,, Are you members of a school organization or club, take or enjoy certain classes or topics?


Be honest, don't just balk at a something that interests you simply because your friends may not approve or share it with you.
If you like a certain subject, hobby, special interest or creative outlet that is atypical of your social circle, embrace it. It makes you unique, even if it isn't shared by your friends.
You may find that you dread a certain class and they do too. Talk about it.

, You'll be shocked how many other interest you share.

,,,


They may feel more comfortable alone with you or without their friends around passing judgment. That's fine. It gives you more one on one time to communicate and get to know each other.
Once you start gaining respect for each other you'll both care less about negative remarks and be more concerned with defending and protecting your new friendship.

,


You may not know each others music very well at the start, but take the time to learn it.
Realize that clothing and style may not show much about others' personalities.
Take the plunge. They may really enjoy knocking ideas and theories around.

, Don't look down on anyone because they are different.

, Put your attention getting personality on the back burner and focus energy on respecting the cultivation of your friendship.

, Why are you hanging out with them?"" Be up front, tell them the person is actually interesting and fun to talk to and hang out with.


If they keep giving you a hard time you should remind them you can keep any friends you'd like and don't need approval.
Chances are they will respect you for being up front and not give you a hard time once you confirm that you're friends.
Never deny being someone's friend to save face with your social circle. Not only is it mean, but it's of very poor character.

, Don't force the issue. Even if you don't become great friends now, being cordial and respectful acquaintances is fine.

, Chances are you won't travel in the same social circle even though you become friends.

,


This happens in friendships. Don't get offended. Just be cool and try to keep the communications open.
Accept when a real friendship may not develop. You may just not be cut out for it with that person. Hopefully, you've met some of their friends and the lines of friendship are open elsewhere.

,


Just because you're from one group doesn't mean you can't date someone from another group. There are many who find the differences and a genuine friendship based on deeper connections more rewarding and successful than dating someone within their immediate circle of friends.
Don't assume they won't like you. Assume they will.

Let go of toxic friendships.",How to Become a Friend," In order to become a friend, you have to find friends in the first place. Get out of your comfort zone by joining a group that shares your values or position in life, sometimes known as a peer group. Studies show that having friends can actually add years to your life, so meeting new people is not just a good idea—it’s essential for your health.If you're a parent, find a mom group in your area. Most communities have more than one type of parent gathering, whether it's a mother's day out or a park stroller group. Most of these groups have Facebook pages you can join.
If you like political activism, most cities have lobbyist groups or volunteer centers you can join. When a group of people works toward a common goal, a bond forms among them.;
, Repeating your attendance at each meeting builds a rapport with other classmates. Having a shared goal also builds strong ties among people in a group.


Find classes that encourage interaction among members. Activities like yoga and Pilates are good for your body but don't allow much socialization. Look instead for opportunities like self defense classes, Zumba, even sewing and cooking classes.

, Even if you’re in the habit of visiting new places, simply introducing yourself to people isn’t enough. You have to ask questions. Show interest in other people, and they will be interested in you in return.


Pay attention to nonverbal cues like smiling and eye contact. When someone invites you with these gestures, you can give a compliment, comment on what's happening, or share some information., Keep a list of easy conversational topics running in your mind. Things like happy childhood memories, the weather, and food are all topics most people can engage in.


When starting a conversation with someone you haven't spoken to in a while, take some time to remember that person before you greet them. If you have a humorous memory or a friend in common, let that be your conversation opener.

, You can make new friends both in person and online, it's true. But it turns out that maintaining face-to-face contact with people is important, and you can't get that by relegating your friendships to your smartphone.When you recognize that conversations with someone are leading toward a friendship, inviting them to an activity outside of where you met provides opportunity for the friendship to truly grow.

, Tactfulness is defined as being “careful not to offend or upset other people.”While you don’t need to be a doormat, you do need to be considerate of the person you’re interacting with.


Be considerate of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or what their opinions might be. Don't make jokes or rude comments at the expense of your friend--or anyone like them.

, Listening is key to being a friend. No one enjoys meeting with someone who doesn't stop talking. In fact, one rule is to listen 75% of the time and speak only the remaining 25%!There are several things that prevent you from being a good listener: judging others; thinking you know what your friend is going to say; and your own emotions.Instead, allow others to be themselves without judgment, believe your friend has something new to say, and set aside your feelings about a topic. This way, you'll be well on your way toward listening well.
If you’re an outspoken person, take time to study your friend to see how much of your opinions they can handle. Then ask them to express their side and listen closely.

, Everyone has flaws, but some things can stand in the way of a meaningful friendship. Try to identify negative traits that you may posses and make a conscious effort to stop them.



Resist bragging about yourself. This behavior is arrogant, and most people find it irritating—you'll lose friends before you get the chance to be one. It is important to have balance in a friendship so that you are celebrating each other's achievements, not competing with each other.

Refuse to gossip. When someone confides in you, don’t share that information with others, even if they don’t specifically ask you to keep a secret. This builds trust, which is essential for maintaining a friendship.Keep your commitments. Canceling plans at the last minute is inconsiderate and it can disrupt your friend's life.Sometimes this might be unavoidable, such as in an emergency situation, but you should give as much notice as possible if you have to cancel.

, Although you shouldn’t be overbearing with your own thoughts and feelings, you shouldn’t be too guarded, either. If you allow someone else to talk your ear off without ever offering your opinions, you're just as unlikely to stay friends as the one talking too much.


You don’t have to tell your friend your deepest, darkest secrets, especially if it’s the beginning of a friendship and you’re establishing trust. But personal anecdotes are what connect people to each other. Sharing you life experience is key for a strong friendship.

, Insincere people tend to smile too much, talk too loudly, and usually laugh to cover their insecurities. To be a good friend, you must do away with insincerity. You can’t keep up a friendship this way because eventually, your friend will see your true self, and it's likely they will feel betrayed.

, This is a basic rule of society, but if you want to have a friend, you must be a friend. Practice doing small favors, giving gifts to show your thoughtfulness, and staying available for your friend’s needs even when it’s inconvenient.

, If you believe in yourself, so will others. And it goes deeper than that—if you like yourself, you will treat yourself well, which translates to treating others well.


Practice becoming aware of your thoughts and beliefs when you encounter situations that make you feel bad. When you identify negative self-talk, challenge it.
Do things like using hopeful statements, forgiving yourself, focusing on the positive, and encouraging yourself., You are much less likely to feel insecure with someone who understands you. You can generally tell when you have a genuine connection with someone. If someone finds you odd, they may criticize you and increase your feelings of insecurity.


Ask yourself questions. Does this person make fun of my quirks? Do their facial expressions seem genuine or fake? Is this someone who will laugh with me or laugh at me?

, If you don't know yourself, no one else will be able to know you either. Start a habit of quiet time each day to explore your thoughts. This practice will also boost your self-esteem. Try doing some writing exercises and think about what your responses reveal about your values. Some writing exercises that may help you include:Reflecting on an amazing experience. Think of a time when you felt really happy. What was the experience? Why did you feel so good? What does the experience reveal about you?
Identifying what upsets you. What things make you really mad? What things annoy you? What are your pet peeves? List everything that upsets you, from major things to minor things and try to identify why these things are upsetting to you.
Think about what you are good at. What do people tend to compliment you on? What do you think you do best?
Figure out what activities or things are important to you. What do you like to do for fun? What things are precious to you?

, Even though sometimes it's uncomfortable to talk to new people, part of overcoming your insecurities is facing your fears. Answer phone calls, text messages, and emails within a day or so no matter how much a person intimidates you; pretty soon new people won't make you nervous anymore.

, If you're used to friends who stress you out, don't return favors, aren't there when you need them, or are overly demanding, then you may have some toxic friends in your life. In order to be a true friend, you've got to show you know what a friend really is, so you may want to consider ending friendships that are one-sided.Keep in mind that just because a friend has some flaws, that does not mean he or she is toxic. Try to weigh you friend's good traits against the bad to determine if the friendship is worth saving.
For example, if you have a friend who annoys you because she is always complaining about her boyfriend, but she listens to you when you need to talk about something, then you may decide that her willingness to listen outweighs her frequent complaints.

Like yourself for who you are.,

Dress nicely.,
Have good shoes.,
Have good hygiene.,
Be social.,
Do not back stab.,
Compliment people.,
Have your own personality.,
Respect people's beliefs and cultures.",How to Be a Cool and Fun Person," Don't complain about yourself, like saying that you are too fat or too stupid or anything like that. It will make others think the same thing.;
, There's no need to go crazy with colours or anything, but a stylish hairstyle is a good touch, like bangs, spikes, etc.

, You don't have to go overboard. If you are a girl, maybe have a couple of bracelets, a nice watch, or a locket. Try styling your hair differently often. For boys, you could have a golden chain, a silver piercing or a single black bracelet, but nothing too girly.

, It might seem unimportant, but shoes really show someone's personality. Converse, Vans, K-Swiss, Adidas, and Nike are all really popular shoes.

, This is the most important. Shower daily and use deodorant. There is no need for you to smell good, just do not smell at all; But a faint hint of perfume would be nice. Wash your face and try to have clear skin, but don't freak out over a few pimples.

, Join extra-curricular activities to meet new people, and hang out with everyone. Don't just stick with a couple of friends. Treat everyone like your friend.

, It will most likely get you into trouble and give you a bad reputation.

, It doesn't have to be extreme, say maybe, ""nice hair"" or, ""I love your shoes!"" or, ""You have a great taste in ___.""

, If you are different, show it. If you like lots of Punk and Metal, for example, instead of the latest pop hits, it doesn't matter! Everyone is different. Respect that.

, Do not bully or make fun of anyone.

Become their friend if you haven't already.,
Put on a good impression.,
Ask to hang out.,
Ask them.,
Explain what your clique is like.,
Accept refusal.,
Welcome her to your crew.,
Treat her fairly.",How to Ask a Girl to Join Your Clique," There's no point in asking someone to join your clique if you've never talked to them before.;
, You want to give a good impression. If you ask someone to join your clique, then they will need to be able to listen and understand you, instead of noticing the fact that you smell horrible and haven't showered since last week.


Wear something that represents you. If you don't have pride in what you're wearing, it will show. Don't always try to follow the trends. If you don't fit in, don't try to.
Style your hair the way you like it best. You can make a nice braid, ponytail or just wear it down. Make sure it is clean and smells fresh.

Smell nice. It's not mandatory, but you might want to spray on some perfume, but make sure it is not too overpowering. Some people can't stand the smell of perfume if it is too strong.

, Before you ask, you will need to loosen up so that the person will be open to your ideas.

, You can also send a note. But asking them in person puts you in a better light, and makes it friendlier. You can be blunt, and just ask them to be in your clique, or just see if they want to hang out, then ask. Be nice, and don't pick on any flaws. The last thing you want is to have the girl you want in your clique to think that you're mean.

, Let them know what the rules are, but don't go overboard, or they won't understand a word you say.


Don't make your clique sound like something it's not. There's no success in having someone join only for them to leave once they learn the clique is not what they thought it was.

, If they refuse, play it cool. Just let them know that it's okay, and that they're welcome to hang out with you anyway. Say something along the lines of: ""That's okay! Just know that you're always welcome to hang out if you want to!"" You should never force someone to join your clique.

, Let your friends get comfortable with a new clique member. After everyone greets her, take your clique to do something fun, such as a swim in the pool, or a picnic at the park. You want to keep her interest level up so that she won't decide to leave. You need to give her a sense of what clique life is like.

, There's no reason to degrade someone because they're new to the group. Also, that will make your newest member feel left out, which is the opposite of what you want. Let her explore the clique for herself.

Wash your neck to if you think having a clean neck will make you charming. Brush your teeth at least twice daily and for at least two minutes.  Make sure to always wear clean clothes and apply deodorant if necessary.;
,  Always wash your face in the morning.  You can either do this by splashing it with cool water and gently patting it damp, or taking a face cloth, soaking it in warm water, and gently wiping your face clean.  Use a facial cleanser if necessary.  Make sure to always apply moisturizing facial lotion after washing your face. Also apply moisturizing body lotion to your body after showering or bathing.

, Get braces if your teeth are crooked.  Even slightly crooked.  Perfectly straight teeth are very appealing and charming according to some.  Brush your teeth two to three times a day, using a whitening toothpaste and optional, a high-quality, electrical toothbrush. Brush for 2-3 minutes. Floss once at night and use mouthwash if necessary, this is essential to being charming.

, Leave your hair medium or long lengthen, or short. Hair lengths have little to no bearing on how charming anyone is. Wash your hair with a shampoo that works well with your hair.  Make sure to massage your scalp when you lather the shampoo in and rinse thoroughly.  Use conditioner on your hair from the bottom of the neck, down.  Using conditioner on your roots will make your hair flat and greasy.  Wash your hair every other day to every 3 days.  Style it different everyday and try out different hairstyles and haircuts.  Make sure to brush your hair in the morning and rid it of all tangles and knots.  Don't use heat on your hair or dye your hair too often.

,  Cut down on all the junk foods you eat and replace them with whole, healthy foods.  Make sure to get your daily dose of protein such as chicken, fish, tofu, nuts, etc. Also stack up on the fruits and vegetables.  Exercise daily for 30 minutes to an hour.  Drink lots of water and get at least 7 hours of sleep a night.

,  Experiment with different clothes and wear appealing, flattering clothes that are comfortable and that fit.  They cannot be too tight nor too baggy.  Slightly loose clothes are fine, though.  Sometimes just wear casual clothes like sweatpants and an oversized t-shirt.  Make sure your clothes are charming.

, Makeup can really help spark up your creativity and make you look even more glamorous than you already are and make your beautiful features pop. A little bit of brown mascara (clump-free), neutral eye shadow, concealer that matches your skin tone, powder, and lip gloss or balm is fine.

Smile.,
Be humble.,
Be kind.,
Be positive.,
Be brave.,
Be a good friend.,
Be confident.",How to Be a Charming Girl2," Smiling is physical, but anyone can smile at anytime.  Smiling will make people around you (including yourself), feel more happy and bright.  Someone who smiles all the time is really attractive.  Smiling will make you seem approachable. Whenever you see someone (even if you don't know them very well or at all), shine a big smile at them, chances are they'll smile back.

, Don't try to show off too much or boast.  Having pride, dignity, and confidence is definitely a must, but don't overdo it and let someone else have the spotlight on them every once in a while.  Try not to be too overly loud or annoying. This may seem attractive to the people who act this way, but it really is not.

, Kindness is a must! Always give compliments to everyone you know, maybe even strangers.Always offer to do favors for people and help others whenever you can. Treat others the way you would like to be treated.  Unfortunately, nowadays many people are rude and ignorant, so don't be like that.

, Always smile, always laugh, and always seem happy.  Of course you don't have to be 24/7, because we are all human and we all cry and frown, but don't let it show.  Try to have a good temper and think of the good side.

, Bravery is also important. Be willing to meet new people and speak for yourself. Don't let anyone tell you you can't do something.  As corny as it sounds, if you believe you can do it, you can.  Don't think, act, is a good motto.

, Whenever a friend needs something, offer to help them achieve it.  Always be there for the people you love.  Friends are people who will help you get through rough times, and that will always support you, forever.

, Be confident in everything you do, sit or stand up straight, take a deep breath, and believe you can do it.  Don't let others push you off your throne. You own yourself, so you can do whatever you want. Always be happy, healthy, and confident, of course, charming.

Use words with deeper meanings. Be careful of your message looking like something sent because it has to be sent.;
, These can be applied to any friend and do not appear personalized.


Instead, target areas where your friend helped you. Messages like 'You always helped me when I was too clumsy and sprained my ankle. I leaned on you for two days until I started walking straight! Thanks a lot (insert name)!' are better.

Create or open a C# program in Visual Studio.,
Right click on your program in Solution Explorer.

,

,Under .NET, select System.Data.Linq

,Click OK

Add the following lines to the top of the source code:

using System.Data.Linq.Mapping;





Note: Visual Studio may have already added the line for System.Linq.

Create a new DataContext class by entering this code, replacing login_string with your actual login string:






class MyDatabase : DataContext
{
        private const String LoginString = ""login_string"";
 
        public MyDatabase() : base(LoginString)
        {
        }
}





,
Add this line to your Main method to create a new instance of the MyDatabase class:







MyDatabase db = new MyDatabase();





The DataContext instance acts as your connection to SQL Server.

,
Add this line your Main method to create a new table in your database:







db.ExecuteCommand(""Create table employees.,
Add the follow line to finalize the changes to the database:






        db.SubmitChanges();





,
Add these lines to your source code:







public class Employee
{
        public int ID;
        public string Name;
        public string Department;
}





This will define a new class, with the Table attribute indicating that the class represents table data, the Name parameter associating a name for that table, the Column attribute indicating column names and types, and the IsPrimaryKey parameter indicating the primary key column.

,
Add this line to the MyDatabase class:






public Table<Employee> Employees;





,
In your Main method, create three new rows of data with new instances of the Employee class and filling in the data, as follows:






Employee employee1 = new Employee();
employee1.ID = 101;
employee1.Name = ""John Smith"";
employee1.Department = ""Sales"";
db.Employees.InsertOnSubmit(employee1);
 
Employee employee2 = new Employee();
employee2.ID = 102;
employee2.Name = ""Ted Black"";
employee2.Department = ""Research"";
db.Employees.InsertOnSubmit(employee2);
 
Employee employee3 = new Employee();
employee3.ID = 103;
employee3.Name = ""Allen Gottlieb"";
employee3.Department = ""Sales"";
db.Employees.InsertOnSubmit(employee3);
 
db.SubmitChanges();





,
Know that querying the database can be done within your source code using a syntax which is similar to SQL.

,
To access the data for everyone in sales, and display their names and ID numbers, use the following lines:






var salesDept = from e in db.Employees
                where e.Department == ""Sales""
                select e;
 
foreach(var employee in salesDept)
        Console.WriteLine(employee.Name + "" "" + employee.ID);





,
Similar queries can be made using similar code.,
Look at the whole thing.",How to Use LINQ to SQL in C Sharp," The example uses the Console Application template.;
,,,,,,,, (ID int, Name varchar(50), Department varchar(50))"");





Other SQL commands may be issued in a similar manner, by passing the command string to ExecuteCommand.

,,,,,,, For instance, to get and display Ted Black's ID number, you could use this code:






var queryResult = from e in db.Employees
                  where e.Name == ""Ted Black""
                  select e;
var tedBlack = queryResult.First();
Console.WriteLine(tedBlack.ID);





, This is the entire program shown above. It connects to SQL server, creates a new table, adds a few new entries to that table, then queries some of the data.

, Some phones that have a speed dial function will also have a Pause key that you can use when programming a speed dial number. The existence and location of this button varies from model to model. If you can add pauses, enter the base number, two pauses, and then the extension number. Save the entire thing to your speed dial entry. If the number you are calling supports entering the extension immediately, you'll be able to use this speed dial entry to call the extension directly.

, If the extension is a four-digit number, you may be able to dial it directly by replacing the last four digits of the base number with it. For example, if the company number is 1-800-555-2222, and the extension is 1234, try dialing 1-800-555-1234.

Decide between a bubble compass or a digital compass.,
Learn about the features of car compasses before choosing a compass.,
Determine your compass lighting needs.,
Check the battery needs of the compass.,
Confirm that the compass has a calibration feature.,
Choose the type of digital display to be used.,
Pick a compass that has a readable display location.,
Find the car compass that meets your needs.",How to Buy a Directional Compass for Your Car," A bubble compass is read as the position of the needle floating in a housing. The housing is filled with fluid to allow the needle to float freely. A digital compass will read the needle for the driver and present the direction on a display.;
,


Ensure that the compass has a means to mount securely to a car windshield or dash.
Evaluate the calibration features of the compass, which will compensate for the magnetic field disturbances caused by a running car.
Make sure that the compass is adjustable in position. The driver of the car should be able to read the compass without grasping it or taking his eyes off the road.
Determine if the compass must be mounted on a level surface. If a bubble compass is chosen rather than a digital compass, it must be adjustable to keep the compass level in the bubble.
Decide if you want the additional feature of a thermometer. Some car compasses come with built in digital thermometers.

, A backlit compass should be chosen for night driving.


Determine how the backlit is activated. This is usually accomplished by pressing a switch on the compass. The backlight may then be turned back off or be allowed to time out. The compass will turn the backlight off automatically after a period of time determined by the compass. This will preserve battery life.

, Most compasses run on AA or AAA batteries. Find out how long the batteries typically last in the compass. Check the manual or installation guide to learn how to change the batteries.

, The compass must be set outside of the car. The compass must then be adjusted after mounting inside the car. This should be done with the car running to account for disturbances in the magnetic field caused by the metal of the car, magnetic noise from the engine and electronic noise from the car accessories. Having the car radio on for this calibration offers the most precise calibration.


Become familiar with the calibration controls of the compass. Check the manual or installation guide of the compass. Be sure that you understand the calibration controls and can effectively control the calibration.

, These can be giving general north (N) and south (S) headings. Displays that give readouts in degrees of the compass also are available.

, Displays can be mounted on the body of the device itself. They also are available in small remote display boxes. Displays can be placed on the rear view mirror of the car.

, Website, automobile accessory catalogs and auto parts stores sell compasses. You can expect to pay around $10 for a basic bubble compass, and more than $40 for a more fully featured digital compass.

It has an antenna which intercepts the radio waves. Portable radio players are handy if you travel a lot or would like to listen to the radio channels on-the-go.Portable radios work on batteries and/ or solar energy.


Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) radio uses a special technology for broadcasting radio stations.;
, Once you've decided on the type of radio you want, go to the store. Radios are available for various prices (starting as low as 10 USD and going as high as 500 USD). The price of a radio depends on its make, brand, model, and accessories provided with it.



Compare prices with two or more stores to find out the best deal for you. Check with e-commerce websites (like Amazon, Flipkart, etc) for better deals on radio players.

, Test if the radio works. Use accessories, like headphones, to improve your experience of listening to a radio.


Some radios come with recording facility. Try recording a song to make sure the function works.
If the radio doesn't work, return it to the shop from where you purchased and inquire for a replacement. Most new radio systems will have a warranty period.

Buy a Xiaomi from a store in China.,
Try Xiaomi's official site at mi.com.,
Use a Chinese auction website.,
Use regional Asian markets.",How to Buy a Xiaomi Phone1," This is the easiest way to purchase a Xiaomi smartphone as all the models are available and the phone is optimized for Chinese use and networks. Also, the first release of new models will be in China, Xiaomi's home market. Visit a official retailer in any major city like China Telecom or China Unicom and see what phones they have for sale. Note that if you want to use your phone while travelling abroad, you should buy the China Telecom or China Unicom model. They use international phone standards (CDMA2000, WCDMA/UMTS). China uses a domestic TD-SCDMA, which cannot be used anywhere else.;
, The site is both in English and Chinese, so whatever your language background you can peruse their offerings. At the site you will be able to see all available models and their specifications.

, Since Xiaomi is still a relatively small company, their supplies can go quickly when a new model hits the market. If the official site is low on supply, you can try Taobao, a Chinese version of eBay. Tabao has a lot of good deals on older models and you can bid on the device you want.


As with any auction site, you should be cautious with your purchase to make sure you're not getting a fake. Only buy from reputable sellers with good ratings and avoid any deal that seems too good to be true.
Try Yixun. This is an online electronics seller accessible in China. It is a more official than Taobao, but also more expensive. , Although Xiaomi is not yet available officially in non-Asian countries, if you are outside China in Asia, Xiaomi has regional offerings to buy Xiaomi online. If you live in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or the Philippines, you can get a phone from Xiaomi's regional site. The location switcher is in the bottom right of the company's homepage.

"

Contact your service provider.,
Use a third party importer.,
Use an auction site.",How to Buy a Xiaomi Phone2," In early 2016, Xiaomi released a statement saying they would soon be importing their phones to Western countries. You can contact your service provider to see if they intend on distributing Xiaomi in the near future.This is the safest way to purchase a phone because it will be made compatible with the provider selling the phone.Keep in mind, if you buy a Xiaomi phone designed for the China market it will not be optimal for the U.S. users. It will not be able to use high speed LTE networks not available to China. Also, it may have difficulty accessing apps that use sites not used or restricted in China.
Make sure that you are getting a China Telecom/Unicom handset. These will be compatible with international 3G standards. Check to see if your area has CDMA2000/UMTS(WCDMA) coverage.

, If you live outside of Asia, you cannot directly order any Xiaomi products from their website. However, there are retailers like Newegg and DHGate that specialize in allowing foreign goods to penetrate the U.S. market. You will have to pay a small shipping fee that usually ranges from $20-25 USD. , A good way to get a Xiaomi phone is through individual resales on auction sites. This can be risky and you should choose a reputable auction site like eBay that offers buyer protection.


Make sure the phone comes unlocked and is able to be used on a network outside China.

It comes with a choice of 16/32 GB storage and a 13 MP camera. This phone is also small and sleek with a 5 inch screen.The Mi 4i is an even cheaper model that ditched an aluminum body for plastic. It comes equipped with a Snapdragon 615 CPU processor and a 13 MP camera. While the price comes down with this model, it still offers a high performing phone. The Redmi 3 is also an option and the cheapest of the Xiaomi line. , The Mi Note is the most high end, fully equipped phone Xiaomi offers. It has a processor on par with any 2015 smartphone. These may cost a little more but come with the fastest processors, more memory capabilities and a larger screen if you use a lot of media on your smartphone.

Mobile entertainment systems vary in availability and complexity and can cost anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand USD.;
, What sort of features do you need? What sort of features do you want? You must answer these 2 questions. The 2 questions are similar but very different. Needs are absolutely necessary whereas wants are desirable but expendable.

, If your budget is small, you would probably be better off buying components 1 at a time. If your budget is large, you should be able to purchase an entire system at once.

, Component systems connect directly into your car's audio system and they provide screens that can be installed throughout the car. Most high-end car stereo retailers have these systems in availability.

, No matter what sort of mobile entertainment system you purchase, be sure to check that it can be expanded in the future. You never know when your budget will expand and allow for additions to be made down the road.

, The double-antenna, also known as a diversity antenna, receives better reception when the car is in motion.

, Mobile entertainment systems require a noticeable amount of electrical power, and if your car can't handle it then it will not work correctly. If necessary, you should contact a professional to assess the situation.

, This will help you to make the best decision.

Collect the data that is needed to be changed.,
Alright that's neat, but kind of hard to read if you have a lot of 777 permissions in this directory.,
Now that we have our data, we can start with some basic scripting.

,
Verify your data


for each in `cat badpermlist`     press -enter-
do                                         press -enter-
ll -d $each                              press -enter-
done | more                            press -enter
This will show your data that is in the file.,
Change the data


for each in `cat badpermlist`     press -enter-
do                                         press -enter-
chmod 755 $each                   press -enter-
done                                     press -enter-
Congratulations, you just changed all those pesky 777 permissions to 755 like they should be.

,
Verify that the change took place because it is never a bad idea to check your work.,
Now as you can tell, there is a lot of potential to a very simple script like this.",How to Create a Bash Script for Mass Changes,"


Here we will use the ""find"" command to look for 777 directories under user ""whomever.""
find /home/whomever/public_html -type d -perm 777
This finds any directories (-type d) in directory /home/whomever/public_html that are 777 permissions (-perm 777).
You can change this to work with whatever directories you want, permissions you want, etc.;
, Let's make them all go into a file.


Start with the same command, but we'll add something to make it go into a file we create.
find /home/whomever/public_html -type d -perm 777 > badpermlist
What this does is take our query and creates a file called ""badpermlist"" where all the data will be put.

,,
IMPORTANT: the ` ` marks are the ones that are under the ~ key, NOT the apostrophe key.

,,


for each in `cat badpermlist`     press -enter-
do                                         press -enter-
ll -d $each                              press -enter-
done | more                            press -enter-
Now all the data that showed up as 777 should now show as 755.

, I hope this helps breakdown some basic concepts for you and helps you on your scripting way!

There are many options here, but you probably only care about ""XkbLayout"" and the Driver.
""Option ""XkbLayout"" "" controls the layout of your keyboard. You can specify a code to tell the computer what key you press means what.
The driver should probably be left alone as kbd driver is able to operate virtually all keyboards, just as the mouse driver can run almost any mouse.

Download the latest version of the Linux kernel from http://www.kernel.org.,
Be sure to download the full source by clicking on the ""F"" where it says ""The latest stable version is..."" otherwise you'll just download the patch, which is used when your current kernel is a patch number lower.,
Make sure you have downloaded the complete source code, and not a patch or change log.

,
Once downloaded, open a terminal.

,
Now we need to extract the kernel.,
Once extracted, move into the directory (in the terminal) that was created.

,
Configure the kernel.,
Once the configuration window is opened, you will see that a specific type of configuration is already selected like support for essential drivers like Broadcom wireless support/EXT4 filesystem etc.,
NOTE: While configuring the kernel, you will see a section known as kernel hacking(by hacking we mean exploring into it), where different types of options are given for hacking into kernel and learning it.,
Once configured, it is time to compile and install the kernel.,
So the kernel is installed, but you need to make it bootable.

,
Go to boot.

,
Run this command ""mkinitrd -o initrd.img-<kernelversion> <kernelversion>"" (For Redhat based distros, you need not create initrd, as it is created by default) remembering to replace <kernelverison> with the version number of the kernel you build.

,
Point the boot loader at the new kernel so it can be started.,
Reboot and enjoy your customized kernel!

",How to Compile the Linux Kernel,";
, An example of this would be 3.4.4.1>>3.4.4.2

,,, Use these commands.


tar xjvf kernel (Here -j option is for bz2 compression)

,, There are 4 common ways to do this.


Make old configuration -- asks you questions on what the kernel should support one by one, very time consuming.
Make menuconfig -- creates a menu where you can browse options on what the kernel supports. Requires curses library, but that is likely already on your computer.
Make qconfig/xconfig/gconfig -- same as menuconfig, except that now the configuration menu is graphics based.""qconfig"" Requires the QT library.
Use configuration of current kernel. Run this from your kernel source folder ""cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config"". This saves a lot of time, but you may want to change version number of the to be compiled kernel to avoid replacing your current kernel. ""General setup"" --> ""Local version - append to kernel release"". Example if the kernel version number is 3.13.0, you can example write there 3.13.0.RC1.

, Further, you may customize the options like adding support for your specific type of device/controller/driver like you may add support for NTFS file system from ""Filesystem >> DOS/FAT/NT/ >> select NTFS file system support, thereby taking full advantage of custom kernel.

, If you want to use it then you may add further options, otherwise you may disable the option ""kernel debugging"", as it makes the kernel a lot heavier and and may be improper to use in the production environment.

, You can run needed commands in one line by separating them with double ampersands (&&) as written below. This may take a long time.


make && make modules_install && make install
You may want to use -j option with make. This allows to fork additional processes for compiling kernel, syntax would be ""make -j 3"". 3 here represents the number of processes to be created.

,,,, Use the tool that came with your distro to configure your bootloader. Add a new entry for the new kernel.

Show friendliness.,
Be kind and helpful towards other people.,
Show genuine interest in others.,
Focus on good points in other people.,
Communicate in a confident and caring manner.,
Accept that sometimes people say and do things that aren't likable.,
Be a nice person with whom others want to spend their time.",How to Become a Magnet for Friends," To make and keep friends, you must show yourself as friendship material. This can be done by displaying an opening and welcoming demeanor, being respectful of others and showing an interest in their interests and what they have to say.


Smile. The smile is a form of instant connection with the other person. It says that you're caring, open and friendly. It lets the other person realize that you're completely approachable and likable. In a nutshell, it says: ""friendly person"".;
, By being kind to the people you meet and to your friends, you'll gain a reputation for caring about people and this is attractive. If your friends know that they can rely on you to care about them when going through a tough time, they'll know that you're a true friend.


Be generous with compliments and supportive statements. Tell your friends what is wonderful about them and why you love being friends with them.
Help people to feel comfortable in your presence. Don't have expectations of people to act differently or be different when around you; if they can be themselves when with you, they'll be happy, comfortable and trusting of you.

, Try to find out what the other person likes and is interested in. This always makes for an interesting discussion and it helps the other person feel heard. Being genuinely interested in people is a skill that is highly valued.


Ask people about their likes and interests. Ask questions that elicit more than ""I love soccer"" or ""I collect Furby toys."" Keep probing to find out exactly what it is the other person loves about those things.
Be a good listener. Listen without interrupting, affirm that you are hearing what is being said and summarize the key points when the person has finished. Don't be too quick to insert your own information; ensure that the person has spoken their piece properly first.

, It is very easy to point out the negative aspects of another person yet what that achieves is instant prickling, as the other person realizes you're judging them and finding them wanting. It's a feeling nobody likes having, and it can immediately set you aside as non-friend material. The solution is simple––don't say negative things. Instead, focus on the good, the lovely and the likability that you can perceive in the other person. Friends come from the people in whom you see the good; more friends come from seeing greater good wherever you go. By always searching for the good things in others, it helps you to think about them in a different way; in turn, you'll get a positive response from them.


Realize that nobody is perfect, yourself included. To expect perfection is to set such a high standard that relatively few people will meet it, and even then, will be likely to disappoint you.
Have positive and respectful thoughts and feelings towards the other. When you find your mind wandering into criticizing their manner of speech, their clothing, their ideas, and so forth, remind yourself to find the good things and focus on those instead. Make it an instant habit by practicing this often. Also remember that the more you focus on praising and recognizing the things you want, the more you get of that and the less of what you don't!
By being positive and upbeat, you will attract the happy people to you.

, Make an eye contact while communicating with other people, nod or show that you're listening to them and ask for clarification if you don't understand something. Moreover, if you find that the other person is shy, reticent to speak, or at a loss for words, find ways to facilitate their involvement in the conversation. This can include asking questions, making it clear that you won't judge them and smiling often to encourage them. It can also help to occasionally show that you empathize with something they're feeling, showing that you've had the same or a similar experience.


When asking questions, use questions that can only be responded to properly with detail; yes or no answers just cut conversation dead.

, These bad moments can cause you to want to push the person away and not befriend them. However, realize that every person, including yourself, has bad days, bad moments and faux pas instances. Be forgiving and understanding; most mess-ups can be corrected in terms of communicating and making friends provided you're willing to move past initial feelings of dislike, outrage or disappointment. Focus on the present. Think about how you can forward from a bad moment, rather than staying in it by replaying it often. It happened, resolve it, then find positive ways to move forward. In this way, you can maintain friendships that are strong and also prove a safe and accepting learning environment.


If someone says something harmful about you or to you, try to work out what may have motivated this. There are many cogs whirring inside people that cannot be viewed externally and often the bad words and feelings are sourced from internal insecurities, weaknesses and fears. Maybe you are in a position to reassure this person that they're okay and don't need to be making gossip, rumor or mean comments just to feel they can cope. Give them the trust that perhaps many others have failed to, and make it clear that they're already forgiven for their thoughtless comments.

, Be loving and happy person, so that others can attract and like to hang out with you. People who have the same interest like you, become your friends soon. If you want to attract a person who is fun loving and energetic, you need to develop the same qualities.

Dress the part.,
Play a sport.,
Succeed in school.,
Learn about the trends that older kids are into.",How to Become Friends With Popular People Who Are Older Than You1," Popular kids are usually well dressed,so your chances of befriending popular kids will increase if you look cool yourself. Spend some time online, with magazines, and making observations in day-to-day life to see what the popular kids are wearing, and try your best to dress similarly.


Keep in mind that trendy clothes or devices alone will not win you friends or bring you long-term happiness.Pick cool styles that express who you are rather than trying to wear all the latest high-priced fashions to look just like someone else.
If you don't have money for a whole new wardrobe, don't worry. At vintage stores and thrift stores, you can often find cool clothes at a fraction of the price of buying them new. This can also help you develop a style of your own that is unique, but still hip and appealing.;
, It's a cliche, but it's true: a lot of popular people are athletes.If you are at all athletic, consider trying out for a sport you like. This will help you fit in better with the popular kids, both your age and older.

, Research shows that there are two kinds of popular kids--those that are friendly and do well in school, and those that are mean and do poorly. The research also shows that the ""bad"" popular kids don't stay popular as they get older (i.e. in high school).If you want to hang out with older, popular kids who actually STAY popular, you want to fit in with the successful ones. So, try your best in school so you can fit in with the people who will have lasting popularity.

, Spend some time learning what the older, popular kids are into, outside of fashion. Pick up some magazines and look online to find out what the hottest trends are. For example:What music are they listening to?
What TV shows or movies are they watching?
What apps or social media sites are new and popular?

"
"
Be friendly.,
Learn to ""read minds."",
Be entertaining.,
Act confident.",How to Become Friends With Popular People Who Are Older Than You2," As mentioned before, there are two kinds of popular kids. Some are nice to everyone and good at getting along with others, and some are aggressive and more likely to get in trouble.Researchers call the nice popular kids ""prosocial"" and the and aggressive ones ""antisocial."" The antisocial kids tend to become unpopular as time goes by because they alienate other people.
Having a friendly, outgoing personality can help you make friends with all kinds of people, and achieve lasting popularity.

, Something else that research shows is that popular kids have a way of ""reading minds."" They can't literally read other people's thoughts, but they are sensitive to other people's desires and needs.Pay close attention to how other people react to different social situations, and try to understand there perspectives. Being able to understand and relate to others can make you more likeable.
For example, if you are hanging out with a couple friends playing a game, take note of whether everyone looks like they're having fun. If one person looks bored or unhappy, you might want to suggest a different activity that you think everyone will enjoy.

, When asked what makes popular kids different, many people say that they are ""not boring."" So, to be more like the older, popular kids you want to befriend, work on being entertaining in social situations.Don't make a fool of yourself, but try to be funny. Learn some jokes.Make an effort to have a good time in social situations, and try to help others have fun, too. Introduce people to new activities, and encourage others to cut loose and enjoy themselves.
Think about other ways you can make yourself stand out socially. Maybe you could learn a magic trick or two, or develop some other skill that will be entertaining to others.

, People are more attracted to other people who appear confident. It will be easier to make friends with anyone if you behave more confidently. It is probably necessary to do so in order to to befriend older, more popular kids. Here are some simple things you can do:Stand up straight--slouching makes you look unsure of yourself.
Smile and make eye contact when you talk to others.
Try not to over analyze social situations. If you want to meet someone, just introduce yourself, don't give yourself time be nervous over ""what ifs.""

"
"
Introduce yourself.,
Treat people like they're already your friends.,
Show up and help out.,
Don't be overeager.",How to Become Friends With Popular People Who Are Older Than You3," Once you've worked on your appearance and social skills, it's time to actually try to make friends. The first step is just to introduce yourself to some of the older kids you'd like to be friends with.Just walk up and say ""hi"" and tell them your name. Don't forget to smile and maintain eye contact.
Keep it brief. Don't try to have a long conversation the first time you meet them.Ask people you meet a question about themselves to get them talking, rather than talking about yourself. For example, you could say: ""Are you guys going to the game on Friday?"" or ""Have you heard the new song by Unreliable Narrator?"" Keep it casual, and don't ask questions that have obvious answers you already know.

, A good way to win the friendship of anyone is to act like they're your friends already. Once you've introduced yourself and know people's names, make sure to say hello to them in the hall from then on, greeting them by name.Give people compliments that you'd be happy to receive yourself. If someone has a particularly cool outfit on that day, tell them you like it. Don't do this all the time or be overly fawning--remember, you want act like they are your friends, not your idols.When they talk to you, listen with sincerity. Learn about things they like and dislike, and talk to them about those things as if you were friends already.

, If things go well, eventually you'll probably be invited to some event by your new would-be friends. Maybe it's a party, a sporting event, or just to hang out downtown. Whenever you are invited, do your best to show up.You can't make friends with people you don't spend time with. Spend as much time as possible with the people you are trying to befriend, without inserting yourself into situations you haven't been invited to.
When you are invited to gatherings, look for opportunities to be helpful. Were you invited to a party? Ask if there's something you can bring. Stay around afterward and help clean up if you can. Helpful people are often popular people

, At the same time, you don't want to appear overeager. This can be off-putting to some people. So, when you get a chance to spend some time with the older kids you are trying to befriend, play it cool.When you are invited to something, say ""thanks for the invite,"" but don't gush on and on about how grateful you are and how cool it is that they invited you.
Don't show up late to things, but don't necessarily always be the first one there either.
If you want to invite them to something, feel free, but don't constantly ask them to join you for lunch, invite them over to your house, or send them texts or social networking messages. Don't learn their routines and follow them around.
If someone gives you a clear signal that they don't want to be your friend, let it go, don't keep trying. If that person has a change of heart, he or she will come to you.

, This is especially true of those who are related to you, or are your friends or significant other.

, In fact, don't touch them at all if they don't like it. Of course if they are a good friend of yours and they don't mind, then by all means have fun. Otherwise, keep your hands to yourself.

, Try to control your emotions and not be too pushy. Give people the space they need. Don't call every single day.

, Even if their things are not private, they may still feel violated if you touch things that are in their personal space. If you wish to borrow something, ask for permission first and allow the person to give the item to you.

, Avoid butting into a conversation by (for example) saying, ""What are you talking about?"" If you hear someone talking about something with another person, and you only catch the last sentence, leave it alone.

, Just because you're confident doesn't mean you have to act like you're better than anyone else. Don't do or say things that might let you appear to be arrogant, like bragging about your wealth or success. There are some people who need to prove that they, and only they, had the ultimate experience. This is known as “One-upping” your friends. This is so universally hated that people actually will laugh at you if they see you doing this consistently. Bragging does not make your friends think you are any greater, it makes you look pathetic, it makes friends sick of you and it is human nature to avoid braggarts.

,,, Remember the world does not revolve around you. If you complain too much, others will avoid you. This also goes for constantly insulting yourself, which is not humble - it's another form of self-absorption. It's normal to feel bad once in a while, and to express your discontent. But, you also need to know when to get over it and move on. Read up on how to be optimistic.

, Also, do not loudly sing or play music which others are likely to find irritating. Consider how your actions are likely to affect the people around you, and you will gain their respect.

, Don't peek down people's shirts for instance, don’t talk about biological functions in public. Cover your nose and mouth with your elbow when you sneeze or cough. Take care to brush and/or floss after meals so as not to inflict your breath on others. Take a shower everyday and put on clean clothes every day.

, When someone's having a bad day, don't try to hang around them to make them feel better (unless of course they ask). If you were having a bad day, you wouldn't want someone bugging you with failing attempts at pick-me-ups. Ask if they would like your reassurance, but remember that ""no"" means ""no"". Only talk about what is bugging them if they bring it up.

, Constantly repeating the same action over and over again (such as making inappropriate sounds or pulling someone's hair, tapping your pencil on the table, chewing ice with your mouth open, tapping your foot against something, etc.), isn't the right way of 'getting attention'. If a person says 'stop', that means 'stop'. If you continue without stopping, you might lose a friend.

, If you are older than 3 years old copying is not funny. When I say “copy” I mean this kind of copy: “Why are you copying me?” “Why are you copying me?”

, These are pointless, and will always annoy and irritate your friends.

, Most people dislike arguing. Simply state that you disagree and refrain from setting yourself up as an expert on the subject. A ""know-it-all"" stance gets on peoples' nerves. Of course, you can have intelligent debates/discussions with a person/people provided the circumstances are appropriate and the other person is willing to engage. Never force someone into a debate. If someone tells you that they would rather not discuss a topic, drop it.

, It’s interesting as long as everybody contributes freely and openly to subjects/topics of mutual interest. The moment any one person wants to control/hijack the flow, the others are put off. If you're talking constantly, others will get frustrated and quit trying to communicate with you. As a general rule, always listen more than you speak. Think about what you say before you say it. Avoid interrupting someone in the middle of a thought, even if it just jogged your memory of something to say. Remember the famous quotation, ""It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt"". Listen actively. Understand others’ viewpoints. It would give you new ideas to think about, and certainly make you a better conversationalist.

, Speaking too quietly can annoy your friends, they will need to keep asking you “What did you say?” if you speak to quickly and don’t enunciate your words, they will just make it a habit of nodding and smiling when they talk to you, because they are tired of saying “Sorry I didn’t hear you, say that again.”

, Most times this isn’t something that gets on peoples nerves, but if it happens multiple times in a single conversation, it’ll irritate the second friend to the point of him wanting never to talk to you.

,,, This is extremely important. However, if you scoff at everything and act too cool for anything or anybody, you will be known as someone who doesn’t know how to have fun, and you will be remembered as a dull person. There is a natural balance between the two extremes.

, Be understanding.

, Apologize when you upset someone. You messed up, just accept it and be humble enough to apologize. This helps people trust you more.

,, If they have their license they know how to drive, if not, why are you in the car with them driving?

, If you offer someone a food that contains peanuts and they refuse there is no need to say “Oh yeah, that’s right, you are allergic to peanuts.” Or if someone is afraid of heights and you keep asking” Why can’t you just go on the roller coaster?” they will become seriously annoyed.

, Input is fine and natural, but interrupting specifically for the sake of correcting someone for something they did wrong is by far the lamest way to listen to a story.

, However, this is taken too far by some people. Relentless insulting and name calling isn’t a way to bond with a person.

, It is very unattractive and annoying to hang out with someone who ignores principles and ethical standards. Be conscientious of the beliefs others have.

, (b) Act overly sensitive and constantly annoy your friends by making a huge deal out of something that didn’t really matter and getting hurt by things that are very minuscule. The solutions to both of these problems are: (a) Stop acting like a jerk. (b) Stop reading into things so much, the world doesn’t revolve around you.

, Even if your words are thoughtful and important, your tone of voice may indicate frustration, crankiness, or a condescending attitude, or flippancy or arrogance or any number of things which give folks the wrong impression and causes them to hate your guts. Learn to read facial reactions and body movements. Pay attention to the facial expressions and body language of those around you and work to immediately identify and stop whatever you're doing that is annoying others.

Treat your Jewish friend like any other friend.,
Cherish your similarities.,
Contact an interfaith council.,
Talk about things other than religion.",How to Be Friends With a Jew if You Are a Muslim1," Most likely, you have friends from other religions. Even your Muslim friends will most likely have different religious opinions on different matters. Treat all of your friends as individuals with different beliefs, opinions, and practices. Some good friend qualities include:Being honest and trustworthy.

Being a good listener.
Not judging your friend.
Being loyal and dependable.

Showing empathy for your friend.
Supporting your friend in good times and bad times.;
, While there are different schools of thought regarding the relationship between Islam and Judaism, many scholars agree that there are considerable similarities between the faiths. Instead of focusing on your differences, think about what you both have in common. Look for core beliefs that you both share, and consider the values, morals, and ethics that you and your friend both have.How do you both feel about helping others? Do you have similar philosophies about generosity, hard work, or respect?
Are you both spiritual people? Is prayer important to both of you?
What non-religious characteristics do you have in common? Do you like the same books or shows? Do you share hobbies? Do you have a similar sense of humor?

, If you are curious about ways you can reach out respectfully to your Jewish friend, you might want to contact an organization that specializes in interfaith relations. There are many that focus specifically on the relationship between Muslims and Jews. These include:


Judaism and Islam in America (co-operative dialogue held by the Islamic Society of North America and Jewish Theological Seminary)Joseph Interfaith FoundationJudaism-Islam.comImams and Rabbis Council of the United KingdomThree Faiths Forum, Friends discuss sports, movies, music, social events, their feelings, and many other things. If every conversation you have with your friends slips into a debate about religion, you might want to change the subject. Instead, think about other things you both enjoy. For example:


What interests and hobbies do you have in common?
Can you talk about work or school?
Have you seen any movies or TV shows recently that you want to discuss?
What is the latest news in your social group?

Ask respectful questions about their religion.,
Discuss what you believe without making generalizations.,
Celebrate holidays.,
Deflect criticism on your faith.,
Resolve conflicts with your friend.",How to Be Friends With a Jew if You Are a Muslim2," If you are curious or confused about an aspect of Judaism, you can ask your friend about it. Make sure to state your questions in a respectful way. Let them know that are you are not criticizing their religion but that you are genuinely curious about their beliefs. Some questions you might ask:


""How do you celebrate Hanukkah?""
""Do you know Hebrew?""
""Are you allowed to marry someone that's not Jewish?""

, If religion does come up, remain civil. Instead of talking about what you think Judaism means, state instead what Islam means to you. This will make it seem as though you are not attacking your friend's religion; rather, you are simply stating your own beliefs.


For example, instead of saying that Jewish people are immodest, you can say instead, “In my religion, we believe that modesty is important.” You might find that your Jewish friend actually has the same belief.

, If your friend is celebrating a Jewish holiday, you might want to send them good wishes. Although you may not believe in their traditions, you can express your goodwill towards them.


If it is Hanukah, you might say “Happy Hanukah” or “Hanukkah Sameach!”At a bat or bar mitzvah, you might tell them “congratulations” or “mazel tov.”
If your friend tells you it is Passover, you can say “Happy Passover!”, Your friend might have assumptions about your religion or your practices. If they say something that offends you, correct the assumption gently. Remind your friend that it is not ok for them to make assumptions about your religion.


For example, if your Jewish friend makes a comment about Muslims and violence, you can say, “People of all faiths do bad things. You shouldn’t judge a whole religion based on a few people.”If your friend persists, you should sit them down and talk to them. Let them know that you enjoy their friendship but that their comments on your religion are unacceptable. You can say, “I know everyone is entitled to their opinions, but if you don’t respect my religion, I feel as though you don’t respect me. I think we should avoid this topic in the future.”

, Fighting with your friend can be upsetting and you will probably want to resolve these conflicts as soon as possible. If a conflict arises with your friend, try to stay calm, practice active listening, empathize with your friend, and look for a solution to the problem.


For example, if your friend gets upset because of something you said, then you might start by taking a few deep breaths to calm yourself down.Then, ask your friend to tell you more about what is the matter and listen closely to what your friend has to say. Remove all distractions, such as by putting away your phone, and look at your friend while they are talking. If anything your friend says is unclear, then ask your friend to clarify what they mean.
Try to imagine how your friend might be feeling. How might you feel in the same situation? What might help you to feel better?
After you have listened to your friend and considered their feelings, try to look for a solution. This might be as simple as apologizing and promising not to repeat the behavior. For example, you might say, “I’m sorry. I can see how upsetting that must have been for you. I will do my best to avoid upsetting you like this again.”

"
"
Discuss each other's spiritual needs.,
Stay away from assumptions.,
Avoid trying to convert your friend.,
Handle politics carefully.,
Stop feeling guilty.",How to Be Friends With a Jew if You Are a Muslim3," Both Judaism and Islam have certain requirements and restrictions. Ask your friend how you can accommodate their religious needs, and let them know what you can and cannot do. This will foster a healthy friendship where both of you understand each other’s needs.


For example, you could say to your friend, “I would love to meet up with you next week, but I can’t eat lunch because it’s Ramadan. I’m fasting until sunset.” Perhaps they will suggest a non-food related activity.
You can explain to your friend that you cannot eat foods that are haram. In return, do not try to feed your friend foods that are not kosher., Just as there are many branches of Islam, there are also many different types of Judaism. While your friend’s religion likely plays a big part in their life, you should not make assumptions or generalizations about their religious beliefs, political affiliation, or personal morals. Instead of assuming, ask them about their personal beliefs.


For example, do not assume that your friend has a particular belief regarding the status of Israel. If you want to discuss it, you can ask, ""What are your opinions on Israel? I'm not judging, but I do want to know what you think."" If they have a different opinion than you, you can say, ""That's interesting. That's not exactly what I believe. Would you be willing to discuss this sometime?"" If they say no, it just means that it's a personal issue, and they do not want to cause a rift.

, You might feel as though it is your duty to convert your friend to Islam, but this may cause you to lose a friend.Remember that they may believe as strongly in their religion as you do in yours. Instead of trying to convert them, have an open dialogue with them. Talk about your religion if they ask you. Instead of pressuring them to convert, simply talk about your beliefs and your practices. If they are attracted to Islam, they will ask you for more information.


You can invite your friend to attend your mosque with you. If they are uninterested, do not press the issue. This gives them an opening to learn about your faith, but it does not pressure them. You can say, ""If you want, you can come with me to my mosque sometime. There's no pressure, of course, but if you ever want to learn about my religion, the option is open.""

, In some parts of the world, religion and politics are tightly entwined. Certain subjects may be touchy for you and your friend. While you might mean well by bringing up political subjects, your friend might think that you are lecturing or criticizing them. This will make them defensive. You might want to avoid politics altogether. If the subject arises, you can help lessen the tension.


Let your friend know that your political beliefs do not change how you feel about them. You can say, ""I know this might a touchy subject, and I don't think that the Jewish people are responsible for this. I just think that some individuals did something wrong.""
If the subject of violence or terrorism comes up, you might want to state something like, ""People of all faiths and nationalities do bad things. It's just unfortunate that everyone else is blamed for it.""

, You might feel as though your religion prevents you from being friends with people of other faiths, but many Muslim scholars believe that the Quran allows you to be friends. In fact, you are encouraged to be kind and generous to people of all faiths.If you are confused or worried about your friendship, you can ask your imam for advice.

"
"
Stand up to naysayers.,
Remind your family that friendship is not forbidden.,
Demonstrate the benefits of interfaith dialogue.",How to Be Friends With a Jew if You Are a Muslim4," You might know other Muslims who do not like that you hang out with a Jewish person. These may be your friends, acquaintances, or family members. If they try to persuade you to ditch your friend, stand up for yourself. Let them know that you believe in being kind and generous to people of all faiths.


You can say, ""Islam is the religion of peace, and that means extending love and peace to all people.""
If they persist, you can say, ""My friendship with a Jewish person is not your concern. I will continue to do what I believe is right.""

, You might have parents, siblings, or other family members who disapprove of your friendship. Perhaps this disapproval is based on political beliefs. Some might believe that such a friendship is forbidden. Explain to your family that the Quran does not forbid friendships with people of other faiths.


If your family's disapproval comes from their disdain for Israeli politics, you can say, ""My friend is not responsible for the political situation. They are a good person, and that is all that is important.""
If your family is biased against the Jewish faith, you might say, ""Jews are people of the book too. They follow an Abrahamic faith. We might have our disagreements, but I do not think that it means I should shun them.""While some use certain verses in the Quran as proof that you should not be friends with other faiths, you might want to point out that those verses were written when there were many wars between the religions. Many scholars believe that the verses have no relevance today., Through your friendship, you can be living proof of how interfaith relations can help promote peace. If others doubt you, let them know how you are helping heal tensions between the religions. Encourage others to do the same as you.


You can remind people that both Judaism and Islam believe in cooperation to improve the welfare of humanity.You can say, ""By being friends with all people, I am acting on the principles of peace in Islam. Actions speak louder than words.""

Ask in a casual way.,
Use a specific common interest as a reason to hang out.,
Be confident that they will say yes.",How to Ask Someone to Hang Out1," If you have been planning to ask them for a while, don’t come on too strong. Keep yourself calm so that when you ask them to hang out it doesn’t come across as desperate. Take a breath and use your regular conversational tone.You’ll sound too eager if you say, “You are so cool and I really want to spend more time with you.”
Be casual when you ask a classmate by saying, “Man everytime we talk, this guy is droning on in the background. We should chill outside of class sometime.”
If you had fun with someone at a party, say, “It’s been a great meeting, do you want to catch up later on sometime?”;
, You may have a hard time asking someone to hang out without a specific reason. If you’re asking someone you know you have a common interest with, use that to your advantage. Tell them it would be fun to do the activity together sometime.If you always talk to a coworker about the Walking Dead, ask them if they want to come over and watch it with you. You know you’re both free when it’s on, and the hangout has a set time frame so they can split when it’s over.
You might meet someone that works out at your gym. Since you are probably there around the same time, ask them if they’d want to work out together. Say, “We could both have a spotter and push each other to work harder.”
Say to someone, “I’ve noticed we always seem to be painting in this studio at the same time, would you want to meet up and actually paint together sometime?”

, It’s no good to ask someone to hang out if you tell yourself they won’t want to. Get in the mindset that you are fun to hang out with and that the person you ask will say yes. If you are confident in yourself and make a direct ask, the person will be more open than if you seem timid when you ask.Don’t say, “You’re probably busy most of the time and have a lot of other friends already, but we could hang out sometime if you want to it. It’s okay if you would rather not.”
For an example, think about a co-worker you’d like to hang out with. Catch them in the break room and say, “We should find something cool to do outside of this place sometime.” It’s simple, shows your interest, and leaves things open to developing.
If you’re in a weekly club with someone, say, “You know, we meet up here every week. Let’s grab some food after the meeting sometime.” Again, it’s direct and shows that you are assuming they would be interested.

Choose a preferred medium for communication and use it.,
Schedule one-on-one activities.,
Schedule multi-group activities.,
Call your friends on the phone or video chat.,
Send an email or a physical letter.,
Text your friends.,
Connect with friends who live in other cities when you travel.",How to Stay Updated With Your Friends if You Don't Use Facebook1," Some friends may clearly express how they like to communicate, while others may not. Some people enjoy emailing whereas others prefer more personal communication. Ask your friends about the best way to stay in touch and use that mode as your basis for ongoing communication.Reach out to your friends on a regular basis. Everyone gets busy, which may be why Facebook has taken off like wildfire. However, you can still remain connected––it just takes a little more effort. Carve out time to discuss the important things that are going on in your lives.;
, Book a slot with one friend at a time, especially if you’d like to discuss personal matters. Visit an art museum, meet at a cafe, or go to a movie. Find an activity that allows you to have time to communicate. If you go to a movie, have lunch or dinner so you have time to talk.You may see your friend regularly (at school or at work). If so, remember that one-on-one interactions allow you to get up to date on things you may have missed. Quality time together can be more personal and rewarding than time on Facebook!
If you don’t see your friend regularly, remind them that you care about your friendship, and that you would like to catch up in person.

, Have a party or go to an event with a group of friends. Ponder the group dynamics and how everyone will interact before assembling your groups. Some folks like to keep work friends and college friends separate, whereas others find that people from different worlds can mesh. Remember that many people use Facebook to schedule events. You may want to extend an invitation and later send out a written reminder to those you invite to your event.

, A call with a friend can bring you up-to-date pretty quickly. Be courteous and find out the best contact times in advance.Sometimes the only way you can ensure that you two connect is to schedule a date. Whether it’s scheduling a video call or a phone call, make sure you put forth the effort.

, If you live far from your friend, written communication can be satisfying, especially if you include a thorough update on your life. Letters and care packages add a personal touch to written communication.
Email has the advantage of instantaneous communication.

, Texting can be used to check in or to have a long chat. Most people use their cell phones regularly, so messaging can often become a real-time conversation via text.


With group chats, voice messaging, and the ability to send pictures, text messages can be similar to some of the features of Facebook. While not as personal as phoning, texting is a common alternative to social media.

, Reach out to friends who live in other cities if you happen to be in town. Ask for hotel recommendations and allow your friend to show you around his or her town while you are there."

Tell the person some times that work for you.,
Invite them to an event that is coming up.,
Make plans for the following weekend.",How to Ask Someone to Hang Out2," When you ask someone to hang out, make sure you have a few times in mind when you know you’re free. Think of three dates within the next two weeks that you’d want to do something. Offer those dates to the person and ask if they are free during any of those times.If you ask them to hang at an unspecified time in the future, it’s less likely to happen. If you give them three dates, there’s a decent chance they’ll be able to say yes to one of them.
You might have one night a week that you always keep open in case something comes up. Tell them you’re usually free on Tuesday nights and ask if next Tuesday would work.
For example, “I’m looking for something to do in the next couple of Saturdays, would you want to hit the shops downtown and then get some lunch?”

, If you already have a party or get together planned, even if you aren’t hosting it, invite the person to come to the event. Since it is happening at one specific time, if they aren’t able to attend, they are only turning down the event and not you. This is also less pressure than a one-on-one hang out.If you are having a Super Bowl party, invite them to join you. It’s a common event, it’s set at a specific time, and there will be plenty of people to interact with.
Maybe you don’t have anything specific that’s coming up. Plan something with a group of friends for the purpose of inviting the person you want to get to know.
It doesn’t have to be a private event. Ask the person if they want to go to the town festival and walk around together. They would probably go anyway, and it’s a laid back, public event.

, Throughout the week, people may have set schedules, but they are often more open on weekends. If you typically only see people in a weekday environment, ask them to do something over the weekend. This gives you morning, afternoon, and night times to work with.Weekends are good because people are often more open to late nights on Friday and Saturday, and they may have more free time during the day on Saturday and Sunday.
Weekends also offer more events like community theater, farmer’s markets and festivals, concerts, and parties.
Say, “After this long week, I need to blow off some steam this weekend. Would you want to hit up the shooting range on Friday after work?""

"
"
Ask them to go to an upcoming meal.,
Transition from class or a meeting into hanging out.,
Invite someone to go wherever you’re going.",How to Ask Someone to Hang Out3," If you are at work or getting out of class around lunch time, ask the person if they want to eat lunch together. If you both packed your lunch, you could sit and eat together. Otherwise, ask the person if they want to go out for lunch together. This works because you both need to eat and it’s a low-pressure way to hang out.It doesn’t have to be an immediate meal. Ask someone to grab dinner when you get off work or meet up in a few hours when you finish what you’re doing.
If you leave a party late at night, ask if they want to grab some late night food at a nearby diner.

, If you’re with the person at work, a club meeting, or class, ask them if they want to do something when the engagement is over. Ask them while you’re in the meeting if they want to hang out afterward, or ask them right when it is over if they want to go do something.They may have things going on back to back, but a lot of times people will be free when a scheduled event has ended. Take advantage of this gap in their schedule.
Say, “I’ve got a couple of hours to kill when the class is over, do you want to go walk around the quad?” This is a simple way to hang out and it’s a low-pressure ask since it’s spur of the moment.
When you’re heading out the door after work or an organization meeting, say, “I’m going over to Poor Richard’s to grab a drink. Do you want to come hang out?” Getting a drink after work is common, so this type of question will seem normal to them.

, Anytime you’re about to do something and you see someone you want to hang out with, ask them to join you. Since you are going to do it no matter what they say, it’s not a big deal if they turn you down. If it’s a person you see every day, you have unlimited options of what to invite them to.This works when you are on your way out of the dorm to see a movie, leaving your apartment complex to go for a hike, or leaving the office to play ultimate frisbee.
Get in the habit of inviting people to come along with you wherever you are going. After a while, they will get used to you asking and eventually they will say yes and join you.

Examine your own music taste.,
Compare your music taste with your friend's.,
Take turns picking songs.,
Go to concerts/festivals together.",How to Appreciate Your Friends' Music Tastes," Whenever you meet new people, the inevitable question that tends to get asked is, ""What type of music do you like?"". This question is usually answered in one of two ways. One, ""Oh I'm into rock/classical/(insert a genre)"". Or ""Oh, I like all types of music"".

The second option usually means that one has a varied taste in music, regardless of genre. You must ask yourself how you'd answer that question.;
, So, you like rock music, but your friend has a big crush on One Direction? Polar opposites right? Not necessarily. Look into the music you listen to and see if there is any crossover with your friends taste.

In the example situation, maybe you like some pop / rock songs and they like some pop songs which feature guitars. This overlap in tastes gives you a foothold to share a portion of their taste in music.

, If you listen to their songs and, then, they listen to your songs, eventually both of you may start to see your music tastes soften and you'll both appreciate some aspects of each other's music.

Make a playlist that features songs choices from both of you to listen to when hanging out and, eventually, you may hear your friend say ""Hmmm, that song wasn't half bad"".

, By seeing a band you either don't like or don't know much about in concert, you may not definitely grow to love them on the spot, but it does put the music into a different environment and gives it a new energy.

Amongst a large group of fans, you can see and feel how loved the music is. A festival combines this idea with the playlist idea; you can see a range of bands and introduce your friends to your types of music whilst seeing theirs in the company of people who love the music.

Maintain stellar contact information for your friends.,
Update your own contact information regularly.,
Keep track of your contacts.",How to Stay Updated With Your Friends if You Don't Use Facebook2," One of the best ways to stay in touch is to always know where your friends currently live and/or work. In addition to their home address, maintain cell and landline information, email addresses, and work information. Obtain family contact information if your friends are under 30. Young career go-getters tend to move around a lot, so it can be easy to lose pace with new apartments, phone numbers, and cities. However, parents will usually have this information handy.Remind your friends that you do not have Facebook, but that it is still important for you to stay in touch.

, Alert your friends if you change your address, phone number, email, or any other communication method. This way you will remain current despite everyone’s changing lives.


If you use email, send an email blast to your contact list (create a group so you don't reveal everyone’s address) to confirm new emails, phone numbers, and any other preferred methods of contact.
Consider using holiday cards as a way to check in with snail mail addresses. Physical cards are also a nice way to show that you would like to stay in touch and that you care about your friendship.

, There are several ways to stay organized and keep track of the contact information you have for your friends. You can use a physical address book or create a virtual address book through your email or other websites. A virtual or physical calendar may be a useful addition to the address book. With a calendar, you can remind yourself of special dates such as birthdays and anniversaries. Calendars may also help you keep track of how often you get in touch with friends. After having a conversation with a friend, consider writing down the date in a calendar so you can quickly see how long it’s been since your last interaction.
Mutual friends may also help with keeping track of your contacts. Stay in touch with other friends who have access to contacts that you may have lost.

"
Be prepared to miss a variety of personal updates.,
Remind your friends to contact you using other mediums.,
Prepare to give out an alternative form of contact information when you meet new people.",How to Stay Updated With Your Friends if You Don't Use Facebook3," It's your prerogative not to use Facebook but be aware that sometimes this may leave you out of the loop. You may feel the need to explain why you don't use Facebook (work privacy reasons, dislike of the site, bad past experience, etc.). However, you will still miss an element of social interaction.


You might be late to learn about your friends' vacation photographs, exciting news, and life changes. Remember to ask about many topics when you do get in touch.

, Tell your friends to contact you in whatever way you prefer. It is important to tell your friends how to reach you so that you're aware of anything they'd like you to know.


Depending on your age and friend group, calling, texting, or using other forms of social may be the best way to ask your friends to stay in touch. Consult your friends about a method of contact that works for them too.
Remember that people can be forgetful. Be prepared to remind forgetful friends that you're not able to read their updates on Facebook.

, Often people assume that everyone uses social media. When you meet someone new, they may want to add you on Facebook. Prepare to give out a phone number, email, or some other form of contact that you feel comfortable sharing."

Smile.,
Listen.,
Ask about the person's life.,
Share a memory.,
Slightly touch the person often.",How to Make Someone Feel Special1," Greet your special person with a smile, and smile often while you are with her (without faking it). Smiling will not only make you feel happier, but it will make you sound happier and more positive.It will also let her know that you’re happy to see her, and that you’re interested in what she’s saying.;
, Pay attention to what the person has going on in her life, like her hobbies and what she does at work or in school. Take note of people she frequently mentions; these people are probably important to her in one way or another.


Give the person your full attention, don’t play on your phone or computer.
Some common people are siblings, parents, grandparents, and close friends. She may also mention pets, children, or even classmates and colleagues. Try to learn about these people and their relationship with your special friend.
Sometimes it is best to just listen, and not offer solutions. For example: your friend tells you that she’s frustrated with her basketball coach. Say something like, “That does sound really frustrating, I’m sorry you had to go through that.” Avoid saying things like, “I know exactly how that feels”, because chances are you don’t fully understand what she’s going through and it might make her feel bad.

, This is a good time to reach back to things you've learned about your friend. Ask her about a specific person or event she mentioned last time you talked. Asking questions will show that you care about what she does and what she loves. Pay attention and try to remember the details of her stories. The next time you talk, ask her how these things are going. For example:


You remember that she is very close with her brother, and the last time they hung out was over spring break when they went on a family trip to the beach. Ask her how her brother is doing, and if she has seen him lately. Maybe ask her if she's been to the beach lately, or if she has any plans to see her brother again soon.

, Not only will the memory be a warm, fun thought for you and your friend, but it will also show that you are thinking about her and that you value the time you spend together.It could be a memory from childhood, or one from the previous night. Maybe you stayed up all night talking, or you did something crazy like go skydiving. Reminiscing about your time spent together is a great way to show that your time with her is special.

, It doesn’t have to be intimate, but touching has been shown to increase happiness and make people feel more connected.Hug her when you first see her and when you say goodbye, or pat her on the shoulder when you pass by.


Be careful to not overdo it, the limit and amount of touching depends on your relationship with your special person. There should be very different limits if your special person is a significant other versus a friend or family member.

Explore what you think lies behind your urge to talk about your friends or share a piece of juicy gossip about a pal.,
Consider the kind of damage you're doing.,
Get savvy in your communications.,
Face facts.,
Button up.,
Increase your respect factor.,
Apologize to your friend if need be.,
Strive from this point forward to speak only well of your friends.",How to Stop Talking About Friends Behind Their Backs," Perhaps you think that it's harmless fun and perhaps you even feel a little proprietary over the information because it is about your friend after all. Or perhaps you think that dropping your friend's secrets or most embarrassing moments into the middle of a conversation will be funny and spares you having to say anything of the sort about yourself. Or are you currently unhappy with your life and talking about other friend’s misfortune or misery feeds your soul? Whatever the motivation behind your loose tongue, you need to get to the root of why you find it's okay to talk behind the back of your friends, in order to know how to stop. Consider which of the following is most applicable to you:



Insecurity: People who are not comfortable in their own skin and who have insecurities will often pick apart others in order to feel better. And unfortunately, this can sometimes include those close to you, whose inner thoughts you know best of all, simply because you don't feel secure enough to find less personal topics of conversation with people who awe or overwhelm you.

Boredom: Feel as if your life is totally boring and without excitement? Dragging out other’s dirty laundry can get the conversation started and cook up some thrills. However, this displays a lack of creativity in your conversation skills, so salving your boredom with your friend's information is both lazy and disloyal.

Revenge: Some people may be angry with a friend and feel that the only way they will feel vindicated is to talk about them behind their back––whether they already hashed it out with the friend or not. Revenge as a motivation for doing anything is always a total fail when it comes to living a fulfilling life; it reveals a lack of self-respect, a lack of respect for others and a lack of self-restraint or personal responsibility for your actions. A friend never deserves having their dirty laundry aired as a panacea for your own annoyance or unhappiness with them.

Protection: You may feel wronged, and want to warn other people in your circle of the ""dangers"" of having this person in their life represents. Consider that we often feel like victims in friendship by minor things, like selfishness, that really represent little danger to anyone. If this is the case, let your friends make up their own minds.

Humor: During these sarcastic times when sitcom and reality TV stars hurl insults as if they were nothing, some folks think they are being funny by making snarky remarks about friends behind their back. Unfortunately for the air-headed TV ""role models"", funny doesn't even come into the equation and copying them is a sign of letting the brain go on vacation. Humor does not stoop to condescension, belittlement or gossip; if it does, it's not humor, it's muckraking.

Thoughtlessness: You've assumed that since your friend seems to have a thick skin, that it's okay to talk about them without consideration for their feelings. Your friend does have feelings; they're just not flaunting them. At least you've got the gumption to admit you've been thoughtless. Now it's time to turn things around.;
, If you were to stop and recall your words and think about what you said, what kind of damage are you doing to another person? Place yourself into your friend's place and think about how you would feel if the things you've been saying to others were said about you by your friend. Suddenly it's not such a nice feeling when looked at this way. Your friend may be hurt by gossip, rumor mongering or exaggerated negative embellishment about their lives in one or more of the following ways:


Personal reputation: Spreading gossip about another person, whether it’s true or not, can harm a person's reputation irreparably, especially since it's coming from a close source. Consider whether your gossiping ways are potentially destroying your friend’s reputation. If so, why do you believe you should bring down your friend like this? If you're gossiping because you seek revenge, this is no way to resolve your conflict. If it's because of thoughtlessness or a desire to look better at your friend's expense, it's time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and start realizing that what you're doing is bringing about real harm.
Business reputation: Are you ruining your friend’s livelihood just for personal fodder or perhaps even out of jealousy? Consider what your words could be doing to your friend’s financial security and business prospects. Think about how your rumor mongering could impact not only your friend, but also his or her family and staff.
Family reputation: Even though you may be talking about your friend, your words could hurt his or her family, including your friend's children. Family members are innocent bystanders and should not be hurt or damaged by your words.

, Know the difference between damaging gossip, venting to friends or simply conveying information about a friend. In some cases, you may be spreading great news about a friend without realizing that your friend might have preferred to keep it secret a while more (such as being pregnant or getting a job promotion). Or, you may be simply venting about a fight you had with one close friend, without thinking too hard about how this sounds to listeners outside of your inner circle. Knowing the difference between indiscriminately talking behind a friend’s back versus delivering information is important:


Venting/clearing the air. We all need to let off some steam and if you’ve had a fight with a friend, you may want to consult with another pal to help you through the issue. Talking with a trusted friend whom you know without a doubt won’t talk about your discussion with others should be fine in most cases. Talking it out may provide you with insight and help you arrive at conflict resolution with your other friend. Avoid saying nasty things or calling your other friends names. Moreover, venting continuously to numerous people moves into gossipy territory.
Gossip/talking behind a friend’s back. Taking information that has nothing to do with you (or in some cases information that does but is highly confidential) and freely discussing it with numerous people is considered to be gossip.
Passing along news. For example, when a close friend has a baby, telling a bunch of people is not considered to be gossip provided your friend gives you her or his blessing to tell the world. On the other hand, if she has had three miscarriages in a row and doesn't want anyone to know she's pregnant again until she knows this baby is safely coming to term, saying anything without her permission is talking behind her back.

, Ask yourself what talking about others says about you. Consider how you end up looking when you talk about friends behind their back. Most likely the friends you gossip to may not trust you with personal information in the future and will distance themselves from you. You may also look insecure and possibly vindictive if you have become the town crier; this risks losing more than just the friend or friends about whom you have gossiped, as other friends realize that you can't be trusted. When you think about talking about another friend behind that friend’s back, think about how negative that makes you appear and how even those in receipt of your information will be thinking twice about trusting you.


Make a concerted effort to put yourself in your friend’s shoes during a discussion. Do you like it when people talk or gossip about you behind your back? Do you know what your friends think about you? Before you open your mouth to talk about a juicy morsel of gossip, insert your name into the sentence such as, “Oh my God, I can’t believe that (name) filed for foreclosure!” Would you want everyone to know you filed for foreclosure? If you might be embarrassed, think about how your friend might feel; it's probably exactly the same.

, Mentally or physically excuse yourself from a conversation that becomes too full of gossip, to avoid ""falling into"" gossip games or socializing-by-demoralizing. One of the best ways to stop talking about others behind their back is to back away from any conversation that stoops to the level of gossiping. For example, if you're in a group of friends and one friend’s name is brought up regarding her affair, don’t add any information you may have. You could let others do the talking and stay quiet but it might also be appropriate to speak up and suggest that it's inappropriate to speak about someone who is not there to defend themselves. Of course, be tactful and don't start trash talking anybody participating in the conversation either!


Don’t speculate about any person. You may be dying to jump into the conversation even though you don’t have any information, but hold back. Don’t speculate––just refuse to participate in any muckraking.
Try to guide the conversation away from gossip. Bring the discussion back to the here and now where the people present during the conversation are either talking about what is going on in their own lives or discuss a new hot trend or topic.
Walk away if you can’t control yourself. You're better off leaving the discussion rather than jumping in and contributing. If your friends ask your opinion simply say, “I really don’t know anything about it” and leave it alone.

, If you've been using gossip about your friends as a social crutch, it is time to wake up from the fugue. Whatever has driven you to talk about friends behind their backs, much of this comes down to learning to respect both yourself and others more. In particular, if you have been using gossiping as a means for making yourself look better or as a way to fit in more with others, then it's definitely time to reassess why you'd rather appear popular with strangers than to feel loyal toward and contented with the friends who are a significant source of support, loyalty and trust in your life.


Help yourself to heal past hurts that might have lead to gossiping habits, by letting go of old wounds, forgiving the errors others have made toward you and forgiving yourself for having given in to an age-old human vice. If revenge has been eating away at you for some time, forgiveness will help you to finally let go.
Promise yourself that you will not repeat the backstabbing talk and that you will catch yourself if you start it up again and stop immediately. It really is that basic when it comes to stopping yourself from spreading tales.
Bear in mind that friendship is a source of healing and regeneration. Instead of turning away from it, turn into it and stay loyal.
Find more constructive ways to communicate with people in social settings that make you feel uncomfortable or left out. If your conversation skills need a boost, learn ways to find better topics of conversation. If your nerves are shredded in public, learn how to cope better through increasing your confidence. If you're suffering from a social phobia, get help to overcome it. Using gossip about friends is never a substitute for improving yourself.

, If your friend learns that you have been gossiping about him or her, be strong and apologize. Whether or not your friend is willing to accept this apology is beside the point––you need to stop and turn over the new leaf somewhere and this is a significant and symbolic gesture to make.


Avoid making excuses. Simply explain that you have fallen into a bad habit of gossiping, you realize that it is both wrong and hurtful and you have made a determined decision to cease being a gossip or to share any more of your friend's personal information without his or her permission.

, Remember and observe this wise old saying: ""Divide all people into two groups: friends and strangers. Friends are loved too much to gossip about, strangers are known too little.""

Learn about the person.,
Give something sentimental.,
Give a compliment.,
Take the person some place special.",How to Make Someone Feel Special2," Listen to everything she says. Make note of things like important people, sentimental things or places, or hobbies. It can even be as simple as learning what her favorite soda or candy is. Some of these things you can pick up on by just listening, and some things you will have to observe. Examples of common things to notice include:


Best friend(s). Does she hang out with one person or a group of people all the time? Learn about these people, how your special person met them, and what they do when they hang out.
Close family members. Is she close with any siblings, or is she closer to parents or grandparents? If she always mentions doing things with her dad, that’s a good sign that her and her dad are very close. Make a note.
Favorite soda. Does she prefer Pepsi or Coke? Does she like regular or does she prefer diet? Simpler things like this can still prove to be valuable.
Favorite food. Maybe she loves Indian food, or maybe there’s one specific dish that’s her absolute favorite. Try to notice if she always eats the same thing, or if she frequently suggests the same type of restaurant.
Sports and hobbies. Is your friend always at practice or taking lessons? Maybe she plays a sport, but doesn’t take it too seriously and just does it for fun. Try to pay attention not only to what her hobbies are, but how involved she is in them.

, Take what you’ve learned about her and get something special. It doesn’t have to be expensive or crazy, just something you know she likes to let her know you’re thinking about her. If she’s having a tough day and seems stressed, giving her something simple like her favorite candy will make her feel special and ease her mind. Examples of some good gifts include:


A favorite food or drink. This one is super easy but will still make the person feel loved.
Something from your friend's favorite sports team. A team jersey, a t-shirt, or even tickets to a game are just a few good places to start.
A collectible item. Lots of people collect things like coffee mugs, cards, and plenty of other objects. Adding something to your friend's collection is a perfect way to show you care.
Another option is to make something for her. Have her over and cook her favorite meal for her, or draw her a picture of her. Use your talents to create something that shows you care about her.

, Giving a compliment can be more difficult than a physical gift, but be an even better gesture to show her she's special. The most important ideas for giving a good compliment are:


Be genuine. Think about things your friend is proud of and reinforce that idea. A genuine complement is more meaningful and is way easier to deliver.
Pay attention. If your friend is trying something new, like a new outfit or accessory, that is a great opportunity to say something nice.
Complement the person's personality. If your friend does something nice for you, thank them and use an extra sentence or two to let them know you think they're a genuinely kind person. Make sure to smile while you deliver your compliment.

, Maybe there’s a place in the woods that she used to go when she was a kid, or her favorite artist is coming to your city next month. Not only is this a good opportunity to see her, but it will also let her know that you care about her.


Some other examples of good places to go include restaurants, vacation destinations, and sporting events.

"
Stay connected.,
Pay attention to social media.,
Connect the person with a friend.,
Plan your next hangout.,
Follow through.",How to Make Someone Feel Special3," Call her when you have some free time. If you’re both busy and it’s difficult for you to both make time, schedule a time to talk. You can also stay in touch via text or email. Send her articles that you think she might enjoy, or things that remind you of her. Ask her how significant people are doing. These will all show that you care about her and the important things in her life.

, When you talk to her, you’ll have something specific to ask her about. When appropriate, comment on and like her posts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Be careful not to overdo it, you don’t want to make her uncomfortable or seem clingy. A good example of using social media to make her feel special:


She posts a picture of her going skiing. The next time you talk, tell her you saw her post and ask her if she had fun. Did she go with friends or family? This will show her that you are thinking about her, and that you want to learn more about her.

, If you don’t get to see her often, but know she’s looking for friends where she lives, think about other friends you have in her area. If someone comes to mind, introduce the two of them. In addition to showing that you’re thinking about her, this will also demonstrate that you care about her happiness even outside of your relationship with her.


When you introduce your two friends, tell a fun fact about them to give both of them something to talk about and make them feel good. Example: “Emily, this is my friend Olivia, we played on the same soccer team in high school, and she was by far the best defender on the team. Olivia, Emily and I were both chemistry majors in college and took a lot of classes together, we made class really fun together.” Now they both have context for your friendships, and have a few easy topics to start a conversation.

, Whether it’s tomorrow or next month, setting time aside in advance will show that it is a priority for you to see her. Planning ahead will also help you, in case you need to save up money or vacation time to see your special person. Ask her what she wants to do, and suggest things that you know she’ll like.


If the two of you have mutual friends or know her good friends, try to include them on the plans. This is an easy way to show her that you’re paying attention to the important people in her life.

, Backing out of plans will make her feel like you don’t care about her and can undo a lot of the work you’ve done to make her feel special. If you make plans, don’t flake! To prevent this from happening, mark your next event in your calendar and set reminders if you need to. Put post-it notes on your desk or bathroom mirror, or come up with your own way to ensure you don’t make other plans on the same day and time.

Lead, don’t follow.People who are admired are unafraid to do something new or different.,
Demonstrate personal integrity.Integrity means being honest when representing yourself to others and to yourself.,
Adopt a positive attitude.A positive attitude doesn’t mean pretending that everything is great all the time.,
Focus on the people that matter.,
Achieve a work-life balance.",How to Be Admired1," Being a leader doesn’t necessarily mean you outrank anyone else. You can be a leader even among those who have greater official authority than you by convincing others to follow a certain course or act in a certain way.


Leadership requires more than speaking and acting in an inspirational and influential way. You must also be willing to take responsibility when something needs doing. For instance, if you’re the director of a play and the actors are not excited to rehearse, it is your job to inspire them to give their all so the play is a success.
Leaders should inspire, not intimidate. Don’t lead through fear.
Leaders must both admit when they were wrong and take credit for victories.;
, It means that you don’t compromise on your core values and you stand by the things you believe. Admirable individuals strive to maintain their personal integrity by staying true to who they are even when it is unpopular or controversial.


Don’t be stubborn. Standing by your principles and acting with integrity doesn’t mean that you are unwilling to accept or consider alternative ideas.

, That is unrealistic. Instead, recognize when things are bad but look for the good in every situation. For example, if you and your classmates present a draft of your project to your teacher and she reviews it poorly, remind your classmates that many aspects of the presentation were still reviewed favorably. Think of the review as an opportunity to revise the project until it is sure to earn an “A.”


A positive attitude gives you confidence, hope, and the belief that tomorrow will be better.

, Admirable individuals tend to be empathetic and sensitive to the needs and wants of others.For instance, you might admire a boss who always remembers your birthday or notices when you are sad. Fostering positive communication with others and treating others with respect are the hallmarks of an individual who keeps the people they care about in mind.


Be inclusive of all people willing to contribute to a project or team. Don’t play favorites or try to divide people. Just because someone has a different background or level of experience doesn’t meant they are not valuable
Always try to see the best in people.
Don’t give too much attention to naysayers and people who only want to drag you down.

, We admire people who are well-rounded and can successfully manage both a happy personal life and build flourishing career. Develop interests outside of work. Whether it’s reading, art, music, or bodybuilding, go after it. Don’t get trapped in the daily grind.


If you enjoy music, form a band.
If you enjoy art, visit museums with friends and set aside time each day to work on your art.
Live your life with passion. Give your best to friends, coworkers, and family each day.

Work hard.Whether you’re working for minimum wage or managing a large firm, you should always take pride in your work.,
Help your coworkers.By helping your coworkers, it demonstrates that you think of others.,
Speak your mind.,
Trust your employees.When you hire someone, hire the best person you can for the job.,
Show your employees you respect them.",How to Be Admired2," Doing so will demonstrate that you are competent and capable of doing your part. Go above and beyond in your workplace by giving your all on the job. If you make pizzas, make the best pizza you can, every time. If you mop the floors, scrub them to a high polish.


Take pride in your work and doing it will be a pleasure, not a chore.
Keep your office or workspace clean and well-organized

, This quality is universally admired. The help you give your coworker depends on the type of work they’re doing. You could choose to do their work for them if they are too busy, or you might choose to collaborate with them on something or provide feedback.


For instance, if you work at a restaurant and your coworker needs to mop the floor, wash the dishes, and refill the soda fountain, offer to complete one of his tasks when you are not too busy.
Do not help your coworkers at your own expense. Take care of your own duties before taking on those of others.
Do not let your coworkers walk all over you. If they are not struggling with their work, they should be left to do it themselves.

, Do not suck up to your superiors.

Stand up to your boss when he or she is wrong. For instance, if your boss criticizes a coworker’s logo design during a meeting, explain that you like it because it demonstrates many features which customers would find attractive.

Make suggestions about how things could be improved if you see problems in a project or in the work-flow. For instance, if your department and another both need to use the same computer during your design phases, suggest that the company invest in a second computer so both departments can get their work done simultaneously.
People who suck up to their bosses are generally considered untrustworthy and do not receive workplace admiration.

, People who are insecure hire people who are good, but not great, because they fear being usurped by their subordinate. This characteristic is not worthy of admiration.


Demonstrate that you trust and rely on your staff by delegating various responsibilities to them. Do not delegate important tasks to individuals who cannot accomplish them.
Use your knowledge of each person on your staff to identify how much and what kind of work they can handle. It is important to push people in the workplace to make them feel they are being challenged and engaged, but be careful not to overwhelm them.

, When your staff does a great job, let them know. You can let them know in verbal and material ways. For instance, after meeting your quarterly earnings, send an email round the office explaining that you’ve done so and inform your staff, “I am extremely proud of all the hard work you’ve been doing. It has paid off handsomely.” Invite them to drinks after work, or organize a workplace pizza party. Give your staff a bonus for meeting the sales quota.


People who treat others kindly and recognize their successes -- as well as their failures and flaws -- are worthy of admiration.
Do not publicly berate or embarrass your staff. Always speak to them with respect in a calm, even tone. If you have a problem or issue with one of your employees, ask them to your office or another private space where you can address any problems or concerns you might have with them.
Do not play favorites among your staff.If you pit them against one another in divisive ways, you will not inspire honest and virtuous behavior, and your workers will not be driven to work as productively as they could.

Practice what you preach.In other words, do the things you want your children to do.,
Be inclusive when making family decisions..

Children will not admire an inflexible tyrant.,
Be a friend to your child.,
Be forgiving and ask for forgiveness.,
Develop an interest in education and learning.If you always have something interesting to teach or explain to your child, they will be much impressed and admire you for your depth of knowledge.,
Persevere in the face of adversity.If you lose your job, fall ill, or suffer another misfortune, do not mope about it.",How to Be Admired3," If you direct your children to be on time for appointments or be at home at a certain time, you should also arrive when you say you are going to. If you don’t want your child to use foul language, don’t curse. If you want your children to tell the truth, don’t lie to them or others. Even if you advise your children to do the right thing, they will not admire you if you are hypocritical.

, Including your child in discussions which affect them will gain their admiration and help them develop a sense of personal autonomy and agency. You can include your child in both small and large decisions. For instance, a few nights a week you could ask your child what he or she wants for dinner. (Naturally, if they answer something unacceptable like ice cream, you should tell them that is not an option.)

Including your child in family decisions doesn’t mean relinquishing all responsibility for those decisions. You’re still the parent and ultimately, authority still rests with you.

, Go for walks, go to the movies, and go to get ice cream together. Enjoy the time you spend with them.Tell your child regularly that you love them. When they come home after school, ask “How was your day?” Ask about their dreams, ideas, and feelings.


For instance, your child says, “I want to be a dancer when I grow up,” you could ask, “Why do you want to be a dancer?” Listen to their answers and don’t belittle what they have to say.If you need more information, ask follow-up questions.
Take time to seriously answer any questions your child asks.
Show your child know that you will always be there for them. If they need help with homework or if they are sick, take time out of your schedule to care for them.

,

Recognize that nobody is perfect. If you make a mistake, you should acknowledge that you did so and apologize for hurting anyone’s feelings. Find ways to amend the situation and think about what you can do next time to prevent a similar situation from occurring. Use these situations to illustrate to your child how to admit when you’re wrong and ask for forgiveness.

For instance, if you mistook your child’s drawing a of a bird for a butterfly, your child might feel distraught. Admit that you made a mistake by identifying it wrongly and reassure them that it is a great drawing. Say, “I’m sorry, can you forgive me?”
When your children make mistakes, you should always expect them to acknowledge the mistake. Your child should apologize and correct the situation as needed. For instance, if they spilled milk on the floor while you were out of the room, ensure that they admit to doing so and then help you clean it up (assuming they are of an appropriate age to do so).
Tell your child you love them even when they make mistakes.

, Having a well-rounded education will not only equip you for a richer life, but it will also demonstrate to your child that education should be an important part of their life, as well.


If you did not graduate high school, consider getting your GED.
If you did graduate high school, consider going to college. You could get a two-year associate’s degree or a four-year bachelor’s degree.
You don’t need a college education to be well-educated or interested in learning, though it does help. Keep up with current events by reading the newspaper regularly. Visit your local library to check out some books. Read a mix of both fiction and nonfiction. Watch documentaries as well as feature films.
Expand your mind by diving deeper into topics you know little about. By challenging yourself, you will be able to think about things in a different way.
By taking your child to local art museums, you can learn together.

, Instead, take proactive action to correct the situation.For instance, if you lose your job, seek new work in the classifieds of your local paper or online. Use labor networking sites like LinkedIn and Monster.com to make your resume available for potential employers and browse available jobs.


Develop patience and control your anger when you feel it rising within you.
Do not take your frustration about a difficult situation out on your child or anyone else. Find positive ways to deal with your frustration through deep breathing, yoga, mediation, or engaging yourself with a fun hobby.
While it is natural to feel depressed when confronted with loss of a family member or other hardship, stay strong and positive for your child. Talk to a trained therapist if your feelings persist.

Serve others as a religious figure.,
Invent something useful.,
Engage in the political process.If you are neither religious nor technologically inclined, you could engage in politics as a politician or as an activist.",How to Be Admired4," Many of the most respected people go into public service as leaders within a religious order. For instance, the Dalai Lama is widely praised for standing for world peace, and Pope Francis is popular for fighting for the poor. You don’t have to attain that level of stature to have the same effect. Become a religious leader in your community and fight for those in need of material as well as spiritual assistance.


Rabbis, pastors, imams, and priests can all gain admiration when they speak and act in concert with the teachings of their holy books.
If your advice is sought by politicians or other public figures, always use your platform to encourage positive change.
Join a monastery or nunnery. Monks and nuns live in a community with others who practice their faith in order to better understand their holy books and teachings. Becoming a monk or nun is a good path toward a future as a religious leader.

, If the religious life isn't for you, there are other ways to gain admiration. Inventions which create a better world earn their inventors great admiration and respect. For instance, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are widely admired for the contributions they made to the development of home computers, which has led to a more connected, informed world.

Think about how you can turn your own creative or scientific ability to practical use.

Look at problems in your community and think of ways to solve them with science and technology.
If you’re not skilled in those fields, propose an idea to someone who can engineer a solution.

, If you want to become an activist, choose an issue or topic which you feel strongly about and locate a local nonprofit which engages in work related to the topic. For instance, if you feel strongly about poverty and food security, you could donate your time at a local food bank or soup kitchen.


If you want to be a respected politician, it helps to have a law degree. You could also have a political science degree, though any degree helps. It is unlikely you will be able to get elected as a politician unless you have a college education of some kind.
Run for local office as a mayor, state representative, or city council member. As you gain more experience, consider running for senator or representative at the national level.
To be a respected politician, be honest and do not engage in corruption or selfish behavior. Lead with vision and respect the will of those who elected you. Work tirelessly for the good of your community, state, or nation. Fight for justice, truth, and a better world."

Realize that different people have different ways of thinking.,
Identify the strengths of the literal thinker.,

Avoid using figures of speech and overly artistic language.,
Say what you mean.,
Use visual representations to improve communication.,
Be open to explaining.,
Avoid sarcasm.,
Run interference if you notice a miscommunication between a literal thinker and another person.,
Work on being patient and understanding.,
Recognize that how you communicate is just as important as what you are saying.",How to Get Along With Literal Thinkers," Each person’s brain operates differently. Literal thinkers aren't trying to think literally; it's simply the way their brains are structured. This can cause as much frustration for a literal thinker as it causes for you.Realize that a literal thinker does not want to be frustrated and that they are not trying to frustrate you either.


Think of how you can accommodate a literal thinker, rather than getting upset that they don't think in the same way that you do.
Respect and celebrate diverse ways of thinking. We each have our own strengths and challenges. Perhaps one of your friends, a literal thinker, is a great mathematician, while you are a poet. As a society we should celebrate their mathematical brilliance and your artistry with words.
Be kind. In addition to celebrating differences, you should be compassionate and generous in your communication with a literal thinker.;
, Because a literal thinker thinks in concrete terms, they are likely to better at understanding rules, utilizing concrete information, visualizing information, and working through thoughts and actions that are rule-based, such as math problems, than many other neurotypical thinkers.With this in mind, it becomes easier for another person to consider ways to communicate with a literal thinker that would play upon those strengths, which would improve the communication process for both parties. When talking to a literal thinker try to identify their personal strengths and use communication practices in line with those strengths.

, Rather than looking down on a literal thinker for thinking in concrete terms, or for missing nuances, sarcasm, or irony, instead consider these things endearing. A literal thinker engages you in new and challenging ways and may require a little extra work on your part to make sure that the communication between the two of you flows smoothly, but this is an experience that is both positive and informative.


For example, instead of making an off-hand sarcastic remark, a literal thinker needs you to phrase your statement in a clear and concise manner without any sarcasm so that they can understand it. This forces you to think about alternate ways of saying something, which in turn, expands your vocabulary and makes you a more effective communicator. This also demonstrates to the literal thinker that you are invested in your communication with him.

, Our language is complex and can be challenging at times for even the best speakers. Literal thinkers think in concrete terms and often focus on “the here and now.”They can miss the nuances of language and subtext, and they can find it difficult to pick up on verbal and nonverbal cues that would otherwise help them decipher the meaning of a statement or conversation.When engaging a literal thinker, remember to use simple language that is straightforward, which explicitly states what you mean. Avoid using:Metaphors
Idioms
Puns
Exaggeration/hyperbole
Euphemisms
Personification of inanimate objects/Anthropomorphism
Sarcasm/irony
Figurative phrases
Flowery or artistic language
Implied assumptions

, Be straightforward with your communication. Hints may sail over the head of a literal thinker. Also, avoid complex nonverbal cues or subtexts when conversing with a literal thinker. For example, don't say, ""I'm fine,"" when you're not fine, or cough and look at your watch when you want to let the other party know that you need to be going. Instead say, “I’m not okay,” if you are not fine, or say, “I must be going now,” when it is time for you to leave. Being clear will allow the literal thinker to catch the full message, so that they know how to respond.


Use “I” statements to handle difficult feelings. For example, instead of ""You're annoying,"" say ""I have a hard time focusing when you tap your pencil on your desk loudly.""
Do not use overly abstract language. Instead, use concrete words. For example, instead of saying, “I am under the weather today,” you might say, “I am sick.”

, Because literal thinkers often translate words into visual images in their minds, you might try to play upon that characteristic to help them comprehend what you are saying.Offering visual support of your words helps to concretize your language for the literal thinker.


For example, if you are talking to a literal thinker about your upcoming vacation to a Florida beach and he has never before been to a beach, you might show him images of the beach you are planning to visit to help him better understand what you are saying.

, If the person doesn't get it the first time, try rephrasing your words into more concrete language. Watch the literal thinker’s expression to see if they are still struggling, or if they get it now. Let the pace of the conversation be fluid, based on each person's needs. Explain what you mean until you are certain that you’ve reached a common understanding.

, State things as they are without relying upon subtext. Often literal thinkers do not understand or even recognize sarcasm. Explain things plainly and with kindness. If you wanted to use sarcasm for effect, think of a way that you could rephrase your sarcastic response in different terms that the literal thinker could understand.


For example, instead of saying ""Oh boy, I'm really loving this,"" when you are waiting in a long line, say something that makes your feelings clear, like ""This is not my idea of fun. I wish we were inside already!""

, If someone else is trying to be subtle, and your friend is missing the cues, step in to clear things up. You can make a gentle suggestion to the literal thinker, so that they have the information they need to know how to respond.


Say something like, ""Joshua seems like he's in a hurry. Why don't we talk about this later?"" or, ""Marisol's sarcasm can be pretty subtle. She's not criticizing you, she's criticizing your professor for being so judgmental.""
It may be worthwhile to take the other person aside and let him know that it helps to be clearer with the literal thinker. For example, ""It can be hard for Maya to decipher subtle hints, and I think she was struggling to guess what was on your mind. Next time, it might help for you to tell her outright how you feel.""

, Different thinking and learning styles are one part of human diversity, and struggles with nuanced language don't make someone less worthwhile or important. Make it clear that you don't think any less of the literal thinker for having a different style of communication.

, This is true for when you are talking to anyone — but applies to literal thinkers in particular — kindness and careful communication can make all of the difference.When you show a literal thinker kindness and are careful about how you speak to them, you encourage them to trust you, demonstrate respect for them and their communication style, and enhance your communication interactions with that person.

Be an active listener.,
Resist the urge to judge your friend.,
Reflect on what your friend says.,
Offer continued assistance.,
Get curious about others.,
Recognize what others need and want.,
Try caring for an animal.,
Practice speaking in an empathetic voice.,
Be patient with yourself.,
Be aware of your thoughts and feelings.,
Focus on what you have in common.,
Walk a mile in the other person's shoes.",How to Be an Empathetic Friend," One of the best ways to show empathy to a friend is by listening to what they have to say. It can be easy to get caught up in your own thoughts during a conversation or to get distracted by other things in your environment while your friend is talking. However, a truly empathetic friend will listen actively and attentively to a friend in need.Make eye contact with your friend while they speak.Minimize distractions. Turn your cell phone off and/or put it away so you won't be tempted to check it while your friend is talking.Don't try to give advice and don't think about what you're going to say while your friend talks.
Focus on simply listening attentively, nodding periodically to show that you're engaged.
When your friend stops talking, ask open-ended questions about what your friend is going through. However, respect the fact that your friend may not want to talk about some things in detail.;
, Real empathy requires you to set aside your judgments and accept another person as they are. That includes accepting that person's suffering for what it is and experiencing an emotional response to it.Remember that your friend doesn't need to feel worse about anything they're going through. As their friend, it's your duty to offer support and kindness.
Imagine how you would feel if you opened up to your friend about something difficult and they made you feel judged or shamed.
Take your imagined scenario a step further: instead of judgmental behavior, what type of behavior would actually help you during difficult times?

, Another way to show empathy while your friend speaks is to reflect out loud on what that friend has said. This can help show that you're concerned for your friend and that you're engaging with their thoughts and feelings.Don't repeat what's said word-for-word. This may come across as condescending or impersonal.
Rephrase what your friend says back to them, then ask them follow up questions.
For example, if your friend says that no one at work understands them, you might reflect by saying, ""I'm sorry that you're having a difficult time. It sounds like you're having a hard time connecting with your coworkers - why do you think that is?""

, Sometimes a friend going through something difficult just needs someone they can talk to or vent about their problems. They may not be looking for advice or anything beyond the company of a reliable friend.


Let your friend know that you're available if they need to talk or simply want to spend time together.
Follow through on your offer if your friend needs you. Make yourself available as much as possible, especially if your friend is going through a difficult time.
Continue to practice showing empathy every time you and your friend spend time together.

, In order to feel empathy for someone, you have to have a real interest in how that person feels. It makes sense, then, that one of the most important aspects of empathy is having a basic curiosity about other people and the lives they lead.Try taking note of other people's actions and body language. Eavesdrop on snippets of conversations when you're out in public places.
Spend some time thinking about what other people are doing on a day-to-day basis.
This can be done in fleeting moments. Make a point of noticing other drivers' faces and their expressions while you're stuck at a red light.
Think about where those individuals are going, what they're doing, and what's going on in their lives right now.

, Part of feeling empathy for someone entails being aware of their wellbeing as well as their needs and wants.If you're unfamiliar with recognizing others' needs and wants, you can start by practicing on people you know.


If you notice that your friends or family members look upset, ask them what's wrong and what they need or want in that moment.
You might be able to use contextual clues to determine what someone needs. For example, if someone is shivering, you can safely assume that they're cold and would like warmer clothing or shelter from the elements.
You can also imagine yourself in someone else's condition and ask yourself, ""What would I want or need in that moment?"" This can help you better understand someone else's suffering.

, Having a general desire to help someone or something is generally considered an important component of empathy. Spending time with an animal makes you more likely to feel empathy for that animal and want to help it any way you can.For this reason, caring for an animal may actually help some individuals develop a stronger sense of empathy for other people.


Try to spend some time volunteering at an animal shelter if you can. You can also try caring for an animal at home.
Over time you may be able to build your empathy for others by deepening your concern for the animal.

, You may not always be aware of it, but how you say something is often just as important as what you actually say. If you're trying to become more empathetic, it may be helpful to train yourself to sound more caring and concerned when speaking to a friend.Use a recording device to tape yourself saying something empathetic like ""I'm sorry that happened to you.""
Say your chosen empathetic phrase several times in different tones of voice and record each version.
Listen to your recorded phrasings and determine which one would sound most consoling to you.
Practice the phrasing you chose so that it comes more naturally to you in conversation. You may want to practice in front of a mirror so you can be aware of your facial expression, too.
Practicing an empathetic voice and expression doesn't mean you're faking the emotions or being insincere. It's simply a way to become more aware of your own mannerisms and body language.

, Most people have the capacity to feel empathy for others, or to at least experience cognitive empathy (not feeling the same emotion, but recognizing that you need to show kindness to someone).However, empathy can come more easily to some people. If it doesn't come instantly to you, be patient and keep practicing.


Recognize that some people have a hard time experiencing or expressing empathy due to a strong sense of individuality.Remember that this doesn't mean you're less capable than others; you may just need to spend more time and effort working on it.
Be patient and keep practicing. In time you will develop the ability to show empathy to your friends, and even to other people you don't like or don't know.

, Often when you encounter someone you don't like, it's easy to feel angry or frustrated with that person. When feelings of anger arise, it can be incredibly difficult to transition into feeling empathy for that person. The key, then, is to try to catch yourself before that anger has fully blossomed.Notice any physical sensations you might be having when you encounter someone you don't like.
For example, if you're frustrated, you might be feeling flush or experiencing a rapid heartbeat. By contrast, if you're feeling empathetic you might actually feel some degree of sadness.
Whenever you catch yourself having thoughts or feelings that interfere with your ability to feel empathy, take a moment to breathe slowly and deeply. Concentrate on letting go of negative emotions and open yourself to the other person's feelings.
Once you're calmer, you should be able to humanize the other person and at least see their struggles as relatable. It's okay if you don't feel empathetic immediately, but you should continue working on it if you want to develop a stronger sense of empathy.

, One of the best ways to humanize someone you don't know or don't like is to consider how they're similar to you. Even though your lives are different, you still have the same basic needs and wants.Think about all the ways that an individual is probably similar to you.
Like you, everyone you meet has hopes and dreams as well as fears and insecurities.
If you look closely enough, you may even find some similarities between you and the person you're focusing on.

, In order to truly humanize someone, some individuals need to actually understand why a person feels, thinks, and behaves the way they do. One way to do this is by following the old adage of walking a mile in someone else's shoes. You can do this literally by trying out someone's hardships for a day, or figuratively by imagining the hardships of someone's life.Even if you haven't experienced what someone else is going through, you have the capacity to imagine what such an experience must be like.Try to relate someone's suffering to something you have experienced, then contextualize it to understand what that person is most likely going through.
For example, while you may still have both parents, you have probably experienced the death of a grandparent, aunt/uncle, or another relative. As a result, you can imagine how much more intense it must be for someone to lose a parent.

Make a list of required hardware interfaces.,

Select the architecture.,
Identify memory needs.,
Start searching for micro controllers.,
Examine costs and power constraints.,
Check part availability.,
Select a development kit.,
Investigate compilers and tools.,
Start experimenting.",How to Choose a Micro Controller," Start with the basics. Prepare a block diagram of your project. By utilizing the general hardware block diagram, make a list of all the external interfaces that micro controller will support. There are two general types of interfaces.


The first type of interface is the communication interface. These are peripherals, for example, USB, I2C, SPI, UART, and so on. Make a special note about whether the application requires USB or some sort of ethernet. These interfaces greatly affect how much program space the micro controller will need to support.
The second type of interface is digital inputs and outputs, analog to digital inputs, etc. These two interface types will dictate the quantity of pins that the micro controller will need.;
, The software architecture and requirements can greatly influence the determination of a micro controller. How heavy or how light the requirements will determine whether you need a 80 MHz DSP or an 8 MHz 8051.


Also make a list of other requirements; for instance, are there any high frequency control loops or sensors or other mathematical notes? Gauge to what extent and how regularly every task will need to run. Get an order of magnitude feel for needed processing power. The measurement of the required force needed will be one of the greatest necessities for the design and frequency of the micro controller.

, With the help of the information obtained by the previous steps, you now got an idea about what exactly is your requirement, weather you need 8 bits,16 bits or 32-bit ARM core. However, do not forget to keep the future requirements in mind. Your requirement may be of 8-bit micro controller now but you can also use a 16-bit micro controller for more features or even for the ease of use. Other way round, you may select a 16-bit part now but later you may find 32-bit ARM part works better. This step is simply for giving an engineer the right direction as experimenting will make you better.

, Flash and RAM are two very critical components of any micro controllers. Make sure how much memory do you need otherwise you will run out of program space or variable space. Using the software architecture and the communication peripherals included in the application, you can estimate how much flash and RAM will be required for the application. You can always start with more and then later move to a more constrained part within the same chip family.

, You can start with looking for a micro controller once you have jot down all the aspects of your requirement. Talk with the Field Application Engineer about your application and requirements so that they can also direct you to a new part that meets your requirement.


The next best place to start is with a silicon provider that you are already familiar. Most silicon providers have a search engine that allows you to enter your peripheral sets, I/O and power requirements and it will narrow down the list of parts that match the criteria. From that list then you can move forward towards selecting a micro controller.

, At this point, you will come across many potential candidates to select. Therefore, this is the best time to examine the power requirements and cost of the part. Price of the part is more critical in case of highly specialized or high-end processing machine. Do not forget about this key element. In addition, if the part does not meet your requirement the keep scrolling through the list until you have got the one you looking for.

, Next is the step of checking the availability of that part. Some of the things to keep in mind are what the lead times for the part? Are they available in stock at multiple distributors or is there 6 – 12 week lead-time? What are your requirements for availability? You do not want to get stick with a large order and have to wait three months to be able to fill it.


Then there is a question of how new the part is and whether it will be around for the duration of your product life cycle. If your product will be around for 10 years then you need to find a part that the manufacturer guarantees continuous production in 10 years.

, One of the best parts of selecting a new micro controller is finding a development kit to play with and learn the inner working of the controller. Once you have selected the required part then you should surely research about what development kits are available. If a development kit is not available then the selected part is most likely not a good choice and you should go back a few steps and find a better part. Another part may be a better choice.

, The selection of the development kit nearly solidifies the choice of micro controller. The last thing that needs your attentions is to examine the compiler and tools that are available. Most micro controllers have a number of choices for compilers, example code and debugging tools. Therefore, it is important to make sure that all the necessary tools are available for the part because without the right tools, the development process could become tedious and expensive.

, Usually the development kit arrives long before the first prototype hardware. Take advantage by building up test circuits and interfacing them to the micro controller. Choose high-risk parts and get them working on the development kit. It may be that you discover the part you thought would work great has some unforeseen issue and that would force to select a different micro controller. In any event, early experimentation will ensure that you made the right choice.

Choose the proper thermal paste.,
Clean the CPU and heat sink surfaces.,
Sand the heat sink and processor surfaces if necessary.,
Place a tiny drop of thermal paste to the center of the cooler base.,
Attach the heat sink to the processor.,
Avoid removing the heat sink after installing it.,
Reconnect the fan to the motherboard.,
Boot the system.,
Apply paste to the base of the cooler.,
Install the heat sink.,
Reconnect the fan to the motherboard.,
Boot the system altogether.",How to Apply Thermal Paste," Most of the basic thermal grease compounds contain silicone and zinc oxide, while more expensive compounds contain excellent heat conductors such as silver or ceramic. The advantage to the silver or ceramic thermal grease is that you will have a more efficient heat transmission. However, the basic thermal grease will sufficiently fit the needs of most people.


If you are planning on overclocking your computer, try to get thermal paste comprised mainly of silver, copper, and gold. These are the most conducive metals that thermal paste can be made of.;
, Wipe the surface lightly with a cotton ball or cotton swab dampened with isopropyl alcohol. The higher the percentage of alcohol the better. 70 percent is good but 90 percent is better if it can be found.

, Ideally, the two touching surfaces will be perfectly flat, which would completely eliminate the need for thermal paste. If your heat sink base is rough, you can wet-sand it down and polish it to make it smoother. This isn’t always necessary, unless you are aiming for the ultimate cooling performance.


Thermal paste is designed to fill in the gaps and imperfections on the surfaces that you are joining. Since modern production techniques cannot make surfaces without imperfections, thermal paste will always be necessary.

, The bead of paste should be smaller than a BB or a grain of rice. If you’ve read that it should be “pea-sized”, that is far too much paste, and you will end up with paste on your motherboard.There is no need to spread the paste for circular coolers, as the pressure of being applied will spread it evenly across the surface.

, Install the heat sink with even pressure from all sides, and the bead that you placed on the surface will spread over the entire contact surface. This will create a thin, even layer that will fill any gaps but avoid excess build up.


As heat is applied, the paste will become thinner and spread more towards the edges. This is why using a small amount of paste is important, as a little goes a long way.

, It can be difficult to check if your paste has been applied correctly. If you break the seal that is created when you install the heat sink, you will need to restart the process, first cleaning off the old paste and then reapplying it.

, The CPU fan wire should be plugged in the CPU fan socket because it mostly has the PWM function which allows the computer to adjust the fan speed automatically without changing voltage.

, Check that the fan is spinning. Enter the BIOS by pressing F1 or Del key during POST. Check if the temperature is normal, CPU temperature should be below 40 degree Celsius when idle, same for GPU.

, Applying paste to a square cooler is a bit more challenging than a round one, because simply placing a dot and applying pressure will not result in full coverage. There are varying approaches that people claim allegiances to, so we’ll cover a few of the more popular ones:


The lines method – Place two thin lines of thermal compound on the base of the cooler. The lines should be parallel and spaced so that they are each placed a third of the width of the processor. The lines themselves should also be about a third of the processor’s width in length.
The cross method – This is very similar to the previous method, but the lines are crossed in an “X” pattern instead of parallel. The length and thickness of the lines should be the same as the previous method.
The spread method – This is one of the most popular and effective methods, but takes a little more effort. Place a small amount of thermal paste onto the base of the cooler. Using a plastic finger protector or a plastic bag, use your finger to spread the paste evenly across the surface. Make sure to cover the entire surface that will be in contact with the processor, and ensure that you do not apply the paste too thick. In most cases, the paste should barely hide the metal underneath., If you are using either of the line methods, apply even pressure to the heat sink as you install it to ensure that the paste covers the entire surface. If you are using the spread method, you MUST install the heat sink at a slight angle to prevent bubbles from forming. This is because the paste is usually spread too thin to compensate for bubbles after pressure is applied.

, The CPU fan wire should be plugged in the CPU fan socket because it mostly has the PWM function which allows the computer to adjust the fan speed automatically without changing voltage.

, Check that the fan is spinning. Enter the BIOS by pressing F1 or Del key during POST. Check if the temperature is normal, CPU temperature should be below 40 degree Celsius when idle, same for GPU.

If the liquid touches the circuits on the laptop while they are active, your laptop will most likely short out, so time is very much of the essence.To disconnect the laptop from a power source, simply remove the charger cable from the laptop. It's typically on the left or right side of the laptop's housing.;
, This will both minimize your laptop's exposure to more liquid and decrease the risk of electrical shock.

, You can typically do this by turning your laptop upside-down, sliding a panel off of the bottom of the laptop, and gently tugging on the battery.


This step is not possible on a MacBook without first unscrewing the bottom of the laptop from the rest of the housing.

, This includes the following items:


USB devices (flash drives, wireless adapters, chargers, etc)
Memory cards
Controllers (e.g., your mouse)
The laptop charger

, This is where you'll place your laptop for the next couple of days, so make sure you choose a warm, dry, unobtrusive area.

, Depending on your laptop's flexibility, doing so will result in anything from a tent-shaped laptop to a completely flat one.

, Places to wipe include the fronts and backs of the screen, the laptop's housing, and the keyboard.


Make sure your laptop is still partially facing down while you do this so that any excess liquid continues to drain.

, Grounding yourself will remove any static electricity from your clothing or body. Static electricity can easily kill circuitry, so performing this step before touching the RAM cards or the hard drive is crucial.

, If you're uncomfortable or unfamiliar with the notion of removing RAM, your computer's hard drive, and other detachable internal components, consider taking your laptop into a professional repair service instead.


You can typically find manuals for your specific computer that detail hardware replacement and removal online. Simply search for your computer's make and model number followed by ""RAM removal"" (or whichever component you need to remove).
For a MacBook, you'll first have to unscrew each of the ten screws holding the base of the housing together.

, To do this, you will need a microfiber cloth (or an otherwise lint-free rag).


If there is excess water in your laptop's internal areas, first drain it.
Be extremely gentle while doing this.

, Use a lint-free cloth to gently buff out any non-water stains, or use compressed air to blow away dust, grit, and other non-liquid residue.

, You'll want to leave it alone for at least one day.Consider storing your laptop in a dry, warm place. For example, a dehumidifier may improve drying time.
Never use a hair dryer to speed up your laptop's drying process, as a hair dryer's heat concentration is intense enough to harm your laptop's internal parts.

, If it doesn't boot up or you notice distortion in the sound or display, you'll need to take your laptop to a professional repair service (e.g., a Best Buy tech department).

, Even if your laptop is up and running, you may have to contend with sticky or greasy substance left over. You can remove this residue by gently buffing the afflicted area with a damp, lint-free cloth like you used earlier when drying the laptop.

Consider purchasing software instead.,
Adjust your brightness and contrast.,
Set your gamma.,

Schedule your next calibration.",How to Calibrate Your Monitor," Make sure that no reflections, glare or strong, direct light reaches your screen. The room doesn't have to be dark, but it should be dim enough that ambient light shouldn't interfere with how you see what's on the screen. If your screen has visible dirt or smears, clean it thoroughly before you continue.


If you'll be doing image editing or other color-sensitive work, it's also important that the light levels do not change over the course of the day or between work sessions.;
, If you are using an LCD monitor, check the manual or box for the ""native"" resolution or refer to the list below. For all other types of monitor, choose the highest resolution that lets you comfortably read text and view small images.


Typical LCD monitors have the following native resolutions, according to size: 19 inch (48.3 cm): 1280 x 1024; 20 inch (50.8 cm): 1600 x 1200; 22 inch (55.9 cm): 1680 x 1050; 24 inch (61 cm): 1900 x 1200., Set your monitor to ""millions of colors,"" or if the more ""nuts and bolts"" option is available, to a high color depth. Color depth is the number of bits used to determine the color of each pixel, or the number of bits used to determine each color component of the pixel (Red, Green, and Blue).These two alternate definitions make terminology a little confusing: 8-bit, 24-bit, and ""millions of colors"" are all equivalent on a modern display. 16-bit or ""thousands"" is noticeably worse but uses less video card memory, while older 8-bit or ""256 color"" displays are poor options for modern displays. 30-bit and up displays offer additional improvements that most users won't notice.The maximum color depth is constrained by your monitor, graphics card, and operating system. You'll need to look at the specifications for each one of these in order to improve.
In Windows, right-click your desktop and select Graphic Properties or Screen Resolution. In Windows 7, you'll need to then visit Adapter → List All Modes.On Mac, open System Preferences, then select Displays. Many modern Mac setups do not have these options listed, but these typically run on 24-bit color depth anyway.

, Skip this step unless you plan to use your computer for editing images that will then be printed. This step may also not be useful unless you have a high-quality printer and glossy photo paper.


Ideally, print several photos on one page, including black & white, daylight color, and low-light color images, and subjects with several natural skin tones.
Let the ink dry away from direct sunlight to set the colors correctly.

, If you've sped through the steps above, make sure your monitor has been on for at least 30 minutes before beginning the calibration, especially if it's a CRT display.This will ensure that your computer has reached its typical working temperature, which can affect color display.


If you aren't using your computer, set the display sleep time to later to prevent the monitor from turning off during the wait.

, Look below this step to find your computer's built-in walk through, or use an online tool such as Photo Friday or displaycalibration.com. Once you've selected a tool, you may follow the onscreen instructions, and/or use the steps below to help guide you.


On a Windows computer, click the Start button, then Control Panel. Search for ""Calibrate display"" in the control panel search bar and click ""Calibrate display color."" You may need to enter an administrator password.On a Mac, open System Preferences, then select Displays → the Color tab → Calibrate.... If you don't see this, search for ""Calibrate"" in the System Preferences search bar.

, Although unnecessary for most users, professional graphics designers and digital photographers may appreciate professional-level calibration software. Look for one with an accompanying colorimeter, and make sure it gives you the option to select gamma and color temperature.Some versions of Photoshop come with ""Adobe Gamma"" calibration software, but this is an out-of-date program only intended for CRT monitors and older operating systems.

, They are located either on the front of your monitor or on-screen in your calibration controls. Typically, the calibration guide will show you two or three grey-scale shapes to help you adjust this. Follow the instructions on screen. For best results, the image or images on screen should include at least four colors: black, dark grey, light grey, and white.


Squinting and sitting back from the monitor may help during fine adjustments.
Many laptops do not have contrast controls.

, When your computer is instructed to make a pixel brighter, it increases the voltage to the monitor. However, the relationship between voltage and brightness is complex, and must be adjusted to a linear pattern using a ""gamma correction,"" named for one of the mathematical terms involved. Some calibration settings allow you to adjust a slider to suit your preferences, but there are only two settings commonly used:A gamma of 2.2 is the most common standard for monitors. This will let you see images and videos in the intended brightness range, and design web visuals as they will appear to other internet users.
A gamma of 1.8 will display images closer to how they will appear after printing. It may also make it easier to notice shadows during detailed image editing work.
Note that image-editing software will often adjust gamma to this value on its own., Also called color temperature, this determines the overall color tint of your screen. The most common standard for computer monitors is D65 (or 6500), a slightly bluish tint. This gives a brighter effect familiar to people who use computers or television. Some graphics professionals who focus on printed work prefer D50 (or 5000), a neutral or slightly yellow tint that better imitates printed materials and daylight.Some monitors can adjust this directly on the built-in monitor buttons. Try this if there is no white point or color temperature setting in your color calibration guide. Use ""warm"" if no exact numbers are available., Calibrate your monitor every two to four weeks to keep the display suited to your needs. Professionals may want to calibrate before each important project.

The division into three is recommended but you can divide it more if wished.

, Cross one color string over the other string. Then cross it under the third. Pull the thread through the loop and push the knot up toward the top knot.

,, Keep the headphone wire in the middle so it begins to be consumed by the string.

, Choose which earpiece (left or right) will be finished off with the pattern and tie a double knot toward the ear piece to secure it into place.


Trim off any loose string so you don’t get string in your ear when you use your headphones.







,


Tie an initial double knot and then begin to weave the three strings together with the headphone wire in the middle.
Cut and tie the other end the same way as you did the first end. Remove any loose strings.

Go to the Linksys router's settings.,
Navigate to the Port Forwarding section.,
Set your hardware in the router's DMZ.",How to Adjust Nat Settings on Linksys Router," Make sure your router is connected and open your preferred Internet browser. Type in the correct address or command for your particular Linksys router. On most Linksys routers, this will be an IP address and usually 192.168.1.1, although it could also be just the word 'router' or another address. If 192.168.1.1 doesn't work, check the instructions that came with your router or the router itself, there is usually a sticker with that information and the default password for your router. For Linksys, the Linksys default username is admin, and the default password is password.;
, After you login, look for the phrase ""Port Forwarding"" on the left hand side of the screen. Click on it and scroll through the settings here. There are a few things to change here to get an open NAT setting, which is the type of NAT needed for local services such as Xbox Live to work the best. Find the box labeled UPnP and enable it. This works much the same way as Windows Plug and Play but on a network level, and allows your router to work out what it will take for a new item on your network to correctly interface with the Internet. For many users, this is enough to adjust their NAT settings to open.


Find your computers IP address. If you are using port forwarding to open up the NAT settings, you will need your computer's IP address as well as the ports that need to be opened. To find your computer's IP, go to the Windows Start Menu and type 'cmd.exe' into the run box without the quotes. When the command utility opens up, type in ipconfig. This will give you information on your computer and what it's IP address is. The vast majority of the time, your IP address when connected through the router will share the first three number groups as the router itself. For example, on a Linksys router your computer would have an IP of 192.168.1.x, with x being the unique digit.

, If enabling UPnP doesn't solve your NAT issues, another option is to set your computer, gaming console, or cell phone to bypass the router's safety features. This will allow your hardware to connect directly to the Internet, but will make it vulnerable to outside sources. Usually, this is only recommended for gaming consoles. If you do this for your main computer, remember to remove the computer from the DMZ when you are done using the service that was restricted by the Linksys NAT settings.

Find your router’s IP address.,
Press and hold the “Reset” button on the router for 15 seconds to restore it to factory settings.",How to Access a U Verse Router," To access the router's settings, you will need to use a computer (or mobile device with a web browser) connected to the router's network. Start by determining the name and password of the U-verse Wi-Fi access point.


The name of the Wi-Fi access point is printed next to “Wi-Fi Network Name”. It begins with either “ATT” or “2WIRE”.The password is directly below the network name, next to “Wi-Fi Password”.;
, The process is different depending on the type of computer you are using.


Mac: Click the Airport (Wi-Fi) icon in the menu bar, then choose the Wi-Fi Network Name from the side of your router.When prompted, enter the Wi-Fi password.
Windows: Click the Wi-Fi icon at the bottom right corner of the screen, then select the Wi-Fi Network Name from the list. Enter the Wi-Fi password when prompted.
If you can’t connect to Wi-Fi, run an Ethernet cable from your computer’s networking port to the LAN port on the router. The computer should then automatically connect to the network.

, Any browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox) will do.

, This will load the router's web interface.Depending on your router model, you may arrive at a password screen, or you may be brought to a page with a list of settings.


If the configuration page does not load, see these troubleshooting tips.

, Most U-verse routers do not have a standard router password.If your model does display a page that asks for a system password, look on the side of the router for a sticker that contains the text “System Password” (NOT the Wi-Fi password), and enter that.


If a system password is required yet there is no “system password” printed on your router, try leaving the field blank.
If none of the passwords work, call AT&T for support or reset the router back to its original factory settings., Now that you have arrived at the web interface, you have full access to your router. The layout of the settings screens varies depending on your model of U-verse router.

, If you are unable to connect to your U-verse router over Wi-Fi or Ethernet, the device may need to be restarted. After waiting thirty seconds, plug the router back in and give it time to start up, then try to connect.

, If you are unable to pull up the router’s web interface by plugging in the default address (http://192.168.1.254), the default address may have been inadvertently changed.


Windows: Press ⊞ Win+R, type cmd and press ↵ Enter. Type ipconfig and press ↵ Enter. The address next to Default Gateway is the address you should use to connect to the router.
Mac: Open the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences"". Click ""Network"", then select your active network connection. The ""Router"" address entry indicates the address of your router.

, If the login information is not working or the connection times out, resetting the router could fix the problem. You may need to use the end of a paperclip to press the button, as it’s quite small.

Resetting the router will erase any configuration changes you have made.The wireless network name and password will change back to the one printed on the router's label.
Call AT&T for help. If you’re still not able to access your router, you may be experiencing a hardware issue. Call technical support for additional troubleshooting tips.

Consult your router's manual for more information about the default username and password.
If you did change your router's password and/or username but you don't remember what it is, you can reset your router to restore the factory settings.

, Each router's page will differ slightly, but you can usually find the following information on every router's page:


Settings - View your router's settings, from the password and the current connection strength to the type of security your connection uses.

SSID - Your network's name. This is the name that you and others see when connecting to the Wi-Fi.

Connected Devices - View a list of any devices connected to your network, as well as recently connected devices.

Parental Controls - Review your router's parental settings, such as time limits for devices or blocked sites.

, Editing the ""SSID"" field will change the name of the wireless network. Keep in mind that doing this will cause any connected devices to lose the connection, and you'll have to reconnect them to the newly-named network.

You'll usually have to open your router's Settings page to do this.

, Most modern routers support multiple kinds of wireless encryption. Use WPA2 to ensure that your network key will remain secure.


If you change the password, use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid basing your password on personal information (e.g., your date of birth).

, You will use this the next time you access the router. The default name and password for your router is very unsecure, as anyone that is connected to your network can easily enter the settings and compromise the security of your network.

Run a Speed Test.,
Run Ping Test.,
Find your IP address.",How to Test Network and Internet Latency (Lag) in Microsoft Windows1," A variety of websites provide access to internet testing tools, your internet service provider (ISP) likely has some tools on their portal, but two popular testing sites are from Speakeasyand DSLReports. The following steps use the tools available from DSLreports, as they provide a comprehensive set of diagnostic tools.


Navigate to www.dslreports.com.
Select Tools from the top toolbar menu.;
, If other users are on your home network, the speed test report may be impacted by the shared use of network resources.


Speak with the other users of your network. Ask them to get off the network until you have completed testing for connectivity issues.
If you are experiencing problems with your connectivity, you may want to connect your computer directly to your internet modem with an ethernet cable to run these tests, instead of via your wireless network, to further isolate the problem.

, Speed test will tell you the download and upload speed you are actually getting between your computer and the test site, which you can compare to the speed you have contracted for with your ISP.


Click on the start button. On the right side of the Speed Test box there is a start button, this will start the speed test.
Select the connection type. On the test page, select the type of connection you have from the list of Gigabit/Fiber, Cable, DSL, Satellite, WISP, or other.
Run the test. The test will run, testing download speed, upload speed and reporting latency.

, The ping test checks the time it takes a packet of data to travel from your computer, to a remote server and back to your computer. This particular test will test multiple servers simultaneously reporting back to you an overall grade of the performance. Normal latency varies by the type of connection from 5 - 40ms for cable modem, 10 - 70ms for DSL, 100 to 220ms for dial-up and 200 - 600 for cellular. The distance to the remote server also adds to latency, you can estimate an additional 1ms in latency for every 60 miles (100km) the data travels.

 From the tools page, select Start, in the Ping Test (Real Time) box. This will advance you to a page indicating that all of the listed servers will be ping-ed twice per second and every thirty (30) seconds a report on your connection from A to F will be provided.
Click Start. A radar plot will show along with a chart of the various server locations, their IP address and the real time statistics about the connection latency.
View the report. As the test is running, your connection’s grade will appear on the left column, with a new grade every 30 seconds. When the test is complete you will be given the option to test again or share your results.

, While not an actual test the “What is my IP address” tool reports the public IP address where your computer is can be found. This is not the actual IP address of your computer because of the proxy services your router provides. This tool also lists the common IP addresses of the components of your network, which is helpful if you need use the Windows utilities to help find the source of your network or internet latency.


Run What is my IP address. Click start within the What is my IP address box. This will advance you to a page that displays your IP address as well as any other addresses relevant to your computer.
Record your IP address. If you plan on doing additional diagnostic tests on your network / internet connection write down the IP address displayed, as well as any of the common IP addresses from the list below.

"
"
Access the Command Line Prompt.,
Run Ping Loopback test.,
Run Ping to a remote server.,
Run Traceroute test.",How to Test Network and Internet Latency (Lag) in Microsoft Windows2," You can enter the commands for testing network and internet latency directly at the command line.


Click on Start, select Run.
Type cmd, and press OK. This will launch the command line window where you can simply type the test commands to execute them. You can also search for cmd.exe in the windows search

, The Ping loopback test will test your computer’s connection to verify that there are no local hardware problems causing the network or internet latency issue.


Type “Ping 127.0.0.1 -n 20”. This IP address is the same for nearly all built in network connections, the “-n 20” extension will send 20 packets of data before terminating the test. If you forget to type “-n 20” you can cancel the test by entering Ctrl+C.
View the statistics. The time it took for the packet of data to travel locally should be less than 5ms and there should be zero packet loss.

, Now that you have verified that your local port is working, you can Ping remote servers to test the latency. Again, normal latency varies by the type of connection from 5 - 40ms for cable modem, 10 - 70ms for DSL, 100 to 220ms for dial-up and 200 - 600 for cellular. The distance to the remote server also adds to latency, you can estimate an additional 1ms in latency for every 60 miles (100km) the data travels.

View the report. As the test pings the remote address, it will report back the results, the final number after the “time = “ is the time it took, in milliseconds, for the packet to travel to the remote site and back to your computer. Note: the “-n 20” extension works with this command, as does the “Ctrl+C” should you forget to enter it.

, The traceroute test will show the path that data travels from your computer to the remote server and any delay in that path. This can be helpful in determining the source of network or internet delays.


Type “tracert” followed by the IP address or site URL you wish to route and hit enter.
View the results. As the test traces the path it will display each address along the way and the time it took for a data packet to travel and acknowledge receipt for each “hop” along the path. The more “hops” or other devices the data packet needs to route through, the more delay you will experience.

Unroll the required length of network cable and add a little extra wire, just in case.,
Carefully remove the outer jacket of the cable.,
Inspect the newly revealed wires for any cuts or scrapes that expose the copper wire inside.,
Untwist the pairs so they will lay flat between your fingers.,
Arrange the wires based on the wiring specifications you are following.,
You can also use the mnemonic 1-2-3-6/3-6-1-2 to remember which wires are switched.

,
Press all the wires flat and parallel between your thumb and forefinger.,
Keep the wires flat and in order as you push them into the RJ-45 plug with the flat surface of the plug on top.,
Place the wired plug into the crimping tool.,
Repeat all of the above steps with the other end of the cable.,
Test the cable to ensure that it will function in the field.",How to Make a Network Cable," If a boot is to be fitted, do so before stripping away the sleeve and ensure the boot faces the correct way.;
, Be careful when stripping the jacket as to not nick or cut the internal wiring. One good way to do this is to cut lengthwise with snips or a knife along the side of the cable, away from yourself, about an inch toward the open end. This reduces the risk of nicking the wires' insulation. Locate the string inside with the wires, or if no string is found, use the wires themselves to unzip the sheath of the cable by holding the sheath in one hand and pulling sideways with the string or wire. Cut away the unzipped sheath and cut the twisted pairs about 1 1/4"" (30 mm). You will notice 8 wires twisted in 4 pairs. Each pair will have one wire of a certain color and another wire that is white with a colored stripe matching its partner (this wire is called a tracer).

, If you have breached the protective sheath of any wire, you will need to cut the entire segment of wires off and start over at step one. Exposed copper wire will lead to cross-talk, poor performance or no connectivity at all. It is important that the jacket for all network cables remains intact.

, The white piece of thread can be cut off even with the jacket and disposed (see Warnings). For easier handling, cut the wires so that they are 3/4"" (19 mm) long from the base of the jacket and even in length.

, There are two methods set by the TIA, 568A and 568B. Which one you use will depend on what is being connected. A straight-through cable is used to connect two different-layer devices (e.g. a hub and a PC). Two like devices normally require a cross-over cable. The difference between the two is that a straight-through cable has both ends wired identically with 568B, while a cross-over cable has one end wired 568A and the other end wired 568B.For our demonstration in the following steps, we will use 568B, but the instructions can easily be adapted to 568A.


568B - Put the wires in the following order, from left to right:

white orange
orange
white green
blue
white blue
green
white brown
brown


568A - from left to right:

white/green
green
white/orange
blue
white/blue
orange
white/brown
brown



,, Verify the colors have remained in the correct order. Cut the top of the wires even with one another so that they are 1/2"" (12.5 mm) long from the base of the jacket, as the jacket needs to go into the 8P8C connector by about 1/8"", meaning that you only have a 1/2"" of room for the individual cables. Leaving more than 1/2"" untwisted can jeopardize connectivity and quality. Ensure that the cut leaves the wires even and clean; failure to do so may cause the wire not to make contact inside the jack and could lead to wrongly guided cores inside the plug.

, The white/orange wire should be on the left if you're looking down at the jack. You can tell if all the wires made it into the jack and maintain their positions by looking head-on at the plug. You should be able to see a wire located in each hole, as seen at the bottom right. You may have to use a little effort to push the pairs firmly into the plug. The cabling jacket should also enter the rear of the jack about 1/4"" (6 mm) to help secure the cable once the plug is crimped. You may need to stretch the sleeve to the proper length. Verify that the sequence is still correct before crimping.

, Give the handle a firm squeeze. You should hear a ratcheting noise as you continue. Once you have completed the crimp, the handle will reset to the open position. To ensure all pins are set, some prefer to double-crimp by repeating this step.

, The way you wire the other end (568A or 568B) will depend on whether you're making a straight-through, rollover, or cross-over cable (see Tips).

, Mis-wired and incomplete network cables could lead to headaches down the road. In addition, with power-over-Ethernet (PoE) making its way into the marketplace, crossed wire pairs could lead to physical damage of computers or phone system equipment, making it even more crucial that the pairs are in the correct order. A simple cable tester can quickly verify that information for you. Should you not have a network cable tester on hand, simply test connectivity pin to pin.

Be very careful with email attachments.,
Make sure your passwords are strong and unique.,
Try to avoid public Wi-Fi spots.,
Be vary wary of programs downloaded online.",How to Detect a Remote Access to My Computer," Many modern computers are set to install system updates automatically, usually at night when the computer is not being used. If your computer appears to turn on without your input when you're not using it, it is likely waking from Sleep mode to install updates.


The chances of your specific computer being remotely accessed, while not impossible, are very low. You can take steps to help prevent intrusions.;
, If your mouse is moving without your control, programs are being opened in front of your eyes, or files are actively being deleted, you may have an intruder. If you have an active intrusion, your first step should be to power down your computer immediately and remove any Ethernet cables.


Slow internet or unfamiliar programs are not necessarily the result of someone gaining remote access to your computer.
Many programs that update automatically will appear or generate pop-ups during the update process.

, If you suspect an intrusion, you'll need to disconnect from the internet immediately. You'll want to completely disconnect from the internet and your network, to prevent any further access and to prevent any other machines on your network from getting infected.


Unplug any Ethernet cables connected to your computer, and disable any wireless connections.

, These utilities can help you determine what is currently running on your computer.


Windows - Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Esc.
Mac - You can find the Activity Monitor in the Utilities folder in your Applications directory.

, Look for the following programs in your list of currently-running programs, as well as any programs that look unfamiliar or suspicious. These programs are popular remote access programs that may have been installed without your permission:


VNC, RealVNC, TightVNC, UltraVNC, LogMeIn, GoToMyPC, and TeamViewer
Look for any programs that seem suspicious or that you don't recognize either. You can perform a web search for the process name if you aren't sure what a program is.

, You'll see this in the Task Manager or the Activity Monitor. While high CPU usage is common, and is not indicative of an attack, high CPU usage while you're not using your computer could indicate that processes are running in the background, which you may have not authorized. Be aware that high CPU usage could just be a program updating or a torrent downloading in the background that you forgot about.

, You should have an active antivirus program already installed, even if it's just Windows Defender. Open your antivirus and run a scan of your entire system. This scan may take an hour or so to complete.


If you don't have an antivirus, download an installer on another computer and transfer it to your computer via USB. Install the antivirus and then run a scan with it.

, If your antivirus finds malicious software on your computer, make sure that you quarantine it using the methods provided by the anti-virus. This will prevent these malicious programs from continuing to affect your computer.

, This is a secondary scanner that will find things that your antivirus may have missed. You can download it for free from malwarebytes.org.


Since your computer is currently disconnected from the internet, you'll need to download the installer on another computer and transfer it to your computer via USB drive.

, The scan will likely take about half an hour to complete. Anti-Malware will look for intrusive programs that may be controlling your computer.

, If Anti-Malware detects any items during the scan, quarantining them will prevent them from affecting your system anymore.

, You can get this program for free from malwarebytes.org/antirootkit/. This will detect and remove ""rootkits,"" which are malicious programs that exist deep in your system files. The program will scan your computer, which may take a while to complete., If your antivirus and/or Anti-Malware found malicious programs, you may have successfully removed the infection, but you'll need to keep a close eye on your computer to ensure that the infection hasn't remained hidden.

, If your computer was compromised, then there’s a possibility that all of your passwords have been recorded with a keylogger. If you’re sure the infection is gone, change the passwords for all of your various accounts. You should avoid using the same password for multiple services.

, After changing your passwords, go through each account and log off completely. Make sure that you log out of any device that is currently using the account. This will ensure that your new passwords will take effect and others will not be able to use the old ones.

, If you're still experiencing intrusions, or are concerned that you may still be infected, the only way to be sure is to completely wipe your system and reinstall your operating system. You'll need to back up any important data first, as everything will be deleted and reset.


When backing up any data from an infected machine, make sure to scan each file before backing it up. There's always a chance that reintroducing an old file can lead to a re-infection.
See Wipe Clean a Computer and Start Over for instructions on formatting your Windows or Mac computer and reinstalling the operating system.

, An up-to-date antivirus program will detect most attacks before they can happen. Windows comes with a program called Windows Defender that is a competent antivirus that updates automatically and works in the background. There are also several free programs available, such as BitDefender, avast!, and AVG. You only need one antivirus program installed.


See Turn on Windows Defender for instructions on enabling Windows Defender on your Windows computer.
See Install an Antivirus for instructions on installing an antivirus program if you don't want to use Defender. Windows Defender will automatically deactivate if you install another antivirus program.

, If you're not running a web server or running some other program that requires remote access to your computer, there is no reason to have any ports open. Most programs that require ports will use UPnP, which will open ports as necessary and then close them again when the program isn't in use. Keeping ports open indefinitely will leave your network open to intrusions.


See Set Up Port Forwarding on a Router and ensure that none of your ports are open unless necessary for a server you are running.

, Email attachments are one of the most common ways for viruses and malware to get onto your system. Only open attachments from trusted senders, and even then, make sure that the person intended to send you the attachment. If one of your contacts has been infected with a virus, they may send out attachments with the virus without knowing it.

, Each and every service or program you use that is password-protected should have a unique and difficult password. This will ensure that a hacker cannot use the password from one hacked service to access another. See Manage Your Passwords for instructions on using a password manager to make things easier for you.

, Public Wi-Fi spots are risky because you have zero control over the network. You can't know if someone else using the spot is monitoring traffic to and from your computer. By doing this, they could gain access to your open browser session or worse. You can mitigate this risk by using a VPN whenever you are connected to a public Wi-Fi spot, which will encrypt your transfers.


See Configure a VPN for instructions on setting up a connection to a VPN service.

, Many ""free"" programs that you find online come with extra software that you likely did not want. Pay close attention during the installation process to ensure that you decline any additional ""offers."" Avoid downloading pirated software, as this is a common way for viruses to infect your system."

Check your printer.,
Examine your network and needs.",How to Set up Your Laptop to Print Wirelessly1," If you want to print wirelessly from your laptop, you have two basic options when it comes to installing a printer: You can either install a network printer that connects directly to your home network, or you can share a printer that is connected to another computer on your network. The option you choose will likely be dictated by the connections that your printer supports, as well as your home network setup.


Most modern printers will connect to your home's wireless network. Some network printers can only connect via Ethernet cable. Older printers or budget printers will likely need to be connected to a computer via USB and then shared on the network.

, Printers that are connected directly to the network can typically be easily accessed by both Windows and Mac laptops. Printers that are connected to a computer and then shared on the network are easily accessed by computers running the same operating system family (Windows-to-Windows or Mac-to-Mac), but get a little trickier when sharing across operating systems. Since it requires fairly different steps, click here for instructions on sharing a printer across operating systems.


Installing the printer directly to the network is almost always the better choice if possible. Not only does it allow for easier connectivity, but it also means that the printer is constantly available. If you are sharing a printer that's connected to another computer, that computer will need to be turned on in order to access the printer.

Connect to the Internet with one device at a time.

,
Find yourself a router that will fit your specific needs, the things to look for are: Wired/wireless, wireless type (such as G or N), quality, and once again price!,
Once you have a router, connect it to your modem.,
Once your router is set up, connect to the network from a computer, ideally a close computer close to the router.,
Once you can find the network, configure it, often the router you purchase will come with an installation CD.,
Once you have finished the installation CD, proceed to configure your network.,
Once you have logged into the router home page you can proceed to change the settings, such as a password for your network, as well as changing the login information to the router homepage.,
Add the rest of your devices to the network.,
To connect any devices with a wire, simply plug the Ethernet cable from the output jack of the router into your device, no passwords will be required for a wired connection.

",How to Set Up a Wired or Wireless Home Network," Do some research and look around on whom has the best deals for your specific needs. Things to watch for are: Speed, Usage, and most importantly price!;
, After you set up your ISP, they will usually give you a modem. Modems vary in shapes and sizes, as well as functionality. There are some modems that have wireless routers built in which will make it easy to set up a network because all you will need to do is plug it in. Others will simply have one output jack, which you will then need to connect to your router. Once you get a router from your ISP, the first thing you need to do is figure out what kind you have, I will be using a standard rogers modem for my examples but they will vary depending on your ISP.

, Usually you want a place that is close to the center of your house so you will get the most range covered by the network. You don't want to be walking up to your room with your laptop then realize that you have a weak signal there because your network station is on the other side of your house and in the basement.


A standard Rogers modem is simple, it will have a power jack, a cable jack, and a RJ45 Ethernet jack. Common sense would tell you to connect the power cable to the power jack, a TV cable to the cable jack, and a standard Ethernet cable to the Ethernet jack. (HINT: Connect the modems power cable directly to a wall socket for best performance)

,, As expected the higher quality routers will have a higher price. To find a router you will need to go to some technology store such as Future Shop, Best Buy, or Staples. There are many more and you can even find them in the Electronics department of most department stores. Best advice is to shop around, see if you can find any sales because routers can get pricey!

, Much like the modem routers are all different, they will have different amounts of antennas, different amounts of RJ45 output jacks, and different power/input options. You will need to connect your Ethernet cable from the modem output jack, into the input jack of your router. Then connect the power cable to the router after that. (NOTE: You may need to reset your modem after connecting it to the router, simply unplug and replug the power cable to the modem.)

, You will often see a wireless network show up on your device named after the brand of device you decided to get.

, Use the CD in you computer and follow the on-screen instruction. Usually, the device you get will say the CD is needed on every computer you use with the network, but i have found this is not the case.

, To do this write the address (usually looks like an IP address which will be in the format 0.000.0.0.00 or something like that) that was given in the instructions for your router into the address bar of your browser. This will open your routers home page, you will need to login. To do this, use the default login information given with your router.

, Once you have completed this, you are almost done!

, Simply try to connect to the network and then enter your created password.

Enter your Internet connection information.,
Set your Wireless settings.,
Apply your settings.,
Place your router.,
Connect a device to the network.,
Enter the password.,
Test your connection.",How to Set up a Wireless Network (WiFi) Connection," There are a variety of factors that will determine which router is best for you. These include distance, interference, transfer speed, and security.


One of the most important factors to consider when purchasing a router is the distance between the router and the devices that you are wirelessly connecting. More expensive routers generally have more antennae, which can lead to a more stable connection at further distances.
Another factor to consider is the amount of signal interference. If you have multiple devices that operate on the 2.4 GHz band, such as microwaves and cordless phones, these can interfere with the Wi-Fi signal. Newer routers can operate on the 5 GHz band, which is much less crowded and thus less prone to interference. The drawback is that 5 GHz signals do not travel as far as 2.4 GHz signals.
Transfer speed is a feature to consider. Newer routers claim to be able to transfer data up to 450 Mbps. While this may be helpful when moving data between two computers over a network, it will not increase your general Internet speed, as this is set by your ISP. There are three main router speeds available: 802.11g (54 Mbps) 802.11n (300 Mbps), and 802.11ac (450 Mbps). It is important to note that these speeds are virtually impossible to attain in any environment other than a clean room free of signal interference. Finally, make sure that the router you are purchasing has the latest form of wireless encryption, WPA2. This is pretty much standard in all new routers, but is something to consider if purchasing an older, second-hand router. Older encryption algorithms are much less secure; a WEP key can be cracked in just a few minutes.;
, Once you’ve purchased your router, you will need to connect it to your modem. The router will have a port in the back labeled WAN/WLAN/Internet. Connect this port to the modem using a standard Ethernet cable.

Make sure that the router is properly powered and turned on.

, This step is not always necessary, but can be very useful if you want to set up the wireless router before connecting any wireless devices to it. Connecting a computer through a physical cable will allow you to tinker with the wireless settings without losing your connection to the router.

For optimum efficiency while setting up the router, plug it in next to your computer while you adjust the settings. After you are finished configuring the router, you can move it to where it will normally stay.

, Not every router comes with software to install, but if yours did, then install it on a computer that is connected to the router via an Ethernet cable. Using the bundled software makes setting up a router much more convenient than going in to the configuration menus.


Using the software, designate the name of your wireless network, and the type of security that you want to use. Choose WPA2 for the most secure network. Choose a password and continue.
Most router software will automatically detect your internet settings. This is the information that the router needs to translate your internet connection and transfer it to all of your wirelessly connected devices.

, If your router did not come with any installation software, you will need to connect to the router’s configuration page through your web browser. Open your browser of choice and enter the web address for the router. This is typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address.


You will be asked for a username and password to continue into the router configuration. These are also provided in the documentation that came with your router. Typical defaults are username: admin and Password: password or admin. You can search for your router model’s specific login information at PortFoward.com.

, This includes the IP address and DNS information from your internet service provider. Most routers will fill this section in automatically. If it does not, contact your ISP for the information that you need to enter.

, Most routers will have a Wireless Settings section towards the top of the router’s menu. From this section you can enable or disable the wireless signal, change the network name, and set the encryption.


To set the name of the network, select the SSID field. This is the name that will be displayed on any device that detects your network. If you are living in an area with a lot of public traffic, avoid putting any identifiable information in the SSID, as anyone with a wireless device can see it.
Make sure to set the encryption to the latest version allowed by your router. In most cases, this will be WPA2. WPA2 operates with a single password. You can enter whatever you’d like. Stronger passwords contain upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

, Make sure you click the Apply or Save Changes button in your router’s configuration when you are done changing the settings. The router will process for a moment, and your new settings will take effect.

, In order to get the best possible signal, try to place your router in a central location. Keep in mind that any obstacles such as walls and doors will degrade the signal. If you have multiple floors, you may want to consider multiple routers to ensure that you have the coverage you need.

Remember that it must be physically connected to your modem, so this may limit your options when placing the router.

, Once the router is broadcasting a wireless signal, you can test the connection by scanning for wireless networks using a Wi-Fi device such as another computer, a smartphone, a tablet, etc.


Scan for new networks. In Windows, click the network icon in the System Tray in the lower-right corner of the desktop. Select Connect to a Network and look for your SSID. On a Mac, click the AirPort icon in the menu bar, which looks like 3 curved lines. Select your SSID from the list of available networks.

, If you enabled WPA2 encryption, you will need to enter your password to connect to the network. If you are using a private computer, you can disable the hidden characters on some systems to let you see the password you are typing easier.

, Once you are connected to the network, wait a moment for your IP address to be assigned. Open a web browser and try to connect to a website you don’t normally visit (this will ensure that you aren’t loading the website from memory).

Secure your windows.,
Set up the door sensor.,
Set up the motion sensor.,
Program the control panel.",How to Set Up a Wireless Home Security System," Another zone vulnerable to burglary is windows. Because there are several windows in a house, it could be expensive to place a sensor on every window.

As a substitute, you can put a motion sensor in every room, and then if anybody attempts to get in via the window, an alarm will be transmitted to the control panel.;
, The transmitters inside the door sensor have a restricted range. Ahead of installing any sensors, check out their function from the planned position to be certain they operate appropriately at that distance from the control panel. 

The door sensor comes in 2 pieces – the bigger half is a wireless transmitter & the tinnier piece is a magnet that completes the circuit. As soon as the door unlocks, the circuit is broken & an alarm jingles.

, Motion detectors operate by sensing a transformation in temperature. Ignore pointing them in the direction of windows where the heat of the glass varies throughout cold and hot periods.

Though these sensors employ infrared technology to distinguish body temperature, small pets will not have an effect on their function since the sensors aren’t efficient enough to identify a body weighing less than forty pounds. 
To set up the motion detector, 1st pick a location with a clear sight of the whole room. Utilize the mounting plate as a pattern to mark navigator holes, and affix the sensor to a firm base – employ drywall anchors in empty wallboard.

, After all the sensors are installed, program the control panel. Plug-in the controller into an electric outlet & a phone jack.

Pursue the system’s programming methods cautiously – if you make any error, you may have to do again the whole progression. As soon as the system is programmed, it’ll jingle an alarm if a sensor is triggered, and it’ll call to aware you. 
Turn on the window and door sensors while you move to bed, or depart the home. The water detector, freeze detector and smoke detector are always triggered.
Several systems offer a “keychain” remote control that users can carry and utilize to trigger the system with just a tap of a switch.

Avoid simply turning the monitor without support.","How to Adjust, Tilt, and Turn Your Windows Screen"," This is the fastest way to rotate the way your screen is displayed, but it doesn't work on every system. The quickest way to find out if it works is to simply test. If these shortcuts don't work, move on to the next step:



Ctrl+Alt+← will rotate your display 90° to the left.

Ctrl+Alt+→ will rotate your display 90° to the right.

Ctrl+Alt+↓ will flip your display upside down.

Ctrl+Alt+↑ will return your display to its original rightside-up orientation.;
, In Windows 7 and 8, this can be accessed by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting ""Screen Resolution"". In Windows Vista, select ""Personalization"" and then click the Display Settings option.


In Windows XP, select ""Properties"" and then click the Settings tab.

, Look for the ""Orientation"" drop-down menu. This will let you choose how you would like your display rotated. Select the option you want and then click Apply.


If you do not see an Orientation option, move on to the next step.

, Screen rotation is handled by your video card, and not by Windows. While most modern video cards will add the rotation options to the Windows Screen Resolution window, you may need to open the video card's control panel to access it.You can usually access the control panel by right-clicking on your desktop and clicking on the video card's control panel option. You can also access it by opening the Windows Control Panel, and then selecting it from there.
Select the ""Rotation"" or ""Orientation"" section of the control panel. You can use this to rotate the display to your liking.
If you can't rotate the screen with keyboard shortcuts, don't have the option in your Screen Resolution window, and don't have the option in your video card's control panel or don't have a video card installed, you will not be able to rotate the display.

, There are lots of free calibration images available online. A calibration image will help serve as a reference point as you adjust your monitor's settings.

, Most monitors have an onscreen menu that you can use to adjust the color, brightness, and contrast. If you do not have an onscreen monitor, you may have specific buttons for these functions.

, Monitor calibration images will usually have blocks of bright color. Use these to find a color temperature that seems natural and allows you to distinctly see all of the shades.


6500K is the standard for monitors, though some calibration images will ask you to turn it up to 9300K. Not all monitors will allow you to set a temperature value.

, Use the brightness and contrast controls to adjust how well you can see the dark boxes on the calibration image. You typically want to be able to distinguish the later boxes, but the first few boxes should be indistinguishable. This will ensure that black and dark scenes in movies and games look good.

, Sometimes the screen won't fit exactly right in the confines of your monitor, and you may notice that your mouse goes off the screen a little, or there may be noticeable black bars around the edge. You can adjust this from your monitor menu.


You can shift the screen horizontally and vertically, and you can stretch and squish it. use these controls to make the screen fit your monitor perfectly.

, If you want to permanently rotate your screen (a retro arcade, perhaps?), the easiest way to do so safely is by using a wall mounting kit. These will not fit all screens, so check that the kit is compatible with your monitor's make and model.

, There are several monitors available that you can rotate at the base. This lets you easily rotate the monitor 90°. Note that when you rotate your monitor manually, you will still need to adjust the orientation through your video card settings.


There are stands that you can purchase that may allow you to rotate your existing monitor without too large of an investment. Just make sure that it is compatible with your monitor model.

, Some monitors have stands that allow you to tilt the monitor up or down. This is especially useful if you have an LCD monitor, as they are best viewed from specific angles. You can usually tilt your monitor by gently grabbing both the top and bottom and then pulling the bottom or pushing the top.

, Many monitors are not designed to be turned, especially old CRT monitors. Any time you rotate your monitor, it should be well supported by either a stand or a mount. Using other objects to support the monitor could cause it to be unstable or lead to it overheating.

, Afternoon or evening is generally best, and a weekend is a good choice, because as no one should have anywhere to go, it will leave the environment more stress-free and keep both of you calm.

, This will give you time to calm him down, remind him about anything you think is important (your father's hatred of tattoos, your mother's expensive silver collection, allergies, likes/dislikes, hobbies, etc.), and let him know that you are in this together, and that he shouldn't necessarily feel nervous, although it is normal to feel anxious.

, Point out interesting facts about anyone (except yourself), if the conversation slows down, and keep it light and flowing easily. Try to avoid subjects like long-term goals, plans for the future, and anything that would make your parents or boyfriend uncomfortable, like sex or arguments.

This shows that you're attentive and caring of other people. Strive to remember your boyfriend's friends names, and always use their names when greeting them.For example, when talking to a friend of your boyfriend, don't say, ""How are you doing?"" Instead, say, ""How are you doing, Josh?"" This makes the greeting a little more personal, which will make you a little more likable.
If you struggle to remember names, it can help to repeat someone's name a few times in your head after you first meet them. You can also try relating the name to something familiar, such as by saying to yourself, ""Joshua, like my nephew Joshua."";
, When you're out with your boyfriend's friends, remember they have a group dynamic at play. As you're new to the group, you won't understand everything. There will be inside jokes you will not understand and certain group traditions that do not involve you. Do not get offended if you're pushed slightly to the sidelines during group outings. Instead, embrace the fact the night does not revolve around you.Try to keep a low profile if there is a conversation or joke occurring that you can't follow. Your boyfriend may, for example, talk about drama in the friends group that you don't fully understand. He may also reminisce about memories that do not involve you.
During these times, take a back seat. Smile and nod without trying to follow everything. It's okay to, at times, give your boyfriend some space in a social setting. In fact, this is likely to make your boyfriend's friends like you more. They will appreciate you allowing your boyfriend to have his own social life.

, During social outings, see your boyfriend's friends as new potential friends for you. Try to get to know them a little. Remember, these are important people in your boyfriend's life. You should make a sincere effort to get to know them.Ask questions. People love talking about themselves, so ask your boyfriend's friends about their interests and hobbies. Try questions like, ""So, what do you do for a living?"", ""What's your favorite subject in school?"", and, ""What kind of movies do you like?""
You should also allow them to get to know you. Share information about yourself in return if they ask.

, No one likes to talk to someone who's constantly on their phone. While it's okay to occasionally return a text or check your Facebook, refrain from being on your phone all night. This is especially important if someone is talking to you directly. If you want to check your phone, do so when no one's talking to you or when you're in the bathroom., People tend to dislike those who seek out attention. Many people strive to be the center of attention, especially when trying to make an impression. However, this can easily backfire. Instead of trying to get your boyfriend's friends to notice you, try to allow people to come to you organically.If you're friendly and confident in conversation, people will be drawn to you. It will not be necessary to seek out excessive attention.
When you're with your boyfriend's friends, simply be yourself and stay calm. This will endear you to them far more than trying to impress them.

, You want to make sure you're not forming a wall between your boyfriend and his friends. If you're serious about the relationship, it's a good idea to try to make yourself part of the group. Try to include your boyfriend's friends in outings with your boyfriend on occasion. Respecting and embracing the group dynamic will make you more likable to them.For example, say you're all hanging out together watching TV and you get hungry. Instead of going out for food with your boyfriend, propose everyone go get something to eat together.

, If you don't let your boyfriend have his own space, his friends may come to resent you. You need to strive to respect his right to have his own social group. Avoid giving him a hard time when he's out with his friends. Accept the fact he will sometimes want alone time with his friends and you may not be included.When your boyfriend is out with his friends, avoid texting or calling him excessively. It's okay to send a quick text here and there, but don't expect him to be on the phone with you all night.

, You may not get along with all your boyfriend's friends. Some may rub you the wrong way. You may not have a lot in common with others. However, you should never try to dictate someone's friends group. If you want to be with someone, you need to accept the people they've chosen to have in their life.Avoid overanalyzing his friends. You may find some people from his friends group seem odd or out of place. However, remember that people make friends during different parts of their life.Your boyfriend probably has friends from different eras of his life. While he may not have a lot in common with them now, their past may bond them together. You probably have friends who you share very little common traits with, but you are close nevertheless.

, You don't want to bribe your boyfriend's friends into liking you. However, basic kindness can go a long way. On occasion, go a little above and beyond. Bring cookies to a party or buy a round of drinks at the bar. You can also bring board games over for game night or bring snacks to social gatherings. Small gestures here and there can make you more likable., Watch your body language when interacting with your boyfriend's friends. Something as simple as a tweak in body language can make you more likable to others.Keep your arms uncrossed, as this will make you look more open.
Use an enthusiastic tone when talking.
Maintain eye contact and lean slightly towards the person you're talking to.

, Do not try to be something you're not to endear your boyfriend's friends. People don't need you to be exactly like them to like you. People are drawn to those who are genuine, even if they're different from them.Never pretend to like something you don't. If you don't know anything about, say, a certain genre of movie, don't follow along as if you do. If you don't care for a certain type of music, it's okay to say so.
Remember, be genuine without being argumentative. You can state your opinions or interests without presenting them as superior to other people's opinions and interests.
If you feel nervous and this affects your behavior, then try doing some deep breathing or give yourself a pep talk before you see your boyfriend's friends. Try telling yourself something like, ""You're great! Your friends love you and so will his friends. Just try to relax and be yourself.""

, Stay relaxed when hanging out with your boyfriend's friends. If you get too nervous, you may forget to have fun. Your boyfriend's friends will like you more if you're fun to be around.It's normal to be nervous when meeting your boyfriend's friends. However, remind yourself you're going to a social event. This should be enjoyable.
Do not get too in your head about whether or not people like you. Instead, take a few deep breaths and embrace the fun.

, If you want to be accepted into the friends group, try to merge you and your boyfriend's groups together slightly. When you make plans with your own friends, encourage your boyfriend to bring his friends along. If you encourage everyone to get together, your boyfriend's friends will grow to see you as part of the group. It will also make navigating social situations easier. If everyone is friendly with one another, you and your boyfriend can easily hang out with one another's friends in large social settings without anyone feeling awkward."

, Gain their interests, and don't just talk about yourself to them, talk about them. If it's one thing that almost all guys like loads is when they have attention. The shy guys usually need you to be open but don't get too pushy or involved in their business, it can come off as annoying.

, You know that if you saw him in the hallway with another girl you would get jealous. Well reverse it. Don't try to make him jealous by flirting with another guy, but casually meet a boy and talk to him in front of your brothers friend. He will go nuts wanting to get the same attention. He will want you!

, Don't like what he likes, unless you naturally do, but try to learn more about it. For example, he likes bowling. Next time you see him casually mention something about a bowling party. Who knows what he will say when he knows you like the same things as him.

, You don't want to go too far without his consent. But that doesn't mean you have to tell him that you like his friend, especially if you know he would get mad/angry.

, You will definitely know if he comes over more and always is talking to you.

, Boys understand what its like to have some flaws, but don't be unhealthy about it. They will like you even more if they like you physically. That means stay active!

, Don't burp and be rude because you're not a guy.

, Try to show him that you are good the way you are and that you're not going to change for him. Don't let him. If you want to get energized and change the way you look, or you want to change the way you do some things that's fine but don't do drugs, smoke, or drink just to get his attention or to be with him.

, Some topics are harmless, such as talking about something that happened at school or work, discussing a recent episode of a TV show, or asking about each other’s plans for the summer. However, some topics are inappropriate for you to discuss with your best friend’s boyfriend.

, Your reasons for wanting to talk to your best friend’s boyfriend can also help you to decide if you are behaving in an appropriate manner.For example, if you are seeking out opportunities to talk to your best friend’s boyfriend in the hopes that he will admit that he likes you or that something else will happen, then you are behaving inappropriately.

Consider the situation.,
Keep your feelings a secret if he does not seem interested.,
Determine if pursuing him is worth losing your friend.,
Try to wait if you really like him.",How to Behave When You Like Your Best Friend's Boyfriend2," The way that you handle a crush on your best friend’s boyfriend really depends on the situation, so it is a good idea to think about what has been happening. Has he expressed feelings for you as well? Have you told anyone how you feel? Has anything happened? Think about what is going on before you decide what to do next., If your best friend’s boyfriend does not seem interested in you, then do not pursue him. Chances are that he will reject you and that he will then tell your best friend that you came on to him. This may not only anger her, but it could be the end of your friendship., If he has told you that he likes you as well, then you have the option of pursuing a relationship with him. However, keep in mind that by pursuing a relationship with him, you will likely lose your best friend. Consider whether he is worth that.Keep in mind that you will probably have many crushes over the years, but you may only have one best friend. Think long and hard before you make a decision.

, Another option is to wait and see if he and your friend break up. This is not ideal, but if you really like him and care about your friend as well, then you should let their relationship run its course.If the relationship ends, then you can consider dating him after your friend seems to be over him.


If you want to date him after your friend has broken up with him, then make sure that you talk to her about it as well. She may be fine with the two of you dating, but she may get upset if you try to date him without discussing it with her first."

Cut down on the amount of time you spend with him.,
Break up with him secretly.,
Talk to someone you can trust.,
Be kind to yourself.",How to Behave When You Like Your Best Friend's Boyfriend3," Being around someone a lot can cause you to develop feelings for that person. If you have been spending lots of time around your girlfriend’s boyfriend, then it might be time to cut back.Try telling your friend something like, “I would really like to spend more time with just you, but I don’t want to interfere with your time with your boyfriend. What would be a good day for just the two of us to hang out?”

, Even though you are not the one who is in a relationship, “breaking up” with your best friend’s boyfriend may be necessary.You can do this by writing a letter to him that you never send, or just imagine that you have broken up with him. Then, grieve the loss of the relationship the way that you would any other relationship. Allow yourself to cry, watch sappy movies, and eat a pint of ice cream.

, Sharing your feelings with someone you can trust may also help you to feel better.

If you haven't established that you both like each other, she's probably going to find it off-putting that you asked her dad permission before you asked her.


If you don't know how to start a relationship, start just by talking to her. Find common ground, or use the classes or surrounding environment to strike up a conversation.
For example, you could say, ""That test was hard, wasn't it? How do you think you did?"" just to get the conversation going.;
, Once you've started talking, work on developing a friendship. Continue to talk to her and seek her out. Show interest in what she likes to do, and don't be afraid to give her a compliment. You could say, ""You're so smart,"" or ""You're really good at math!""When you've spent a good deal of time together, you can bring up the topic of dating or going out. You could say something like, ""I enjoy spending time with you. I think I like you as more than a friend. Would you like to go out with me?""

, Once you've established that you'd both like to go out with each other, bring up the topic of asking her father. You need to explain your reasoning for asking his permission and ask her if it's okay, as she may have reasons that it's not a good idea. If she thinks it's a good idea, ask her a few questions about her dad, so you'll have a better idea of what you're walking into. You could ask her if he's strict, as well as his religious beliefs, as that could help you figure out an approach.

You could say, ""I know most parents are uncomfortable with their kids dating, so I'd really like to talk to your dad about us dating before we go out. What do you think about that?""
Alternatively, you could say, ""I know your family is fairly conservative, so I'd feel more comfortable asking your dad's permission for us to date. How do you feel about that?""
Of course, it may be that she has brought up the topic of asking her father permission because she knows that's what he would want. In that case, ask her for tips about how to approach the conversation, since she knows her father much better than you do.

, This conversation is not one you want to go into without thinking about what you want to say ahead of time. When you're faced with your potential girlfriend's dad, you're liable to get a little tongue-tied. Therefore, you need to think about what you're going to say before you get into that situation.It can help to write out what you want to say, or at least write down enough to figure out your main points. You probably don't want to take what you wrote with you when you go, but just writing it down can help you work through it.For example, maybe you want to say something like ""Hello, Mr. Vail. I wanted to meet with you today to discuss your daughter. I would like to date her. I know that could be a problem for you, but I want you to know that I have nothing but respect for her. I give my word that I will treat her well.""

, Of course, you're going to be nervous. The trick is to seem confident despite your nerves. Confidence will give off a better impression, as you'll seem more sure of yourself. Don't overdo it, though, as you don't want to seem cocky.\


Make sure to run through your speech several times to make sure you remember what you're going to say. That way, you'll be less likely to lose your nerve. Ask a sibling or a parent to go over it with you if you think it will help.
One way to seem more confident is to pay attention to your body language. Look him in his eyes, especially when introducing yourself, and make sure you stand up straight.
Be sure to smile, and when you shake his hand, do it with strength and confidence. In addition, don't be afraid to crack a joke or laugh at one he makes.

, Call your potential girlfriend's father, and introduce yourself. When you introduce yourself, make sure you mention your connection to his daughter. Ask him if you can meet with him to talk to him about his daughter.For example, you could say, ""Hello, Mr. Vail. I'm Terry Roberts, and I go to school with your daughter, Jessica. I was wondering if I could meet with you in the next week to discuss my relationship with your daughter."" Letting him know ahead of time what you want to discuss gives him a chance to prepare his mind for the conversation.Of course, it's possible that you already know her father. In that case, it's still polite to call and set up a meeting. When you do, you'll still state who you are and what you would like. You could say, ""Hello, Mr. Vail. It's your daughter's friend, Terry Roberts. We go to school together. I was wondering if I could meet with you soon to discuss my relationship with your daughter.""
If he agrees to the meeting, set up a time and place. Let him pick it out since you're asking him a favor. If he asks for more information, you can emphasize that you'd really like to meet with him in person.

, Your potential girlfriend's father will not be impressed if you show up in clothes full of holes or covered in stains. You don't have to dress in a suit. However, some nice pants, a button-up shirt, and a tie wouldn't hurt.Dressing up shows that you respect him and his daughter, and he'll be more likely to say yes.


Also, make sure everything is ironed, and you're not missing any buttons or anything.

, If you say you're going to show up at 4:00 P.M., make sure you are strictly on time. Being about 10 minutes early is even better, though you don't want to show up much earlier than that, especially if you're going to his house, as he may not be ready for you. Showing up on time shows you respect him enough to know his time is valuable., When you show up to the meeting, it's polite to introduce yourself in person, even if you already introduced yourself over the phone. Give your name, and offer your hand to shake. It's also polite to offer an introduction to how you know his daughter, as it gives him some context about you.You could say, ""Hello, sir, my name is Terry Roberts. As you know, I go to school with your daughter, Jessica."" Then offer your hand to shake.
Of course, if you know him, you don't need to introduce yourself, but it's still polite to greet him and offer your hand to shake.

, Everyone loves compliments, as long as they're sincere. You don't necessarily have to compliment her father, if that makes you uncomfortable, but compliment something that's connected to him.For example, you could compliment his house or his car, such as, ""Your house is really amazing.""

, You don't want to spend time beating around the bush. Being direct is a much better approach, and it shows you have bravery (because it does take bravery to say that to a potential girlfriend's father). Therefore, start out by stating outright why you wanted to talk to him.For example, you could say, ""I asked to meet with you because I would like to date your daughter. Even though I don't know you, I respect her and you enough to come here and ask your permission first.""
If you do know her father, you can leave out the part about not knowing him.

, If you're still a teenager, be aware that most fathers are not going to want to hear that you ""love"" his daughter, especially if you aren't technically dating yet. However, you can express what you like and respect about his daughter so he understands your intentions.For example, you could say, ""Sir, I'd like to date your daughter because I think she's very smart and funny. I enjoy spending time with her.""

, His daughter means the world to him, and he expects anyone that dates her to respect her and treat her well. You need to let him know that you will treat her well to put his mind at ease.[

For example, you could say, ""I understand that anyone dating your daughter will need to treat her with respect. I promise I will do my best to treat her well and not hurt her. I know she deserves the best from anyone who dates her.""

, In any conversation, you've got to give the other person a chance to voice their feelings. In this case, that means letting her father voice his concerns. He'll likely have something to say, even if he does eventually give you permission.Listen actively to what he has to say. That means making sure that you hear what he's saying, and that you're not just thinking about what you're going to say next.
Also, be sure your body language shows you're listening. Look him in the eye, and nod along to what he's saying.
You can also summarize what you're saying to make sure you are hearing his concerns correctly. For example, you could say, ""What I hear you saying is you're not sure if you're ready for your daughter to date. I completely understand that concern.""

, One way you can help your cause is to set boundaries with your potential girlfriend's father. That is, once you hear his concerns, try to figure out if there's a way you can calm his fears by agreeing to certain terms.You could say, ""I hear what you're saying. What could I do to make you feel better about me dating your daughter? I would be willing to agree to whatever boundaries you set. For example, maybe we could start with group dating, or we could even go on a date with your supervision. I'm willing to prove to you that I'm worthy of dating your daughter.""
Remember what ""permission"" means. That is, you want to know if your potential girlfriend's father thinks it's fine for you to date his daughter. Then, it's up to him. He can say ""yes,"" but you've also given him a chance to say ""no."" If he says ""no,"" you must accept that response."

And if you've already met, then it couldn't hurt to learn a bit more about them before you meet up the next time. Ask your girlfriend a few basic things about them, such as what they do for a living, where they're from, what their hobbies are, or anything else that can help you make a connection. Even something like a shared favorite sports team, or the fact that you and your girlfriend's mother are in the same line of work can help you make conversation and build a connection.


If you learn that you have something in common with her parents, don't bring it up the second you meet them. Wait for a quiet moment in the conversation to say something like, ""So, Mr. Smith, I hear you're also a huge Cubs fan.""
Be frank with your girlfriend instead of trying to elicit the information from her. Tell her that you want to know a few things about her parents to find common ground.
You can even ask her what her parents are like, if you haven't met them before. If you know that her father is sarcastic or that her mother is really talkative in advance, then you can be even more prepared to hang out with them.;
, This is no time to be a limp fish or a wimp! During introduction, shake the father's hand with a nice, firm grip while maintaining eye contact, smile, and make them feel as if you are honored to be there. Remember that these are the people responsible for giving you the girl you love — they deserve your respect and admiration.

, Make sure you wear something presentable for the introduction. If you wear something too casual, they will think you (A) didn't care enough to dress up (not a great first impression) or (B) are stupid and don't get why you should bother (also awful first impression). You should wear something nice and appropriate to the occasion. If you're just coming over their house for a barbecue, then nice jeans and a polo will be fine, but if you're going out to dinner, then you may need slacks and a button-down shirt.


Make sure to groom yourself well too. Take a shower, get a nice close shave, and run a comb through your hair.

, If you are going to their house for the first time, then you should come with flowers or another gift to show that you're trying. You can also bring a nice bottle of wine, if you know that her parents are drinkers. Ask your girlfriend what they will like. And even if you have met before and they are entertaining you, it's not polite to come to their home empty-handed. Bringing a gift, even if it is simple, shows that you are thoughtful.

, Another thing you should do is to make sure that your body language makes you seem approachable and engaged. Stand or sit tall, make eye contact, avoid hunching over, and use your arms to gesture or keep them at your sides instead of crossing them. You should also avoid fidgeting or that will make you look bored or nervous. If you're at dinner, avoid the temptation to push your food around your plate. Know that your actions say just as much as your words, and if you're shuffling your feet while trying to look interested in her mother talking about her PTA meetings, then she'll know you're really bored.


Maintain an open stance, turning your body toward her parents, instead of away from them. This shows that you are eager to talk to them.

, If you've met her parents at their home, then you should offer to help however you can. Maybe you can help Mr. Intimidating Dad man the grill. Maybe you can help her mother clean up in the kitchen after a nice long meal. Maybe you can find another way to help out around the house to show that you care and want to be useful. It's likely that her parents will say that they don't need any help, but you'll look like a gentleman just for asking.


Try to read their tones if they decline any help. You'll see whether they really mean it, or if they want you to help out.

, This is the single most important thing you can do to win them over. All parents, even those that act hostile to boyfriends, want their daughter to find a good mate who will respect her and treat her right. Show them you are that person! Encourage their daughter when she speaks, talk about how accomplished she is or how many great qualities she has, and don't demean her or talk down to her. Be a gentleman and treat her like a lady.


Though you may tease each other in private, try to keep this to a minimum in front of her parents, at first, until they truly understand your dynamic. Otherwise, they may think that you don't respect her.

, There are other ways to show your girlfriend's parents how much you like her without trying to make out with her or grope her in front of them. If you really want to show that you like her, then you should be respectful towards her, maybe holding her hand or showing a bit of affection, but you should definitely not overdo it. Fathers don't generally like to see their daughters being touched by other men, so keep that in mind the next time you find yourself with your special lady's parents.


Though you don't want to be cold and distant toward her, not showing too much PDA is a sign of respect toward her parents.

, At the end of the day, the most important thing parents care about is how much you like their daughter. You could be a billionaire or Ryan Gosling, and they wouldn't care at all if you seemed distant or condescending to their daughter. Though you don't have to praise her to the high heavens or force something that isn't there, you should make it clear that their daughter is really special to you by finding ways to subtly compliment her and show her affection, and by talking about her accomplishments or the things you like to do together. Make them see that you're serious about their daughter and that you realize how special she is.


Even the fact that you're going out of your way to be nice to her parents will show them how much she means to you. If you act like you don't really care what they think of you, then they'll think you don't really care about their daughter.

, Another thing parents don't want to see is that their daughter is dating a guy who lacks ambition or isn't going to amount to much. You don't have to be Mr. MBA, but you shouldn't talk about how much you hate school or work or about how you think the system is pointless. Sure, you can have these thoughts, but keep them to yourself around your girlfriend's parents — at least, until you're sure they really, really like you. You want them to think that you will amount to something and that you and their daughter will make a great team.


Though it's old-fashioned to say that your girlfriend's parents will want you to be a good provider for her, it's fair to say that they want to see a guy who can at least take care of himself. If you talk about mooching off your parents, getting bad grades, or how much you like to booze it up with your bros, they will not be won over.
Hey, if school or work isn't really your thing, talk about something you really care about, like playing the guitar or collecting stamps. Just make it seem like you care about something.


, The important thing is that you act like you care about the conversations you're having with your girlfriend's parents, even if you're talking about doing your taxes or growing cauliflower. Ask lots of questions, nod politely, and give her parents your full attention. Make sure you react if they're trying to make jokes, and seem like you're genuinely happy to be there and interested in what they have to say. This will make a big difference, and will show them that you're a nice young man.


When they ask you questions, don't give them a yes or no or a two-word answer. Take the time to elaborate to show that you care.
Even if your girlfriend's parents ask a yes or no question, you can give them a deeper answer. If her father says, ""So I hear you're studying history,"" don't just say, ""Yes, I am..."" Instead, say, ""I'm a history major with a focus in American studies. I've always been kind of a history buff...""

, The most important thing is that you put away your phone. Seriously. Stop texting your friends to make plans for later, stop checking your team's score on ESPN.com, and stop checking your email randomly, no matter how tempting it may be. Turn it off if you have to. The last thing you want to do is to annoy her parents by acting too cool for school by looking at your phone every five seconds. If you're out at a restaurant and the game is on in the background, sorry, buddy, but you'll have to miss out on that one.

, This doesn't have to mean you have to act all formal if you're only 16, but that you should try to show that you're on the way to becoming a mature young man. Be polite, use good manners, don't use vulgar language, and be graceful and kind during conversation. You can show that you're mature by talking about your future plans, talking about your family with respect, avoiding whining or complaining too much, and by not making any comments that make you seem clueless.


Remember that your girlfriend's parents, no matter what age you are, want her to be dating a man, not a boy. They want her to be with someone who will be a good influence on her and who will encourage her to grow.

, Another important thing to do around your girlfriend's parents is to demonstrate that you have good manners. You don't have to go over the top and act like British aristocracy, but you should make sure to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" at the correct times, to ask the people at the table to pass the food instead of reaching across the table and grabbing it yourself, to pull the chair out for your girlfriend (unless she and her parents are more progressive in that regard), and to not interrupt people when they are speaking.


It's also polite to know what to call her parents. This part is easy. Just call them whatever they call themselves when you are introduced. If her dad says, ""Call me Jim,"" then don't be afraid to call him Jim; however, if he introduces himself as ""Mr. Smith,"" then you should call him that until he tells you to do otherwise.

, The last thing you want to do is to get embroiled in a debate about the political situation in Ukraine or the Catholic church with your girlfriend's parents in the middle of what was supposed to be a nice dinner. If you know that you have very different politics, or if you just want to be polite, then you should stray away from controversial topics. You will not impress anyone, and this will only lead to an embarrassing and uncomfortable conversation.


If you feel that the conversation is getting uncomfortable because her parents don't agree with your beliefs, try to delicately change the subject. You can say something like, ""I may not go to church on Sunday, but I like watching baseball during the day. Mr. Jones, I hear you're a big Giants fan?""
Once you get to know your girlfriend's parents, you can discuss these topics more. However, in the beginning, it's better to stick to the safe topics, even if it's a little boring.

, Another way you can impress your girlfriend's parents and act appropriately around them is to compliment them or something about them in some way. This shouldn't sound forced and you shouldn't do it too often, but a well-timed compliment can really help them see that you appreciate their company and care for their daughter. Even if the compliment is a bit silly, they will like the fact that you're trying. Here are some things you can compliment:


A painting, souvenir, or piece of furniture in their home
The food you're eating (if they cooked it)
Her mother's earrings

, Parents love honesty no matter what the situation is, it makes them feel more comfortable about their daughter being with you, so always answer their questions with honesty. Not only that, but parents have a lot more experience than you do — they can tell if you're being dishonest, no matter how good you think you are. This doesn't mean you have to be honest about every little thing, like how much you like to smoke pot, but that you shouldn't lie to them when it comes to important topics such as your education or future plans.

, Tell yourself that you are a good guy who cares deeply for the daughter of these people. Make yourself feel secure and certain of yourself without a trace of a cocky attitude. It isn't enough to just pretend to be confident — you need to feel it as well, or else it won't reflect as well as you hoped it would. If you want your girlfriend's parents to really have faith in you, then you have to have faith in yourself first.

, Make sure that when you first meet the parents, you maintain eye contact when you are speaking with them. Don't look away, mumble, or trail off. Sound confident in what you say and show that you have convictions and that you believe in yourself. Try to avoid saying ""Uh"" too much or turning to your girlfriend for help when you're at a loss for words. It's okay to take a minute to formulate your words when you need to.

, No matter how nervous you are, keep your head held high. Don't fidget, look around the room, or take too long to answer a question. Just take a deep breath and tell her parents whatever you need to say. It's okay to feel nervous, but you should minimize letting them see how you're feeling as much as you can. If you come off as nervous, then they'll thick you lack confidence and that you're unprepared. Just keep telling yourself that if your girlfriend likes you, that her parents will like you, too.


Don't be nervous about looking nervous! That will only make things worse.
At the end of the day, know that it's no tragedy if you come off as a littler nervous. Your girlfriend's parents once also had to go through the awkwardness of meeting the parents, and they'll understand where you're coming from.

, Don't fake a personality just to win over the parents. You should not have to change for anyone just to impress them. Remember, your girlfriend chose to be with you for a reason, and plus parents can sense when guys are faking. There's a difference between letting them see the more mature and responsible sides of yourself and pretending to be a completely different person completely. If you plan on being with their daughter in the long run, then you can't keep up an act forever.

Let your friend make more of the calls. Though you can still reach out with a few invitations, let your friend do more of the inviting as her relationship develops.
Remember that your friend still needs you. If your friend and her new boyfriend ask you to hang out, you should join them when it feels right, and reciprocate their invitations. A relationship is a two-way street and your friend will still expect to hear from you.;
, Though you can still hang out with your friend and his or her plus-one, it's great to have more hang-out options so you don't have to sit home on a Saturday night while your friend is away on a romantic weekend. Though you will miss your friend, you can keep busy by pursuing new activities or making new friends.


Use this as an opportunity to pursue a new interest or a hobby. You can join a bowling league or a book club and will have fun learning something new.






Do something your friend would never do with you. Is your friend terrified of heights while you've always wanted to go mountain climbing? Is she vegetarian, while you've wanted to check out the new seafood place down the street? This could be your chance to explore a new interest.






Turn old acquaintances into new friendships. Have you been friendly with the girl in your English class, but have never spent time with her outside your classroom, or did you recently run into someone you knew in high school who just moved to your neighborhood? Now you have an opening for spending time with new people who may turn into close friends.






Alone time is always valuable. If you're trying to branch out but still find yourself with much more free time now that your best friend is MIA, use this as an opportunity for some good old ""me time."" You can read that long book you never had a chance to finish, treat yourself to an at-home pedicure and manicure, or explore that new TV show that your best friend refused to watch. Don't be sad about being by yourself--see it as time to grow as a person and pursue your interests.







, It's important to keep up the solo friendship with your friend, even if the new couple in question is attached at the hip. It'll be easier to keep the dynamics of your friendship strong, and to be yourself, if you have time to see your friend without her beau.


Make time for the activities that you and your friend love to do, which may not appeal to the new significant other, such as watching your favorite classic movie together. This is a better option than encroaching on your friend's dating time.






Plug a weekly meeting into your schedules. It can be helpful to set up a new routine now that your friend spends so much time with his or her significant other. You can schedule a weekly dinner or drinks date, or a time to do a sport or activity you both love--and if your friend's week is just too busy sometimes, make sure to at least plan for a Sunday phone date, even if you're just catching up.







, You may feel a little weird about being the third wheel, but drawing attention to this fact will only make things worse. If your friend and her boyfriend are constantly reminded that you're not part of a couple, then your friend will be calling it an early night.


When you are hanging out with the new couple, you should avoid mentioning that you are ""the third wheel"" or ""the single one""--this will make them feel uncomfortable.
If you're single, you can certainly make jokes about it, but if you repeatedly make comments like, ""I know I'll never find a love like yours,"" the new couple may feel guilty and will be less inclined to hang out with you. If you're too busy acting sorry for yourself to enjoy their company, then they may realize they are better off as a duo.
Remember that you should still be assertive if the new couple is acting out of line. If they are having a hot-and-heavy make-out session right in front of you, then you should say something, but otherwise, it's better to just roll with the punches.

, If you want to have fun with the new couple, you should pick you-friendly activities so you don't feel left out. There is a time and a place for everything--even for being the third wheel.


Anything that screams ""romance"" should be avoided--this can range from taking a stroll through the rose gardens or having a candle-lit meal at the new French restaurant down the street with the new couple. Even if your friend insists that it'll be fine, use your judgment when you agree to certain outings.
Activities that can be enjoyed in a big group are the safest. Joining your friend and her new boyfriend to play beach volleyball with a group of friends or to enter your team of six into a local pub quiz may be the most fun because every person will have something to contribute.
Hang out only if your friend really wants you to be there. Read your friend's tone to see if she's inviting you out of obligation or if she really wants to see you. If she invited you to hang out with her and her new boyfriend out of pity, then none of you will have a good time.

, Though the new relationship may be a letdown to you at first, see it as an opportunity to improve your own romantic life. Whether you're looking for a new girlfriend or boyfriend, your friend's new love interest may help you find a special someone of your own.


If you're on the hunt for a new girlfriend, then maybe your best friend's new lady can introduce you to some of her single friends, or play wing woman when you go out.
Or if you respect your best friend's new boyfriend and are looking for a guy of your own, you can ask his opinion about what guys really think.
Your friend's new relationship can be an opportunity to ask your latest crush to go out on a low-pressure double date. If you're shy about asking, you can use the couple as an excuse. You can say your friends have a dinner reservation for four or an extra movie ticket, and see if your crush wants to tag along.

, Remember that if your best friend is really best friend, she will always be there for you at the end of the day. No relationship should get in the way of your incredible bond.


Be patient--but not forever. Though it's okay for your friend to go into obsessive-love mode for a little while, if your supposed best friend has left you high and dry after her first date, then maybe she wasn't your best friend after all.
If your friend goes missing every time he or she has a new love interest, then this may be a red flag that you are only a placeholder in his or her life.

Work hard in school.",How to Ask a Girl's Parents for Permission to Date Her," If possible, it is best to establish yourself with her parents before you ask their permission to date their daughter. Talk to the girl about arranging a group hang out at her house, or if she would be comfortable inviting you (and a few other friends) to a casual family gathering. This will give you an opportunity to lay some groundwork and become a friendly and familiar face in her household. This way, when you go to ask them for permission, they will already know that you are a trustworthy person and a good influence.

One way to show that you are a positive influence is to go over to the girl's house to study. Stay focused on studying to prove that you are a mature and responsible person.;
, Show respect to her parents by making a special visit to their house. Discuss this with the girl, and see if her parents would be okay with having you over for dinner. Having their pre-approval will help relieve some of the tension.She might say, “Mom and Dad, can Jared come over for dinner Wednesday night? He'd really like to get to know you guys better and talk to you about us going on a date."" This will give her parents some time to think about this so you don’t spring a complete surprise on them.If you have already spent some time at her house and established yourself as a respectful and trustworthy person, her parents will likely be more open to the suggestion.
Understand that going in without her parents having any prior knowledge of you is going to be difficult — no matter how polite you are or how well you dress, you will still be a stranger.

, Dress conservatively: Think about what you would wear to a nice dinner with your grandmother or to a religious service, and go with that. Make a good first impression.Make sure you shower, or at least clean up, beforehand. You want to look as presentable as possible.

, Say your name, smile genuinely, and shake their hands. Call her parents by their titles and surnames, for example Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, until they indicate otherwise.


If you have met them before, say something like, ""Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. It's really nice to see you again. Thank you for having me for dinner.""
If this is your first time meeting you, you could say, “Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. I’m Josh Green. It’s nice to meet you.”
Use a firm, confident handshake, and make eye contact as you say hello. Stand up straight and tall., Her parents will likely have plenty of questions for you. Try not to be overly eager to tell them about all your achievements. Allow the conversation to flow naturally. If they are concerned or curious about something, you can be sure that they will ask you about it.


They will likely ask about your family and friends, goals, and interests.
Mention anything that supports your claim that you are trustworthy and responsible — volunteer work, religious involvement, a job, and extracurricular activities can help vouch for your character.
You could say something like, “Right now I’m working as a lifeguard on the weekends and am busy with the swimming team during the week. I’m going to start teaching swimming lessons next month at the park district.”

, Don't treat this like a formal job interview. Answer all their questions in a friendly, warm voice. Make sure you show interest in their lives by asking some questions, too. Showing genuine interest in other people leaves a positive impression when you meet someone for the first time.Questions you can ask her parents include things like, “How long have you lived here?” or, “Did you grow up in this area?” You could also look for things you may have in common. For example, “Mr. Johnson, did you coach softball with my dad a few years ago?”
Make sure the conversation is a two-way street. Neither party should be doing all of the talking or asking all of the questions.
Don’t get distracted by your phone during your conversation. Looking at your phone while someone else is talking can be seen as extremely rude. Silence it, and keep it in your pocket as you are talking to her parents., If you think you have a negative reputation with her parents, talk to them about it. Be honest with them, even if you have to admit to something you’d rather not. They will respect you far more for telling the truth than for lying to them. Lying to them will make them not trust you.If they ask you about a poor past decision, for example, make sure you tell them what you have learned from it, and how you are different now. For example, you could say, “Yes, I was one of the kids who got suspended last year for the cafeteria prank. I feel really embarrassed about that now because I know how much extra work we made for the janitors. We sent them an apology card.”

, Let her parents know that their daughter is interested in getting to know you better, but that you both wanted to talk to her parents to see if it was okay with them first.


You could say, “Lucia told me that she knew how important it was that you meet people who wanted to go out with her. So I wanted to respect her and her family by coming here to ask your permission to take her on a date.”
Acknowledge that the decision is also their daughter’s. You could say, “I wanted to get your permission to go on a date with your daughter, but I also understand that it’s up to her, too. If she’s not interested anymore, I understand.”

, Talk about what you like about her personality and why you want to get to know her better. Talk about things you have in common. Convince them of the value of your relationship.You could say, “Ann and I were lab partners last semester and we became friends. She is fun to talk to. I think we bonded over our love of science fiction movies.”
Do not say anything about her physical attributes. Only talk about her personality. Telling her parents that you think their daughter is hot will probably get you kicked out of the house fast!

, Once you have introduced yourself and made your case about why you want to date their daughter, it’s time to ask the question. Stay calm, remain polite and friendly, and ask if you can take their daughter on a date. Tell them about what kind of date you would like to go on.You could say, “I really would like to get to know your daughter better, and I think she feels the same way about me. Do we have your permission to go out on a date?”
You could say, “I was thinking about taking Emily to the school play next week, then going out for dessert afterward. We’d probably be home by 9:30. Would that be okay?”
If they seem reluctant to let you go on a one-on-one date, you could ask if it would be okay to go on a group date with the daughter. Make sure they know the other people in the group. You could say, “A few of us in my youth group are going out to dinner next week. I think you know Laura and Jack? We’d all like to have Emily join us.”

, Accept their answer politely and graciously, and understand their decision. If they say no, talk to them about it and try to understand why.They may say they think their daughter is too young to date. You could ask, “Would it be okay if we went out together in a group?”
They may say you could go out together as long as you are not out too late. Be agreeable and say, “No problem. I have a 10 o’clock curfew. Does that work for you, or does she need to be home earlier?”
If this is their first time meeting you, they may say they'd like to get to know you better. You might say, ""We have a test coming up next week. Maybe I could come over Sunday afternoon and we could study here?""
If they say no to everything, you could ask, “Do you think we could talk about this again in a few months?” Accept that you may need to wait a little bit to date, but you may still have other ways to see their daughter in a school, extracurricular, or social setting.

, Show that you are a trustworthy person. If her parents have initially put strict limits on how you can spend time with their daughter, keeping your word and being reliable may help them give you more freedom and responsibility over time.Be at the location you told her parents you’d be going. If you told them you are going to see a movie, be at the movie theater watching the movie you said you were going to see at that particular time. Don’t go to another movie or be somewhere else entirely. If her parents find out you are lying about your whereabouts, that will likely put a stop to your relationship.
Be on time. Bring her home when you say you are going to. If you absolutely can't avoid being late (for example, you're caught in an unexpected traffic jam), let the parents know as soon as possible. Then try to avoid circumstances that would cause you to be late again, such as going somewhere within walking distance rather than driving.
Have safe and reliable transportation. Let her parents know how you are getting there and back. If they are not comfortable with you driving, for example, propose alternatives without argument.

, Give them your phone number. Return their calls or texts promptly. You could also give them your address and your parents’ phone numbers, so they have other ways to get in touch with you. Parents like to know how to get in touch easily.You could ask your parents to talk to her parents. Be brave and ask your own parents if her parents could call them with any questions about your character.
If your home life isn’t great and don’t think your parents could speak well of your character, you could ask another trusted adult in your life to talk to her parents if necessary.

, Respect the limits her parents set, even if you disagree with them. If her parents catch the two of you going behind their backs, it will be very difficult for you to regain their trust and move forward with your relationship with their daughter.If the girl you like wants to sneak around, don’t go along with it. Ask her to be honest with her parents and try to talk to them. You could say, “Look, I really like you, but I want to respect your parents’ wishes. Do you think you could try talking to them again?”

, Parents are more likely to trust someone who is known to be a good student. Make sure you and the girl are keeping up with your studies. Her parents will be more likely to put limits on your relationship if she is not doing her best at school.


Offer to come over to her house and study for tests with her. Do your work in a room in the house where her parents can keep an eye on you.

Be prepared for the Q & A session.,

Don't look back.",How to Meet Your Girlfriend's Parents," Every girl is different, so every girls' parents are different, with unique expectations. All of the recommendations that follow can backfire horribly if you don't consult with your girlfriend first about what her parents are like.


Find out as much as you can about the parents from your partner. What do they do for a living? Do you have any common interests? Have they been on holiday recently? Are there any subjects which are off limits? This gives you a heads up on conversation topics - and what to avoid.






Anticipate the most difficult questions. You know what they are--about your future (i.e. career, financial stability), your commitment to their daughter (i.e. marriage, future children), and your background (e.g. religion, education, race, etc). Pretend that her parents already know that you just lost your job, that you can't afford an engagement ring or a house and probably won't be able to for several years, that you got arrested that one night, or whatever else you dread them asking about. Develop the most responsible, slick answer you can think of in advance. See Warnings below.






Consider how you'll be compared to past boyfriends. Ask your girlfriend how her parents have responded to any other guys in her life in the past. What did or didn't they like about them? By asking this question, you can learn a lot about what NOT to do. You may also discover the unfortunate circumstances that there may have been one guy who they thought was just perfect for their daughter, and you'll be getting judged by that standard from the second you walk through the door. There's nothing to be done about this but anticipate it and not let it catch you off guard.





;
, Going to meet someone's parents in your vintage, hole-ridden, acid-washed jeans and Che Guevara t-shirt that you got from the thrift store the other day for three dollars probably won't get you their utmost respect--unless they're very unconventional parents. This doesn't mean wear a suit - just be presentable (e.g. a polo shirt or t-shirt that doesn't spread the Communist agenda). Dress smart but casual, and make sure everything is clean, decently fitted (nothing too tight or baggy) and tidy. Get a fresh haircut and trim your nails. Ask your girlfriend for her opinion - she knows them best.

, Don't pull up with your stereo blasting heavy metal. They'll disapprove in a heartbeat (unless they like it themselves). Turn the volume down. Park your car in front of their house, and lock both doors. This will be explained later.

, Give the father a firm handshake. Nothing says ""I can't take care of your daughter"" more than a limp-noodle handshake. Not to mention, when it's firm, it shows you mean business. All men-who-mean-business use the firm shake, sometimes with an additional forearm grab. If he happens to think his daughter can take care of herself, or he's not a man-who-means-business himself (i.e. more of the artist, intellectual or anything goes type), a firm handshake certainly won't hurt (unless you squeeze too hard). For the mother, the appropriate greeting can range from a handshake, to an air kiss, to a hug (or any combination of these). Some mothers are reserved, and some mothers will hug the air out of your lungs and shower your cheeks with kisses. Ask your girlfriend for feedback on this. As far as greetings are concerned, follow your partner's cue when addressing them. If you are just told ""This is my mother and father"" then show your respect and go with Mr. and Mrs. until they tell you otherwise. If you are introduced with first names, then stick to them. Tell them that you're happy to meet them, and thank them for inviting you to their home. Make sure when you meet her parents for the first time you must be 100% polite. Use proper grammar, and DO NOT use any slang words. This will shown the parents that you are kind, educated, and aware of your surroundings.

, One of the most pivotal parts of meeting anyone - parents, girls, the president - is the conversation. If you have mastered the art of conversation, you are a deadly force just waiting to disarm parents at every turn. Use anecdotes and, most importantly, well-timed (and appropriate) jokes. Timing is the key--an ill-timed comment could be the difference between ""father-in-law"" and ""law-suit"". Take lessons from your past experiences; i.e., look at your conversations with your ex-girlfriend's parents (see, that's EX-girlfriend for a reason). You've done your research so you will have a few conversation openers up your sleeve. Avoid heavy or controversial subjects; this is not the time to air views on human cloning. But don't be a yes-man. If you are asked for your opinion, be polite but be honest. If at any point, you are stuck for conversation, ask what your partner was like as a child. This is a brilliant ploy, parents love discussing their offspring and it shows you have a deep interest in her.

, Be extra attentive to your partner. Pull back her chair for her at dinner, pour her a drink, open doors for her, and all that jazz (which are all good practices outside the parental meeting, as well, or else she may feel disgruntled that such consideration is only executed in front of her parents). At the same time, don't show too much affection towards your girlfriend while in their presence (i.e. don't put your hands on her rear). They should see you treating their daughter like the princess they believe her to be, not the hottie you believe her to be.

, There comes a time in every first meeting where you will be assaulted with questions that end only upon the submission of your manhood. Fortunately, you've followed these instructions and anticipated many of these questions already. It is very important to answer most of these questions in the affirmative, unless they begin with, ""Have you ever...,"" ""When is the last time you...,"" ""Have you ever committed a felony..."" - in which case it is best to use your discretion. Be warned that you may have to swallow your pride and be humble at times. By the end of this session, you will most likely feel out of breath, beaten, and less of a man - however, if done correctly, it will soon be over with. If not, a 'family emergency' might suddenly come up that somehow doesn't allow you to go out with your date tonight. You didn't even know she had an Uncle Pedro in Taipei, or that myxomatosis affected humans - but you hope he gets better soon.

, Shake hands, give hugs, or whatever seems appropriate. Thank them profusely for having you over and smile. This is the most relieving part of the entire parental-unit-meeting-situation, but only for the champions who have made it past the gauntlet. Usually characterized by a dark, evil stare by the father (sometimes by the mother) as he (or she) opens the door to let you out, and accompanied by a ""Have her home by ____,"" - in which case you respond you will have her home within plenty of time to make that deadline - this is the green-mile.

, Once you exit the door, it is imperative not to look back - because you know darn well that her parents are watching until you are out of sight. When you reach your car, be certain to unlock her door first, and open it for her. Turn around and flash her parents a smile while you close the door if you are feeling dangerous. Once you get in, don't pull out until both of you have your seat belts on, otherwise you will notice her father's face twist and distort behind the screen door. Finally, give a single-hand acknowledgment of her parent's presence behind their door, and drive away at no faster than fifteen miles-an-hour until you are out of their sight.

Get a crash course on the parents' flavor of etiquette.,
Request that your boyfriend or girlfriend try to be especially agreeable just this once.,
Dress with the following in mind: What you want is for the parents to realize how suitable you are for their child, and the last thing you want is for your clothing to distract from that.,
Emphasize aspects of yourself that are the opposite of what the parents disliked about your partner's ex(es).,
Find common ground.,
Be genuinely appreciative.,
Read body language.,
Find things you have in common with the parents and talk about it.",How to Meet the Parents," Will the parents expect a handshake, a hug, or a bow? Will they want to be called Mr./Mrs., sir/ma'am, by their first name, or Mom/Dad? Will you be expected to take off your shoes in the house? Should you take off your jacket, or wait for them to offer to take it from you? Where do the parents usually sit, so you can make sure to avoid those seats? Your boyfriend or girlfriend might find these questions odd or annoying because they already know this stuff without having to think of it consciously, but you'll save a lot of awkwardness by finding out in advance.;
, If he or she argues a lot with the parents, this can be very uncomfortable for you, especially if you're asked to choose sides. It's a battle you can't win. So ask your significant other to try to avoid any arguments or debates. If they bubble up anyway, be ready to change the subject.

, You have to understand that when you're viewed from the perspective of an older generation, your clothes stand out much more to them than they do to your peers, and it can be difficult to pay attention to what someone is saying when you're surprised or shocked by what they're wearing. So generally, the plainer, the better!


If the parents are conservative, strict, or religious, dress like you're going to church. Stare at the parents thoughtfully, as it makes them feel important, not just their child. Keep it simple and clean. Leave the death metal t-shirt or the miniskirt in the closet.






If the parents are hippies, dress as casually as you're comfortable (but not too comfortable--sweatpants and pajamas are generally not a good idea, no matter how laid back the parents).






If the parents are wealthy, find or purchase quality clothing that you'd wear if you were going to work in a professional environment.







, Before you meet the parents, ask your boyfriend/girlfriend: ""Did your parents like your ex? Why or why not?"" If they liked or disliked anything about former boyfriends/girlfriends, dig for character traits, not unchangeable things like race or status. For example, if the parents didn't like that the ex had no direction in life, talk about your goals and plans. If they didn't like the ex because (they thought) she was a snob, be humble. If they didn't like the ex because he was too controlling, find a way to show that you respect your partner's individuality.

, This is where some preliminary research will come in handy.


Are the parents into sports? If you follow the same sport, this can be a good conversation topic. But if you're fiercely dedicated to their favorite team's rival, you might want to avoid this subject for now.






Geographical origins. Are you, or anyone in your family, from an area of the country or the world that the parents are from? Or have you visited the area? Example: ""Sarah tells me you lived in Germany for a year when you were in the military. I studied abroad in Germany for a summer. Did you enjoy your time there?""






Some other interests that often cross generations: classical music, jazz, wine, beer, cars, crafts, pets, gardening, literature.







, If you're in the parents' home, look around for something you sincerely like, such as artwork, or an area of the house (e.g. ""I love the greenhouse you have attached to your house! It feels like a tropical jungle in there.""). If you're eating together, comment on what you like most about the food. Upon departing, thank them for having you over, making dinner, etc.

, If you pay attention, you'll be able to pick up on what the parents like or dislike about you, and adjust accordingly. Some parents might like that you're holding your boyfriend or girlfriend's hand, others might feel uncomfortable with it. Some parents will be horrified if the soles of your shoes come anywhere near their coffee table; others will think you're too stiff if you keep your feet planted firmly on the floor the whole time. You can follow your boyfriend or girlfriend's example to a degree, but remember that the parents are scrutinizing you, not them, so you can't get away with everything they can.

, Try to be as intelligent as you can when you speak (use correct grammar) and speak with politeness in mind.

Try it to argue.,
Never lie to a Gemini, because it's not a good idea.,
Respect your Geminis dignity.,
Indulge your Gemini friend with great conversations.,
Avoid being cocky or arrogant.",How to Be Successful in a Relationship with a Gemini," One thing that annoys Gemini, are people who take themselves too seriously and will not enjoy at least a portion of humor. All Geminis absolutely love to laugh, they enjoy being sarcastic, and they want to have a good time. So if you have a Gemini friend, indulge them in this, because if you don't, they will take offense after a while and then abruptly decide to end the relationship without warning (due to them feeling misunderstood).;
, They love to share their gifts with the world and they have a strong desire to make a positive difference. Geminis want to make a lasting impression with everyone they know and come in contact with. Geminis are very loyal to their family and friends and in many cases will sacrifice a lot just to see them happy. Geminis themselves are selfless individuals and expect others to be the same way.

, Geminis are masters of communication, in all respects. You can never really win an argument with a Gemini. The more you argue with a Gemini, the more you're fueling their fire to argue even more (because they love to debate for fun, it's in their nature), so really there's no point in trying to win an argument. Geminis can articulate well and validate every move they make. They also have an ability to see all sides of an argument.

, Geminis have an unusual ability to know when people are being dishonest and once they find out you're withholding information, be deceptive (they need to know) or just straight out lying it will be a very long time, until you can gain their trust back. Geminis are caring individuals, but they will not tolerate dishonesty or lying on any level.

, People born around 20 May – 21 June are all very dignified and are very respectful of all people. Yes, they enjoy having a great time, but they also have all have a very serious, professional/business-like demeanor and it should be respected. Geminis are chameleons and are able to adapt to any given situation and due to their versatility, they can accomplish more than any other zodiac sign.

, One thing that can irritate a Gemini is a person who cannot engage them in conversation. They find those who lack conversational skills to be very mundane. Have interesting things to talk about and keep in mind, a Gemini like to listen just as much as they enjoy speaking. Geminis are very intelligent, so don't just ramble about things you don't know about, because they have a lot of knowledge about different subjects and can tell when you're being pretentious.

, Geminis do not like people who are arrogant and who show off, for they feel this very distasteful, unattractive, and not becoming. Geminis do not like people who are too bossy. They are all fiercely independent and will not tolerate anyone stomping on their freedom, they need their autonomy. Geminis hate having the same routine and like to change things up more often than not. Geminis are very rational and analytical. They do not appreciate people who have tunnel vision, people who only see things in black and white, and people that are not open to the viewpoints of others, because they just don't operate in that mindset and considers it to be a weakness.

Scorpios can be very intense and sexual in the short term, and can develop that passion into a deep and lasting bond, but learning to negotiate these differences is essential to the success of the relationship.Scorpios can be great for a fling, making them ideal short-term partners. They sometimes struggle with long-term commitment, however. No matter what you want, go into it looking to make a connection, not with preconceived notions of what a relationship should be like.
Sometimes, people who talk about finding a Scorpio mate are looking for a sense of danger or drama. Looking for a ""bad boy."" Instead, focus on getting to know this guy and seeing where it leads.

, Dating a Scorpio is a good choice if you are have a predominance of the water signs like Cancer or Pisces in your chart. This allows you to empathize with his moods, emotional undercurrents. and unspoken thoughts.


If you possess fire signs (Leo, Aries or Sagittarius), you may clash constantly with him and resent all the darkness and gloom Scorpios are famous for exhibiting.
In general, someone with lots of air signs like Libra, Aquarius, Gemini would not work with someone who has a Scorpio Sun, because your spontaneity may make him miserable.
If you are an Earthy person, you may enjoy having a Scorpio mate. But your love of material things and pragmatism could clash with his idealistic, dreamy and philosophical side. Sometimes the combination works, and sometimes it doesn't.

, Scorpios can tell right off if you're being fake. They are the best lie detectors, and value sincerity and trustworthiness in prospective partners. You can know that they will never share a secret you trust them with, and for your own good, you'd best not be spreading any of theirs.


Never lie to a scorpio. Breaking trust can be one of the quickest ways of turning a Scorpio guy off and losing him. Even if you think the truth will hurt, it'll be better to be completely honest.

, Talk with him about subjects which excite your passion. Many Scorpios secretly feel that the rest of the world lives on the surface of life while they go spelunking into the depths. Show him that you have investigated a few deep caves of meaning as well. Cut right for the heart of an issue and talk about big topics. Scorpios can spot insincerity a mile away, and will turn the other way when they see it coming.


It will help if you are as intrigued by some of Scorpio's favorite subjects like science, political power and the occult.
Stay up on current events and world issues. Voice your opinion about what's going on and ask him what he thinks as well. Don't shy away from a good debate. Challenge him on things you disagree about and stand up for yourself.

, Scorpios are driven by the desire to lose themselves fully in The Other, to achieve an almost mystical state of Kundalini with another person that makes them feel regenerated, renewed, and reborn. Scorpios want to get to know you on an intimate level, but may shy away from making the first move.


Be forthright and answer questions he asks as sincerely as possible. If a Scorpio asks a question, he's not just asking to be polite. Scorpios truly want to know and understand you and figure out why you are the way you are. Clue him into what makes you tick.
A Scorpio will appreciate learning more about you, for Scorpios are cursed with craving intense emotional honesty. They often feel that nobody will ever truly understand them, but struggle to express themselves without some encouragement.

, Scorpios are serious and will appreciate your desire to have serious conversations, or to spend time reflecting together. Scorpios don't need constant entertainment or constant chatter in their lives, but do require a lot of time spend in reflection. When you're with him, it's ok to share silence comfortably. Don't look for easy solutions or easy entertainments.


Talk about recent books that you've both read, or difficult films that you've seen. Don't brush things off by saying, ""I didn't like it."" Instead, think about it. Discuss it. Wrestle with things together.
Don't fill time by rambling. When you talk, it should be in terms of substance, sharing your hopes, fears, and dreams. No Twitter updates.

, When you're with a Scorpio, focus your attention on being together, and doing what you're doing. Shut off and put away your cell phone when you're hanging out and talking, so this guy won't feel and if he's being ignored.


Make eye contact while you're talking. Practice active listening skills, summarizing the things that he says and responding to them in turn.

, A Scorpio prides himself on being mysterious and layered, and it might take a while to get to know him. But he'll appreciate the chance to share with you, if you play your cards right. Listen when he talks and look for opportunities to get him to open up even more.


If a Scorpio says something, take it to the bank. It will mean a lot to him later if you remember little details, like the name of his best friend from school, or the name of his favorite pet from childhood. These little details show you care.
Don't tease Scorpios. If you want to leaven your conversation with humor, keep it a bit dark and sarcastic. A Scorpio man is not attracted by goofiness or silliness since it tends to deflate the intensity of a conversation.

, If you date a Scorpio, aim to keep things exciting. Try to stay have new adventures together, giving him the the motivation he needs to be endlessly fascinated by you.Change the language you use to talk about your dates. Don't make vague plans like seeing ""a movie"" or ""going out,"" and instead say that you want to ""Catch a screening of a great new documentary"" or you want to ""Explore a few new places down by the waterfront."" Make date ideas specific and engaging.
Be willing to change plans at the last minute, if something doesn't work out, or if he's not into a particular idea. Learn to fly by the seat of your pants when you're dating a Scorpio.
Try to plan things that are exciting for you. A Scorpio is interested in passion, and even if he's not as passionate as you are about a particular activity, he'll be turned on by your zest for it.

, Want to get closer to a Scorpio? Get your blood pumping and your bodies moving. Getting outside and doing something physical together can be a fast track to other kinds of intimacy, physical and emotional.


Couples massage
Yoga
Outdoor sports, like basketball, tennis, or golf
Swimming
Dancing

, Scorpios crave that connection, getting to know someone on a deeper level. Plan dates that will allow you to connect in a real way and build something together.


Spend private time away together Go on long walks that allow you lots of time to talk, but also plenty of time to just be. Spend time together sharing silence and enjoying each others' presence.
Plan dates that will allow you to talk at length. A candlelight dinner will always be better than a movie, which you'll have to stay quiet for.
Attend intellectual events, like readings, lectures or debates. Discuss them afterward.

, Scorpios are known for their sardonic and sometimes cutting sense of humor. It takes some thick skin to hang with a Scorpio sometimes, and you'll need to develop it. Try to remind yourself that when a Scorpio lashes out, it's a defensive mechanism that has more to do with him than it does with you.


Don't put up with jealousy or possessiveness, which are common stereotypes of the Scorpio. If your guy is domineering and controlling over your life, it may be more appropriate to end it., You won't usually need to initiate intimacy with a Scorpio, who is passionate and fiery. If you feel passionate feelings stirred, don't hold back. Allow yourself to share, and you can spark that innate loyalty that Scorpios exhibit towards their nearest and dearest. For some, it can be the deepest kind of love.

Opt for genuine romantic gestures.",How to Date a Cancer Woman1," Some believe Cancer women do not love big, rowdy establishments.

, Those who believe in astrology find Cancer women appreciate sincerity in a partner more than their career, material possessions, or education.Romantic gestures should come from a place of sincerity. Rather than trying to impress her with an expensive date night, go for something personal for her.


For example, you don't have to spend a lot of money on a fancy restaurant. Instead, plan an intimate picnic lunch in area that's personally meaningful for you, like the park where you first met.

Get traditional.,
Understand their lack of emotion.,
Help them maintain their image.,
Get over those trust walls.,
Be ambitious.,

Be classy.,
Be open-minded.,
Be patient.",How to Date a Capricorn," Your Capricorn has a ton going on in their world -- both the world on the outside and the one in their heads. Not only are they doing a million things at once (usually climbing up the career ladder), but they have a million things going on in their brains, too. They're very cautious and practical and need to develop a plan before they take any action. If you spring something on them, they won't feel prepared. Baby steps are the only way to get to their heart.


Build a foundation of friendship, first. They are incredibly logical people -- if you're not a good match, they don't want to waste time fooling around. They need to know before they get into anything that it'll be worth their while. So show them you're interested, you're in it to win it, and that you're willing to wait.;
, Sometimes Capricorn is so enveloped in their career or something else going on in their lives that even the most obvious of flirtations can be lost. You might feel as if you've been waiting on their doorstep coquettishly for weeks when you finally ask them out and they seem taken aback. It's because they didn't see you coming! If the ball needs propulsion, you may have to do it yourself.


Make them feel secure. Capricorns aren't ones for spontaneous actions; if they know it's coming, they'll embrace it. So plan out your date and show them you've put thought into your offer.

If you're a woman, this is a fine, fine line. Some Capricorn men are very traditional and expect themselves to fulfill the most stereotypical of gender norms. So if he's obviously traditional and not asking, put yourself out there but don't outright ask. You may need to do him the favor of making it clear you're a ""yes"" before he does ask.



, Patient, loyal Cappy is also very stoic, at times melancholy, and almost always serious. To give them the change of pace they desperately want but can't seem to find, make them laugh! Even though they don't seem to be about humor themselves, it doesn't mean they don't crave it.


Just about anytime and anywhere and anyhow is a good way to go about it. The only thing to keep in mind is not to poke fun at them too much if you're not close; sometimes Cap doesn't pick up on when people are being playfully obnoxious.

, Since Capricorn is so ambitious, they constantly are striving toward something a bit better than their current state. To match this drive in them, always show up to the occasion dressed well. If you're dressing like you've spent the last 72 hours in your mom's basement eating only Pop-tarts and playing the Sims, Mr. or Ms. Cappy won't be having it.


Capricorn, at least on the outside, seems to be into appearances. It can be misconstrued as being shallow and vain, but in reality they just like nice things. They like working for everything, so it's the reward they deserve.

, Capricorn is traditional and serious in most situations (at least initially). If you two are out and about, don't expect him/her to be hanging off of you. And don't hang off them either! The place for that is at home.


Capricorn also responds better to knowing looks than to playful touches. While being physically affectionate is fine, there are more effective ways to work your way into their heads. Master meaningful eye contact and you're in.

, You know how we talked about Cappy being serious and stoic? Yeah. Makes for a tough time getting them in the bedroom! You might be on your 6th date and you wind up with a gentle peck on the lips and a cab ride home. Don't be dissuaded! Things that come too easy aren't worth it, remember?


A lack of sexual contact initially does not mean they're not interested. You just have to weasel your way in to get to the good stuff. They're not going to give it away for free, you know! And when you do get in there, it will be way more than you expected.

, Generally speaking, Capricorn views dating in a very traditional sense. In the beginning, you may go to dinner and a movie half a dozen times before he/she suggests something else. While this has its drawbacks, it has its advantages too. You'll experience a traditional courtship that can be very fulfilling and fun.


Some men will insist on paying the bill, some women will want the door opened for them, etc. This will go away as the Cappy gets more comfortable, but will always be resonant in the smaller ways.

, More erratic and unstable signs aren't good matches for Capricorn. They are patient, serious, and often unmoved. If you don't understand that this is just how they are, it'll make for a very difficult relationship. It has nothing to do with you or how they feel about you. It's just how they operate and see the world.


It's easy to mistake the Capricorn as melancholy. While this is obviously a feeling they're capable of, it's not necessarily so when you detect it. They're just in their brains, figuring out the best plan to action, weighing out logic and rationale, and devising a plan.

, Capricorn does not have time for someone who's really just an obstacle in their way to success. If you're a deterrent to what they want to achieve, you'll be ousted. Help them rise to the top like they're inclined to do and you'll be a necessary part of the action.


A huge part of this is simply understanding that their motivation and ambition is an integral part of their personality. Encouraging their laziness or enabling them to slack off is not what they're looking for in a partner.

, You've probably picked up on the fact that Capricorns aren't easy to get to know. They're not into displays of emotion and they can seem pretty uninterested and stoic at first glance. But this goes away! One day a light bulb will turn on and you'll wonder where your dream goat went. Only to get replaced by someone who's even more incredible.


At some point in your relationship, it'll click. Once they've determined that you're the real deal, that you'll be around for the long haul, that you're worth being let in, you're golden for forever. They're yours to keep!

, As if it wasn't already crystal clear, Capricorn has drive and is determined. Though they say opposites attract, this is not one of those times. Those who are laid-back need not apply. Cappy needs someone who can fuel their drive, not question why they're trying so hard. If you have it going on too, they'll be all that much more motivated.


Capricorn isn't looking for someone who's only focused on their relationship. If you're getting into deep waters with yours, be sure to keep an eye on your career, your friends, and your hobbies. You shouldn't lose yourself and your dreams -- it's what Capricorn was drawn to in the first place!

, The one who's temperamental, mercurial, and erratic will not be a good fit for patient, rational Capricorn. If you're quick to anger or tears, Capricorn just straight up won't get you and will get exhausted. Be stable mentally and Cappy will know who they can lean on.


Those with addictive or insecure personalities don't really have a place in Capricorn's world. If you're boozing away the weekends or spending days wrapped up in a pity party, Capricorn will not be having it. They desperately want life to be on an even keel at all times. Why do you think they plan everything out ahead of time?

, If you're poised and classy, Capricorn will see you as a boost to their image and someone who's just as driven and motivated as they are. They want the best. So stop the gossip, the drunk texting, the selfies, and bring out your inner Kate Middleton/Michelle Obama/Cary Grant.(All Capricorns, by the way!)


This doesn't mean the richest, most lavish things. Carrying a Louis Vuitton purse doesn't make you classy. Being sophisticated is an inner maturity and grace and not what's strung on your arm.

, This, however, is one of the times where Capricorn needs an opposite to juxtapose their personality. While Capricorn is rational and logical, they are often stuck in their ways because of it. Since they're usually right, they find it hard to open their minds to others' opinions. They can be very stubborn and relentless. You'll need to work with them!


It's because of their extensive planning that they can be so firm in their convictions. Since they've weighed everything out (or they think that they have), they see no need to budge. So if you can do the budging for them, the both of you will be better off.

, This will come in handy for two reasons: 1) Since your Cappy is so patient, being frazzled is something they won't tolerate and 2) they operate on a slower wavelength sometimes (like how your relationship progressed). It's also good for you and your stress level!


Basically, it's important to be patient in your world and in your relationship. You'll be calmer, more relaxed, and be more willing to see things through till the end. It may take a while to break your Cappy down, but once you do, you'll be glad you were so willing to wait!

She needs to know who you are and be comfortable with you before things can even touch on romantic or sexual. She likes to know exactly what she's getting into, so be friends with her first. Anything worth it is worth the wait, and she definitely is.


Use, subtle, incidental touches to get her used to physical contact with you. It doesn't put you up for rejection, but it still gets your touch in her subconscious. Hopefully, she'll start liking it and wanting it more and more. She'll start touching you back, letting you know it's okay to proceed.





;
, Virgo girls are very shy, so be careful not to mistake shyness for her not being interested in you. To start off a relationship with a Virgo, you're going to have to be the one to make the first move, as she's too shy and traditional to do it herself. Once she gets to know you, however, her shyness will wear off and she will become confident around you. But for right now, you'll be doing the brunt of the work.


Know exactly what you want to do -- she'll be attracted to your determination knowledge. Tell her exactly where you'd like to take her to dinner or what you would like to do this weekend. Who could refuse an offer delivered with such confidence and desire?
Keep it traditional. Don't get her alone in a dark room and start loosening your belt. Be romantic and slow-to-start. She needs to be courted above all else.

, Virgo women have a soft spot for more romantic words and would prefer to be called ""beautiful"" or ""pretty"" instead of ""hot"" or ""sexy."" When you're interacting with her, be kind and caring. She will not be impressed by any display of machismo or playful condescension. Games are not her thing.


She is looking for a partner who will be a constant. Who can help her not worry and put her mind at ease. If you engage in a game of cat-and-mouse or tug-of-war, she won't be having it. She wants to know that you are into her and only her and don't plan on going anywhere. In short, she needs to trust you.

, Above all else, Virgo will value your mind. It's great if you're sweet and good-looking, but if the lights aren't all on upstairs, she'll be heading for the hills in no time at all. So when you're talking to her, find what gets her excited. She's probably well-read on just about everything!


She'll love it if you can talk about current events, politics, literature, music, history, science, and everything in between. If you can keep up with her, she'll know you deserve her and are worthy. So start reading up!

, Since a Virgo is an animal you have to draw out of its cage, it's important to sense how she's feeling about you. When you're sitting next to her, look into her eyes. If they're lustful and scream that she's dying to get closer to you, go in for the kill. If they're saying, ""What the hell are you doing?"" it's time to back off.


A lot of understanding Virgo will be reading her. Sometimes you'll be wrong, but if you've built up a friendship, you should be pretty good at this by now. But if worse comes to worse, you could openly ask her! She'll appreciate your directness as long as you're tactful and diplomatic.

, The Virgo woman likes her partner to be a good dresser. She's quite the perfectionist, so you gotta be put together, too (she doesn't want to waste her time doing it for you!). The casual Virgo will be good with a nice t-shirt and jeans, but the dressier Virgo will want a jacket and spiffy shoes. Whatever it is, look like you put thought into it.


That isn't to say you need to be trendy. No, no, no -- there are pieces that are timeless that Virgo will always appreciate. A good button-down shirt, a nice jacket -- even a nostalgic vintage tee will garner her approval. As long as you have some thought into your look, she'll notice.

, In addition to rocking the right clothes, you gotta be clean! Virgo needs a partner who's well-groomed to the max: that means clean ears, clean fingernails, clean noses, clean everything. And smelling good, too!

, If Virgo gets into your car and has to wade through wrappers to sit down, she'd rather walk. Walk back to her home, that is. She can't stand messes and won't tolerate yours. It's a total turn off for her to be with someone who isn't organized. She'll have no choice but to get out of bed and clean your room for you! Definitely not romantic.


So when you find her organizing your closet by thread count, don't be surprised. This is just her. You shouldn't go about changing your ways -- unless you're of the type that leaves pizza on the floor for later. Virgo doesn't need a partner that's as clean as she is, but she doesn't want a slob!

, Virgo wants her lover to be everything -- smart, funny, cute, and loving. Though intelligent definitely takes center stage, ideally you'd be a powerhouse of awesome qualities. Be as well-balanced as possible to keep her finding more and more things about you that she loves.


To keep her wanting more, talk to her about everything. Engage her mind. It could be about literally anything. If she wants to talk about 18th century Swiss art, great. If she wants to talk about the Kardashians, great. Show her that you can handle every side of her and her mind.

, Virgo's mind is running, running, running all the time. ALL THE TIME. She's constantly nit-picking at something, including herself. She needs someone who can help calm her down, to be her rock. If you can do this, there will be no way she can let you go.


When you see her thinking, ask her what's going on. If she doesn't open up, don't leave. She may just be feeling the waters or uncomfortable asking for assistance. Let her know you're there if and when she needs you.
When you get to know her well, odds are you'll have a grip on at least a few of the reasons she's worried. Try to make her plate less full by picking up the slack. Does she need to run errands? Clean the house? What can you help her with that gives her more time to relax?

, Because her mind is running all the time, she notices every detail in the book. If something is a bit off, rest assured she'll take note. So when your shirt is a bit wrinkled in the back, she notices. When your spice cabinet isn't organized, she notices. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it is something she will remark on in her head.


Things may take a bit longer with her because of this. Though Virgo will always be punctual, she probably knows by now to allot more time for specific endeavors. If she's the creative type, she could be devoted to her art for days until its just right. She's a modern-day Goldilocks!

, Virgos are natural outdoorsy people. If you want to see her grin, get her outside. Take her on a picnic or go hiking. Rent a paddle boat and float on a lake. She's not the type to complain about the weather or need her hair to look perfect at every second. Get her outdoors and give her a memory to cherish forever!

, Virgo doesn't believe in kissing and telling and wearing her heart on her sleeve all the time. Sure, there will be times when she feels like opening up, but more often than not, assume she wants to stay reserved. Keep the PDAs to minimum -- you'll have time to be affectionate at home.


Sometimes Virgo is quiet about her emotions, too. If you want to know how she's thinking or feeling, you may have to ask. It's not because she doesn't have feelings for you; it's just because she finds emotions to be an incredibly personal matter.

, Virgo needs to know she can depend on you. Because of this, be sure to keep your word. For example, if you say you'll call her at 3 PM, call her at 3 PM -- not 3:30 or 4:00. If you're dependable, she'll come to you without worry.


So before you say you'll do anything, make sure you can actually do it. Don't make promises or commitments you can't keep. And if you absolutely must break your promise, have good intentions and explain your situation fully. Then, she'll appreciate your honesty and your attempt at accommodating her.

, Virgos hate fighting and arguing. Virgo girls will let you do what you want, but will secretly be upset. This can lead to serious fractures in the foundation of the relationship. Compromise with her to keep both of you happy.


Watch your temper. Gentle Virgo is turned off by unwarranted anger and rage. Listen to her when she tries to talk to you. Usually what they tell you is important, or she wouldn't bother telling you!

, If you come off as the type who kicks a woman out of bed in the morning, Virgo won't give you the time of day. When you get to know her, make it clear that you are honest, trustworthy, and understand how to treat people, women in particular. Virgo does not search the toolbox for prospective partners.


Virgos are really sensitive and look for a steady partner that will be loyal and faithful. Virgos can be flirty, but once they're in a relationship they are completely committed. The man who gets a Virgo will be the only man in her life.

Take some time to explore your feelings in a journal.How long have you had feelings for her? How would you describe your feelings? Reflecting on these feelings, take a moment to make sure you are genuinely interested in her as a romantic partner.;
, Rather than trying to change into somebody you imagine she would like, simply be yourself.Take a few minutes and reflect on the values and character traits that you hope to embody in a romantic relationship.It is okay to take some time when exploring the possibility of a romantic relationship., Do you feel stronger romantic feelings for her than for your other crushes? By asking yourself such questions, you can make sure you are pursuing a noble path."
"
Consider expressing your intentions to your best friend.If you are certain about asking her out, you should probably communicate this intention with your friend.,
Develop a solid relationship with the family.If you have mostly been hanging out with your friend and do not know the family very well, it is best to spend some time getting to know the family.,
Get to know her better through family conversations.You can get to know her a bit better by developing a relationship with the family.,
Get to know her better.You can start to get to know her better before going out on that first date by having conversations with her wherever you can and asking about her passions and hobbies.",How to Ask out Your Best Friend's Sister2," You want to handle this situation delicately so that it doesn't seem like you are asking permission from your friend, which she might not like. At the same time, you want to be forthright with your friend. Be respectful and communicate your genuine intentions, so that your friend understands that you are serious about a romantic relationship and have genuine respect for their sister and the family.


You might go for coffee with your friend and find a moment to talk about your feelings. For instance, you might say, ""Since we went to that concert with your sister Sarah and her friends in July, I've been having some pretty serious feelings for Sarah. I haven't had these kinds of feelings for a long time, and they aren't going away. I wanted to let you know because I would like to ask her out for dinner."" If your friend questions your intentions, try restating your genuine feelings for her. If they reassure you that everything is fine, then you know the conversation has gone well.

, By putting some good time into developing these relationships at the start, you will have a better chance of being seen as a good dating prospect.

, Use discretion and don't be too nosy, as this could be a big turnoff. However, you may very well get to know a bit about her simply by hanging out with the family and listening to conversations with and about her and her siblings.


If you are at your best friends house for dinner and there is a conversation about a family vacation, you might listen for details about her experience of the trip.

,


For instance, if you know she practices Judo twice a week, you might ask her, ""What do you like about Judo? And how is it different from the other martial arts?"" By expressing an interest in something she is passionate about, you can learn more about her life and her interests.

Find a place to interact with her.,
Ask her out on a date.,
Try indirect suggestions to ask her out.,
Express how much you enjoy her company.",How to Ask out Your Best Friend's Sister3," If you go to the same church, for instance, you may have an opportunity to ask her out after the service. If you go to the same mall to work, you might run into her in the cafeteria. So, you need to think about possible opportunities to ask her out.

, You need to be very specific when asking her out, so that she has something to respond to. For instance, you could ask her if she would like to go for coffee after class or if she is free to check out a movie on the weekend.You might say, “I remember you saying you love dark roast coffee. I found an amazing coffee place on third street downtown that has this incredible Italian roast. I think you would appreciated it. Do you want to check it out on the weekend?”
For instance, you might say, ""A few friends and I are going rock climbing at Echo point on the weekend. We are thinking of making the day of it, maybe bringing a lunch and trying to get in three or four climbs. Do you want to join us?""

, If you feel slightly awkward about asking her out directly, you could use an indirect method.You could ask, “what are you up to this weekend?” She might reply, “I have a soccer game on Saturday afternoon, and then a study group. I’m not sure yet what I’m doing afterwards.” If she says something like this, you could then say, “That sounds fun. I was considering a movie on Saturday night. Maybe you would like to join me after your study session?”
For instance, you could also find an opportunity to help her with one of her projects. You might ask, ""How are you feeling about your upcoming theatre production at Studio Y?"" If she says she is worried about her lines, you might say something reassuring like, ""You work so hard on them, I know you'll be great! But if you want to practice them some more, I would be happy to help out. Maybe we could grab a coffee and I could listen and give line prompts?""

, If you have the opportunity to go on the date, it is best to be forthright in expressing how much you enjoy spending time with her."

Be open to change.,

Be flirtatious.,
Do not act overly clingy.,
Look your best at all times.,

Have confidence in your appearance and personality.",How to Attract a Sagittarius Man," Sagittarius guys are constantly expanding their horizons--they crave new knowledge, new scenery, and new adventures. If you’re going to tame an archer, you’re going to have to be spontaneous and open to a change of plans at the drop of a hat.


A great way to show that you are flexible is to suggest a crazy adventure. Something like “hey, wanna ditch this club and sneak into this rooftop pool area that I know?” will immediately get your archer’s full attention. Of course, your plan doesn’t need to be so elaborate (or daring) simply asking him to go on a hike you’ve been wanting to try, or suggesting he try this crazy drink that you know the bartender secretly makes will intrigue him.;
, Sagittarius guys like girls who hold back about themselves a little. Don’t spill all of your life’s story the second you meet an archer. Instead, reveal your personality in bits and pieces. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, which means that they enjoy puzzles. Make him have to figure you out.When he asks you questions about yourself, throw in an occasional “wouldn't you like to know?” or “maybe I’ll tell you...on our next date.”

, Being mysterious and aloof does not mean that you should lie to seem mysterious. Generally Sagittarian guys are an excellent judge of character--which means they can hear a fake laugh a mile off. When you are around your guy, always make sure to tell the truth and act honestly.


Sagittarius guys are trusting but have a hard time trusting again once they have been let down. Be as truthful as possible because if he catches you in a lie, he probably won’t be very quick to forgive (or call you again.)

, This means keeping things lighthearted. Be fun and playful and avoid being negative around your guy. Archers are generally happy, active people who want to have a good time. Try to avoid complaining or speaking negatively about others. Go out of your way to make your time with your archer fun. Laugh and smile a lot, and make fun suggestions like going out on the dance floor or doing a fun activity together.

, Sagittarius guys love a girl who is unpredictable and always keeps them guessing. While this does not necessarily mean you should play hard to get, you should challenge him a bit. Play coy and make him work for your affection. Don’t show him that you are interested. Act indifferently around him (but don’t ignore him altogether.)Archers also love to be challenged mentally. You must be clever to catch an archer. Debate him on topics that you are both interested in. Play the devil’s advocate and take the opposing view from the one he holds (even if you secretly agree with him.)

, Sagittarius guys never stay in one place for very long so you are going to need a love of travel and adventure to capture the attention of an archer. When you first start talking with him, ask him about his travels and then relate some of your own (this may also be a great time to play up your mysterious side by giving vague answers about why you went to a certain place.)Suggest things to do that involve a little bit of traveling. Plan an adventure day in which the two of you explore an area neither of you have been before. Drive out into the country and stop at every place that looks interesting (world’s largest corn maze? Lets do it! A pie shop on a huge farm where you can learn to milk cows? Lets do it!...etc.)

, Sagittarius guys love to flirt. Don’t be afraid to simply walk up to him and begin a conversation (a very flirtatious conversation.) The archer will love you confidence and will be flattered by your attention, and will (much) more than likely flirt right back.


To get his attention before even talking to him, make eye contact with him across the room. Catch his gaze, then drop your eyes while slightly smiling. Then slowly draw your eyes back to his and don’t look away until he drops his gaze. Give him your best ‘come hither’ look.


, A big part of the Sagittarius personality is his love of freedom. Whether it’s hitting the open road on his latest adventure, or simply having some time alone (probably going on a run or hike in the mountains) this guy needs a girl who won’t cling to him or clutter his freedom.


When you and your guy begin interacting, make a point of showing that you can be independent and don’t need to be waited on. If you’re at a bar, buy yourself a drink (and ask him if he wants one.) This will show him that you are not expecting him to wait on you hand and foot.

, Men can’t resist a woman who looks fabulous--why would an archer be any difference? Arches love women who are put together, dressed well, and sexy but without being too revealing.


If you know your Sagittarius guy is going to be at a party or bar you are heading to, tonight might be the night to break out that flirty dress you haven’t worn yet and those sexy stilettos. No man (and certainly not an archer) will be able to resist you.

, Sagittarius guys love a woman who smells fresh and delicious (no but really--archer’s love girls who smell good enough to eat.) Try out scents with hints of citrus and orange blossom. You’ll have a whole swarm of archers humming around you as soon as you walk into the bar.


Here’s a tip: always carry around a small bottle of perfume and a travel-sized deodorant. That way, even if you have to hike up 20 blocks to the party you are going to, you can refresh and smell great once you get to the top.

, Are your eyes a crazy shade of blue? Do you have gorgeous mile-long legs? Maybe your hair is a prize asset of yours. Whatever it is, make sure he notices. Wear clothes that play up your best features. Wear makeup that makes your eyes pop and style your hair to perfection.

, Archers love a woman who has confidence in herself. Know that you are a beautiful, strong, intelligent woman--and show them that you know this fact. A woman who knows she is sexy is a thousands times sexier than a woman who is fidgeting with her hair, clothes, face, etc."

Show some mutual respect.,
Take your time.,
Be patient.,
Consider the Taurus's nature.,
Develop a routine together.,
Practice nonviolent communication and work with his ego.,
Know you may need to draw him out.,
Work on trusting each other.",How to Attract a Taurus Man," While you need to be strong and confident to gain his respect, he also needs a woman with a definite feminine side. A Taurus man loves to be surrounded by your femininity. He really appreciates beauty, and will expect his woman to be beautiful. If you want to attract him, take the time to look good!


And while we're at it, be classy. The Taurean man wants a woman with refined taste -- someone who appreciates good music, good wine, and good art, to name a few. Be sure to dress this way too; you don't want to give it all away too soon!;
, A Taurus hates disarray, and won't give in to a messy lifestyle. Show him that this comes naturally to you and he'll be automatically smitten. Taurus are neat, organized, and grounded, they will enjoy if you're likewise.


If you invite Taurus to your home, organize it! He'll appreciate your attention to detail in everything—down to your spice racks. He'll notice what lengths you go to to keep your life organized and he'll consider you a kindred soul.

, These men have an eye for money, and won't accept useless and impractical use of it. If you are sound financially, you can get his attention. He is very practical and knows when his dollar is worth it. And definitely don't be careless with his!


That being said, they know when something of quality is worth it. You don't need to cut corners, but do know when certain things are frivolous and unnecessary.

, Be truthful to him. He will appreciate your honesty, which is a trait he really wants in a lady. He's not quick to trust, so any lying will not be tolerated in the slightest.


Be honest about the image you put forward, too. If you're not clean, you're gonna have to come clean. If you're not super ladylike, don't put up a front. Be you. If he doesn't like it, he doesn't like it. You can't keep up a facade forever; eventually, he will find out. When he does, he won't be happy. So don't act as you are not it in the first place!

, Taurus men are family men; they prefer to be in the comfort and warmth of their own home, with good food and good company. You will smite his heart if you are a good cook. They are down-to-earth and calm, so avoid making drastic changes or spontaneous plans. Keep it practical.


Don't worry about coming off as lame! Have him over for a dinner you made yourself. He'll be impressed by your resourcefulness, your skill, and your femininity. A woman who asks him to dinner who's attractive and competent in the kitchen? That's a win for any man!

, Many mistake the bull for being a bit aloof and cold. It's not that he is unhappy with his surroundings, it's just that he keeps his emotions on the inside and tries to be practical at all times. So he may be interested in you, but you may not know it! You may have to make your move -- or you could be waiting for a while!


You don't have to do something super extravagant -- again, inviting him over to dinner would be super impressive to him. And no need to swarm him with your intensity either; a simple cup of coffee will show him you find him intriguing.

, A Taurus man loves a cozy, cuddly, inviting atmosphere. He adores staying at home to just be with a woman -- you. Dress subtly alluring in public and more alluring in private. Your Taurus Man will appreciate it, knowing it's just for him.


Show him you're physically interested without making too much of a show of it. Graze his shoulders as you pass, lightly massage his arm, keep him aware of your touch until he has no choice but to break out of his cage.

, In the end, Taurus wants a relationship where there's mutual respect. The idea is to respect him as a builder -- he'll, in turn, respect you in your own right. Handle conflict with a delicate hand and he'll respond. Taurus are natural leaders and they love to take charge. Guidance and support will work better than confrontation. The Taurean man has enough issues with his own temper, much less anyone else's.

, A Taurus is slow to change. He likes routine and doesn't like change. If you try to change him, remember, you are angering a BULL! Try to roll with his flow. If you don't understand something, just ask! He'll gladly include you in his routine if you show that you're trying to understand and share in something that matters to him.


He likes planning, too. If you're overcome with brilliant ideas, run them by him before you start implementing them. He'll probably be able to bring you back down to Earth and actually get things done!

, The Taurean man likes to feel out his adventures. He needs to wrap his mind around the factors at play -- and that includes relationships. So with this one, you'll need to put on your patient hat and relax for a bit. Let the relationship grow without pressuring it. If he didn't like you, he wouldn't stick around!


This goes for his time, too. Taurus does his routine and he sticks with it. If you interrupt that, he won't be thrilled. If there's something he needs to do, let him do it. Then he'll be all yours when he's finished.

, It's important to sit down and be a tad bit realistic. A Taurus is very protective and is often jealous, like his opposite, Scorpio. If your sign happens to be Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Libra, or Gemini, you may have to forget about getting along with a Taurus, much less attracting him. His overbearing nature will be too stuffy for you. Make sure your sign meshes well with his!


If he can handle his bull-headedness, his need for routine, and his need to lead, by all means! This could be a relationship that lasts a very, very long time. But if these are factors that you can't see yourself tolerating long-term, try not to get your heart twisted in a bunch. He can make for a good fling, but little else.

, Taurus likes his routine and his woman will need to be a part of it. So carve out a space for yourself! Make him part of your routine and vice versa. The deeper ingrained you two become in each other, the harder it'll be to break.


This does not, by any stretch of the imagination, mean that you two have to be involved in every aspect of each others' lives. No, no, no. It simply means to have routine hobbies and activities that you two do together that you can depend on. Stir Friday. Bowling league. Saturday morning mimosas. You each still need your own life! But each other has their definite, solid part.

, Sometimes men can get pretty defensive when it comes to their manhood, and Taurus is no different -- in fact, he may be the cause for this gender stereotype. His pride and ego dominate a large facet of his nature -- if you attack this, he will not be happy. Make sure allow him to lead you on occasion -- he'll love it and love you for it.


There are delicate ways to do everything. If you two are fighting, this does not mean backing down and saying, ""You're right, honey. I'm sorry."" (Unless he is right, of course.) It means saying, ""I don't understand what this has to do with that. Can you explain it to me?"" With Taurus, a certain amount of tact will get you a long, long way.

, If you're looking for a man that will shower you with adoration, Taurus isn't it. Sure, he's very capable of being affectionate, but he may take his precious time. If you can muster it, be patient. Show him you're comfortable being caring and demonstrative and he will echo you back.


Don't be discouraged if he's not as caring as you'd like him to be. If it's an issue, address it! He'll value your honesty and straightforwardness. Give him a while to come around to the idea. He's worth the wait, you know?

, Along with being aloof and slow to make his move, Taurus can be a bit untrusting. He's very much so of the mantra ""If you want something done right, you do it yourself."" This leaks into his romantic relationships too, where he's used to doing his own thing. However, over time, if you show him you're trustworthy and responsible, he'll see it makes sense to let his guard down. That's when you know you've won Taurus's heart.


If you're all these things: honest, practical, diplomatic, and patient—there will be no issue. Trust will just fall into place! Make it clear that your loyalty lies with him and only him; if he trusts you, he'll show it back. That means he's in it to win it!

She won't be into a guy who sits back and just smiles and nods. Bring up that interesting thing you read the other day or ask her a question about something you have in common. She'll be intrigued by your gusto and intellect.


A Pisces female is sweet, compassionate, and caring. She's not the type of girl you get with and drop! So get to know her a bit first before you make your move. She won't move too quickly, anyway. If you want it to last, you'll be friends before anything else happens.





;
, Gentle Pisces wants a storybook romance. She loves being sent love letters! She expects her man to go through the hoops our grandparents had to go through. Words and intentions should come way before any action! So get to telling her how wonderful she is and how much you'd like to take her out. She'll be weak in the knees.


Don't stop this once the relationship develops! If you courted her with cheek kisses and love letters, be sure to keep this up. Don't let it be just an act -- have it be part of you. It'll spark the relationship and keep it going.







, In case it wasn't already clear, Pisces wants a man who's traditional, unassuming, and sweet. Assure her that chivalry isn't dead by embodying it yourself. Open doors for her. Foot the bill. Give her your jacket. Kiss her hand. Don't ask for too much and she'll want to give you her entire world.


Pisces is definitely a stickler for tact. She won't tolerate if you're the guy yelling at the waiter or the one eating all the pizza but refusing to chip in. Manners are very important to her. Be polite to her and to everyone you're around -- we could all take a leaf out of her book!







, Taking a balloon ride over the French countryside is not the idea of a good, romantic time to a Pisces. The grandeur of something like that just doesn't make sense to them. They want the things that are meaningful and unspoken -- not the gestures that are overstated or blunt. If it's chivalrous, you're good to go. If it seems like you have ulterior motives (what might those be?), she'll drop you like a hot potato.


Put on her favorite song while you're cooking dinner. Bring her a cup of coffee just the way she likes it when you know she's in for a long day at work. It's the small things -- the attention to detail -- that proves to her how much you care.







, Pisces wants a man who knows who she is -- ultimately she seeks protection and support. In order to be her rock, you gotta be confident enough to do so. She needs someone who has it together and can go hand in hand with her on her journey through life.


It's also important to be yourself! If you're not genuine, she'll see through you like you're some Victoria Secret lingerie. She has a keen eye for motivation and character -- fake it in front of her and she'll detect it for sure.







, And this water runs deep. She is emotional, intuitive, and sensitive. She often goes off her feelings instead of logic or rationale. She is compassionate and understanding, mainly because she's so empathetic. With all this emotional prowess, she's quite the nurturer.


She also flows like water -- meaning she's highly adaptable and goes with the flow. Present her with anything and she can morph to it. However, she can also have mood swings and flow to each side of the spectrum. Hopefully you can keep up!







, Pisces wants to explore every inch of your mind. She wants to hear about that one time you scraped your knee in 6th grade. She wants to sit down and take in your stance on lite mayonnaise. Everything. Don't hold back! This is how she'll feel like she truly knows you.


Don't worry about her judging you -- she's far too sweet for that (and you are far too confident to be concerned!). If it's important to you, it's important to her. So while you may feel like you're talking your mouth off, don't worry. It's a means to an end!

, Random gifts (along with the big ones like mentioned earlier) aren't Pisces' cup of tea. She wants ones that you've actually put thought behind -- not something you're doing just to get in good with her. So pay attention to what she says! You'll find little opportunities everywhere.


Instead of getting her flowers, get her that book you two were just talking about. Instead of chocolates, buy her tickets to that comedian you told her you're convinced she'd die for. When she sees the reason behind it, she'll love it.







, When a Pisces girl takes you to bed, it means you're in. She doesn't let those who she doesn't supremely trust get her this vulnerable. She sees it as the most intense form of bonding -- one that can't really be broken. Since this is such a big deal to her, respect it. Only go this far with her if you plan on sticking around.


This isn't a thing to be taken lightly. If you're not looking for a girl who might get emotional on you, stay away from the bedroom with this one. And definitely, definitely call her back.







, Since she's looking for a rock, make it clear that that's you. When you see her growing emotional, be there for her. Comfort her. Ask her how she's feeling if she's not coming out and saying it. When she feels like you're in tune with her, she can let her guard down and open the gates.


She does not respond well to negativity. If you want to get on her good side, use encouragement and genuine compliments (not the fake kind -- those are a total turn-off) to build trust. Be her #1 fan and she'll treat you with the same undivided attention and praise.







, Though some see her as a people-pleaser and far too ruled by emotion, that's not always how it is. When you look at her, see how loving and caring she is. She has compassion for everything she sees, down to the smallest flower in the crack on the sidewalk. Wouldn't it be something if more people were like her?


And above all, don't use it against her. She recognizes when people take advantage of her kind, giving nature. If you're always asking for favors or making it about you, you, you, she'll be gone in a heartbeat.







, Stronger, more fixed may look at gentle Pisces and see someone who lacks a backbone. Yes, Pisces is sensitive. Yep, Pisces has a ton of feelings and sometimes has trouble controlling them. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing!


As a result, she's very in tune to how she feels. She can be open and honest with you because of it. You'll know exactly how she feels about you. On the other hand, you'll also have to deal with the roller coaster ride that is her life. So buckle up!






She also can hold a grudge. Watch out if you really make her angry! She won't forget it anytime soon.



, And if you can dream with her, even better. When you're talking about everything, include your goals and aspirations. It doesn't even have to be feasible -- it just has to be something that would make you happy, regardless of whether or not it will ever happen. She can often be found in her fantasy world and she would love a companion.


This is part of the reason she loves the arts so much -- they take her away from reality and put her in a place she can use her imagination. So get her to the art museum and to the symphony and watch her fade away into dreamland.







, Pisces is naturally drawn to beauty. If you can make an otherwise routine endeavor not so routine, she'll remember it forever. Instead of dinner, go take a picnic in the park while the trees are blooming. Instead of a movie, go to Shakespeare in an outdoor amphitheatre. Get her using all her senses to make her feel like she's at her best.

, When Pisces has decided you're worthy of her care, she will treat you like the only person she's ever known even existed. She can love fully and unabashedly, so hopefully you deserve her. She's not the flirty, fling type of girl. She's in it for the long haul!


You'll be able to tell that your Pisces is in it to win it when she starts opening up to you and depending on you. She doesn't do that with everyone! Don't hide your true feelings in return -- she's looking for someone to be totally and madly in love with. And someone that feels the same way back!

Actions speak louder than words, and they're a lot easier to get right. So just shut up and hold them -- you don't have to think of the perfect words or speech. Your friend may be too upset to start talking right away, and these little gestures can go a long way in making your friend feel less alone.


If your friend is trying to wriggle away, then clearly he or she doesn't want you touching them. Be respectful of them and you're doing just fine.;
, Make eye contact, nod occasionally, and make very short comments when necessary. Mostly, let your friend express him or herself and get everything off his chest, even if you want to say something. You're not going to ""fix"" them -- period. So don't try. This isn't the time to give your opinion or to talk a lot. It's time to let your friend explain everything that has been troubling them so you can get a better sense of their worries.


If your friend isn't saying much, you can say, ""Do you want to talk?"" or ""What's up?"" Either your friend wants to talk about it and needs a little prodding, or he or she is just so upset that they aren't ready to talk yet, and all you have to do is be there.
You can make little comments like, ""That must be so hard"" or ""I can't imagine what you're going through..."" but don't overdo it. Don't say things like ""Oh, I have been through that so many times!"" Just be quiet and listen -- this isn't about you at all.


, Maybe your friend is shivering in the rain. Get her inside and give her a blanket. Maybe she's been crying for an hour straight. Get her some tissues and some Advil. Maybe your friend is standing up telling you how upset he is while carrying a heavy backpack. Get him to sit down. If your friend is a little riled up, get him or her some chamomile tea. If your friend stayed up all night worrying, put him in bed. You get the idea -- be a bit of a nanny.


Your friend may be so upset that he or she isn't looking out for his or her health or comfort. That's where you come in. Take it off their already crowded plate.
Do not think that your friend will feel better if you open a bottle of wine or bring over a six pack. Alcohol is never the solution if a friend is upset-- it is literally classified as a depressant.

, Your friend can be upset for a variety of reasons. A serious reason: your friend just found out that his grandmother is in the hospital. A not-so-serious reason: your friend has just broken up with her boyfriend of six weeks. How angry would you be if someone tried to say, ""suck it up, that's not a real problem?"" They're upset because it is a real problem to them, so don't be a total jerk and try and minimize their issues.


If your friend mopes about a short-term break-up for way too long, then you can deal with it later. But, in the first moments, you should be a friend, not a bully.
Don't offer dumb, useless comments like, ""It's not the end of the world,"" ""You'll get over it,"" or ""It's really not that big of a deal.""

, Phil.) Unless your friend turns to you and says, ""What do you think I should do?"" you should not jump in and tell your friend the five best courses of action, in your humble opinion. It will come off as condescending: like you think your friend's problems can be solved so easily if they're weren't such dunces. Unless your friend is looking up at you with doe eyes, saying, ""I don't know what to do..."" give it time before you offer any advice.


To be honest, you probably don't know the best course of action either. Unless you're a trained psychiatrist or have first-hand experience, you're just as in the dark as them.
You can say simple things like, ""You should get some rest,"" or ""Drink some chamomile tea and you'll feel better"" just to offer your friend some minor comfort, but don't say things like, ""I think you should call Bill right now and sort things out,"" or ""I think you should apply to grad school right away."" You're just making it up on the spot, whether you admit it or not.

, This is another way to quickly annoy your friend. Unless you had once found yourself in an identical situation, you shouldn't say, ""I know exactly how you feel..."" because your friend will want to scream, ""It's not the same!"" And it's probably not the same! Take you ego out of this, it isn't about you, it is about your friend. Sure, if the friend is upset because of a serious break-up and you happened to go through one of those puppies too, you can talk about it. But don't compare your three-month relationship to your friend's three-year relationship -- admit it is different.


Saying, ""I can't imagine how you feel"" is better than ""I know exactly what you're going through..."" You don't know exactly what they're going through -- you're not them!
Sure, it can be comforting for your friend to know that someone else had been through the same situation and survived, but if this is the case, you have to phrase it delicately. Be more reassuring, ""you're an amazing person, and you can handle this,"" then self-assured, ""I got through this exact thing, so you can too.""

, Not everyone who is upset wants affection or a kind ear. Some people deal better with things alone, and some people may want to be left alone after talking a problem through. Think about it -- how often have you just wanted some peace and quiet when you feel bad? Don't stick around if you're not wanted; if your friend says he or she needs some alone time, chances are he or she means it.


If you think your friend is in danger of harming him or herself, you must stick around whether they want it or not.


, Maybe there's a concrete solution and you can help fix it. Sometimes, there is no good solution but a bucketful of ice cream and a bunch of really crappy movies. Just ask -- don't feel like you need to read their mind in order to be Mr. Super-Friend.


If they say nothing, then just let them be, already! They're not playing games, they want to be alone.
If your friend thinks that you're doing so much for him or her and feels bad about it, remind that friend of a time when he or she was there for you when you really needed it. That's what friends are for, isn't it?

, If your friend isn't suffering from a major loss, then you can cheer him or her up by making a small joke or acting like a goofball. If they don't respond, don't push it! But if you give it some time and start trying to cheer your friend up through laughter, it may pay off. Laughter really is the best medicine, and if you can make a joke about the situation that isn't offensive, or just poke fun at yourself to distract your friend, it'll offer some temporary relief.


Obviously, if your friend is absolutely devastated, then humor is not your best bet.

, Keep them as busy as possible. You don't have to drag your friend out to the clubs or put together an elaborate surprise party. You should come over to your friend's house with a movie and a big 'ole tub of popcorn. Go for a walk. Keeping your friend busy can take some of the pain away, even if your friend is resisting at first. They'll need some prodding, and some ""fun patrolling,"" but that's what you're there for.


Your friend may say something like, ""I don't want to hang out because I'm just going to be a major downer..."" and you can say, ""That's ridiculous! I love hanging out with you no matter what.""
Your friend may be hanging out in his cave-like bedroom. Just getting him or her out of the house and into some fresh air, even if you're only walking to the coffee shop down the street, will do him good physically and mentally.

, If your friend is really upset, then it's likely that he or she is neglecting his basic duties and chores. That's where you come in. If your friend is forgetting to eat, bring over some lunch or come over and cook dinner. If your friend hasn't done laundry in two months, bring over some detergent (you'll both be thankful for it). Pick up your friend's mail. If he or she is staying home from school, pick up his homework assignments. These little favors may not seem like that big of a deal when your friend is incredibly upset, but they do add up.


They aren't a helpless little puppy, but they do need some coddling and support if they are particularly upset. Don't treat them like a baby, treat them like a friend who just needs an extra leg to stand on.

, Unless you and your friend have identical schedules, it's inevitable that you will be spending some time apart. But if you know your friend is really upset you can't just fly off the grid completely. No one wants to be asked ""Are you okay?!?!"" constantly, but they do want to see their friends and have a decent convo every once in a while.


Be slicker than, ""I'm just calling to see how you're doing."" Make up an excuse to call, like asking if your friend has seen your brown coat, and then end up asking your friend to lunch. Or just tell them a story from your day! Again -- this is simple stuff when you really think about it -- you're just being a good friend!

, You will rarely solve a friend's problems for him or her, or even find the best solution. Usually, your friend has to wait it out or figure it out on his or her own, even though it sucks in the meantime. What you can do most of the time is be a shoulder for your friend to cry on, a comforting voice to listen to in the middle of the night, and a source of kindness, reason, and comfort.


Make an effort to clear up your schedule and to devote more time to being there for your friend. He or she will be grateful for the effort you have made to make him or her feel better.
Don't give up your life for theirs. At the end of the day, this is their baggage to work through. You are there as support, not as a savior.

Keep the romance simple.",How to Attract a Libra Man," Libra is definitely an extrovert who loves to socialize and be around other people. You'll often find him in groups, standing out as the life of the party. If you want to attract him, your best bet is to cross paths with him as often as possible in his natural setting: a crowd.;
, Since most Libra males have a tendency to be friendly with a lot of people in any given crowd, you'll need to do more than just hang around him. Instead of lingering in the back of the room where no one can see, you need to make yourself the center of attention, even if only for a few moments.

, Libra is friendly—sometimes, a little too friendly. Your Libra man is probably flirty with a lot of other women without necessarily meaning anything by it. For some women, this will be a turn off, but others may not consider it to be a big deal. If you have any hope of winning your Libra man's affections, you need to belong to the latter group. Hang around long enough until the rest of his admirers lose patience with his flirtatious ways.


Keep in mind that Libras rarely have favorites. Even if you attract him quickly, he might also be attracted to several other women within his social circles. If you want his budding attraction for you to win out over the attraction he feels toward other women, you need to stick things out for as long as possible.

, Your style should be classic, clean, and refined. Avoid fashion choices that are excessively bold or those that are too cutesy.


Avoid jarring color choices, bold patterns, or temporary trends that are here today and gone tomorrow. Excessively girly fashions, like lace and bows, can also be a turn-off.
Opt for classic, clean-cut styles in a traditional color palette. Choose elegance rather than trendiness.
The theme of refinement should also extend into your make-up and accessories. Use your make-up to enhance your natural beauty and avoid caking it on or trying out dramatic looks. Any jewelry you wear should accent your look without competing for attention.

, Within the zodiac, Libra is represented by the image of scales, and with good reason. Your Libra hunk gravitates toward balanced situations and people. When you first start talking to him, have a pleasant, mild-mannered attitude and present an overall balanced aura.


Similarly, when you invite a Libra into your own personal space—your office, your car, your apartment—make sure that he's greeted with refined, balanced style.

, It's not that Libra is narcissistic, but as someone with an outgoing personality, he does have a definite tendency to ramble on about himself and the things that interest him. If you want to impress him, let him talk to his heart's content and follow along with the conversation sincerely.

, Bring up a topic that might be open for debate and discuss both sides with him. Just remember to keep the conversation intellectual rather than emotional.

, Libra men are usually rather confident and have positive opinions about themselves. A genuine, well-timed compliment or word of praise can go a long way in capturing his attention. When choosing something to compliment on, focus on a typical Libra area of interest, like his sense of taste, style, or justice.


No one trusts an obvious flatterer, not even a Libra man. While he might pardon a blatant appeal to his vanity more than some of the other signs will, a compliment that is clearly untrue or forced lacks the sort of harmony and fairness that a Libra ultimately longs for. As such, any compliments you do make should be as meaningful and truthful as possible.

, Impress your Libra crush by talking to him about a variety of subjects. Libras like to talk, and they like to express ideas and exchange opinions on as many topics as possible. If you can keep him intellectually stimulated, he will find your personality more attractive and enjoyable to be around.


Libras naturally have somewhat of an airy personality, so they feel most inspired when they are allowed to move about from thing to thing. Fixating on any one topic can quickly make a Libra man feel bored., Libras crave balance, and that balance extends beyond your Libra's personal life. As a general rule, Libras have a great sense of dedication to justice and fairness. If you want to seem like an attractive person in his eyes, you need to make sure that he views you as someone with a similar dedication to justice .

, Even though Libras love to be around people, most Libra men have a tendency to be emotionally detached. When he first starts getting to know you, avoid showing too much emotion, either positive or negative.


Try to understand why he feels uncomfortable with emotion. Feelings are messy, especially once those feelings get deep and complicated. The Libra avoids emotions mostly to maintain the sense of harmony and balance he loves so much.
Of course, if you want to be with your Libra man for a long time, you and he will eventually need to confront your emotions together. When the times comes, do so in as calm and rational a manner as possible. While you are only in the introductory stages, though, it's better to avoid heavy emotions as much as possible.

, Related to Libra's distaste for emotions is his aversion to conflict. Even though he likes intellectual debate, emotionally-charged debate tends to be a big turn-off. Keep a calm, casual attitude when dealing with your Libra to avoid sending him running.

, You need to be open and talkative with your Libra, but weaving in a carefully constructed thread of mystery can really catch this inquisitive sign's curiosity and make him long to know more. If you can trigger this sense of longing, you can capture his attraction more readily.


His earliest impressions of you should view you as a “mysterious beauty.” Of course, the longer you're with your Libra, the more that mystery will fade. To pack a strong punch at the start, though, try to be an elusive, nearly inaccessible goal to strive for.

, Most Libras have a bit of an altruistic spirit, so they might be involved in volunteer work of some sort. Even if your guy does not have a charity or cause he actively takes part in, he will likely find someone who does sacrifice her time for a noble purpose exceptionally attractive.


If you are actively volunteering your time somewhere, consider asking your Libra crush along, especially if you are supporting a cause he also happens to believe in. In doing so, you'll become someone who helps him satisfy his own desires to do good works.

, Libra has a hard time focusing on one thing and may find you less attractive if he believes you to be fixated on only one aspect of life. If you want to look like someone who has a balanced, well-rounded personality, you should try having a few different hobbies to talk to him about.

, Most Libra men can really appreciate beauty and culture, so if you want to make his heart skip a beat for you, invite him to the art museum or give him a book with photographs of beautiful scenery. Showing him that you understand what he loves can be a huge plus in your favor.


When you extend an invitation, pick a place that your Libra man will probably enjoy, like an art gallery, arts and crafts fair, or museum.You can appeal to him even more by inviting him out during an active time. For instance, ask him to a special one-day-only exhibit instead of inviting him to the museum during a quiet ""off"" time.

, Along with art and culture, Libra men usually have a strong appreciation for the finer things in life. When you invite him to spend time with you, choose impressive locations like trendy cafes or four-star restaurants. When you give him a gift, consider picking out something tasteful from a designer.


If you do not have the finances to back Libra's love of luxury, fear not! These men are interested in refinement, but that refinement does not necessarily need to cost you an arm and a leg. Try inviting him to a fancy restaurant for dessert only to save you the cost of a meal, or go somewhere with an elegant atmosphere but a moderate cost.

, As social creatures, Libra men love freedom and need to feel unconfined in order to be happy. You can dote on him as much as you want when the two of you are together, but avoid smothering him or forcing your way into areas of his life he hasn't invited you to on his own.


Keep in mind that Libra is an active guy, so once he takes a liking to you, you'll probably know about it. In the meantime, work on him steadily, and avoid pushing your feelings onto him before he is ready for them.

, Libra men love to love, and they love being loved on. Little tokens of appreciation can underscore your feelings for him while making you appear more attractive in his eyes. Try giving him a small gift or note for no reason, or offer a massage at the end of a long day or week.


Refined, tasteful gifts tend to work better than gifts packed with too much sentimentality. You might not be able to afford a designer watch or pricey cufflinks, but you could try offering him a small helping of designer candy or any beautiful yet non-designer item.
If you want a free alternative, you could try writing him a beautiful note. Again, heavy emotions are not quite the Libra's cup of tea, but a letter with a few scribbled verses can make a big impact as long as those verses focus on the beauty of things rather than the intensity of your feelings.

, As mentioned earlier, Libra men can be emotionally detached when you first get to know them, and as such, they tend to avoid women who seem manipulative or who live for drama. When you make your move, avoid getting too serious too quickly. Keep things light, and win him over with gestures of traditional romance: candlelight dinners, moonlit walks, and so on.


Once he starts to return your attraction and affection, be prepared for him to show you what he likes in the romance department. Libra is a natural-born charmer, so when he wants to charm you, he will use a range of romantic tactics to do so. Take note, and increase his attraction to you by responding with similarly romantic gestures.

Subconsciously, a Cancer male will be looking for a woman who fits his image of the ideal wife and mother. Everything from your appearance to your mannerisms should ooze femininity.


Slip on a sensual, flirty outfit before you approach him, like a dress that hugs your curves in all the right places. Floral perfumes in classic scents, like rose, can also create the perfect feminine ambiance around you.Don't try to slip in under the radar as ""one of the guys."" Skip the dirty jokes and witty jabs; instead, speak softly and compassionately. Avoid acting too boyish around him.;
, After you get to know him a little, take the initiative and show off your ability to keep house in a very traditional manner. One of the easiest ways to do this is through cooking. Cook up a meal or treat for him, or invite him over to cook a complex recipe with you.


Keep in mind, however, that the Cancer man is a little more withdrawn and may resist your affections if he believes that you're coming on too fast. Inviting him back to your place for a meal the first time you meet him will probably end in rejection. Wait until you have already established some sort of bond with him before you extend an invitation into your home.

, You should talk about the love you have for your current family as well as any dreams you have about marrying and starting a family of your own. Cancer men generally dream of having children someday, so it'll help your case dramatically if your dreams are in line with his.


When talking about your current family, focus on the maternal side. Talk about things you have learned from your mother or time you have recently spent with your mother. Cancer is a classic mama's boy, and if you can show a love for your mother that rivals the love he has for his own, you can connect to him more easily.In addition to all the “mom” talk, converse with him about pleasant family memories and your childhood.

, As long as your Cancer man has a functional family, he will probably be very close to them. The sooner you can get to know his family, the sooner you can attract him as a potential mate.


Once again, the Cancer man tends to be a mama's boy. If you can meet his mother and get on her good side, you can quickly promote yourself in his eyes.
If he did not have a good relationship with his family growing up, chances are, it was not by his choice. A Cancer man who did not receive the love of family from his actual family will probably view his circle of friends as his family, instead. In this case, your best bet is to get on good terms with his friends. Focus on his female friends, though, since getting too cozy with his male buddies might cause him to distrust your affection for him.

, Invite him to talk about his own family and connect other topics of conversation back to his family as often as possible. Always do so in a positive light, though, and avoid anything that could sound like an insult toward those he loves.


For instance, if you've seen his mother and he shares some resemblance with her, mention it to him.
You could also try complimenting the relationship he has with his siblings or remarking on how much you think a certain family member might enjoy the great new band/restaurant/book/movie you're talking about.

, Cancers are neat, orderly guys. As such, they will generally find women who can be equally organized more appealing than those who are complete slobs. Any space you claim in front of the Cancer male should be clean. Even if you are unable to keep up with his level of tidiness, you need to make a good effort at it.


In other words, don't invite him into your personal space if your desk is covered in papers or if your apartment is covered in dirty laundry. You do not need to have everything labeled and filed away into neat little packages, but some basic cleanliness and a lack of clutter will go a long way.

, If you do have a cluttered area, tell him about it before he finds out on his own by asking him to help you organize it. The appeal of this petition is three-fold: you'll make him feel needed, you'll appeal to his natural love of organization, and you'll demonstrate a willingness to become less messy and more organized yourself.

, The occasional romantic surprise is fine, but as a general rule, avoid making any sudden wild suggestions or demanding something without any warning. Cancer guys like to keep all aspects of their life organized. This includes both physical space and intangible time.

, Cancers like to assume the traditional male role of provider and protector. Give him the chance to provide for you in some way by asking for his help. The situation does not need to be anything major, but it helps if you choose a task that your Cancer dreamboat usually excels at so that he can complete it thoroughly and impressively.


Ask him for help when you move into a new office or apartment, or if you go shopping for a new car. If nothing quite so dramatic lies ahead of you, however, look for smaller excuses. For example, ask his opinion about a dilemma you have at work, even if you've secretly solved the issue yourself.

, Even though Cancers like to assume a traditional male role, they are also fairly in touch with their emotions. They crave love on an emotional level, so don't be afraid to shower them with affection. The more your actions demonstrate your affection, the more likely your Cancer man is to respond in kind.

, Offer a kind word about his appearance, his skills, or the way he makes you feel. Compliments make your Cancer feel good about himself, and he can appreciate a woman who gives him the sort of buzz you'll provide whenever you tell him how wonderful he is.


Make sure that your compliments are genuine and subtle, though. If a Cancer man suspects that you are trying to flatter him, he might become uncomfortable and start to withdraw from you.

, Plus, showing your own willingness to open up can demonstrate how much you want him or need him in your life.


Remember that Cancers tend to be insecure. The quickest way to establish a sense of emotional security with your Cancer crush is to make the first emotional investment.

, Everyone is wrong sometimes, and the Cancer man is no exception. That said, since Cancers are so emotionally reactive, they tend to lash out when directly contradicted or corrected in a harsh manner.


When you need to correct him, be tactful and persuasive.Rely solely on reason to make your point and try not to get emotional or reactive.
Similarly, when he gets angry or upset, do not lash back in response. Wait for him to calm down on his own rather than trying to force him into a calmer state.

, Oftentimes, real attraction is not instantaneous with a Cancer man. You will need to enter within his field of vision on a fairly regular basis before he comes to appreciate your presence there.

, Cancers tend to be shy, so gather up your courage and approach him first. The key is to present yourself in a non-aggressive way. Introduce yourself and cement your existence in his mind, but never push or pry your way inside his personal bubble, especially if he seems uncomfortable.


You'll need to be assertive, but indirectly so. Persistence is important here. Show him that you're genuinely interested in him by continually making the effort to approach him. A Cancer guy can be a little insecure at times, but once you calm those insecurities and demonstrate that your interest is real and lasting, he can feel comfortable enough to develop his own attraction and affection for you in return.

, Dealing with a Cancer man can be incredibly complex and may test your patience. As someone who likes to assume the traditional male role in a relationship, he will probably want to confess his feelings first and may find you less attractive if you jump first. On the other hand, you have to make your feelings so obviously clear to him that he has very little reason to doubt your attraction to him.

, Cancer men are usually attracted to women who will share their feelings, but you'll be even more attractive if you demonstrate a willingness to really listen to everything he says. He needs to open up at his own pace and may do so slowly, but if you want to become an attractive person in his eyes, you'll need to be a trustworthy presence every step of the way.


Occasionally, you should make it a point to demonstrate that you've been actively listening to him. Remember his birthday or any other special days he mentions to you. If he tells you about something he has going on at work in a few days, ask him how it went after the event passes.

, You might be tempted to prod his affections along by flirting with other guys, but doing so can damage or kill any budding attraction he already has for you. Cancer men need to feel that they can completely trust their partners. If you give him even the slightest reason to doubt this early on, he may write you off as a potential mate.

, Once a Cancer starts feeling attracted to you, he will probably become notably more possessive. If you want to nurture his growing attraction, you'll need to find ways of coping with his perceived invasion into your personal space. If you push him away, he will probably stay away for good.


Of course, you should always mind your own needs when pursuing a potential relationship, even when doing so can chase away the guy you've set your sights on. If his possessiveness becomes dangerous or otherwise unnerving, walk away and don't look back. Even if his possessiveness seems innocent and harmless, though, you should still take a step back if it makes you feel uncomfortable or unhappy.

, His aversion to wild, quick-paced actions and his dedication to family make the Cancer guy a poor candidate for a fling. If you want to attract him in the hopes of starting a long-term relationship, though, you'll probably have much greater success.

This at any time, you never know which twin you're going to get! One minute she'll be laughing and childlike, and the next minute she'll be serious and reserved. If you can handle both sides, you have a chance with this dynamic female.


You never know what you're going to get with a Gemini, so if you're looking for a girl to be consistent and always caring for you, you'd be better off courting a different sign, Virgo. She can be submissive and feminine but also dominant and masculine. If she's a true Gemini, she'll have a balance .;
, Gemini women are unstoppable when it comes to their quick wit and creativity. They'll banter with you, do plays-on-words, and whip out their novel or painting that's in the works when you least expect it. She likely spends her free time doing something related to music, art, or literature.


A gemini girl is the type who can ""dish it out"" and also take it. She can take a joke if you poke fun at her flirtatiously, but you better expect her to have a cutting, witty remark to make back at you!

, There is a side to Gemini that is very young, childish, flighty, and immature. There almost has to be to balance her almost overly mature, serious side. However, she can't always control when it comes out. The ""younger twin"" may come out when she's meeting your parents or in the middle of a conference – who knows!


A Gemini benefits well from a person who can reign in the more radical sides of her disposition. A person who brings out their immaturity could lead to dangerous situations, while a person who brings out their darker, serious side could lead to no fun. It's best if you are well-balanced yourself.

, If you have this girl around, one minute you could be reading poetry on the couch together and the next she's left you a note saying she's on vacation in Italy. This girl is curious and always looking for the next adventure, so when this side comes out, it's unstoppable.


This unpredictability gets to certain people. It's easy to mistake it for her not being loving or caring enough, when really she does care, she just needs to do her own thing. What's more, she's seeing if you'll be around when she gets back.

, Most Geminis are too smart and too good to value simple girly things, like cosmetics and magazines. She knows she's naturally beautiful, so why bother? And when it comes to magazines, no thank you. She'd rather be found reading Tolstoy or Hemingway.


That is not to say a Gemini isn't feminine – she is. Well, at least half of her is. She just doesn't see the point of these things society says girls should like. And if you talk with her about it, you'll likely come away convinced of the same!

, A Gemini girl wants someone who can sweep her off her feet physically and mentally. She needs to know you can match her when it comes to anything. The last thing she wants is a partner that she feel superior over – she wants someone she can share the glory with.


When you're with her, talk to her about the book you're reading. Ask her if she'd like to go to a museum. Mention an article you read the other day about a little known current event. She'll find you intriguing and wonder what it is she can learn from you.

, Gemini has two sexual sides – submissive and dominant. You'll see her be coy and subtly flirtatious, batting an eyelash here and there, and then you'll see her being dominant, asking you out and making the moves. When this happens, roll with the punches! Let her take charge when she needs to take charge and take over the reigns when she's done.


She doesn't need someone who's just dominating enough or just submissive enough – she needs someone who can handle and complement whichever side she's currently showing.

, Geminis are notoriously very social creatures. When their childlike side comes out especially, they can be quite the chatterbox. When she's off on her tangent or telling you every little detail of the book she's reading, sit back and relax, allowing her the spotlight. Watch her go. Let her entertain you.


Since Gemini needs someone who can stimulate her mind, ask her questions. Pose thoughts or theories. Talk to her about what you're thinking or wondering about. You may open her up and get onto an exciting ride!

, A Gemini loves to be surprised, intrigued, and entertained. As you begin your relationship, she'll want to do things that aren't exactly traditional. Ask her to go make pottery or to go to a cheese tasting. She'll be very impressed with your originality and ingenuity.


Don't feel pressured to keep this up all the time. She has two sides – once you've shown her that you can handle her more difficult side (the curious, adventurous one), show her that you can relax, too, in pajamas and with a movie and take-out.

, A Gemini can be emotionally unavailable and difficult to pin down one minute, and loving and nurturing the next. This sounds a little mentally unstable, but it's just the nature of this sign. However, for their partner, this can be a little unnerving. You'll have to work at the relationship, surviving the times when she's distant and being available when she's ready to return.


Remember: this isn't all about you. While she is very hesitant to get into a relationship, she is by no means unfaithful or unloving. Half of why she is hard to pin down is because she wants to make sure that when she is, it's totally and completely worth it.

, A Gemini girl needs to be kept on her toes. Since she's so full of surprises, she wants a partner that can be surprising, too. Tell her you're going out for dinner when really you planned a night at the planetarium. Bring home a song you wrote for her that you've been keeping from her. It's little things like that a Gemini will truly appreciate.


Keep her guessing with your personality, too. If you're not outdoorsy, ask her to go on a hike. If you're not huge into music, offer to go to the opera. If she thinks she can't pin you, you'll have her pinned.

, There's a very independent side to Gemini. She needs to be left alone at times and given space to find her own adventure. Don't be unnerved when this happens – she's not slipping away from you, she's just doing her own thing. And there's nothing wrong with that! She'll come back, raving about all her experiences that she wants to share with you.


If her independent streak bothers you, open up a forum for communication about it. She'll love talking to you, knowing how you feel, and explaining how she feels. She'll likely appreciate your concern and try to please you as much as she can.

, The thing about a Gemini is that once she's finally decided that she'll commit to you openly, she can get pretty jealous. She's spent a ton of time deciding if you're worth a serious commitment, which is a little scary for her. If she feels you slipping away, she may not be able to handle it well.


Think of this as a declaration of love and not something that's aggravating. All it means is that she cares about you and wants to be sure you're hers.
Do keep in mind though, that if you purposefully make her jealous, she'll be onto you and she likely won't put up with it.

, As you get to know her, you'll probably be able to tell which side of her you're dealing with. Knowing what to expect and handling her swings properly can keep the relationship flowing healthily for a very long time. She'll feel safe in your arms this way, too.


Simply accepting that these two dynamics of her personality are here to stay is the biggest challenge for any partner of a Gemini. Once you reach that point, the rest of the relationship will be smooth sailing.

Listen to your friend.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Spend time with your friend.,
Give physical comfort.,
Learn to empathize, not sympathize.,
Make life easier for her.,
Send her gifts.",How to Cheer Up a Friend1," Listening is one of the most important things you can do for someone who is hurting. Active listening shows that you care about your friend and he or she is being heard. Often, intently listening is more valuable than any other gesture.When you're really listening make sure that there are no other distractions. This means don't check your phone, don't try to talk to other people.
Try to make eye contact with her while she's talking. You don't need to stare, but eye contact shows that you're paying attention and that you're engaged. It's also a good way to avoid being distracted.
Let her know you can be the person she can call any time of day or night. Sometimes friends will lean on you, other times you will lean on them. Being a friend means being available, even when it's inconvenient.;
, Instead of jumping in with your feelings, perceptions and experiences, ask questions about your friend's experience. When your friend talks about her break-up, for example, ask her about what she's feeling and what she needs from you.


Instead of asking, ""Are you sad?"", consider asking ""What emotions are you feeling?"" and ""Is there anything I can do to help you?"".

, When people are sad, it's easy to want to crawl into a cave and want to be alone. But humans function better when social needs are met. Too much isolation can cause mental and physical breakdown.Think about enjoyable experiences that you can have together. Being there physically for your friend and engaging in fun activities will help bring cheer to your friend.


Offer to come over and hang out, watch a movie, or get food together. Any way that you can spend quality time together is beneficial.

, Touching is a language all its own and it can be used to convey the idea that you are there for your friend, that your friend is safe with you. It's good to check in with your friend before you offer physical comfort, because she may not appreciate touch.A hug can be truly important and healing. If your friend is upset, especially if she's feeling highly emotional, a hug or even a touch on her arm can send the signal that you are here for her and that she is safe.
If your friend is uncomfortable with touch, bring your dog over or encourage your friend to cuddle with her cat. Animals can be very comforting and many people feel safe petting a dog or cat.

, Sympathy is about feeling sorry for someone, rather than feeling pain with your friend. You want to feel what your friend is feeling and let her know that you're engaging in their pain with her.For example: say your friend Mary recently lost her husband. Sympathy would be saying ""Poor Mary. I feel so sorry for you for losing your husband."" Empathy, on the other hand, would be saying ""Oh Mary, I feel your pain about losing your husband and how much you loved him.""

, When a friend is experiencing something that hurts her deeply, it can be difficult to do even the most basic activities. Let her know that you're here to help by taking on some of those tasks and making life easier for her.


You can offer to cook meals, or help clean the house. Housework, especially, has a tendency to fall by the wayside when someone is upset.
You can offer to go shopping, or drive her to a doctor's appointment.
Think about ways to help that will be most helpful to your friend and bring her some cheer.
Always ask your friend how you can help instead of assuming that something will make her feel better. Don't make assumptions when you are there to help.

, Who doesn't cheer up even a little when given a gift? This can help your friend remember that people still care. You can't always be physically present for you friend, but you can make sure that she doesn't feel like she's suffering alone.


Bake her favorite cookies and mail them to your friend with a note telling them how much you care for her.
Pick up something that reminds you of her and send it with a card.
Send her little things to make her laugh: a funny card, a funny story about something you saw, pictures of the two of you doing silly things from a long time ago. Keep it light and think about what will make your friend smile.

"
"
Go for a walk.,
Have a movie night.,
Be Silly together.,
Do something new together.,
Help someone else together.,
Take a trip.",How to Cheer Up a Friend2," Sometimes a change of scenery can help distract your friend from whatever it is that is upsetting her. Take a walk around your area and keep your eye out for cool or unusual, or funny sights.


Be present. Instead of talking about whatever the problem is, look at the color of the sky, or discuss what that weird smell might be. Watch the animals and engage with the environment.

, Movies and tv shows can be a great way to help your friend keep her mind off her troubles, at least for a little while.


Avoid upsetting films. For example: if her father has recently died of cancer, avoid movies where a parent dies, or where someone has cancer. Likewise, if your friend has recently been dumped, movies about relationships tend to be the wrong way to go. Keep it light and enjoyable.

, Silliness is a great way to distract from pain and encourage smiles and laughter. After all, ""laughter is the best medicine"" as the age-old saying goes. Laughter also has health benefits and improves some bodily functions.Take a stroll back in time to childhood. Make snow angels or a blanket fort, only talk to each other in outrageous voices, or replace walking with skipping or jumping.
Do some silly art, such as drawing silly self-portraits or writing silly poems.

, Doing something new and unusual is a great distraction and can increase happiness.It means that you're having to think about the new thing instead of focusing on whatever it is she's upset about.


Try a new workout class at the gym, make crafts together, plant a garden, or paint.
Don't spring a new thing on your friend without checking with her first. This could overwhelm and upset her, which is the opposite of what you want.

, Helping other people lowers stress, heightens compassion, and heightens capacity for resilience.Someone who is going through a difficult time has need of all of these things.


Volunteer for something. Volunteering is a great way to foster community, do good in someone else's life, and participate in something important. Volunteer at a soup kitchen, or volunteer to walk dogs at the animal shelter. Be a reading buddy for children or offer time at a nursing home.
Help cheer up a different friend. Sometimes working together to help someone else in their problems can help cheer someone up, because it helps take the focus away from one's own life difficulties.
Do something nice for someone else. You can cook for a different friend or create a card from both of you.

, Sometimes a great way to distract your friend from unhappiness is to take a trip. Travel introduces new sights and new places and keeps your friend from wallowing in whatever unhappiness she's dealing with.


You can opt for a long vacation: touring Europe, or hiking the John Muir trail, or road tripping through Canada.
You can also choose something smaller: a weekend getaway at a nearby beach, a couple days backpacking in the mountains, or road tripping to the next city to see a band you both love.

Allow your friend to be sad.,
Resist avoiding your friend.,
Keep the focus on your friend.,
Avoid offering solutions unless they ask for them.",How to Cheer Up a Friend3," Avoid saying things like “cheer up.” This is one of the worst things you can say to someone who is upset, especially if she's struggling with depression or anxiety. When you say this you're telling your friend not to be sad. Telling someone to ""cheer up"" is putting focus on you more than your friend. You're saying that your feelings of discomfort about her unhappiness is more important than her unhappiness. And that is something a friend should never do. It's important to experience emotions, even when they are unpleasant.Don't tell someone how to feel; everyone is entitled to feeling and expressing emotions.

, Sometimes it can be hard to know what to say when confronted with a friend who is in pain. Don't avoid your friend because you feel awkward about talking about her problem. Instead, focus on what you can say that is supportive. Often you don't need to say anything other than ""I'm so sorry. I'm here for you if you need anything.""

, Don’t make her pain all about you. This is a mistake that a lot of people make! You think that you're relating to your friend and her problems, but instead you're turning it into a you-fest.


You can relate to your friend, but make sure that it doesn’t turn into you telling lots of stories how you went through something similar and that you're just fine now.
For example, don't say: ""I know what it feels like to be broken up with. Remember when Jordan dumped me in front of everyone? I was feeling so awful about it all the time, but I also got over it. I've been doing really well about the break-up lately.""
Instead, consider saying something like this: ""I know that it really hurts right now. I can promise that you'll feel better later, but right now you're going to feel really unhappy. I'm here for you in whatever you need.""

, Often people don't want you to offer them solutions, especially when they're venting about a situation. What many people want is to feel like they've been heard and that someone knows what they've going through.


For example don't say: ""I know your cat just died. Maybe you should hit up the shelter and get a new one. There's so many cats that need a good home."" This feels invalidating about the emotions your friend has about her dead cat.
Instead you might say: ""I was so sorry to hear about your cat. I know you loved her so much. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.""

"
"
Take care of yourself.,
Know when to encourage your friend to seek professional help.,
Call outside help if your friend is in danger.",How to Cheer Up a Friend4," If you're feeling overwhelmed by your friend's emotions and problems you may need to take a break. It can be draining to be the constant emotional support for someone else. Make sure that you aren't their only means of support. There is a difference between being supportive and being a caretaker to a friend. Know the difference, and be prepared to set limits.If your friend is always calling and wanting you to do things for them, be prepared to say no. It's ok to acknowledge your other responsibilities. Say: ""I know you are hurting and would like a friend. I care about you and want to help you. I need you to respect my time, too and tonight is not a good time for me. Let's find time this weekend"".
Don't let your life slip. Keep engaging with other friends, going to the gym, and doing other regular activities. Don't let your friend take over all of your time.

, Sometimes people can't deal with emotion and events on their own. In that case, as a friend, you may need to recommend that she get professional help. There is nothing wrong with needing a little extra help, especially with things like marriage break-ups, the deaths of loved ones, and illness.


Watch for signs of depression: difficulty with concentrating or remembering details, difficulties with making decisions, decreased energy, insomnia or excessive sleeping, sad anxious or empty thoughts, physical pains and issues that do not go away with treatment, thoughts or discussion of suicide, feelings or worthlessness or helplessness.When you're discussing the idea of seeking professional help, don't tell your friend that she is sick and needs to go into therapy. Say something like: ""I know that you're really hurting and I think it might be a good idea to talk to someone who can really help you. Remember that I'm here for you.""

, If your friend is in a violent or abusive situation, or if she is threatening to commit suicide, the best thing you can do as a friend is to call emergency services. This is a situation that you are not equipped to handle, and it is best left to experts. Being a friend means prioritizing safety. Make sure your friend is safe and that her life is not in danger.


If you suspect abuse, you can call The National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) or live chat online with http://www.loveisrespect.org/.
If you believe your friend is suicidal, you can call The National Suicide Prevention Hotline (1-800-273-TALK).

Bring your family member with AD to the doctor regularly.,
Find a caregivers’ support group.",How to Care for an Alzheimer's Patient As a Family," If you are a family that communicates openly, honestly, and regularly, you will need to put those attributes to use to care for your loved one with AD. If you aren’t such a family, you’ll need to work on developing those skills as well. You have to have an open, frank, and ongoing discussion about your loved one’s care needs, plans, and wishes.In the best case scenario, you will hold this discussion while the person diagnosed with AD can still be a full participant. He or she should be given the opportunity to express his or her care preferences, along with questions, concerns, and fears.
This is an important enough conversation that a separate, single focus family meeting should be scheduled. Don’t try to shoehorn it in before dessert at Thanksgiving dinner.
Have a calm discussion about what type of care is needed for both the present and future. Having this conversation will provide a base for avoiding confusion in the future.
Have your family think about their schedules, as well as how to adapt them and coordinate with the primary caregiver for holidays and vacations.
Each family member should consider their own strengths and skills that they can offer.
Be sure to show appreciation, reassurance, and positivity to the primary caregiver. This person needs a special amount of support.
Think about your family's current limits financially, emotionally, and personally.
Consider getting a professional care manager. These people are usually licensed nurses or social workers specializing in care for older adults.;
, Almost inevitably, one person (often a spouse or child) becomes the single primary caregiver for a loved one with AD, no matter how involved others intend to be. Try to divide responsibilities among family members fairly, but also accept that practical matters like available time, proximity, and individual skills must play key roles in the process.For instance, a sister who lives 100 miles away should probably not be the day-to-day primary caregiver, while a brother who can’t balance his own checkbook probably shouldn’t be in charge of getting the financial, legal, and medical documents in order.
Create a “care notebook” that can be distributed and regularly updated. An actual, old-fashioned binder will do, but you'll probably find a virtual ""notebook"" that can be remotely accessed more practical. Regardless of format, it should include important information on the Alzheimer’s patient’s care (medications, doctor information, etc.) as well as an agreed-upon breakdown of individual care responsibilities among family members.If at any point you feel an overwhelmed, seek help from a friend or a professional, such as social worker or geriatric care manager. Your family and other geriatric care professionals should work together as a team to find solutions for taking care of your loved one with Alzheimer’s disease.

, In some respects, caring for a loved one with AD is similar to providing end-of-life care over what can be a significantly longer period. In either instance, dealing with lots of important paperwork (and making important decisions) is a component of the caregiving process. Make sure you discuss important legal, financial, and healthcare matters with the gathered family, and include the Alzheimer’s patient if his or her condition permits an active role.

Beyond issues like making sure bills are paid and various policies and plans are kept up-to-date, you should make sure your loved one has both a valid will and a living will (which designates healthcare wishes, among other things).
While it can sometimes cause disagreements and hard feelings, it is often best if an individual family member is granted a durable power of attorney (to make important legal and/or financial decisions), and that the same or another individual family member is appointed the AD patient’s healthcare proxy. All family caregivers should have input, but sometimes there needs to be a single “decider.”
Find resources in your area or online that will give you information about putting the important paperwork together and having a durable power of attorney for health care and asset management. You can look online at the websites of the Family Caregivers' Alliance and National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (for estate planning).

, Even if your family gets along quite well, expect disagreements and arguments when caring for a loved one with AD. The realities of caregiving alter existing family dynamics, and can bring longstanding tensions or new disputes to the surface. When times get tough, keep the main goal in mind — providing the compassionate care that your loved one deserves after a lifetime of caring for you.Express your feelings and opinions openly and honestly in regular gatherings, and respect the perspectives of other family caregivers. If there are differences that cannot be overcome, seek the assistance of an outside facilitator — such as a counselor, clergy member, or perhaps the AD patient’s doctor.As an example, deciding if and when an Alzheimer’s patient should leave home and move into some type of care facility can often cause family friction. Opinions among family members are bound to vary and be difficult to adjust. Seeking the counsel of someone with experience dealing with Alzheimer’s patients may help facilitate compromise.You can also find a support group for caregivers. Support groups can help you realize that you are not alone. Many other families are also going through similar experience. You can find both live and online supports groups; look at The Alzheimer's Association website to find one near you.

, The constant care demands of advanced Alzheimer’s patients, in particular, may make your other family members feel more like fellow caregivers (working different shifts) than siblings, cousins, etc. Seize opportunities to spend time together under enjoyable circumstances like holiday gatherings or birthday parties. Leave your frustrations and disagreements as caregivers aside for a few hours.Involve your loved one with AD in these gatherings whenever possible. Make sure he or she is still treated as a living, breathing, full member of the family. Make practical adjustments when having gatherings at home (like perhaps limiting the number of visitors at any one time or scheduling events earlier in the day, when most AD patients do better) or in public places (like choosing a restaurant that is familiar and accessible to your loved one).
It is important to remind yourself that the disease, not the person with AD, presents challenges to your life and family. Keep things in perspective, and find humor when you can.

, As the mental and physical decline associated with Alzheimer’s moves along its irregular but inevitable path, the risk of injuries due to accidents or confusion will continue to grow. Work as a family to identify and address safety concerns in your loved one’s home — or at whatever location it is that he or she now calls home.


Make changes such as removing trip hazards, locking away sharp or dangerous objects, and adding bright colors and large-print signs (such as a “TOILET INSIDE” sign on the bathroom door) to make the residence safer and more suited to the AD patient’s needs and abilities.
Reassure your family member with AD that they are safe and that you are there to help. These reminders should be really kind and helpful, especially when the person is confused or upset.
Provide comfortable shoes with good traction. Clear out any walking spaces in the house that might cause your family member with AD to stumble or fall. Some potential hazards you might move are rugs and doormats.

, Confusion is one of the hallmark symptoms of AD, and it can lead to fear, anger, and hostility on the part of the patient. Setting and keeping a regular daily routine helps keep things more familiar, and may help to limit confusion and anxiety at least to some degree.Keep things simple. You should map out a daily routine for you and your family. If it helps, create a schedule that outlines the entire day, with each family member's responsibilities marked clearly.
You can vary activities — a puzzle one day before lunch, looking at photo albums the next — but try to keep a consistent daily schedule (wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast, take pills, do some light exercises, listen to some music together, etc.). Identify each activity in the daily routine for your loved one.
Make sure, in particular, that dressing, eating, and bathing times remain consistent. Changing these routines can be really challenging for someone with AD.
Be careful of ""sundowning."" Sundowning often occurs for AD patients at night and consists of the person experiencing restlessness and agitation as the sun goes down. Be prepared for this. In the evening, foster a calm and quiet atmosphere. Keep the lights low, reduce the noise level, and play soothing music. Try playing music from the time of your loved one's youth to help lessen confusion and agitation.
Try to minimize naps.
Make time for exercise, such as light walking, so that your loved one with AD can have a more restful night's sleep.
Try to ensure that all caregivers are following similar routines for the sake of consistency. Communicate with your other family members regularly on this topic.

, Each case of Alzheimer’s progresses differently, but patients eventually lose a significant amount of their communication skills, especially verbal ones. Even once it begins to be a challenge to understand what your loved one is trying to say, keep talking with — not at — him or her. Learn to pick up on non-verbal communication cues, like facial expressions and hand gestures, as well.Tell family members and visitors to talk to your loved one with AD, even if a coherent conversation is impossible. Remind them not to speak as though the person isn’t there.
Be aware of the tone and pitch of your voice. Do your best to sound calm and respectful, even if you are frustrated.
Be patient with your loved one's angry outbursts. Remind yourself that this is the result of the disease.
Take a ""timeout"" if you get frustrated. Leave the room and sit outside for a few minutes. Do some deep breathing to calm yourself down.
Ask questions that require a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.
Allow extra time for your loved one to listen to you.
Talk to your family member in a well-lit room.
Face the person as your are talking to them.

, In addition to talking as though an AD patient is not present in the room, people sometimes (and usually without any malicious intent) lose sight of treating AD patients with dignity and respect. They might, for instance, change soiled clothing in plain view of others. Remind yourself and others that no matter the progression of the disease, the patient is still a person — and a very important person to you.Work together as a family of caregivers to ensure that basic hygiene and grooming efforts are kept up, especially if your loved one took special pride in his or her appearance. When it comes to clothing, for instance, emphasize comfort and simplicity in getting items on and off, but don’t allow your loved one to sit in the same dirty clothes for days.

, Alzheimer’s at present cannot be cured, stopped, or substantially delayed, and your loved one’s condition will continue to worsen. The transition from mild to moderate to severe AD can happen quickly, or can take many years. Take measures recommended or approved by your loved one’s medical team to try to delay the worsening of symptoms, but accept that your primary goal as a caregiving family will inevitably be to create as comfortable and loving of an environment as possible.Whether or not it can actually help delay the worsening of the disease, keeping an Alzheimer’s patient physically, mentally, and socially active as long as possible will provide benefits to your loved one and you as a caregiver. See How to Help Alzheimer’s Patients Stay Active for specific advice on this topic.

, People with AD can often have bouts of aggression and irritation. Sometimes these are related to AD, but they could also stem from a range of other things. Keep an eye out for the following things that could be making your loved one upset:


Pain
Constipation
Excessive caffeine
Lack of sleep
Soiled hygiene pad

, No matter how many family members are “pitching in,” caring for someone with Alzheimer’s is physically, mentally, and emotionally draining. Some forty percent of people providing a loved one with AD care experience signs of depression at some point. Everyone needs a break sometimes, and everyone needs help sometimes.Keep in regular contact with other caregiving family members, and let them know when it is all getting to be too much for you. See if someone else in the group can cover for you for a short period of time.
Also, don’t feel as though every free second you have beyond your own work, family, and other responsibilities must be dedicated to caregiving. You have to have some time for yourself and your life, or your caregiving for your loved one will suffer.Learn how to manage stress. Take five deep breaths. Learn to do yoga or meditate.

Take care of yourself. Make sure that you are on top of getting your regular checkups and are exercising, eating, and sleeping well.
Recognize signs of stress as a caregiver. These signs include denial, anger, social withdrawal, anxiety about the future, depression, exhaustion, sleeplessness, irritability, lack of concentration, and health problems. Burnout can damage the health of both yourself and your loved one with AD, so be sure to recognize these signs. If you are feeling burnout, communicate that feeling to your other family members so that they can give you a break for a day.

, Wandering can be a major issues for patients with AD. If wandering is a concern, sign up for a service provided by MedicAlert and Safe Return, which is a network for locating a person with AD who is lost. The service provides ID cards and jewelry with a 24-hour emergency toll-free number so that, when found, the person can be reunited with their family. You can also call the number if you find that your loved one is missing, which activates the search network. Local Alzheimer Association chapters and law enforcement agencies will be notified so they can help look for the missing person.You can lean more here: http://www.alz.org/care/dementia-medic-alert-safe-return.asp


, When you need some help or time away, ask for it; when you sense that another caregiver needs the same, offer your help. Working as a team means anticipating needs and offering whatever contributions you can to support the larger goal.As members of the same family and caregivers for the same loved one, set aside petty differences whenever possible and approach each other with compassion and understanding. Do what you can to help each other, which is certainly what your loved one with AD would have wanted of you.

, No matter how good your intentions, how great your energy levels, and how determined you are to see things through as a family, the time may well come when caring for an Alzheimer’s patient is simply too much for your family group. There is absolutely no shame in this. Always focus on what is best for your loved one with AD, even if that means turning over some amount of care to trained professionals. Outside assistance options for AD patients include but are not limited to:Respite care providers, who will provide full-time care for your loved one for a predetermined (short) period of time, so that you and other family members can get some rest and energy.
Meal service providers, who bring prepared food to your loved one’s home on a regular schedule.
Adult day care programs, which supervise activities for AD patients according to an established schedule.
Home healthcare providers, who can provide services ranging from occasional home visits to 24/7 in-home care.
Geriatric care managers, who make regular home visits and offer care suggestions and assistance in coordinating needed services.

, Bring your loved one to the doctor every 2-4 weeks, especially in the early stages of treatment. In these sessions, the doctor may still be adjusting medication and answering your questions. After those initial stages, bring your loved one to the doctor ever 3-6 months. The doctor will be assessing your family member with AD in different areas: activities of daily living, cognition, comorbid medical and mood disorders, and caregiver status.


The doctor will also be assessing your family, helping you cope, and directing you to resources. They will do their best to help you cope with and manage your stress about your family member with AD.

, You can find comfort, support, and assistance within your family group of caregivers, but sometimes it may be easier to seek out these things from strangers going through the same type of thing as you. With the growing number of cases of AD, there is also a growing number of available AD caregiver support groups.Don't wait to be asked to help. Try to help your family members whenever you can. Sometimes, even simple things, like helping with chores or taking a walk with your loved one, can make the burden of other caretakers feel much lighter. You want to give other caregivers time to recharge, too.
Talk to your loved one’s care team for advice on local caregiver support groups. You can also search for groups online and/or join online support groups. Start your search on recognized sites dedicated to Alzheimer’s care, such as http://www.alz.org/.

Spend more time with guys.,
Hold similar beliefs as the dude you want to bond with.,
Meet guys engaged in similar work.You might find a best bro in your line of work.,
Search for others who share your hobbies.Starting a bromance with someone who understands and can share your hobbies will make the process easier.,
Be open to new experiences.Part of the fun of making a new friend is that you get to learn new things through that person.,
Make time for your bromance.Having a best friend is a big commitment.,
Get your partner's blessing.,
Invite your bro-mate to do something.,
Start out casual.,
Do fun things together.,
Open up emotionally with your buddies.Moving the relationship with another guy forward -- from acquaintance to friend to bromance -- is something that the typical guy often struggles with.,
Support your friend.A solid bromance is one where both parties see the other’s victories as their own.,
Respect your bro’s boundaries.",How to Start a Bromance," Bonding with other men can lead directly to a bromance. Whatever you’re into, try to meet the same people over and over so you can get closer to them over time.Connect with your guy friends through the things you both like to do for work and play, and connect with their friends too. Instead of just having a few beers, watching the game and then calling it a night, consider asking your bro to check out a new band or play Frisbee golf at the park with other friends.


Even if you don't have guy friends already, some men make new friends through their girlfriends or wives. If you are not involved with anyone, then you might consider starting a “guys only” meetup on Meetup.com.;
, If you share ideas with someone, it is easier to create a bromance with them.Similar political or religious ideas could be the foundation of a solid bromance. For instance, if you’re a young conservative, you’ll have more luck striking up a bromance at the Young Men’s Republican Club than you would at a progressive politics forum.


If you are religious, try to start a bromance with a fellow believer at your religious institution -- church, mosque, or synagogue -- of choice.

, People who have similar jobs will be able to admire each other, respect what the other does, and bond with one another over work achievements and struggles. For example, if you and another guy are both professors in the same university’s earth science department, and you both study similar scientific problems, you might spend a lot of time talking about your research, bouncing ideas off one another, and nerding out about the nuances of your work.


If you both share a mutual interest that could transform into a business idea, pursue your dreams––you could end up finding both friendship and financial success. However, bad business decisions can rip apart good friends, so tread carefully before subjecting your bromance to the world of business.
Intense male friendships have been lauded throughout history, and today many bromance pairs can be found in fields such as politics, comedy and acting.

, For instance, if you love rock ‘n’ roll, you’ll improve your odds of finding someone you can have a bromance with if you look for people to start a band with. If you love reading, check your library for book clubs where you could meet like-minded men.


Check meetup.com for groups near you that cater to a multitude of unique interests, including film, astronomy, and reading.
A lot of bromances develop from guys doing things together that their girlfriends/wives aren't interested in: lifting weights at the gym, going to heavy metal shows, playing video games, etc.

, Don’t feel like you have to start a bromance with someone who is exactly like you. Try to stay open to meeting someone who has different interests and life experiences.

, If you have a girlfriend, children, or a busy work life, then you will need to make sure that you can still find time for your friend. Make sure that you set aside enough time to spend with your new friend so that the relationship can grow.


Try setting aside a time once per week for you and your bro to hang out together alone.

, Talk to your girlfriend or wife about wanting a close guy friend.Explain that much in the same way she enjoys her time with her gal pals, you'd be pretty stoked to have a guy friend. In case she's the jealous type, emphasize that a bromance won't take away from your relationship.


Have a conversation with your girlfriend about both of your expectations for spending time together. For example, how many nights per week does your girlfriend expect you to be home? Does you expect to spend most weekend with your bro-mates?
Try to make sure your significant other and your new BFF get along. If you're dating someone and it's getting serious, introduce her to your pal early on. Try to find something they have in common, and be careful not to neglect your date in the presence of your buddy.
Treat your friend's girlfriend or wife with respect. Who your friend decides to be in a relationship with is his business and his choice. Offer him advice if he asks for it, but ultimately, be supportive, not destructive.

, Planning times to hang out after you meet a new potential bro-mate is an important part starting a friendship. If you feel like you have been hitting it off with a guy and you think it might be fun to hang out together, then ask him if he’d be into that.

Try saying something like, “Hey, do you want to go watch the game on Saturday?""
If you need to get his number to contact him about meeting up, then you can say something like, ""Cool. I'll text you about where to meet up. What's your number?""
If you are worried that the guy you want to hang out with thinks you might have romantic intentions, then you can say something like, ""Not to make this awkward, but I'm looking for bros not dates. You too, right?”

, Meeting up for dinner together as a first getting-to-know-each-other session might be too romantic. Instead, stick to something one or both of you would naturally be doing in your spare time instead. For instance, ask your potential bromantic partner for advice about a girl over a beer, or invite him over to check out your vintage car. Keep the conversation and the preliminary man-dates casual in order to make the early stages of the bromance less awkward., Bromance is likely to flourish and deepen when you can share good times and create new, happy memories together. If you have common interests like fishing, bowling, or watching movies, invite a friend to do them with you. Weekly poker nights, daily trips to the gym, or going to see your favorite band together every time they come through town might also be of interest to you and your friend.Hang out with your buddy regularly, and make sure a good chunk of that time is without your significant other(s).

, However, there are many things you can do to step your relationship up a notch:


Share information that you normally keep to yourself. A solid bromance should mean that you will have a trusted ally who you can really be yourself with, and talk about things that are typically off-limits not only to others, but possibly your significant other.
Ask for advice. It not only shows your buddy that you respect his opinion, but it also makes him feel more invested in how things turn out.
Keep it mutual. You don’t want to be blabbering about your life when you know he probably has a secret or two he could share. Ask him how things are going, especially if your friend seems out of character. Don't prod; a simple ""You seem off, dude, is something up?"" should do the trick. If he says he's fine, leave it be.

, If your friend gets a new job, for instance, tell him how happy you are for him. Insist on celebrating by going out to the bar or doing something you two like to do together. Expect that your friend, in turn, will support you.


Applaud your friend when he gets married, promoted, or achieves professional or personal recognition.
When things go wrong for your friend, let him know that you’re there to support him.This will deepen your bromance. For instance, if your friend’s girlfriend just broke up with him, tell him that you feel really awful about his situation. Tell him about a time you broke up with a romantic partner and how you got over it.
Empathize with your bromantic buddy’s situation. Listen to what they have to say and let them know that you care by nodding when they talk, and calling or texting to express you’re thinking of them.

, Don’t expect your friend to comply with unreasonable favors like, for instance, extending you a large personal loan. Bromance does not require that you or your friend give up who you are. Stay true to yourself, and don’t do anything out-of-character just because you’re trying to impress your new friend. At the same time, don't get so attached at the hip that you drive each other nuts.


Be gentle when criticizing your buddy. Try to see things from his point of view.Always be respectful when expressing disagreement about your friend’s opinions and perspectives. Don’t yell, curse, or call names. These behaviors can hurt your bromance.
Don’t assume your buddy views the bromance the same way you do. Keep your expectations realistic and stay sensitive to what your friend is feeling.For instance, if you feel that you and your friend are very close, but he doesn’t open up emotionally right away, just give him time. He might not be at the same stage in the bromance that you are.
Let your bromance develop naturally. Don’t force one that isn’t there. If your friend shows little interest in spending time with you, or is disrespectful, look elsewhere for true bromance.

To use Macintosh computers as FireWire disks themselves, hold down the “T” key during system start up.",How to Boot a Mac from Firewire3," This forces the system into FireWire "" target"" mode, at which point it can be connected to another Macintosh computer via a FireWire cable and used as a remote (target) drive disk.


This is a useful technique for transferring specific data from an old computer to a newly purchased computer. Just boot the old computer in target mode, connect it to the new computer, and transfer only the data you want to transfer, instead of transferring everything with the Migrate utility.
This technique works for almost all Mac computers, in both desktop and notebook models, with G4 or faster processors. The one notable exception to this is the Power Mac G4 model with PCI graphics, which does not support FireWire booting.

Join an organization or club.,
Join a sports team.,
Volunteer.,
Make yourself available.",How to Make Friends1," This is a great way to find other people who have common interests. You don't necessarily need to have a lot of common interests with people in order to make friends with them. In fact, some of the most rewarding friendships are between two people who don't have much in common at all. However, if you like a specific topic, try searching for a location where you can meet people who share that interest.A church, Mosque, temple or other house of worship is a great place to start since you at least have a religious faith in common. However, if you do enter a religious building, remember to be respectful in the house of their God.
In addition to church activities, you can join the science club at school, the marching band, a knitting group, or any other shared-interest activity.
If you play instruments or sing, try joining a band or choir.;
, A common misconception about this is that you have to be really good at playing a particular sport in order to make friends with others on the team. But not all teams are so competitive. As long as you enjoy the sport and support your teammates, joining a local team with a laid-back attitude could be a great way to make new friends.Spending time together at practices and games is a great way to bond with others and make new friends.

, Volunteering is also a good way for people of all ages to meet others. By working together, you build bonds with people. You may also meet others who have a passion for changing things the way you do (a common cause).Donate your time at a local nursing home, a hospital, or a non-profit organization.

, If you want to make friends, you first need to put yourself out there somehow in order to meet people. If you just sit alone, friends might come to you – but that's not likely. If you're still in school, sit somewhere with other people. It doesn't have to be a crowded table, but one with at least two other people.


Remember, friends seldom come knocking on your door while you sit at home playing on your laptop.

If you're sweating meeting new people, if you're thinking about how awkward, lame, and embarrassing your last comment about ferrets was and how these people are never going to want to see you again, it will show. The solution? Stop. People are generally harmless and too wrapped up in what they're saying to notice much else. If you never see them again, it is not the end of the world. There are many other people on this planet looking for friends, too.;
, If you're not out there being friendly, people will assume that you're just not interested in being friends. Most humans are pretty easily intimidated and like a sure thing; if you're not receptive, warm, and give off those friendly approach-me vibes, they won't come knocking on your door. And since this is a concept you've been taught since before you could practically walk, you know exactly what we're talking about.


Be willing to listen. Even if ancestry research isn't your thing, be willing to listen and ask questions. More likely than not, you might find a new interest.

, Greet the people you meet by smiling. It's a friendly gesture that attracts people, shows them you're engaged in your surroundings, and looking to have a connection. Can you imagine trying to befriend a stranger you see grimacing in the corner? No thank you. Make it less nerve-wracking for potential buddies by opening up and exuding warmth.


Maintain open, inviting body language. When you find yourself amongst people, try to keep your body aligned with theirs (and not toward the door, for example). Keep your arms open and stay off your phone. There are people out in the real world that deserve attention!

, Too many of us blame the fact that they get tongue-tied and never really know what to say to account for the lousy social skills, when really it's listening that is the more important of the two abilities. People seek friends who will care to listen to what they are saying more than anyone who can talk circles around them. If talking isn't your specialty, you will be just fine without it.


Ask questions. Everyone loves being asked questions and it takes the spotlight off you! Open-ended ones, especially. A one-word response (yes or no) doesn't really take the conversation anywhere and puts the pressure on you to follow up, so ask ones that require elaboration.

, How impressive is it when you meet someone once and the next time you run into them they ask you about your birthday, your mom, or some other little tidbit you casually mentioned in passing? It feels so good knowing someone paid attention to you and valued the information you told them. Be that person! Winning friends is all about making the other person feel good.


You can notice details, too. If there's anything they're wearing, carrying, or have about them, ask! Who knows the interesting conversations this could launch?

, People naturally gravitate toward confidence. If you're clingy, they'll all be headed for the hills in no time at all. No need to be cold, but know that whatever your audience's opinions of you are, it doesn't really matter. Be you. That's the best self you can be.


Easier said than done, isn't it? Overcoming insecurity is a process some people never get through. But a large part of it is positive thinking. If the insecurity thing seems a little daunting, try focusing on that aspect instead.

, The only way to meet people once you get out of high school and college (and those are people you're thrown in with anyway. How many of them do you like) is to get out and do stuff outside your home. The more you do, the more interesting you'll be and the more (interesting) people you'll meet. That's a cold, hard fact right there, that is.



All sorts of places. Even places you initially wouldn't see yourself going to -- those are the places you always get the most surprised about! Make it a point to check out that cafe you've heard about. Check out that abstract Jell-O art exhibition. Go to your little sister's softball games for a change. You'll have so many stories to tell by the end of the week that making conversation won't even be an issue.

, The more places you go and activities you go (such as going to Jell-O art exhibitions), the more interesting you'll be and the more varied your perspective on the world will be. You'll have seen more things, met more people, and, at the risk of sounding like your hippie aunt in Denver, you'll be happening. And you'll be busy! Busy meeting people, having experiences, and living life, that's what.


When people meet you, they'll probably assume a fair number of things. It's your job to take those labels people place on you and tell 'em where to stick it with your dynamic, multi-faceted self. Are you a leggy blonde? Well, maybe you're into magazines and The Bachelorette. Oh crap, you're also a sharpshooter? Woah! Do you only wear flannel and listen to Neutral Milk Hotel? Oh...hold up, you also speak Russian and studied French cooking? Cool.

, If you have even one friend under your belt, you have access to a ready-made social network. Heck, your coworkers, your neighbors, your cousins -- they all know people you could win over. Take advantage of them! Invite them to a get together and have them bring along a couple friends. Attend recitals, festivals, and other public events that they're going to. Put your connections to work!


This is also a good way to turn acquaintances into friends. Let that coworker who you talk to once in a while that you know is into red wine that you're looking to get into it too. Do they have any suggestions? Talk to your neighbor about their garden -- how do they do it? Before you know it, you'll be going to wine tastings and joining your neighbor's book club. Maybe getting roped into babysitting, too, but it's worth it!

, That's a terse way of saying, ""Go do things where you don't expect friendships to bloom because that's when they happen."" Your little cousin's soccer tourney? Sure, why not? Open mic night at a local comedy club? Of course! If you frequent these places, you'll wind up seeing the same faces. And you already know you have stuff in common!

, Because if you don't, you'll stop getting invited at all. So while in the back of your head you're totally thinking, ""Ugh, this is going to be such a drag,"" you may want to stick it out. The party might suck, sure, but you could meet someone there who thinks it sucks, too. You might not be the biggest beer, volleyball, or country music fan, but accept anyway. If it really stinks, you can always leave.


If you're convinced you're going to have a terrible time, you're going to. So don't waste your time going to places that put you in a bad mood. Instead, try to open up your mind to the possibility that it could be fun. And if not fun, it'd at least be an experience. What's the worst that could happen? It sucks and you leave. What's the best? It's awesome, you've met people, and you've found something you really enjoy. How's that weigh out?

, Heads up: we're all nervous when it comes to meeting people. It's so much easier just to live in our world and wait for people to come into it. But the problem arises when everyone does that; so take one for the team and do the initiating yourself. People are warm and polite (usually) and they won't reject you in any sort of embarrassing fashion. The worst that could happen is they make quick small talk and go on their way. Nothing lost there.


In its own crazy way, initiating is terrifying. To make it seem simpler, focus on one thing: making a situational comment. That's all it takes! In line at the cafe? Talk about coffee, the wait, or getting your caffeine fix. At a party? The host, the food, or whoever's off making an idiot of themselves. The conversations can only bloom from there.

, All too often people meet and have a good time and both parties would be willing to be friends, but no one makes the effort. It might have to be you that steps up to the plate. Ask for their Facebook name, their cell number, or in some circumstances, their email. And then use it!


If you've had a good, interesting conversation, don't worry about coming off creepy. A simple, ""Hey, what's your Facebook name?"" or, ""Let me get your phone number so we can go to that Jell-O exhibition sometime"" will do the trick. No need to make mountains out of molehills! If you're cool and casual, there's nothing to refuse.

, When we're first forming friendships, it's important to keep our interactions positive and friendly. If you don't, you risk being that guy or girl who's always such a ""Debbie Downer,"" the one who has a negative spin on everything. New friends are the ones you laugh with, not the ones you cry on...yet.


Commiserating is a powerful tool, yes. Having a common enemy can bring two parties together, and shared negative feelings can be very, very cohesive. But it's generally best to save this for when the relationship is a bit sturdier. Start gossiping later, when you both know each other well enough for it to be light and as well-meaning as possible. You can bond over your boss's ridiculous getup or Sally's ""pregnancy"" when the time comes.

, Talk about heavier and more serious topics. A level of trust has to be ascertained for that bond to go beyond the watercooler. To start that train chugging away, ask for advice. Bring up a little problem in your life and seek out their opinion. They'll feel important and important to you, making them like you that much more. And maybe they'll return the sentiment!


Examples are what coffee maker to purchase or where to go when you're on vacation in New Zealand, maybe how to deal with an annoying roommate -- not how to deal with your life-threatening disease. It needs to be a topic the other person feels like they can handle, you know? Something they can weigh in on that will be of benefit to you; you want them to walk away feeling useful, not overwhelmed.

, Just like keeping your body or mind in shape, you gotta keep your relationships in shape, too. Once they've been achieved -- you're hanging out occasionally, you're starting to be comfortable around each other -- don't let them dwindle and fade! Send the random text about something funny you saw. Invite them out for coffee, to a party, or to some public event you think they might enjoy.


And when your new friend is having a hard time, be there for them. Part of being a friend is sacrificing some of your time. If they ever need a favor, help out if possible or reasonable. If they need a shoulder to cry on, be there! Let them know that you care. Friendships aren't always sunshine and rainbows; sometimes they take a little TLC to flourish.

, The older we get, the more and more plates we're spinning simultaneously. If you don't have any that are dropping, you're doing it wrong. In other words, people are busy. People have lives to attend to. If your friendship isn't at the ""OMG WE'RE BFFLs(!)"" level, it's fine. You have your own life to lead, too. If you can make each others' lives better from time to time, that's good. That's all you need.

, No friendships will last if you don't treat the other person well. Once you get to know each other, it's not enough to be friendly -- you have to be a good friend: someone who clearly cares and is worth spending time with. You get out what you put in, really. So if you want someone who trusts you, who makes time for you, who makes life feel good, you gotta do that for them.


Being a good friend in fair weather is nice, but being a good friend when times are hard is even more important. If your friend is sick you don't have to rush over with a bowl of chicken soup, but do text them how they're feeling and if they need anything. If they're having an issue, let them know you're there for them. And when it's your turn to feel down, hopefully they'll be right alongside you, too.

Talk to people.,
Make eye contact and smile.,
Start a conversation.,
Make small talk.,
Introduce yourself at the end of the conversation.,
Ask them out for lunch or coffee.,
Initiate a get-together.,
Pursue common interests.",How to Make Friends2," You can join a club, go to school, or go to church, but you still won't make friends if you don't actually talk to people. By the same token, you don't have to be involved with an organization to be social. Any time you talk to someone, you have a chance at making a lasting friend. Most conversations may be a dead-end of sorts, and you may never talk to that person again, or you just remain acquaintances – but once in a while you'll actually make a friend.You can talk to anybody: the clerk at the video store, the person sitting next to you on the bus, or the person in front of you in the lunch line. Don't be too picky.

, If you have an unfriendly countenance, people are less likely to be receptive to your friendship. Look people directly in the eye when they are speaking to you (or when you are speaking to them) and offer them a warm, friendly smile.Do not squint, look bored, frown, or appear blankly deadpan, fold your arms (this practically screams ""don't talk to me"") or hang out in a corner; such habits may make you look troubled or disinterested.

, Once you find a person you’re interested in becoming friends with, you need to initiate a conversation with that person. This will help you connect to that person and start forming a friendship.Try making a comment about your immediate environment. The weather is a classic: ""At least it's not raining like last week!""
Make a request for help: ""Can you help me carry a few boxes, if you have a minute?"" or ""Can you help me decide which one of these is a better gift for my mom?""
Give a compliment: ""That's a nice car"" or ""I love your shoes.""
Follow up immediately with a related question: Do you like this warm weather? What kinds of gifts do you normally buy for your mom? Where did you get shoes like that?

, Keep the 30% talking/70% listening ratio in mind during small talk when possible. Keep in mind that this is only a general rule, and it can change from situation to situation as needed.People enjoy talking about themselves. So, listening more than you talk will make you seem like a desirable friend.

, It can be as simple as saying ""Oh, by the way, my name is..."" Once you introduce yourself, the other person will typically do the same.Remember his or her name. If you show that you remembered things from your past conversation(s) with the person, not only will you look intelligent but he or she will see that you were paying attention and are willing to be a true friend.

, That will give you a better opportunity to talk and get to know each other a little bit better. Invite them to join you for coffee sometime and give them your email address or phone number. This gives the person the opportunity to contact you; they may or may not give you their information in return, but that's fine.A good way to extend yourself is to say: ""Hey, well, I've got to go, but if you ever want to talk over lunch or coffee or anything like that, let me give you my number/e-mail address.""
Maybe they don't have time for new friends – don't take it personally. Just offer your contact information to whoever seems to be potentially a good friend, and eventually somebody will get in touch.

, You can chat your heart out but it won't get you a friend if you don't open up the opportunity for another conversation or meeting. This is especially important if you meet someone who you aren't otherwise likely to meet again.Tell some new people that you’re having people over to watch a football game or for a fun dinner party. Or suggest going out to the movies or to a bar as a group.

, If you've discovered that the person you're talking to has a common interest, ask them more about it and, if appropriate, whether they get together with others (in a club, for example) to pursue this interest. If so, this is a perfect opportunity to ask about joining them. If you clearly express interest (when? where? can anyone come?) they'll probably invite you.


If you have a club, band, church, etc. that you think they might enjoy, take the opportunity to give them your number or email address and invite them to join you.

Be loyal to a friend.,
Be a good friend.,
Be reliable.,
Be a good listener.,
Be trustworthy.,
Emphasize your good qualities.,
Keep in touch.,
Choose your friends wisely.",How to Make Friends3," You've probably heard of fair-weather friends. They're the ones who are happy to be around you when things are going well, but are nowhere to be found when you really need them. Being a loyal friend will attract other people to you who value that quality. This is a good way to put your money where your mouth is and attract the kind of friends you want in your life.Part of being a friend is being prepared to make sacrifices of your time and energy in order to help out your friends.
If a friend needs help with an unpleasant chore, or if he or she just needs a shoulder to cry on, be there for them.

, Once you've started spending time with potential friends, remember to do your part. If you want to have good friends in your life, you need to be a good friend yourself. No one will want to be your friend if they can see that you won’t return the sentiment.This means initiating some of the activities, remembering birthdays, asking how the other person is feeling, etc. If you don’t do these things, the friendship will become unbalanced and an uneasiness or distance is likely to arise.

, When you say you'll do something, do it. Be someone that people know that they can count on. If you embody these qualities in your treatment of others, it will attract others who appreciate reliability and who will be reliable in return.If you and your friend agree to meet somewhere, don't be late, and do not stand them up.
If you're not going to make it on time or make it at all, call them as soon as you realize it. Apologize and ask to reschedule.
Don't make them wait for you unexpectedly; it's rude, and it is certainly not a good way to launch a potential friendship.

, Many people think that in order to be seen as ""friend material"" they have to appear very interesting. Far more important than this, however, is the ability to show that you're interested in others. Listen carefully to what people say, remember important details about them (their names, their likes and dislikes), ask questions about their interests, and just take the time to learn more about them.You don't want to be the guy or girl that always has a better story than anyone else, or that changes the subject abruptly instead of continuing the flow of conversation. These people appear too wrapped up in themselves.

, One of the best things about having a friend is that you have someone to whom you can talk about anything, even secrets that you hide from the rest of the world. Before people even feel comfortable opening up to you, however, you need to build trust.


The key to being a good confidante is the ability to keep secrets. It's no secret that you shouldn't tell other people things that were told to you in confidence.

, Project the good, unique qualities about yourself. Show others what makes you stand apart from the crowd. Talk about your interests and hobbies. Share a little bit about your background with new friends. Everyone has interesting stories to tell – don’t be afraid to share yours. If you are a unique person, then show it.A little humor always keeps conversation light and happy. People love to be around someone who makes them laugh.
If you have a quirky, different style of humor then make sure you let them know that the things you say are in fact a joke. This way you don't just come across as simply weird. It will also help them understand a bit more about you too, which could potentially spark their interest.

, Many people often times lose contact with their friends because they're either too busy, or just don't value their friends enough. When you lose connection with a friend, the friendship may fizzle out. And when you do try to contact them again, it can be hard to rekindle the friendship.Maintaining friendship is hard work. Make time and share your life with them. Be respectful of their decisions and share yours with him. Strive to keep in contact over time.

, As you befriend more people, you may find that some are easier to get along with than others. While you should always give people the benefit of the doubt, sometimes you may realize that certain friendships are unhealthy, such as if a person is obsessively needy or controlling towards you, constantly critical, or introducing dangers or threats into your life. If this is the case, ease your way out of the friendship as gracefully as possible. Cherish those friends you make who are a positive influence in your life, and do your best to be a positive influence in theirs.If you have to leave a friend because they aren’t good for you, try to preoccupy yourself with other things, such as a new volunteer opportunity, so that you can honestly say that you don't have enough time in your schedule to spend time with them (but don't substitute their time for time with other friends; they may notice and become jealous, and more drama will ensue).

Consider ChromeOS.",How to Pick an Operating System," Every operating system (OS) has a learning curve for those unfamiliar with it, but the curve might not be the same for all OSs. All operating systems tout ease-of-use, though OS X has made that their selling point over the years. Linux is traditionally the least easy-to-use, but modern distributions make working with Linux very similar to both Windows and OS X.;
, Windows will generally have the most software compatibility, as the majority of commercial programs are designed for Windows. Macs have access to a large library of Mac-specific software, while the Linux community provides a vast number of free, open-source alternatives to commercial software.

, If you're going to be sharing documents and files with a lot of other people, it may be easier to stick with the same operating system everyone else uses. This will make connecting to others a lot easier.

, Windows is by far the most susceptible operating system to viruses, though virtually all viruses can be avoided by practicing safe browsing habits. Macs have traditionally had very few viruses to worry about, though that number is rising recently. Linux is the most secure system, as virtually everything needs direct administrator approval.

, If you are an avid game player, your operating system choice will heavily dictate the number of games available to you. Windows is by far the market leader in video games, but more and more games are getting Mac and Linux releases.

, If you do a lot of image, video, or audio editing, a Mac will most likely suit your needs best. Macs come packaged with powerful editing programs, and many prefer to use programs like Photoshop on a Mac.


Windows has lots of powerful options available as well. Linux has very few options with little support. Most editing programs on Linux are open-source alternatives that meet most of the functionality of popular paid programs, but are generally more difficult to use and not as powerful.

, If you're a software developer, you'll want to compare coding options available on different platforms. Linux is one of the best places to program desktop software, while you will need a Mac computer to develop iOS apps. There are compilers and IDEs available for most other languages on all operating systems.


Due to the large amount of open-source code available for Linux, there are a lot more examples to look at when learning a language.

, If you're running a business and are trying to decide what systems will be best for your workers, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. Windows machines will be far cheaper than the same number of OS X machines, but OS X machines are much better for content creation, such as writing, images, video, or audio.When stocking your business with computers, you'll generally want all of them to be running the same operating system for easy compatibility and networking.
Windows is cheaper and may be more familiar for your workers, but it is inherently less secure than OS X.

, Most new computers should come with the 64-bit version of your chosen operating system installed. 64-bit operating systems allow for more processes and more efficient memory handling. Your hardware must support 64-bit in order to use a 64-bit operating system.


32-bit programs should generally have no problem running on a 64-bit operating system.

, When choosing an operating system, hardware has a major role in the decision process. If you want to use Mac OS X, you'll need to purchase an Apple computer. This means paying a premium for an Apple product. Windows and Linux both run on the same hardware, though not all hardware is officially supported in Linux.You can build your own Windows or Linux computer, or purchase a pre-built one.
You can purchase a computer with Windows installed on it and then install Linux instead of or alongside Windows.

, If you're buying a computer with an operating system installed, you don't have to pay too much attention to the cost since it's included. You should know, however, that upgrading your copy of OS X will usually run about $100-150 USD cheaper than upgrading Windows to a new version.


If you're building your own computer, you'll need to balance the cost of Windows versus the usability of Linux. Most home distributions of Linux, such as Ubuntu or Mint, are free.

, The vast majority of Linux software is free. There are plenty of free, open-source programs for Mac and Windows as well, but also a significant number of paid programs. Most popular Windows software, such as Office, require a paid license.

, If you're looking at Windows, you may have noticed that there are standard versions and there are Upgrade versions. In general, you'll want to purchase the full version. While it will be more expensive, it can save you a lot of headache down the road. If you ever want to install that copy of Windows on another computer, you'll need to install an older version of Windows first to be able to use the ""Upgrade"" version.

, In general, you'll want to get the newest edition of your chosen operating system, even if it's a little unfamiliar. This is because you will often find features on the new operating system that you didn't know about but can't live without after discovering them.



With a few tweaks, Windows 8.1 will act just like traditional Windows, with all the new features that have been added to Windows 8.
If your still hesitant about buying Windows 8, many computers still come with Windows 7, which is much more similar to previous versions. Most retailers still carry Windows 7 as well.
Do not buy a computer with Windows XP, unless you plan on immediately upgrading or switching to Linux. XP support has been discontinued, making it a very unsecure operating system.

, Most Linux distributions provide images to create a LiveCD, which you can boot from without having to install the operating system. This will let you try out Linux before committing to the installation process.


Using the LiveCD version of your chosen Linux distribution will be a little slower than if you had installed it. Any change you make will be reverted when the computer restarts.

, Since there are no ""demo"" versions of Windows, and you need a Mac computer to run OS X, you'll need to try these operating systems out in a store or at a friend's place. These aren't ideal settings, but use your limited time and access to see how the menus, file organization, and program launching works.

, This is a much more limited OS than the others, but runs very quick and is available on devices in the $200-$250 USD range. ChromeOS is essentially the Chrome web browser acting as an operating system, and thus is designed for a computer that is constantly connected to the internet.There is very little software available for ChromeOS, but if you do most of your work through Google, everything will sync perfectly.

Be reliable.",How to Become a Highly Valued Member of Your Team1," Nobody likes working with a team member who says they’ll do something and then has no follow-through other than an endless list of excuses. If you’re that person, then put some thought into your claims before committing them on paper or to a group.


Map out a plan that, when you look at it, makes you feel confident about delivering what you've promised. Include a backup plan and a check-in point, so if you’re not on track, you can let your team know.
If you’re not sure how to come up with a trustworthy plan-of-action, sit down with a boss or co-worker who can help you out.
Set aside perfectionism. Teamwork is not about being perfect—–change happens around the clock at work, everyone knows that. Of course, being reliable is also about staying focused and working towards a goal. Keep your eyes on the end result, follow through, deliver what you say you will and more people will see you as trustworthy.
If you have passive aggressive traits, such as saying you'll do something but either not bothering to do it or doing it badly, then teamwork will be hard for you (and your team members will not fail to notice your reticence). By making a choice to stop acting passive aggressively, you'll enjoy teamwork a whole lot more and may learn a thing or two about giving and receiving help.;

Point out when your friend has gone too far.",How to Be Friends With Someone Who Has a High IQ," If someone is very intelligent, chances are that others often focus only on the person’s intellect. Remember that your friend is just that—a friend and not a brain. Paying close attention to your friend and every aspect of her personality can help you enjoy spending time together and strengthen your friendship.Be aware that individuals with higher IQs often have fewer friends and may have social anxiety. Because of this, you may want to focus on your friend in part by just doing things together without other people.Remember that it’s acceptable to acknowledge your friend’s intellect, just don’t make it the center feature of your time together. Instead, consider doing activities and talking about things that you both enjoy.
Avoid believing stereotypes about your intelligent friend. She might not be as lively as your other friends, but that doesn’t mean that she is like a stiff, intelligent character from a television show, either.Try to remember you're intelligent too, and while your intelligent friend might blow you off the map in her chosen field of expertise she is still a person. Out of her element, she is just as likely as you to make stupid blunders, get confused, and need some guidance, after all she is only human. And what human doesn't need help from a good friend from time to time.;
, Talking is an important part of any friendship. It can make a person feel seen, appreciated, and supported. This is no different for someone who is intelligent. Keep chats and conversations with your intelligent friend going and incorporate subjects you both enjoy or issues either of you might be experiencing.Be sure to listen intently to what your friend says and likes to discuss. This lets your friend know that you care about and are engaged in matters important to her life.
Make sure your conversations are a mix of lighthearted and serious topics. They may also be intellectual or completely silly. No person can have serious or intellectual conversations all the time and your friendship might be a great outlet for your friend’s sillier side. For example, if your friend mentions a funny TV show, ask about it and think of other shows that you can compare to it.
Remember to follow up any statements your friend makes with questions or a comment to show that you’re paying attention and care about the person.

, When someone is very smart or has a high IQ, the person may find that others only focus on that part of his or her personality. Remember that people are multifaceted and have many things to offer beyond intellect or other traits. Instead of focusing on your friend’s brainpower, forget about it. You can turn your attention to other things such as the person’s great sense of humor or activities both of you do. Not only does this keeps a conversation going, but it shows your friend that your interest is in more than his or her intellect.Think about your friend’s personality before you meet the person. Ask yourself what other traits the person has and find ways to focus on these in your conversations. For example, you could say, “You’re such an adventurous eater! How do you not get squeamish? Would you like to go out to dinner sometime and show me?”
Consider being up front with your friend about focusing on the person’s intellect. You could say, “Ack, I love talking about smart things with you but it starts to hurt my brain after a while. Have you seen the ads for the latest romantic comedy that Nora Ephron made?”

, Make sure to mention your own interests when chatting with your friend. This can guide the conversation and help your friend realize that you are not only interested in her brain. In addition, it can teach both of you to compromise as a way to develop your friendship.Use your friend’s interests or comments as a way to mention your interests. For example, if your friend mentions wanting to see the latest Star Wars movie, use that as a way to say “I’m not really into sci-fi pictures, but love romantic comedies. But I’d be interested in seeing Star Wars and maybe changing my mind.” You could also say, “I love Vietnamese, too, but if we go there tonight can we try that happening new Mexican place next time?”

, No matter what your respective interests, try and do different things together as friends. You may find adventure, have a blast, and strengthen your friendship in the process.Do activities both of you like. Let this guide you for future experiences that you can have together and which can strengthen your friendship. For example, suggest trying a new restaurant or experimenting in the kitchen together. You could also go skydiving or parasailing together.
Consider mixing serious and fun activities. For example, your friend might be a highly intelligent scientist. A trip to a local science museum might be a good way for you to understand about your friend’s talents, allow the person to shine, and even pique your interest. This might also help you and your friend navigate group dynamics in a positive way.
Consider taking day trips or vacations together. Relaxing together can strengthen your friendship and help both of you get past your friend’s brain. Make sure to build in some “me time” for each of you, which can be very important to an intelligent person.

, In some cases, you may feel intimidated by a friend with a high IQ and assume that every decision they make is right and rational. However, it’s important that you continue to be yourself and assert your own views and opinions. This shows your friend that you have self-respect but will also respect her independence.Make sure to give your friend space. Many intelligent people thrive at friendships in which they are not constantly with the other person.This gives you the option of being friends with other people, which can make you more well-rounded and socially intelligent.Be confident and believe in your opinions. This may provide a basis for more meaningful conversations with your friend. If the person is truly your friend, she will value your opinion and give you the chance to express it without bullying you or making you feel stupid., Every person wants to feel special and valued by friends, family, and peers. Intelligent people are no different. Make sure that your friend knows that you value every aspect of her personality and enjoy spending time together when you have the chance.Show your happiness at your friend’s accomplishments, even if it comes to your detriment. The sign of a true friend is the ability to be genuinely happy no matter what. You can tell or write your friend a message that says “Great job” or “I’m so happy for you!”
Be open to your friend’s needs. There are times when others might make fun of your friend or she feels pressure to constantly perform because of her IQ. Listen to your friend’s concerns, figure out a way to address them, and then try to cheer up the person.

, One of the best ways to make a new friend is by meeting the friends of a friend.Consider inviting your friend with a high IQ to meet some of your other friends, which could offer her some new and different perspectives. Remember that many intelligent people don’t do well in large groups, so you may want to keep the group to a manageable 3 or 4 people to start.


Keep the mood as light as possible and don’t mention to your other friends anything about the person’s IQ. This might cause your friends to focus only on how smart your friend is and not value her as a multi-layered individual.
Ask your friend if she is interested in meeting your friends before putting together a group event. Your friend may feel more comfortable with just you. But your friend also may be very receptive to meeting some of your other friends.
Make sure your friends know that you enjoy your intelligent friend, even if the person comes off badly at your activity. Explain that your friend felt overwhelmed and a bit insecure around such exciting people and reverted to intelligence to cope., No friend is one-dimensional, but instead a multi-layered individual. Part of being a good friend is accepting every part of your friend’s personality. Take the ups and downs in your friendship as they come, which can forge a better and stronger friendship.Be understanding of the quirks that may come with an intelligent friend. Remember that she may be highly intelligent at math, but terrible at relating to other people.For example, if your friend feels threatened, she may fall back on her intelligence to boost her confidence. As long as your friend isn’t hurting another person, let this roll off your back.
Be understanding whenever your friend is in a bad mood, having a bad day, or socially awkward. You can always explain to others, “Normally she is really fun and easygoing but she’s under a lot of stress and it sometimes makes her a bit insecure and snarky. I hope you’ll have a chance to meet my friend at a better time.”

, Whether it was sharing toys in the sandbox or bonding over a lab in college, there was some spark that started your friendship. Think about what bonds you and your friend if you are having difficulty in the friendship or can’t connect any longer.


Think about what you share in common. Did your love of World of Warcraft or interest in playing soccer spark a friendship? Were you both competitive in the spelling bee or Model UN at school? Or did you both have a job at a fast food restaurant? Whatever interests you shared in the past, draw on your common interests to keep your friendship strong.
Ponder your pal’s personality in all of its dimensions. Is your intelligent friend also sensitive and kind, or does have strong insight and the ability to read others? Focus on the qualities that make this person special and not what upsets you.

, Gifted or highly intelligent individuals may exhibit unique characteristics such as being extremely creative and passionate about specific things. Your intelligent friend may also not approach problems or situations like other friends, which is part of what makes her an individual and special. Instead of being annoyed or even embarrassed by your friend’s personality, remember that her intelligence and its quirks are as much as a part of her as other traits. This can help strengthen your friendship.Ask or remind your friend if the person acts quirky. You can do this in a humorous way by asking, “do you always have such spot on comebacks?” or “Could you teach me how to think that rapidly about stuff?”
Remember that every single friend you have, irrespective of the person’s intelligence, is an individual and has special traits and quirks that come with being human.

, A friendship requires participation by two equal individuals, so keep in mind that you are as big a part of the friendship as your intelligent friend. While your pal may happily discuss quantum physics, it’s important to remember you have talents and traits that complement the friendship.Remember your traits that your friend likes about you. Perhaps your buddy appreciates your irreverent sense of humor or uncanny ability to see the good in people. Bringing out these traits in yourself can reinforce your friendship.
Use humor if necessary. If your friend begins obsessing about something that goes over your head, bring the person back down by saying, “While you’re over there being a smarty pants, I think I just found a new adventure for us! Picture us doing ceramics over booze!”
Don't avoid saying something because you think she would ""Think that sounded dumb"" or it would ""Make you look like an idiot"" It's probably not that bad after all and if she is a friend she'll think the better of you anyway.

, Honesty is also another cornerstone of any strong friendship, even with someone who is very intelligent. If you're worried that you're not smart enough for your intelligent friend, remember that the person seeks you out and values your friendship. Have an open discussion about your fears and insecurities in the friendship—you may find that your friend has similar fears.Broach the subject with your friend in a non-confrontational manner. For example, you could say, “Sometimes when you go off on tangents like that I wonder why you want to be friends with me. I didn’t really understand what you said.”
Try to focus on your friendship and less on intelligence or a competition of your wits. Avoid letting yourself feel intimidated by your friend’s intelligence by reminding yourself that there are many things you can do better.

, Think about your friend and other intelligent people you know. You might realize that they’re not always great in social situations. In fact, many intelligent people suffer from social anxiety, which may be related to thinking or analyzing situations to much, psyching themselves out, or an inability to deal with emotions.Keeping the social hindrances your intelligent friend may have can help you better navigate your friendship and interactions you and your friend have with others.


Help your intelligent friend deal with other people more effectively by supporting her or boosting her self-confidence in situations. For example, you could draw attention away from your friend’s intellect by saying “you know, Christina and I have been friends for 20 years and she wouldn’t tell you this, but she is a fantastic painter.”

, If your friend hasn’t met your other friends or they’re meeting for the first time, consider cuing in other people about your intelligent friend. Some people may be offended by your friend’s intelligence or responses to situations and this could help them understand your friend better.


Tell your other friends about your intelligent friend. Say, “I’m really excited to have you guys meet Simi. We’ve been friends for years and she’s really wonderful. I just wanted to let you know that she is incredibly smart and can sometimes come off a bit aloof. Just give yourself a chance to get to know her and I know you’ll love her as much as I do.”
Remind your friends that intelligence sometimes means social incompetence. You could say, “I’m really sorry my friend came off so arrogantly. She doesn’t always do well in social situations, but I can assure you she’s a really nice person if you give her a chance.”

, In some cases, your intelligent friend may get a bit too arrogant or even be rude with you or people who are maybe not as smart or talkative. If this happens, it’s a good idea to point the problem out to your friend and explain why what the person did crossed the boundaries of acceptability.


Avoid embarrassing your friend if you can. Instead, point out the problem in private. You could say, “You know Sam, your response to Pat was really condescending and totally unnecessary. He doesn’t have it as easy as you when it comes to developing projects quickly and you should realize that not everyone is like you in that regard. You really need to be more sensitive and think about others in these situations.”
Break any tension by making a sarcastic remark. For example say, “well, now that we all fell completely stupid, let’s figure out how to tackle this.” Not only can that help to smooth over any problems, but also cue your friend in to the mistake.
Support your friend no matter what, even if you don’t support or agree with a situation. For example, if your friend is arrogant about intelligence with another person, you could support her by saying “I understand why you said what you did, but I might have been a bit more diplomatic in the way I said it.”

Share information and resources with your team.,
Keep your project manager informed about your progress.",How to Become a Highly Valued Member of Your Team2," Some people think they increase their career worth if they’re the one with all the information. It depends how you play this. Hoarding resources and then trotting out your smarts at opportune moments will not get you far; after all, nobody likes a know-it-all. Withholding information until the spotlight shines on you alone is a surefire way to lose support.


Instead, make yourself a necessary part of the team by sharing all your information, knowledge and resources freely––be the ""go-to"" person that people feel they can trust. Take a page from people-centric business expert Tim Sanders’ book Love is the Killer App: Be a lovecat – a rich, open source of knowledge.

, Even with the most collaborative planning tools, you probably have a lead project manager who oversees the delivery of a project (even if her title isn’t “Project Manager”). This person initiates tasks and assigns work to all other team members. In some groups, this person could be your boss or a team leader, and is generally the one who takes the fall if things go south. When you show respect for your project lead’s responsibilities – by meeting deadlines, communicating changes and being reliable – you make an important person’s life easier and raise your value quotient.

Respect other people’s work styles.,
Be flexible and willing to change.",How to Become a Highly Valued Member of Your Team3," We all know this one: Everyone is different and we all have our own work styles. Just because a team member approaches a task or challenge at a different angle than you would doesn’t mean it’s wrong. So if you don’t understand what a teammate is doing or saying, ask questions until you find a common ground. Clearing up the differences in your processes will help you work together more fluidly going forward, and who knows––you might even learn a thing or two!


In many cases, the outcome is what matters, such as making the deadline with quality work. If your team member approaches the work in a manner that perplexes you but still delivers, it's probably fine. However, in some cases, if methodology or accuracy require a specific way to achieve something, and your teammate is dodging this, it's time to have a pointed chat.

, Projects hardly ever go as planned, so there’s a good chance you’ll find yourself doing “surprise” work in order to move a project forward. It could be helping a teammate with some tasks, taking over part of a ballooning project, you name it. If you can roll with these change requests with a positive attitude and pitch in where needed, this will earn you those key points as “team player.”


If you’re a good problem solver and naturally willing to do whatever (within reason) the team needs of you, it could be that flexibility is one of your greatest strengths. Every team needs a flexible player, so play to it!

Be positive.,
Keep it meaningful.",How to Become a Highly Valued Member of Your Team4," You can’t do everything perfectly, which means you’re going to get constructive feedback every once in a while. This is how each of us learns and builds our career skills. So when you do get constructive feedback, try to take it with a positive attitude.


Keep in mind that not everyone’s great at their feedback delivery, so don’t take it personally if it comes out blunt and seems a tad insensitive. Instead, just focus on the part that you can learn from.

, If a boss sets out a plan of action and you can rise to the occasion and meet it––well, how many ways can you say “raise” and “promotion”? At the end of the day, however, you know what matters even more than raises and promotions: the feeling of doing meaningful work in a team that fosters your talents and being appreciated and valued for the good work you do. Focus most on how you can do your part in the equation and see the world rise up to meet you.

An operating system can be user friendly too, so make sure to add user friendly features, making these an integral part of your design.

",How to Make a Computer Operating System," Assembly language is essential; another supplementary high level language such as C is strongly recommended.;
, It can be a CD drive, DVD drive, flash drive, a hard disk, a floppy disk, or another PC.

, In Windows, for instance, an easy-to-use GUI and plenty of security is the core idea.

, IA-32, ARM, and x86_64 are the most common for personal computers so they're your best bet.

, Linux from scratch is a project for those that would like to build their own Linux distro, for example.

, Since coding your own bootloader will require extensive knowledge of the hardware and the BIOS, it may push back the schedule for programming of the actual kernel.

, While it is possible to create an operating system in a language such as Pascal or BASIC, you will be better off using C or Assembly. Assembly is absolutely necessary, as some vital parts of an operating system require it. C++, on the other hand, contains keywords that need another fully-built OS to run.


In order to compile an operating system from C or C++ code, you will, of course, be using one compiler or another. You should, therefore, read the user guide/manuals/documentation for your chosen C/C++ compiler, whether it comes packaged with the software or is available on the distributor's website. You will need to know many intricate things about your compiler and, for C++ development, you should know about the compiler's mangling scheme and its ABI. You are expected to understand the various executable formats (ELF, PE, COFF, plain binary, etc.), and understand that the Windows proprietary format, PE (.exe), has been copyrighted.

, One good API to choose is POSIX, since it is well documented. All Unix systems have at least partial support for POSIX, so it would be trivial to port Unix programs to your OS.

, There are monolithic kernels and micro kernels. Monolithic kernels implement all the services in the kernel, while microkernels have a small kernel combined with user daemons implementing services. In general, monolithic kernels are faster, but microkernels have better fault isolation and reliability.

, That way, less time is required to solve more problems, which may produce a better OS more quickly.

, Remember, wiping your drive will irreversibly clear out all your data! Use GRUB or another boot manager to dual-boot your system with another OS until yours is fully functional.

, Begin with small things such as displaying text and interrupts before moving on to things such as memory management and multitasking. Also make sure you make a 32 bit and 64 bit version.

, This provides a measure of protection in case something goes terribly wrong with the current version of your OS or your development. If your computer crashes and is unable to boot, it is an excellent idea to have a second copy to work with so you can troubleshoot.

, Rather than rebooting your computer each time you make changes or having to transfer the files from your development computer to your test machine, you can use a virtual machine application to run your OS while your current OS is still running. VM applications include VMWare (which also has a freely available server product), the open-source alternative, Bochs, Microsoft Virtual PC (not compatible with Linux), and Oracle VirtualBox.

, This will allow users to tell you about potential problems with your operating system.

You should be making backups anyway, but before major updates such as this is a good time to make sure.;
, If necessary, also have the serial numbers ready. Also have ready the installers for any software applications you want installed on either operating system.

, If you currently have one operating system on a single partition spanning the entire disk, you'll need to resize that partition to make room for a separate partition for the other operating system. This may require defragmenting the drive first. In some cases, it's better to have each operating system on a separate physical disk, but usually partitioning works. Check the system requirements for each operating system and make sure each can get a partition at least that large. You may also want to reserve some space for a data partition available to both operating systems. Note that different operating systems require partitions with different file systems. Check the table below for compatibility.

, During the installation, you should be asked what partition you want to install to. You should also have access to a partition program to modify the partitions of your drive. If you already have the correct operating system on the first partition, skip this step.

, The second operating system installer may detect the first on the other partition and configure a boot loader allowing both to boot.

Research your software compatibility.,
Obtain your new operating system.,
Backup your data.",How to Install a New Operating System on Your Computer1," If you’ve decided that you want to install a new operating system, you’ll first need to figure out which one you want to use. Operating systems have varying system requirements, so if you have an older computer, make sure that you can handle a newer operating system.


Most Windows installations require at least 1 GB of RAM, and at least 15-20 GB of hard disk space. Also, your CPU needs to be powerful enough to run the OS you want to run. Make sure that your computer can accommodate this. If not, you may need to install an older operating system, such as Windows XP.
Linux operating systems typically don’t require as much space and computing power as Windows operating systems. The requirements vary depending on the distribution you choose (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, etc.).;
, Windows licenses need to be purchased. Each license comes with a key good for one installation. Most Linux distributions are free to download and install as much as you’d like, though some Enterprise versions are closed and require purchase (Red Hat, SUSE, etc.).

, Make sure that the operating system you want to install supports the programs that you want to use. If you use Microsoft Office for work, you won’t be able to install it on a Linux machine. There are substitute programs available, but the functionality may be limited.


Many games that work on Windows will not work on Linux. The number of supported titles is growing, but be aware that if you are an avid gamer your library might not transfer over smoothly.

, If you’ve purchased a copy of Windows from a store, you should have received an installation disc along with your product code. If you don’t have the disc but have a valid code, you can download a copy of the disc online. If you are installing Linux, you can download an ISO of the distribution from the developer’s website.


An ISO file is a disc image that needs to be burned to a disc or copied to a bootable USB drive


, When you are installing a new operating system, you are most likely going to be wiping the hard drive in the process. This means that you will lose all of your files on the computer unless you back them up. Always make sure that any important files are copied to a backup location before starting the installation process. Use an external hard drive or burn the data to DVDs.


If you are installing the operating system alongside your existing one, you most likely will not have to delete any data. It is still wise to backup important files just in case.
You cannot backup programs; they will need to be reinstalled once you have finished installing your new operating system.

"
"
Determine your installation order.,
Boot from your installation disc.,
Try your Linux distribution before installing.,
Wait for the Setup program to load.,
Enter your product key.,
Choose your installation type.,
Format your partitions.,
Set your Linux options.,
Wait for the installation to complete.,
Create your Windows login.,
Install your drivers and programs.",How to Install a New Operating System on Your Computer2," If you are installing a Linux distribution that you want to run alongside Windows, you need to install Windows first and then Linux. This is because Windows has a very strict boot loader that needs to be in place before Linux is installed, otherwise Windows won’t load.

, Insert the installation disc into your optical; drive, and reboot your computer. Normally a computer boots from the hard drive first, so you will need to adjust some settings in your BIOS in order to boot from the disc drive. You can enter the BIOS by hitting the designated Setup key during the boot process. The key will be displayed on the same screen as your manufacturer’s logo.


Common Setup keys include F2, F10, F12, and Del/Delete.
Once you are in the Setup menu, navigate to the Boot section. Set your DVD/CD drive as the first boot device. If you are installing from a USB drive, make sure that the drive is inserted and then select it as the first boot device.
Once you’ve selected the correct drive, save your changes and exit Setup. Your computer will reboot.

, Most Linux distributions come with a copy that can be loaded directly from the installation disc. This will allow you to “test drive” your new operating system before you commit to the installation process. Once you are ready to install, click the Installation program on the desktop.


This is only possible with Linux distributions. Windows does not allow you to test out the operating system before you install.

, No matter which operating system you choose, the setup program will need to copy some files to your computer before it can continue. This can take several minutes, depending on the speed of your computer’s hardware.


You will most likely need to choose some basic options, such as language and keyboard layout.

, If you are installing Windows 8, you will need to enter your product key before you can begin the installation. Older Windows versions will ask for the product key after installation is complete. Linux users will not need a product key unless it is a purchased version such as Red Hat.

, Windows will give you the option of Upgrading or performing a Custom installation. Even if you are upgrading an older version of Windows, it is highly recommended that you choose Custom and start from scratch. This will minimize problems that may arise later from combining old settings and new ones.


If you are installing Linux, you will be given the option to install alongside your existing operating system (Windows), or to erase the disk and install Linux by itself. Choose the option that best meets your needs. If you choose to install alongside Windows, you will be given the option to choose how much hard disk space you want to designate for Linux.

, If you are installing Windows, you will need to choose which hard drive partition you want to install it on. Deleting partitions will wipe the data on the partition and return the space to the Unallocated section. Select the unallocated space and create a new partition.


If you are installing Linux, the partition needs to be formatted in the Ext4 format.

, Before installation begins, your Linux installer will ask you for your timezone, and you will need to create a username and password. You will use this to log in to your Linux distribution as well as authorize system changes.


Windows users will fill out personal information after the installation is complete.

, Depending on the speed of your computer, this can take up to an hour to finish. Most installations are hands-off at this point. Your computer may reboot several times during the installation process.

, Once your Windows installation is complete, you will need to create a username. You can also choose to create a password, though this is not necessary. After creating your login info, you will be asked for your product key.


In Windows 8, you will be asked to customize the colors first. After that, you can choose to either log in with a Microsoft account or use a more traditional Windows username.

, Once the installation is complete, you will be taken to your new desktop. From here, you can begin installing your programs and make sure that your drivers are installed and up to date. Make sure to install an antivirus program if you are going to be connecting to the internet.

Catch your friend off-guard.,
Trick your friend.",How to Surprise a Friend," One friend might love a surprise trip, but another would prefer a nice gift and a quiet evening. Think about what your friend does when she's happy — that's probably what she'll enjoy. The answer may be one of the following:


Giving gifts
Going on an adventure or experiencing something new
Quiet quality time, enjoying the company of a few close friends
Talking and encouraging each other;
, Snoop around and try to find out what's been on his or her mind. Is there somewhere they've been meaning to go? Something they've been meaning to buy as a treat?


Try to plan a surprise that's related to your friend's hobbies, taste in music, or other interests. If his or her favorite band is coming to town, consider buying tickets so that the two you can go to the show together.
If you can't think of anything that your friend immediately needs or wants, try to imagine something that he or she might conceivably want, but hasn't talked about. For example, if you know that your friend likes to read, try to find a book that she might find interesting—something that she probably hasn't read. Bring her a snack that she loves.

, Now that you know how your friend celebrates, and what your friend wants, combine it into one idea. Here are some examples:


Someone who enjoys talking might love a video of family and friends saying what they like about her, or cheering her on to her next big step in life.
If your friend enjoys new experiences, but has been complaining about stress, take him on a relaxing day trip to a park or tourist destination.
Someone who's happiest during a quiet evening at home can still get a surprise when you decorate her house with a theme based on her favorite movie, then stay in and watch that movie with her.

, If your friend is an extrovert, she might enjoy a surprise involving several people, or even a large group for a special occasion. If she is an introvert, she might prefer to spend time one-on-one—or to get a gift that she can enjoy on her own time.


Make sure the guests will enjoy themselves as well. The white water rafting might be perfect for your friend, but make sure there's something for everyone to do.
Try to invite people that your friend knows well, especially if he or she tends to be shy or introverted. If your friend is a social butterfly, she may not mind if you invite new people that you think she'll like.

, Try including references to how the two of you met, or to other shared experiences you have together. If you're giving a simple gift, add a personal touch to the presentation: stack a pyramid of edible treats, carefully hand-wrap the gift, or add a handwritten note.

, Make your surprise extra special with a fun location. Kids love a surprise blanket fort. Adults might agree to visit a park or a pub, where they'll be surprised by a special gift or a crowd of friends.

, If you're giving a gift, drop it in a place that will surprise your friend. Enlist the help of someone who lives with your friend, and hide the gift somewhere she'll find it during everyday activity.

, If you're really into the setup, leave a series of clues. Make sure your friend finds the first clue, and wait at the end with the surprise. Don't make the scavenger hunt too difficult, or you might be waiting for a long time.


Consider arranging for another mutual friend to walk through the scavenger hunt with your friend and drop hints if he gets stuck. Plan ahead. The mutual friend should be walking with the friend you're planning to surprise—as if everything is normal—when he or she finds the first clue.

, Talk to your friend as though it were a normal conversation, as you lead her to a surprise party or prepare to shove a present at her. Wait until she seems slightly distracted, and she won't know what hit her.

, Call your friend in a panic and make up a reason he needs to come right away. This will give quite an adrenaline rush, but be careful. Don't make up a story that would upset your friend too badly, or that's more fun than the actual surprise. You don't want your friend to wind up angry, upset, or disappointed.

Be supportive.,
Never forget your friend's birthday.,
Listen to them.,
Never force your friends to talk to you when they make it clear they don't want to.",How to Respect Your Friends1," Never stop believing in your friends, even when they've given up. Don't be unrealistic – but try to see the best in them, and try to help them see the best in themselves. Encourage them when you know that they need the extra push.


Be a positive influence. Don't support your friend in doing things that you know are a bad idea. On the other hand, respect your friend's right to learn from his or her mistakes.
Help them study for tests, but don't tutor them like a teacher. If you tutor your friend too much, they might get irritated; they may believe that you think that they know nothing. Only help them out if they ask for advice, and it may make the two of you closer.;
, Write him or her a thoughtful note, and make or buy a gift that feels personal. This shows that you care, and that you want the friendship to last a long time. Odds are, your friend will be deeply grateful.

, Listen to their problems, their fears, their dreams, their joys. Put aside your own problems, and take the time to fix your full attention upon what your friend needs. Offer advice, if it seems appropriate, but try to just let them talk. Listening is one of the most important things that you can do for a friendship.Listen to all of your friends when they need to talk. If you prove that you are a thoughtful and trustworthy listener, your friends may confide most of their problems in you.
Do not interrupt them when they're speaking. Interruption is a sign of disrespect.

, Don't take this personally. Some people are simply more reserved, and are the type to handle their problems themselves. This doesn't mean they have anything against you, or don't value you as a friend. It means talking about certain topics might make them uncomfortable, and you should always respect that. Pressuring them to speak to you will only make them not want to come to you with things in the future."
"
Show gratitude.,
Find hobbies that you have in common.,
Respect their feelings.",How to Respect Your Friends2," Say ""thank you"" whenever your friends do you a favor or give you something. Consider telling your friends how much they mean to you. Appreciate the fact that another human being went out of his or her way to do something specifically for you – no matter how large or small that thing may seem.Repay friendship with friendship. Help your friends out without them having to ask. Show your gratitude by responding in kind.
Share your gratitude. You don't need to wait for a special occasion to tell your friend how much he or she means to you. Say, ""This might sound random, but I want you to know what an awesome friend you are. You're always there for me when I need someone to talk to, and you have the greatest sense of humor. Thank you.""

, Music, for instance: listen to something new that nobody else listens to in your area, such as K-pop or any international music. If you do sports, or anything active or creative, ask your friends if they'd like to try it out – anything from rock climbing to painting to video games. Listen to your friends talk about what they like, and ask if you can have a go. Not only will this shared experience help you form a closer bond, but it will make your friends feel as though their preferences are worthy.


Consider trying something at least once before you dismiss it. Even if you don't like it, try to understand why your friend enjoys doing it. You don't need to like everything that they like – but you should at least respect the fact that they like it.

, When your friends express that something hurts their feelings, or makes them uncomfortable, realize it isn't funny. If they go out of your way to point out that your behavior affects them in a negative way, it's time to stop. Your friends feelings are more important than what you find personally entertaining. Just because something doesn't seem like a ""big deal"" to you, doesn't mean it isn't to them. This doesn't make them ""too sensitive"", or ""over-emotional"".

"
"
Refrain from judgement.,
Give respectful advice.,
Talk about your disagreement.,
Learn the boundaries.,
Remember that respect goes both ways.",How to Respect Your Friends3," Unless something your friend is doing is hurting themselves or others, there is no reason to give an unwanted, negative opinion. Putting undue pressure and judgement on them will make them start to dislike your presence. Try to be supportive and non-judgmental, even if you deeply disagree with something that they did. Show your respect by letting the friendship stand stronger than any one mistake.


If your friend messes up, forgive them – even if he or she, say, forgets your birthday. If they don't study for an important test, help them out.
If your friend embarrasses him/herself in front of their crush, or in front of a group of people that they like, then help them out. Tell them that people will forget about it. Make sure you don't constantly talk about what happened, and just drop it as soon as it happens.

, Warn your friends if they make a decision that seems like a bad idea. If you know someone well, then your opinion is valuable. However, your responsibility as a friend does not include depriving someone of the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them. Make sure that you respect your friends' right to make their own choices. If they need to do something, then let them do it., Arrange a time when you can interact one-on-one. Then, if you're sure that they are okay with being alone with you, try easing into a friendly conversation about where you think things went wrong. Humble yourself for a few minutes, and try to speak with your friend as though everything were normal.


Do not accuse. If you want to restore your friendship, you'll need to let go of your anger. Rash words and unfounded accusations may cause the person to put up a defensive wall. However, it's reasonable to bring up an offense if it directly caused the falling-out.

, If a friend feels like he or she is being held back, he/she might react by creating distance or fading from your life in an attempt to get some space. This might hurt – but sometimes people will do this without even realizing it. Respect their journey, and give them some space. Allow them to spend time with friends other than you.nThey can still be your friend, even though they want to hang out with other people too., If your friend doesn't respect you, then you shouldn't respect them. Respect is earned, not given. If your ""friend"" steals your boyfriend/girlfriend, then they do not deserve your respect or friendship.

Say hello!,
Inquire about the person you’re curious about.,
Hold off on the heavy-hitting conversations.,
Speak with respect.",How to Start a Conversation with New Friends1," Approach people you’re interested in conversing with and simply say hello. Offer your name, and ask theirs. While it may feel awkward to start a conversation without an explicit reason for doing so, people are usually happy to be approached in a friendly manner.Alternatively, if you’re standing or sitting in a group and hoping to speak with one person in particular, don’t feel rushed to do so. Simply sitting, listening, and enjoying one another’s company is actually an incredibly effective way to become comfortable around other people.
Wait for a moment to introduce yourself unobtrusively. Remember, silence is a form of communication. Even in social settings, a comfortable silence indicates confidence and contentment that people will respond to positively.
In a group setting, be sure to ask each person that you haven’t already met what their name is. This indicates a general friendliness that is a key component of conveying to others that you are social and accessible.;
, People like to talk about what they’re interested in, and questions that are geared accordingly can be great conversation starters. There are plenty of specific options.Ask the person you’re curious about what they do for fun. Not only does this get a conversation going, it indicates that you’re curious about what they’re interested in and how they spend their time.
Ask them what they do with their life. Don’t ask about employment explicitly. Say something like, “So what do you do with your days?” This allows people to answer however they want, which gives them the chance to talk about something they want to talk about.
If you’re looking for a particularly interesting question, try asking them about a recent quote they came across that changed how they viewed the world.

, Refrain from talking about your radical political or religious beliefs as soon as you meet someone. Deeply personal topics should also be avoided, as well as private information.Even if it seems like you might share a certain point of view with another person, you don’t need to immediately re-iterate your shared belief.
Hold off on having conversations about worldviews or beliefs that you may share to allow for a deeper conversation on that topic later on.

, Watch your word choice and put effort into being courteous until you know a bit about the other person’s sense of humor or any particular sensitivities. There are a few conversational manners to always remember.Never cut another person off while they are speaking. This is harder than it sounds. Instead of thinking about what you’re going to say next, focus on what the other person is saying!
Don’t raise your voice. Though it may simply be the effect of excitement, speaking loudly may intimidate some people, or make you seem overzealous.
Concentrate on speaking clearly. Not only do you want to make sure you are not misunderstood, it’s much easier to listen to someone who is enunciating well.
A good concept to keep in mind is that you’re not competing for space within a conversation, you’re sharing it!

"
"
Respond thoughtfully.,
Listen actively.,
Limit your use of filler words.,
Know that people think differently about things.,
Know how to end the conversation.",How to Start a Conversation with New Friends2," Give a detailed answer when your new friend asks you a question. If you are unsure of how to respond to something, ask for clarity – especially if they had asked a question. The most important thing is to respond genuinely, as this will convey that you value the conversation, as well as the other person’s attention.Elaborate on your responses to questions. When someone asks what your favorite part of a movie was, instead of just answering, ""Definitely the ending!,"" answer with something like, ""The ending sequence, when the minions were caught and mostly destroyed, but one survived in the pile of its fallen brethren. I like to think it still roams the Earth today.""
Say what you actually think, not what you think they want to hear. You shouldn’t assume you know what other people admire or expect. More importantly, people admire individuality, especially if you can spin some quirky positivity into your statements.

, One of the most important steps in being both a good conversationalist and a good friend: Be a good listener. At it’s most simply, active listening is simply paying attention to what the other person is saying. But to truly actively listen is to give them the time and space to speak openly, to actively learn about another person, and to give yourself the opportunity to fully consider what they have to say.Be sure to look your friend in the eye throughout the conversation. Don’t literally stare into the other person’s eyes, but maintain eye contact most of the time, especially when one of you are saying something particularly meaningful or interesting.
Recognize that many people simply wait for their turn to speak in conversation, and don’t actively listen to what their conversational partner is saying.
Push your own thoughts out of way while the other person is speaking. Focus on their points, and allow a few moments of silence when they finish speaking, both to make sure they are done speaking, and to allow yourself to consider a thoughtful response.

, These include ""um,"" ""like,"" and ""you know"".While these words are entirely appropriate to use occasionally, if you say them too often, it will seem as though you are distracted or uninterested in explaining yourself clearly.

, Even people you expect to get along with or immediately admire may have significantly different points of view. Differences of opinion can actually enrich a friendship, and can help both of your individual minds to grow.Whenever you do not agree with your friend's opinion, and want to share this disagreement, be sure you have a reason. If you choose to do so, share your disagreement politely.
If you don't agree about a minor thing, consider the universal truth that you could always simply let it be.

, A friendly, positive conclusion to a conversation will leave you both feeling glad to have met one another, and hoping to meet again. A great way to conclude is recall a point in the conversation you just had that you both resonated with. There are lots of options; the key is positivity.Say something clever or insightful you had thought of and wanted to say earlier, but had forgotten.
Inquire about your friend’s plans for the rest of the day and wish them well on the endeavor. For instance, say something along the lines of, “Well, I’m off to ______ in a minute here. What’s the rest of your day look like?”
Default to humor. If all else fails, tease yourself for not wanting to leave the conversation, while explaining you hope to meet again. Try, “Hey, it’s been great speaking with you and I wish we I could chat with you all day – but I have to run.”
Use a friendly parting gesture as an opportunity to offer an open-ended invitation to spend further time together by saying something like, “When might I see you again?”

"
"
Make and keep plans to meet again.,
Always have an interesting conversation topic in mind.,
Appreciate others’ individuality.,
Remember and recall previous conversations.",How to Start a Conversation with New Friends3," If you’re interested in spending more time around one another, make plans to do so! This will usually be rather apparent, but even it’s not, feel free to make the offer.One of the easiest and safest ways to invite a new friend to meet up again is by inviting them to a group event sometime in the upcoming week.
If you know you’ll be attending an event at a certain place and time, and others are welcome, mention it and encourage them to attend as well.

, If you recently met someone that you get along with and made plans to see each other again, have something in mind to talk about. There are few dependable ways to think of your own conversation topics.Think about what might be relevant to your plans. If you’re going to a comedy show, watch videos of your favorite comic to be able to reference parts of skits you’ve enjoyed. At the show, ask if they have a comedian or style of humor they particularly enjoy.
Similarly, if you’ve planned to go to a sporting event (as either participants or observers), read the pertinent professional sports headlines for some reliably light conversation fodder.
Reflect on recent major events, both local or global. News can be interesting to talk about because people’s different worldviews often provide colorful interpretations about things that have happened elsewhere in the world.
Bring up the discovery of a new archeological finding or new species discovery, and conversations about where each other have traveled (or would like to travel!) will likely follow.
Think about seasonally-relevant conversation topics. If Halloween is coming up, ask your new friend what they plan to dress up as, or what their best-ever costume was.
Try an old standby: “What’s the next thing you’re looking forward to?”

, If you admire someone, there’s likely a good reason for these positive sentiments. These are likely the reasons you may come to appreciate a person’s presence in your life. However, whomever they are, they will certainly be different than you first expect. This is partly why it’s so fun to get to know new people.Recognize that every new person you meet will shape your understanding of people in general. No one is exactly like anybody else, and nor should they be!
Resist the inclination to compare new friends to other friends you have had in the past. Focus on the attributes that each of your friends have that make them who they are, and appreciate how their individuality contributes to your understanding of the world.

, It is incredibly meaningful when we recall the conversations we have with one another and are able to pick up right where we left off – both literally, and metaphorically, in terms of developing a new friendship.


If you know that you may be talking to your friend in the future, make a mental note of the topics you spoke about, particularly things they had conveyed interest in that you were unfamiliar with.#*Check out something they had mentioned, such as a certain band or a particular article, and contemplate what you might agree with or add to the observations they had shared with you.
Indicate that you’re excited to see them again by recalling a positive moment from your earlier conversation – especially if there had been a shared moment of humor. Reminding one another that you had enjoyed each other’s company before will be a great way to begin enjoying one another next time to you see each other.

Establish that you have common ground with the person that you invite over.,
Ask your parents or guardian before you invite your friend over.,
Find an opportune moment to ask your friend to hang out.,
Confirm the visit.,
Get your house ready for your guest.,
Do something while you wait for your friend to show up.,
Don't let a moment of awkwardness ruin the visit.,
Be flexible and spontaneous.,
Remember that some friendships take time to grow.",How to Invite a Friend Over," Choose someone that you have some inside jokes with, or someone who likes the same books or bands that you do. Choose someone who you feel good being with. When you have decided to ask someone over to your house, don't think ahead. Thinking ahead can make you nervous about potential outcomes that aren't even a possibility yet. Just remember that even if you are rejected, it's really not as big a deal as it feels at the time.;
, This will prevent any awkward last-minute cancellations. It can also be beneficial to avoid times that siblings might be around.

, In order to make more concrete plans, wait until you are both talking enthusiastically about something you both want to do, whether it's to watch a new episode of a T.V. show, or try a new recipe.


Make plans as soon as you both agree on an activity that you want to take part in. For example, ""There's a new episode of that TV show out on Wednesday. Do you want to hang out at my place and watch it then?” Or, “I have all the ingredients for that recipe. Do you want to make it tomorrow after school?”

, Call your friend and ask them if it was alright with their parents, and if they are still up for coming over. Remind them of what you planned on doing so that they can get excited about the visit.


Don’t text to confirm. Texts are too easy to forget. It can be scary to call someone to make sure that they are coming, so just jump right into it without dragging it out awkwardly. Try saying “Hey, ! I just wanted to see if your parents said it was all right for you to come over tomorrow, so I could get things ready”.

, Tidy up your room, and if you want, get out interesting conversation starters or games. If you planned on watching a movie or making a recipe, make sure you have everything that you need. Make sure you provide something simple to eat-- you don't want your friend to leave early because they're hungry.

, If you just sit there waiting, you might get nervous. When they arrive, greet them warmly and show them around.


Don’t fall into the trap of trying to think of what the two of you might say. The best conversations happen naturally. Ask your friend questions, either about things you have in common, or things you want to learn more about them. , If you can sense that your friend does not want to talk about something, turn the conversation back to the activity you originally planned, or suggest a new activity.


It is not your job to be funny or interesting. Experts say that the conversations that people find the most interesting are the ones where they are able to talk about their own interests the most. All you have to do is ask your friend about what interests them, and listen carefully, so you can ask follow-up questions.

, If your activities don’t work out, suggest something that you usually like to do. If all else fails, take a walk or get food. Don’t let changes ruin the visit.


Remember that some of the best visits are not centered around an activity at all. Activities are really just an excuse to hang out and talk. If the two of you are having a good time without doing the activity, don't rush into doing it. If the conversation ever runs out, the activity will be a good way to break the silence.

, Don't expect to be best friends as soon as the visit is over. Just be confident in the fact that you were able to successfully ask someone over, and keep doing it until it becomes second nature.

Find someone who seems to have similar interests and just start texting them or IM-ing them concerning these subjects,not like you're already best friends, but just a little short message.,

Make sure that you kick off shoes and have no papers in your pockets to ruin, ""Practice it and stick to rather shallow water!"" (that you can stand up in): Wet clothes can be very heavy and shoes are almost impossible to swim in!

, Your friends needs to know that they have your trust. Tell them a bigger secret and say, ""I just needed to blab, you won't tell anyone right?"" Hopefully, they will say, ""No!""

, Go relax at the pool, you don't have to talk, just sit back. Maybe making some small talk, that's not a big deal. You could go to the mall, walk and browse and joke about clothes and other stuff in store windows, or go to a sports game, or watch TV (but of course it has to be their choice of shows, or skip it if they show no interest...).

, Would you say this or that certain person is one of them? If so, you have successfully made a best friend! If not, keep trying!

Think of different jokes.,
Know your audience.,
Pick your target.,
Express hostility.,
Relate to the real world.,
Exaggerate your stories.,
Create an emotional connection.,
Surprise your audience.,
Practice your delivery.,
Make fun of yourself.,
Do an impression of someone.",How to Make Your Friends Laugh1," The best jokes are always going to be original jokes. It could be about the president, your parents, or even one of your friends. You can find humor in almost anything if you look hard enough. There's a whole world of topics to choose from.


Mix up the types of jokes you tell. You can't just tell knock-knock jokes all the time if you want to keep getting laughs. Keep your humor fresh by mixing it up. Think of quick one-liners or puns mixed with longer anecdotes funny stories.;
, Adjust the subject matter that you joke about. Since you are with friends, you can tell jokes that may not be appropriate to tell at work or to your parents. You might even have an easier time making your friends laugh if your jokes are somewhat inappropriate.


Your may know your close friends well enough to tell crude jokes, but avoid sensitive topics like race or gender around more casual friends. Be wary of any jokes that might be offensive.

, Decide who or what you are going to joke about. Pick a target that your friends will be able to relate to. For example, if your friends are all older and have kids, then telling them a funny story about your kid will get a laugh. Telling the same joke to kids in junior high would probably not amuse them.

, Most humor involves a reaction to something that bothers us in our lives.It can be politics, romance, money, or even something as trivial as the weather. What makes these topics funny is how you uniquely express your frustration with them.


Be sarcastic. Many funny jokes come from sarcasm. Make a statement that might not seem funny if you take it literally, but use your tone of voice to let your audience know you don't really mean it. For example, you could pepper a conversation with some sarcastic comments like, ""You're totally unique and special... just like everyone else in the world."", Things that we find funny tend to reflect some kind of truth about the world. What makes them relatable is often what makes them funny. If your jokes aren't grounded in reality, there is a good chance you won't be able to connect with your friends and the joke will fall flat.

, Contrast realistic topics by blowing them out of proportion and using ridiculous metaphors. For example, if you say ""I ate too much pizza,"" you're not likely to get a laugh. However, it will probably be funny if you say, ""I ate like 17 pizzas. I was like a bear getting ready to hibernate. When I was done I stacked the pizza boxes to make myself a cave and went to sleep."" By exaggerating a simple idea, you can easily make it into something comical.

, A big part of making anyone laugh is performance. You need to be able to use your words to engage the emotions of your audience and create a bond with them.If you can build up tension, anxiety or sympathy with your words, then you will get a bigger laugh when they finally hear the punchline.

, Humor is best when it comes unexpectedly. Don't telegraph your jokes or they will fall flat. To get a laugh, you need to create some incongruity between the setup and the joke by creating an unexpected twist., The funniest jokes usually seem spontaneous.If you can make it seem like the jokes are just coming to you it will make your friends laugh even harder. Once you immerse yourself in comedy, you will find it becomes easier to tell jokes. Try reciting your joke in a room by yourself and see how it sounds.


Work on your timing. Pace yourself. Don't get nervous if it takes awhile before you get a laugh. Keep your tone at a natural conversation pace. Allow your audience a moment to laugh before hitting them with another line.
Tweak your phrasing. Be blunt and concise. If you can't think of the best words to express and idea, let it marinade awhile longer.

, Sometimes it is better to make yourself the target so your friends don't feel like you are constantly ridiculing everyone else. You don't want to seem like a jerk. Let them know you don't think you're better than everyone else by being self-deprecating every once in a while.


For example, ""I love my life, but it thinks of me more like a friend.""

, You can mimic someone famous, or just someone that all your friends are familiar with. The key is to study the person you want to impersonate and be impressive with how you replicate their voice, expressions and use of language.


Work on your impression by assessing yourself in a mirror. Only do an impression if you can really pull it off.
Your friends should be able to know who you are impersonating without being told. If they don't see it without being told, it isn't going to make them laugh.

Use the element of surprise.,
Scare one of your friends.,
Call a friend.,
Prank a friend online.,
Be good-natured.,
Get your other friends involved in your pranks.",How to Make Your Friends Laugh2," The key to a hilarious prank is the element of surprise. Regardless of what kind of prank you set up, be sure your friend does not see it coming.


Try to keep a straight face. Avoid giggling. Just try to look entirely emotionless so they have no reason to suspect anything is up.

, The best part about pranking a friend is that you can use your knowledge about them to your advantage when coming up with a potential prank. For example, if you have a friend that is afraid of snakes, putting a rubber snake in their car or in their bed is a sure fire way to get a reaction., A prank call is one of the easiest ways to make your friends laugh. Be sure to use a public phone or borrow another friend's phone so your target won't recognize the number. Work on different accents so that your friend won't recognize your voice. You can pretend to be a bill collector, secret admirer or tell them they won a ridiculous prize contest.

, The internet can help to play some amazing pranks. They take very little effort and you can keep them going for a long time.


Sign up your friend for a bunch of email subscriptions from strange websites so they get tons of annoying marketing emails.You can order strange objects online and have them shipped to your friend. Pick anything that is funny, disturbing or strange. Imagine their confusion when they open up a package and find a giant inflatable zebra and some nylon medical gloves that they didn't order.

, Don't do anything that could cause physical harm to your friends. You always want to be sure not hurt your friend emotionally. Pranks should be harmless enough that even your target can laugh along with you. You don't want to ever ruin a friendship just because you wanted to be funny.

, The more people that are in on a joke, the funnier it will be. If you let your other friends in on your pranks ahead of time, they can also play along and help you pull it off.


Be selective about which friend you decide to prank. Some of your friends are more sensitive than others. Pick one of your friends that has a good sense of humor and will be amused by the joke. It will be much funnier if everyone is able to laugh about it, even the person being pranked.

"
"
Laugh.,
Put on a funny movie or television sitcom.,
Have a lip sync battle.,
Post a funny meme on social media.",How to Make Your Friends Laugh3," Sometimes laughter can be infectious.If your friend says something funny laugh. Try to lighten the mood by infecting everyone else with laughter. At the very least they might crack a smile.


If you find you're the only one laughing, just go with it. Laugh obnoxiously. Cackle like a witch, or laugh like a hyena. Maybe they will find that funny.

, It could be the Simpsons or a Will Ferrell movie. Sometimes you might not feel like being funny and turning on the television or a movie is an easy way to keep the good times going. You can use the opportunity to share something that brings you enjoyment with your friends.

, Challenge your friends to put on a better performance than you. Pick some hilarious music and have fun with it. Videotape your performances, then you can play them back and laugh all over again later.


You can also challenge them to a karaoke battle.

, Just because you didn't think of it, doesn't mean your friends won't see the humorous post as a connection to you. Even if you aren't that creative, friends may still consider you funny because you share things that are funny. If it makes you laugh, as least some of your friends are likely to find it funny too.

Prank call your friends.,
Make your friend into a toilet paper mummy.,
Write and perform a one act play.,
Watch your favorite childhood TV shows or movies.,
Play your old favorite board games.,
Have a poker night.,
Become a sports commentator.,
Do funny impressions of people you know.",How to Have Fun with Your Friends (Guys)1," Don’t underestimate the amount of fun you can have prank calling your friends, no matter what age you are. Just find a good victim, whether it’s another friend of yours or a girl you like to tease, and practice what you’re going to say before you make the call. You can pretend to be a school administrator getting her in trouble, act like you’re a neighbor complaining about noise or even pretend to be one of the person’s friends.


Call from your house phone, making sure to dial *67 so your number isn’t identified and get a few of your friends on the other phones so you can all have a good laugh together.
Just don’t take this too far. If you call a teacher, neighbor, or another adult or even a peer who would be less-than-pleased by your antics, then you could get in trouble with the law.;
, This is just as simple and easy as it sounds. Just get a few rolls of toilet paper, have one of your more adventurous friends stand up with his arms at his sides, not moving and have two people wrapping toilet paper around his body from different directions until he is completely covered. Take some photos for fun, and then set your friend free, letting him break through the toilet paper. This can be a fun activity on Halloween or really during any time of the year.


You can also have your completed mummy walk around your house to try to scare your parents or siblings.
If you have a bigger group of friends together, you can even make two mummies at once, having a contest to see who can make a mummy the fastest.

, If you and your friends are more creative and want to make something, then try writing a simple one act play. It can have just a few characters in it and doesn’t need to be more than 5-10 pages long. Give yourselves a time limit to write the play, such as an hour or two, cast the parts, and then give yourselves another hour to practice performing it. Then, perform for your family, a few other friends, neighbors, or for a video camera to show off your skills.


You don’t have to be the next Arthur Miller to write a fun play with your friends. You can write something goofy and completely ridiculous; do whatever’s the most fun. Nobody’s judging.

, Think of the movies or TV shows you used to love when you were just a little kid. If you’re not much older than that, well, then you can look for some even older shows or movies that your older siblings or parents used to like and can check those out. This can be a fun way to remember your childhood and to laugh at all of the things you used to think were so scary, funny or interesting.


Make some popcorn, order some pizza, and have sodas with big slurpie straws while you and your friends relax.
Though it can be fun to be active and to be jumping around, sometimes you and your friends will just want to unwind.
If there’s a famous catchphrase in one of the movies or shows, you can all find something to do every time you hear it, like taking a big sip of your soda or shouting.

, Board games never really get old, no matter what age you are. If you feel like having a night in with your friends, bring out the board games, such as Monopoly, Risk, or even Jenga. When was the last time you played something other than a video game with your friends? This can be a great way to mix things up and to have some old-fashioned fun without sacrificing your eyesight.


You can make some fun snacks while you play them, such as S’Mores or peanut butter sandwiches, to make it feel more festive.
Some of your friends may need some convincing, at first, but they’ll soon see that playing old games is much more fun than they expected.

, If you and your friends like poker or want to learn how to play, then you can have fun having a “boys’ night in” and have a poker night at someone’s house. Have at least a few of your friends sit around a table, do some light betting, put the game on in the background, and have an old-fashioned poker night with your buddies. Don’t make it feel too competitive and keep things fun and friendly.


You can even plan to take a late-night trip to Chili’s or another local restaurant afterwards. You can raise the stakes by saying that whoever loses has to buy dinner or dessert for everyone.

, If you want to do something goofy and different with your friends, then turn on a sports game and mute the sound. This may work best if it’s a sport you don’t know super well, such as darts or curling. Then, put on your fake commentator accent and have fun making completely irrelevant or ridiculous comments about the game with your friends. This can be a goofy way to mix up the usual sports-watching experience, and you’ll all be cracking up in no time.


If you really want to kick it up a notch, pretend like you’re an alien who just landed from outer space who has never seen the sport before. What do you see?
Once you get tired of being a commentator (it’s a tiring job!), you can unmute the sound to see how accurate your commentating skills were.

, This game can make for a fun version of charades, except this time, you get to talk. Make two teams and have everyone write down at least five people you can do impressions of, making sure it’s people that everyone knows. (If you all don’t know the same people, then celebrities will work, too). Then, take turns doing impressions of the people to try to make your team guess what impression you’re doing; if you succeed, your team earns a point. Keep going until one team has reached 10 points or until you get bored.


If you’re all okay with it and you don’t think anyone can be offended, then you can put the names of the people in the room into the mix, too.

Play manhunt.,
Go to the beach.,
Play dodgeball.,
Hit up your favorite restaurant and pretend it’s your birthday.,
Hit up the playground.,
Play four square.,
Hit up the gym.,
Have a boys’ night out.",How to Have Fun with Your Friends (Guys)2," Manhunt puts a more exciting spin on the ordinary game of hide and seek and tag. To play one version of manhunt, wait until the sun starts to set and designate one person to be “it.” Then, have the rest of the people hide in a designated area and have “it” count to 20. Then, the person will work to seek out the people who are hiding; if you’re hiding and you see that person coming toward you, you can run to your heart’s content. When the person who is “it” tags the person who is hiding, that person joins his team as part of the manhunt.


The idea of the game is for the person who is “it” to have as many people on his team as possible; these people will also help find people who are hiding once they’ve been tagged. Once everyone but one person has been tagged, that person wins the game.
Typically, the person who was tagged first becomes “it” first during the next round of the game.

, When was the last time you and your friends went to the beach? If you leave relatively close to the ocean, then you should plan a day trip to the beach so you can hit the waves, get a tan, play some carnival games if they’re out there, or throw around a Frisbee or kick around a soccer ball. Even if it’s not quite swimming season yet, then you can have a low-key barbecue or play some beach volleyball. Just a change of scenery can help you and your guy friends have some fun; what’s more, the beach is a great place to meet girls.


If you don’t have a beach to go to, see if there’s a lake or river nearby that is easy to visit. If not, you can set up a fake beach in your backyard, complete with beach chairs and a beach ball.

, Dodgeball doesn’t have to just be a game you get really excited to play in gym class. Find a big, open field, some balls that are not too heavy and are easy to throw, and have yourselves a dodgeball tournament. You can even open this game up to more people in your school and can even invite a whole bunch of people in your class to play, whether you text them or invite them through Facebook, to have more people to play with.


Get an “official” whistle and make sure the rules are clear at the before you start the game. Prepare some rules for safety, such as saying that hitting people in the face doesn’t count and can even result in a penalty.
Prepare for injuries just in case. Prepare some bandages, ice packs and towels just in case.

, This is another silly thing you can do if you and your friends are bored with your usual trips to the same old restaurants. A lot of restaurants, especially chains that are used to catering to people your age, will give you a small piece of cake with a candle and will sing happy birthday to you if someone tells them, sneakily, that it’s your birthday. If you don’t feel guilty about getting the free cake, then doing this can make you and your friends crack up on the inside.


Of course, you shouldn’t tell the waiters that it’s your birthday yourself. Have one of your friends tell them by saying, “My friend is really shy about it, but actually it’s his birthday today…”
Don’t worry too much about being found out. They won’t ever ask for proof of ID. And hey, if they do, what’s the worse that can happen?

, Who says you have to be a kid to go to the playground? Hanging out at the playground can be a fun and goofy way for you and your guy friends to pass the time, especially if you haven’t been there in a while. Wait until most of the kids have left and have fun playing tetherball, going on the tire swings, or playing lava tag, where you can’t touch the ground of the playground or you’ve stepped in lava.


You can also see how high you can go on the swings, as long as you don’t hurt yourselves.
Don’t be self-conscious about it. As long as you and your friends are game, this can be surprisingly fun.

, Four Square is another underrated game that can be fun for boys of any age. Just draw four squares on a cleared-out, concrete place, get a big ball that bounces, and have fun bouncing the ball in your friends’ squares and work on getting them out until you’re the Four Square champion. There are a lot of additional rules you can add to this game, such as “Popcorn,” where you can keep the ball going by moving it back and forth between your hands, and you can add more rules as you go.


You should have at least five friends to play this game, so that it means something when someone’s out.

, You and your friends can also have fun if you go to the gym together. Though you don’t need to work out right next to each other, if you find a quiet gym at off-peak hours, then you can have a great time with your friends and can even make some hilarious conversation while you work out. You’ll be having such a great time that you won’t even notice that you’re actually exercising.


Having workout buddies can be a fun way to motivate yourself to stay fit.

, Whatever your age is, you and your friends can always have a fun boys’ night out. If you’re not of drinking age yet, then just hit up the mall with your friends and talk to some cute girls. If you’re old enough to drink or just old enough to go to a club, then hit up the dance floor with your friends all night long. You can also go to an evening baseball game, see a thriller or watch a boxing match at a restaurant or bar.


Though you don’t have to do something “boy-centric” when you hang out with your friends all the time, it can be fun to plan an event that is “boys only.”

Buy the most ridiculous outfits you can find at a thrift store.,

Forget the soda pyramid—build a human pyramid.,
Buy Halloween clothes during the wrong season.,
Spy on your friends.,
Dress up as monkeys and buy bananas at your local grocery store.,
Make a ridiculous video.,
Drive around blasting embarrassing music.",How to Have Fun with Your Friends (Guys)3," Have fun looking through the endless varieties of clothes you can find at a thrift store. Give each other a thirty minute limit to try on and buy the most ridiculous outfit you all can find, and then decide where you’re all going to wear your outfits, whether you go to a party, walk around the mall, or even wear them to school. This can be a fun way to spice up your afternoon!


You and your friends can even go for a theme, like “Goth” or “80s” and find clothes that stick to that theme so you all have a relatively similar look.

, Hey, why not? Get at least 100 cans of soda and have fun making the tallest pyramid possible in your garage, on a table in your backyard or another place with an even surface. Take some photos to show off your pyramid-making skills. Once you’ve build the pyramid, you can start drinking the soda little by little, play pyramid Jenga, or even work on making other shapes with the soda cans.


Just don’t drink too much soda at once—unless you plan on getting super hyper!

, Once you’ve mastered your soda pyramid skills, or if you just feel like starting with a bigger challenge, then you and your friends should make a human pyramid to see how high you can make it. As a general rule, heavier and bigger people go on the bottom, and the smaller people go on top. If you only have a few friends, invite more people in your social network over and see if you can make a human pyramid of twenty people or more.


Just make sure to plan it out carefully and not to rush it.

, If you really want to get a great deal, hit up the Halloween store a week after the holiday is over. This should give the stuff enough time to go on super sale but will be close enough to Halloween that the store won’t close up or stop selling Halloween stuff completely. Go into the store with your friends and act like you don’t know that Halloween is over and make sure you consider all of your options very carefully so the salespeople get confused.


Once you have your awesome discount Halloween outfits, you and your friends can wear them out to bars, parties, or just the mall, acting like you don’t understand why no one else is wearing a costume. Just make sure your costume doesn’t have any dangerous elements on it and that you don’t get in trouble.

, If you’re bored and looking for something original to do, then try spying on someone you know. Assemble a team of your best spies, pick your target, and have fun watching the person over the course of a few hours. Take photos, take notes, and discuss any suspicious behavior you may see. Of course, you shouldn’t take this too far and shouldn’t snoop around too much, but if you can find a good place to hide and watch over a person for a few hours without invading his privacy too much, then this can be a great way to have fun with your friends.


If you’re really committed to digging up some dirt on this person, you and your friends can split up and pretend your cell phones are Walkie-Talkies, telling each other everything you see from different places.

, This is definitely an original idea that no one can top. The hardest part can be finding the monkey costume. Once you do that, though—whether you buy them online or make them yourself—all you have to do is head to the local grocery store with your friends while you’re dressed up and buy some bananas. This can be the most fun if you don’t act like monkeys but talk to each other like everything is perfectly normal and then casually buy the bananas instead of making a spectacle of yourselves.


To really make a statement, buy a few bunches of bananas. Try not to crack a smile while you do this. You can even say something like, “Man, I’m starving,” to one of your friends to make your act even more convincing.

, Another thing you can do is get some props, get one friend with a camera who knows how to use it and plan something completely silly and ridiculous that you can film. You can try to break dance, pretend you’re wild animals, speak a made up foreign-language, pretend like you’re making a motivational speech, or really do whatever you think will make people crack up the most. Give yourselves a two-hour limit to film a five-minute video so you don’t overthink it or waste too much time planning it.


If you’re really proud of your handiwork, then you can post it on YouTube. Or you can try the reverse—telling yourselves that you’ll have to post the video on YouTube no matter what, so it better be good.

, If at least one of your friends has a car and your license, then you should drive around blasting embarrassing music that will get everyone’s attention. You can play whatever you think is embarrassing, whether it’s The Bee Gees, Britney Spears or just whatever you’re in the mood for hearing. Don’t be ashamed—sing the lyrics loud and proud, and smile at the people who stare at you.


For bonus points, you can even act like one of your friends is chasing after your car, wanting to be in on the fun. There’s something hilarious about a guy chasing after a car that’s blasting Britney.

, Playing computer games/video games is recommended since it will usually get your adrenaline flowing. If you are going to watch movies, make sure they aren't too slow paced. Action, thriller, horror, and witty comedies are best. Stay away from romances.

, A real all-nighter cannot stop until 7-9 AM, when neighbours and other people wake up and start going about their daily lives.

, This is one of the best parts of an all-nighter.

, The adrenaline flow and all the laughing will be enough to keep you up for a while. And that'll teach the person who fell asleep to stay up for longer.

, But keep in mind that nobody but you and your friends will like them.

,,, It could help you relax and eventually fall asleep.

Make sure you have lots of food on hand. Snacks make a binge watching weekend more fun.
Make sure to take breaks now and then to stretch or take a walk outside.
Amuse yourselves watching a bad movie, especially a cult classic. You can also do this with a poorly written book. Take turns reading it out loud and see how far each person gets before they are laughing too hard to keep reading. You can even turn it into a game (a drinking game for those over the legal drinking age, or using chocolate/candy as prizes otherwise). Your body will thank you.;
, This is especially fun if you've been friends for a long time. Talk about things you did together a long time ago. Often your friends will remember things that you don't so you can exchange stories about things you did together.


Try to find things from that time. Look for old notes you passed back and forth or a journal you wrote together. Maybe you made dolls, or played football together. The objects will help you recall more of the times you spent together.

, Invite your friends to come over to give each other manicures, facials, and try out new hairstyles and makeup looks. Mimic spa fare by serving your guests hot tea, fresh fruit, and water with cucumber slices and lemon. Play quiet, relaxing new age music in the background and light a few scented candles to create a relaxing atmosphere for your friends., For adults, teenagers, and children, games can be lots of fun. Card games, board games, video games, figure out which works best for your group.


Card games are good because most people have cards and there are a lot of simple games. The game Spoons is a really good with a group, while something like Speed is better with just a few people. If you're playing Poker, use little pieces of chocolate or candy as money. That way it's just about fun instead of money.
Some options for board games include Settlers of Catan, Scrabble, Bananagrams, and Clue. Clue is, especially, is an easy game to learn and fun because you get to accuse your friends of murder.
Multi-player video games are great to play with your friends too. Have a Super Mario party or compete in the latest multiplayer racing game.

, There are lots of different ways to have a fun party, even if there are only a few of you. Get creative with your party and you'll definitely have fun.


Have a dance party. Put your iPod on shuffle and turn the lights down and dance away. You can check out dance moves on your favorite music video and have a laugh copying them.You can dress super fancy and learn some ballroom steps.
Plan a theme party. This can be anything from a 1920s murder mystery to an Ascot tea party. This all depends on your ingenuity and that of your friends. Consider what your group is interested in and go for it.
Have a baking or cooking party. Pick out some recipes to cook together, shop for the groceries together, and use teamwork to prepare them. You can laugh at your failures and delight in your successes.

, This is a fun and easy game to play anywhere you want. A ""truth"" is a question they must answer truthfully. A ""dare"" is an activity they must perform. You can also allow a certain amount on ""chickens' per person which allows them to not complete the truth or dare.

, You can check out the latest exhibits together and have lots to discuss after you leave. Museums and art galleries also often hold special events like lectures, film screenings, and musical performances that you could go to with your friends.

, If you need a new outfit or just feel like shopping invite a friend or two to join you. If you don’t want to spend any money, go window shopping. Walk around, look at the displays in the shop windows, talk, and have fun!

, Brainstorm a story, write a script, gather props, and film your movie. You can try to do it in one shot or get pro and edit all of your footage together. Then, you can have even more fun when you watch the movie together., You can go out to your favorite restaurant, or eat in if you're short on money or not wanting to be in public. It'll give you a chance to chat with your friends while you eat or cook.


If you're going out, make sure it's a place both you and your friends enjoy and that everyone can afford it.
Having the meal at your house can save money and can be great fun. Invite your friends over and have a glass of wine while you're cooking or, even better, have a potluck and have all your friends bring their favorite dishes!, It's fun when all the servers know you by name and your drink and it can be a great way to just relax and have a quiet chat with your friends.


Pick a time every week, or every month to meet. Try having everyone who can make it meet every first Friday of the month, for example and catch up on everything that's happening in your lives. Having it specifically scheduled means more of your friends will be able to make it.

, Looking for cheap treasures at yard sales can be a ton of fun with a friend or a few friends. Watch your local newspaper for yard sale announcements during the summer months or just drive around and look for signs.

, This is great to do no matter your age. Head on out with your buddies and play a sport, throw a Frisbee or take your kids to the playground. The park is a great place to have free fun.


You can organize a touch football game, or play basketball. You might even meet more friends that way if people ask to join you.
Going for a run with a friend around the park can be a good way to have fun with friends when you're super busy. It's already on your schedule and even running is more fun with a good friend at your side.
If you have kids, getting together with friends to take them to the park can make the whole experience more fun for everyone. Bring some food and turn it into a picnic. You can catch up with your friends while your kids play.

, Lots of cities put on free or low cost concerts, outdoor movies, plays, and festivals. Check your local newspaper for free and low cost events that you can attend with your friends.


Check to see if outside food is permitted at the event. Sometimes you are allowed to bring your own food and drinks to outdoor concerts and plays.
Bring blankets or folding chairs if they are permitted.

, Camping is a great way to have fun with friends and reconnect with nature. You don’t have to go far either. You could go camping at a nearby state park or even in your own backyard.If you decide to go camping with your friends, just make sure that everyone brings their own supplies., During the warmer months, there are races all across the country. Look for a race and register with your friends. A 5K can be a great way to have fun with your friends even if you don't like to run. Most 5Ks offer separate start times for walkers. Just go with your friends, get some exercise, and have a great time!

, You can have lots of fun at a bonfire. You can roast marshmallows, make s'mores, talk with each other, and even play truth or dare.

, Volunteering is so much more fun when you're doing it with people you like. So have a good time and know that you're helping the planet out with your actions. It'll help you feel good about yourself while doing something worthwhile and having fun.


Volunteer a few hours a week at the local humane society. You can play with the animals and help out.
Sign up to be a Big Brother or Big Sisterwith your friends and do things with your Little Brother or Sister with your friends and their Littles.
Take a few shifts at your local soup kitchen or food bank with your buddies. If you can, try to donate food, as well<.

Most people find it easier to meet and make new friends in small group settings, so an interest group is often a better choice than a club or bar.Groups that allow you to engage with the same group of people regularly are more likely to result in friendships.


Pursue your own hobbies and interests. Depending on your interests, you could join a writing group, book club, bowling league (or similar adult sports league), gym, photography club, or cooking class. Getting involved in activities you can enjoy will help you meet people with similar interests.
Get involved with your child's school by joining the PTA or becoming a chaperone on field trips. This can be a great way to meet other parents.
Go to church. If you believe in a certain religion, start attending church. If you already go to church, get involved with any religious study groups, volunteer activities, or social events the church sets up.;
, No matter where you live, you're probably not the only adult interested in making new friends. Look for local groups and activities designed for the sole purpose of bringing strangers together.Choose activities and groups that you have an interest in. You will automatically have something in common with the other people.


This option works especially well for extroverts who don't mind large group settings.
Organizations like this usually arrange a variety of activities, from cocktail mixtures to ski trips.
If you don't know where to start looking, head online and check out daily deal services (Groupon, LivingSocial) or socializing services (Meetup.com).

, Ask yourself if there are any causes you feel especially compassionate about and look for volunteer opportunities that deal with those causes. You may make friends with the people you help or with some of the other volunteers. If you are shy, volunteering is good way to practice your social skills and talking to people that you do not know., Go to coworkers, relatives, or friends you already have and ask if they know of anyone you might get along with. Make it clear that you're only interested in meeting a platonic friend, not a romantic partner. Similarly, if someone suggests a friend to you without being asked, follow up and meet the person.


A blind “friend date” may or may not be successful, but in each instance, you'll never know unless you try.

, Nowadays, few people really take the time to meet the people living around them. Go for a walk in your neighborhood and greet the people you pass. There might be someone you can get along with living closer than you realize. If you have a dog, be sure to take it with you on your walk. Most people love animals, and someone who wouldn't approach you when you're on your own might approach you if it means meeting a friendly furry companion.If you do not have a dog, volunteer to walk dogs from an animal shelter or rescue group.

, Make light conversation with the people around you as you go about your usual errands. Some people might act uncomfortable, but others may reciprocate your goodwill and start talking back. Think of every meeting as a chance to make a new acquaintance. For instance, talk to people in line at the grocery store or while standing at the gas pump.


Going up to strangers is one of the most difficult ways to meet new people and can be difficult if you are shy or have difficulty starting random conversations., Too many people let the fact that they're alone stop them from enjoying all that their city has to offer. Force yourself out into the world without worrying about how it looks when you're by yourself. Visit places you enjoy. Go to a museum or head to a restaurant that serves your favorite cuisine, even if it's not an especially popular one. It'll be easier to run into people who have something in common with you., Few people will approach a stranger the first time they see him or her. If you become a familiar face at someone's favorite hangout, though, the other individual might become curious and eventually approach you.Choose a location with regular traffic yet small crowds.


For example, head to a local coffee shop every Saturday at 11 AM or a low-key pub every Thursday evening at 7 PM. Repeat the process for several weeks to several months.

, No matter where you go, greet the people you pass or see with a smile. Your body language needs to convey friendliness. Others are much more likely to approach someone who seems friendly than someone who seems grumpy or distant.Crossing your arms and/or legs and looking down make you less approachable and like you do not want to be bothered.

, You might expect your new friends to be similar to you in terms of age, gender, and circumstance, but if you limit yourself to that one demographic, you may accidentally pass someone by who you'd get along with surprisingly well.Just because you are single does not mean all of your friends have to be single. Build friendships based on common interests instead.For example, you might meet a neighbor 20 years older than you who happens to share your love for cooking and gardening, or you could make friends with someone 20 years younger than you who frequents the same museums and coffee shops.

, Before you put yourself out there, try to gauge if the other person is interested in making new friends as well. Does the person ask you questions about yourself? Is the conversation limited to small talk or goes beyond the surface? Does the person give you his or her attention when you are around?If you can answer yes to these questions, the person is likely open to building a friendship.
If the answer is no, maybe this person is not open to building a friendship at this point.

, Show an interest in how your acquaintance spends his or her free time. Ask about what he or she did the previous weekend or plans to do over the upcoming one.Showing a genuine interest in an acquaintance's social life signifies that you may not mind being a part of it.


Pay attention to the person when you interact with them. You will make more friends by showing that you are interested in the person than trying to make the person be interested in you.This might reassure your acquaintance that you would be open to an invitation if one is extended to you.

, Instead of waiting for the other person to make a move, make the first move yourself. Think about an activity your acquaintance might enjoy and ask if he or she would be interested in doing it with you over the weekend. If you have primarily spending time with the person in the confines of a group (e.g. club, organization, volunteering, etc.), you need need to invite the person to hang out outside of the confines of the group.Spending one-on-one time is key to building the friendship.
You can simply say, ""Hey, what are you doing on Saturday? Do you want to try out this new restaurant?""
Making informal invitations is a good way to determine if someone is interested in becoming friends, but it won't actually be enough to make someone your friend. You'll need to take the extra step and actually invite them out.
Accept invitations as well. You might be hesitant to accept it depending on the circumstances, but unless you have a good reason not to—like a prior commitment or a moral objection to the activity being suggested—it's better to take the risk than to pass the opportunity by.
Spending time with an acquaintance can be a good way to help your relationship grow into an actual friendship, even if the activity planned for the day usually isn't something you'd plan for yourself.
If you've been invited to a group event—a birthday party, a company picnic, drinks after work—you may even find yourself meeting and befriending someone there other than the person who invited you., The older you get, the more upfront you should be about your desire to become friends with someone.Directly telling someone that you want to be friends can break the ice, making it easier for your acquaintance to tell you where he or she stands, too. Suggest an activity that you would like to do with the person as well. Say, ""I'm going to _____ would you like to come?"" If the person does not want to be friends, it will be easier for them to turn down the activity instead of turning down you as a person.There's no shame in telling someone, ""We have a lot in common; let's try to be friends."" The key is to phrase your desire as something mutually beneficial so that you don't come across as being needy or awkward. The former statement sounds much better than, ""Would you please be my friend?""

, Casual conversation is fine for acquaintances, but if you want to turn this acquaintance into a friend, you'll need to drop the light stuff and start a heavier conversation. Vulnerability separates acquaintances from actual friends. You must be willing to open yourself up to other people.Start talking about your values. You don't need to reject someone whose perspective is different from yours, but it's often easier to connect with people who share your values and convictions. This may mean turning some people off, but it'll ultimately allow you to build deeper connections.
Get personal. Tell people about yourself. Explain what motivated you to pursue your current career path or describe the sorts of activities you do in your free time. Ask your acquaintances more about their lives, as well.
You should be honest with yourself throughout the process, too. Don't force yourself to spend hours on a topic your acquaintance loves even though you have no interest in it.

, Rejection is always a possibility when you put yourself out there. You will not like everyone you meet and vice versa. If rejection happens, have a healthy outlook.A person may decline your invitation for many reasons.


A person may be too busy to hang out or have prior commitments.
If someone does reject you, it is not because something is wrong with you. Maybe the two of you were not a good fit.
Be proud of yourself for trying to make friends and try to learn something from the experience.
Keep trying to befriend the same acquaintance.Try to make plans with someone a couple of times before giving up.. The only time you should give up sooner is if you're given a clear indication that your goodwill isn't wanted.
Keep trying to make friends with other people. Even if one person rejects your friendship completely, that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. After you've given up on one person, continue trying to make friends out of your other acquaintances.

, Making new friends is exciting and scary at the same time. Try different strategies to meet new people. The hardest part is actually going to that first group meeting and getting out of the house. It is okay to be nervous, just push through your feelings and go..


There will be times when you look silly, are embarrassed, or feel awkward. Some interactions will go really well and others will not. All of that is perfectly fine, and it is not a big deal., Social media is great in a lot of ways, but oftentimes, it acts as a crutch that prevents people from pushing themselves into real life social situations. When you feel lonely, turn off your computer and head out, call up a friend, or try to meet with an acquaintance. You must get out of the house to meet people and form friendships.


Social media websites offer the greatest benefit when they keep you more connected to your friends. If your social media accounts only give you an excuse to avoid real, meaningful contact with people, they're doing more harm than good.

, Forming friendships is a process. Both you and the other person must put in time and effort.It usually takes 6 to 8 significant interactions for people to come friends, and it may take years before you feel as if you can really confide in another person.Most adults have a fairly small social circle. Even when you've had some success, you may only be close with two or three different friends.


You may have different friends to meet different needs in your life. Some friends are for regular happy hour or lunches, while you may go hiking with another friend.
Working on a couple of close friendships or gathering a huge circle of casual friends are both options. Do whatever makes you happy.

, Keep in touch with your old friends and continually work on your relationship with any new friends you make. If you have hung out with someone and had a good time, invite them out again and keep in touch. Some friendships will take more time to grow than others.Some of your new friendships may start out great and then burn out. This is completely normal.
Try to schedule regular times to meet with your friends.If both of you are able to meet each Friday for an hour, go for it. For friends who are a bit busier, set aside at least one regular time to meet each month, like each second Sunday afternoon or every third Thursday evening.

,, This will help to alleviate fears in the dark.

, Games are a big part of a successful all-nighter. Here are plenty of examples for you to be inspired by:


Hide and Go seek in the dark.

, Before your friend's arrival, if you have enough time, take a nap! It might sound ridiculous, but it actually works. If you can't seem to doze off, or stand still, then don't. If you force yourself to take a nap, you'll get more tired and exhausted, and you'll waste time.


If you don't have much time, or they're on their way, try not to fool around. Get everything ready before they end up on your door-step. They probably won't want to help set up a sleepover, after all, you are the host!

"
"
Get on with the party from the start time.,
Be quiet when using other rooms during the all-nighter.,
Deal with scared guests as best you can.,
Do your best to stay awake.,
Eat well the next morning.",How to Host an All Nighter with Friends2," If it turns out somebody will be a bit late, or somebody showed up early, then don't sit around and wait. Begin doing activities while you wait for your friends. Once all of the guests arrive, start doing the good stuff. In other words, get this party started!

, This is especially important if the all-nighter isn't really condoned by the parents. If you need to go to the bathroom, but can't because you'll wake everyone up, don't go crazy, but don't flush. If you really have to no matter what, tell your friends and they'll pretend they're asleep, and mess up your hair so you have bed-head.


If you accidentally drop something or make some kind of noise, stop, drop and get into sleeping positions. Once you all are in sleeping position, stay completely quiet and count 10 seconds. If you hear footsteps, pretend you are asleep, If you count 10 seconds and hear no footsteps, you're usually good.
Need to use the microwave for something while your guardians are sleeping and it's loud? No fear, there's a solution for that. When you're going to put the food into the microwave, try to open it slowly. If you have to jerk it open, put your elbow on it and pull the handle. (That works for doors too) When you put it in, close the microwave slowly and wait at least 10 seconds. If you hear nothing, enter the numbers in. Make sure to put it a couple seconds ahead, so you can open it before it ends and starts beeping, and Voila! You have your cooked food.

, Give scared persons a flashlight and do some fun or funny things to help them feel better. They definitely don't want to be left out because they are scared. If that doesn't work, try making them feel better by turning on the lights, or if you can't do that, then explain how that could never happen. If silliness doesn't work, hopefully logic will.

, If you or your friends are feeling sleepy, do some more activities. If you are doing activities, either you aren't occupied enough, it's not very active, or the game is boring.


A good tip to keep awake is to eat spicy or sour foods. They mess with your taste buds and the sugar will keep you up. Same goes with caffeinated drinks. Such as: Soda, Coke, Coffee, Monster, Redbull, root beer, or any other brand names.
If you can't eat, or that doesn't work, try stepping things up a bit. Pillow fights, scary movies, or other time consuming, interesting and fun things. If fun's not the problem, you may just need to splash some water on your face.

, Once you and all your friends have finally stayed up or finished the sleepover, be sure to have a good breakfast and send your guests off with a smile! Just be sure to tell them to make up the hours of sleep they lost, especially if it's during the school year!

Remember why you want to stay friends with your high school friends.,
Don't ignore your old friends because of new friends.,
Make sure that you have your friends' contact details.,
Make sure to see your old friends in person, too.,
Keep on top of your work in college.,
Don't forget important details about your old friends and make sure you're updated on important new details about your friends.",How to Keep High School Friendships in College," If you're going to keep in contact with old friends, then you need to remember why you're doing it. If you're only doing it for the purpose of having more friends, then it's not going to work. However, if you truly care about each individual friend and remember all the fun times you've had together, then it's much easier for you to want to keep them as a chum.;
, Each friend (new or old) should be equal in your eyes. If you tell your old high school friends you can't hang out with them because you're hanging out with your new college friends, then they could get very upset and hurt and will think that you've changed. To avoid this, make sure you even out the time spent with new and old friends and don't be afraid to introduce your new friends to your old ones so that you can all hang out together.

, This means things like: home address, home phone number, mobile phone number, social media accounts, and email addresses. However, it's meaningless to have a list of all your friends' contact details if you never use them. Contact your friends regularly. The more regular you are in contacting your friends, the closer you will be with them.


For example, if you only talk to you old friend once a year via email, then you're unlikely to have the same close relationship you did in high school.

, Although contacting friends online and through the phone is a great way to catch up without going all the way over to see them, if you really want a close relationship with them, then you'll have to see them in person every so often too. Whether it's just going on a jog together through town or a 3 day sleepover at their house, you have to make the time to keep your old friends.

, College work is very time-consuming, especially in your final year. This makes it hard to spend quality time with new friends, let alone old friends. However, this is why it's necessary to manage your time efficiently, so that there is time for work and play. Your work is very important, but too much work and no play can make you unhealthy and overly-stressed. Also, your friends might get the wrong idea and think that you don't care about them at all.

, Forgetting these things might not affect your life in college, as your friend's birthday isn't the answer to question 6 in the final exam, but if you want to maintain a successful friendship, these things are absolutely critical. If you really find it hard to remember these things, write them down in a notebook. That way, when you need a little recap, you can just flick through your notes.


For example, don't forget your old friend's birthday, but also make sure you remember the name of the new guy/girl he or she is dating.

, If you don't have a phone handy, you can just walk over to your friend's house. Make sure you get permission from your parents and your friend's parents too.

,  This would include:


Warm winter coat
Snow pants
Hat/scarf
Winter boots
Gloves.

, If your friends don't have something they may need, then lend something to them, or even give it to them.

, Now you can finally get to doing fun stuff! Fun activities could include:

Building a snowman
Making snow angels
Having a snowball fight
Sledding (This is perfect if you live on a hill or one near you that is open to the public)
Building a giant snow slide
Catching snowflakes on your tongue during a snowfall.

, Everyone loves to have a shelter where they can be protected from the wind! You'll want to gather up friends and build snow bricks and place them in a circle. If you want to go the easy route, make a big snow pile and dig into it. Get your friends to help too.

, Make a huge ball of snow, one slightly smaller, and the last small. Stack them up and add stuff like old scarves, hats, a carrot and coal for eyes, buttons, and a mouth, and if you want, a pipe.

, Get on the ground, and spread out your arms and legs and back in over and over again. Get up and look at your creation.

, Get sleds and put 1/4 of a sled into snow, and build some foundation around it. This way, when you have a snowball fight, you have shields. Make sure to throw the snowballs lightly and don't make them really packed.

, Get a sled, go to a hill, and sled! You can even build some ramps in the middle of the hill to make it more fun! You can also challenge your friends to surf down on the sled, go on backward, or go with multiple people! Just be careful.

, Though it may take up to 6 hours a day of making a pile of snow, shaping it, and letting it freeze overnight seems like a lot of effort, it's worth it. You can also build Ramos into it and do fun and crazy poses down it.

Try couples therapy.",How to Forgive Someone Who Betrays You," Forgiveness does not mean excusing or accepting the betrayal. Rather, forgiveness is the act of freeing yourself of the anguish and anger that you’ve felt towards the person who betrayed you. Forgiveness means letting go of your grudge against the other person.Even though resenting someone who betrayed you seems like an appropriate response, in fact the only one you’re hurting when you refuse to move on is you.
If you do not forgive others after a betrayal, you will always in some sense remain tethered to the person who wronged you, and won’t be able to live your own life to full capacity.;
, There are two primary reasons why you might forgive someone. One is to stay true to the value system you believe in. The other is to help you overcome the emotional pain caused by betrayal.Both are valid, and can work in tandem.


Religious traditions, especially, encourage forgiveness.
The second reason you might choose to forgive is to move beyond the pain and misery caused by the person who betrayed you. When thinking about this motive, you use forgiveness as a tool to help you work your way through the sadness of your betrayal.

, Making an explicit decision to forgive is important, but actually experiencing forgiveness and being free of the pain can take time. Forgiveness is a process and won’t happen overnight. Even slight betrayals can take time to stop hurting; however, if you actively maintain forgiveness as your goal, you will eventually get there., Some betrayals are so awful that afterwards, you are unwilling or unable to recover the relationship. Even when you forgive someone, you might feel that the relationship is not one you want to salvage.


Think about your relationship with the person who betrayed you. Are they an integral part of your life? Can you imagine life without them?
Analyze the person’s character. Someone is only worth rebuilding a relationship with if they demonstrate sincere sorrow for what they did and are actively working to regain your trust., If you’re sad, ashamed, or angry about being betrayed, that is perfectly natural. Try to find positive ways to deal with these feelings. Accepting how you feel is an important step toward emotional recovery, which is the first step toward forgiveness.


You might also feel resentment, contempt, and disgust at the person who betrayed you., Writing a letter is therapeutic because it allows you to express yourself in an honest, thoughtful way. After a few days, go back and re-read the letter, reflecting on its contents. You don’t need to send the letter, though you could. Alternately, you could choose to burn the letter afterwards in order to help you exorcise the negative feelings the letter contained. Writing a letter can provide emotional healing for you, moving you further along in the process of forgiveness., Getting support from those who care about and love you is an important step in recovering emotionally after a betrayal. Explain the betrayal to your friend or family member. Once you’ve talked through the betrayal with someone, you’ll feel better, and be more willing to forgive.


You could also talk to someone you trust about methods they used to help forgive someone who betrayed them.
If you do not feel comfortable talking to someone within your social circle, you could consult a therapist. Therapists are trained in helping people deal with conflicted, painful feelings, including how to cope with betrayal.

, When you’re betrayed, you might feel an intense pain and sense of powerlessness. To restore a sense of power to your life, you need to think of yourself as someone who does things, rather than as someone who endures or suffers from things done to them at the hands of someone who has betrayed you. Unless you feel a sense of autonomy in your own life, it may be difficult to forgive anyone else or heal fully from the betrayal. Use positive self-talk to reclaim power in your life.
For instance, say to yourself, “I value myself and others. Others value and love me in return. I will show attention, affection, and love to people who make me feel safe and loved.”

, Shift your attention away from the betrayal and the pain it brought you by using restorative images. Restorative images reinforce positive thinking and healthy values by keeping you focused on safety, happiness, and your own future instead of looking backwards toward the pain in your past. With positive images in mind, you’ll be able to see the process of forgiveness as a healthy step on the road to your own healing.To tap into the power of restorative images, simply imagine a scene that embodies something positive that you value. For instance, perhaps you identify love as one of your positive core values. Think back on your life to a time when you felt truly loved. Perhaps you will assign the restorative image associated with love to your childhood, where you were raised by a loving mother and father.
Restorative images can be drawn from your own life experience or imagined.

, Self-confidence refers to the idea that your life has value, and that you are capable of learning from and overcoming challenges. Following a betrayal, you might find you are not very confident in yourself since you have been hurt and may feel your sense of worth shaken. Rebuilding your self-confidence requires recalling your past victories at work, school, or in your personal life, or creating new victories for yourself in those realms.Once you've rebuilt your self-confidence, you will feel empowered to forgive the person who betrayed you.


Positive self-talk is also useful for rebuilding your confidence. For instance, if you’re plagued by the idea that, “I deserved to be betrayed because I was dumb,” counter this inaccuracy by telling yourself, “I did not deserve to be betrayed, and the person who betrayed me was wrong to do so.”
Learn to challenge negative self-talk so that you will be able to respond in a constructive way.
Do things you know you’re good at. If you’re a talented musician, join a band or write some songs. If you’re a strong athlete, join a community sports team. Doing things you’re good at will help you feel more confident.

, Mindfulness refers to a suite of abilities, each of which can help you move recover emotionally from the betrayal you suffered. Staying mindful means being objective when thinking about your betrayal and acting in a thoughtful, deliberate way. Live in the moment and remember that the betrayal is in the past. This will give you the necessary perspective on the betrayal to think about in less reactive ways like seeking vengeance or wishing to harm the person who betrayed you., In the context of forgiving a betrayer and healing yourself, self-compassion is the understanding that sometimes life is painful, but through your pain, you are connected to the rest of humanity.Think about others who have been betrayed by someone, even if it’s someone fictional. Thinking about the fact that your situation is not unique and that others have overcome betrayal in their own lives will help you feel less isolated and alone. By gaining new perspectives on your betrayal and your feelings through self-compassion, you will be better equipped to forgive the betrayer.


For instance, you might remember how Lando Calrissian betrayed Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back, but they were eventually reconciled when Han forgave Lando.

, After being betrayed, we have a tendency to blame ourselves or beat ourselves up. Instead, recognize that there was no way you could have known you’d be betrayed. Remember that while you have no control over the actions of others, you do have control over yourself, and can choose to love yourself. Forgiveness is, at its core, an act of love, and it will be difficult to love or forgive anyone else unless you can love yourself.Love yourself in tangible ways like spending time with friends and family, going shopping at your favorite store, or relaxing in a warm bath.

, While the betrayal you experienced may seem senseless and random at the time, step back and try to give the experience value. Instead of thinking of it as a completely terrible event without any beneficial aspects, you could think of ways in which you might actually be thankful for it. The meaning you take from the misery of betrayal can bolster your emotional strength, which you can then use to forgive the person who betrayed you.For instance, if your partner was cheating on you, you might feel glad that you discovered the betrayal when you did, thus ceasing a potentially ongoing cycle of betrayal.
You could also think about the betrayal as something painful that you had to endure, but like a sword forged in flame, you have emerged stronger for having passed through the betrayal.

, Being honest with the person who betrayed you can be extremely difficult. You already feel vulnerable with the person who let you down, and revealing more about yourself or your emotional state might seem impossible; however, if you want to fix your relationship with the person, you must take the risk and open up to him.Stay calm when confronting the person who betrayed you. While it may be tempting to yell, scream, and accuse him, the mature response is to speak calmly in an even tone and be direct when talking about how you feel.
Use “I” statements when expressing your feelings. For instance, you could say, “I feel very hurt by your actions.” Avoid accusatory “you” statements like, “You are a rotten person and do not deserve to be happy.”

, A large part of rebuilding trust is for the person who betrayed you to acknowledge she did something wrong. The person who betrayed you should be aware of your emotions about the betrayal and try to understand why you feel betrayed (if it isn’t obvious). If both of you are interested in making things right again, you can move deeper into the process of rebuilding trust.Empathy on the part of both the person who betrayed you and yourself is crucial. Try to understand why she did what she did without excusing her behavior.
Explicit forgiveness — speaking the exact words “I forgive you” to the person who betrayed you — is actually not necessary to rebuild your relationship;however, it could help.

, If you were betrayed by a partner or spouse, you could consider attending couples therapy. Couples therapy involves talking to your spouse and a therapist who is specially trained to act as a mediator.The therapist will work with you and your partner to discover the underlying causes of the betrayal, help you cope with the pain, and prepare you to forgive your partner.
The therapy session provides a safe space in which you and your partner can work out your feelings about the betrayal in order to decide how to proceed in rebuilding what you had.

Ask for help.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Hug your pillow.,
Work up to it.,
Discover some benefits to hugging.",How to Like and Accept Hugs1," Is there one person you feel comfortable hugging, like a close friend or a family member? Find somebody who will not make you feel weird that you don’t like to hug, and maybe suggest ways to make your hug feel more natural.


For example, you could ask a friend to grade you, or rate you on your hug. You can make a game out of it and make it easier for your friend to give you a bad, but honest assessment. Hearing from your friend that your hug is a D-plus or a 3 is easier to swallow than “That was a terrible hug, yuck.”
Ask how you can improve. They may give you some useful feedback like, “Don’t be so stiff,” or “Come closer, because you feel really far away.”;
, Hugs are bad for both people if one person is rigid. Find some strategies to help yourself stay relaxed.


Take a deep breath and exhale.Get the tension out of your arms by consciously tensing them up, holding the tension for a few seconds, and then relaxing. Your arms will feel more relaxed. You can try this technique with your whole body as well.Don’t put pressure on yourself to “get it right.” It’s just a hug! If you are hugging someone, it’s presumably because you care about them. Chances are they care about you, too, and won’t judge you on how you do it.

, Yes, it sounds a little strange. But no one needs to know you are doing it. Pretend the pillow is a person and practice relaxing into the pillow. Figure out where your arms and head feel most comfortable.

, Don’t jump right into big bear hugs if you are not a touchy-feely person. Take small steps toward your goal of a full hug, by breaking the action down into smaller steps. Once you are comfortable with the small action, move on to the next, bigger action.For example, you might progress this way:


Shaking hands
Touching other person’s upper arm
Putting your arm around them (AKA the side hug)
Putting one arm around their shoulders while facing them
Full hug

, Hugging may not feel very natural or comfortable to you, but there are lots of reasons to give and receive hugs. They do more than just show affection. For example, hugs:


Reduce stress.Hugs trigger your brain to produce oxytocin, which helps you feel relaxed and thus, less stressed. Keep you healthy. Stress taxes your immune system. If you are receiving hugs, you are reducing your stress level. Because you are feeling less stressed, you are less likely to get sick. Help you feel connected to others. Oxytocin is known as “the bonding hormone,” which is the same hormone triggered in new mothers following the birth of a baby. Hugs help you feel that others are supporting you and reduce the feeling of loneliness, itself a stressor."
"
Have welcoming body language.,
Accept a hug with confidence.,
Focus on the things you like about the hug.,
Signal the end of the hug.",How to Like and Accept Hugs2," In order for you to accept a hug, someone needs to want to give you one. You will not get a hug if you look uncomfortable or unfriendly.


Face the person who wants to hug you and smile.
Hold your arms out at your sides, ready to receive a hug. Don’t cross your arms or keep them straight at your sides.

, Are you ready to embrace a hug with open arms (pun intended)? Here are some things to keep in mind when you are hugging someone:


When hugging, try to tilt your head in the opposite direction to the person. If they turn their head to the left, go right. Otherwise you'll end up bumping heads, and that's super awkward.
When you put your arms around them, try not to stick your elbows out awkwardly. It feels more natural to the person being hugged to have your elbows closer toward them.
A hug doesn't have to be long. A few seconds is completely appropriate.

, Does it make you feel warm or relaxed? Did it make you smile? Remember those feelings for the next time you hug someone. This will help you associate positive feelings with being hugged.

, If you are just getting comfortable with hugs, you may not want to be hugged for that long. Here are some body language cues that you could try to indicate you are finished hugging:


Giving the person a quick, tighter squeeze, then backing out of the hug.
Stepping back and briefly putting your hands on the person’s upper arms as you back out.
Transition to a sideways hug and pull away.

"
"
Figure out some alternatives to hugging.,
Give others social cues.,
Go easy on yourself.,
Decide if it is a bigger problem.",How to Like and Accept Hugs3," If you’re not comfortable with hugs, there are other ways you may feel more comfortable expressing warmth, friendliness, or comfort. Consider shaking hands, patting someone on the back, or putting an arm around them instead.

, If you don’t like hugging, make sure you let people know. You can tell the truth and say, for example, “I’m sorry, I’ve never liked being hugged,” or you can try another strategy:


When you see someone approaching with their arms out, offer your hand to shake instead. Most of the time, people will pick up on this nonverbal cue.
Put your hand up in front of you (like you’re telling someone to wait) and say, “You might not want to hug me, I’m just getting over a terrible cold.”
Make a joke out of it. “I’m the world’s worst hugger, you don’t want to hug me!” and pull back.
Just get hugged for a second and pull away quickly.

, There's no rule in this world that you have to give and enjoy hugs. It's a personal preference, and you shouldn't force yourself to learn to enjoy them just to fit in. Just as some people don’t like being in big crowds or in small spaces, you simply have a different comfort level than others.

, If you have a genuine fear of being touched by someone else, you may have haphephobia.You may wish to seek counseling to help you get over your phobia.

First get three friends together.,
Find some place that has thick carpet and is somewhat sound proofed or isolated.

,
Then each of you sits with your legs overlapping a leg of each other, forming the edges of a triangle.,
Then tie each pair of legs together (ankle to thigh) with 6 pieces of soft rope or a few scarves forming a triangle.

Agree to disagree.,
Show respect.,
Focus on the better aspects in your friendship and find common ground.,
Support your friend if other people pick on them.",How to Be Okay with Having a Communist Friend1," The best part about making friends is understanding each other. If your friend is communist and you uphold a different ideology, you can still get along very well. Politics will just be one area where you won't meet eye to eye. Understand that you don't have to agree with your friend in order to get along., If someone doesn't share the same beliefs as you do, they don't deserve to be criticized or scrutinized. Set aside their beliefs and treat them based on the respect you feel they deserve. Friendships should be void of harsh treatment of one another. Respect can focus on things such has hard work, treatment of others, their abilities, and characteristics. , Arguing about communism is not going to create a strong bond. People offer other interests aside from politics. Figure out what drew you to that person in the first place, such as school, sports, or work. The best friendships are well rounded.

, No one needs to be bullied for what they believe. If your friend receives harsh treatment from others who oppose Communism, stand up for your friend. That will be the best thing for your friendship, and it will open the eyes of others.

Ask your friend about her or his beliefs.,
Learn about communism.,
Separate communism from tyranny and dictatorships.,
In Marxist theory, all governments in human history have been a class dictatorship, meaning that the state is under the command of the interests of one social class.,
Research the core beliefs of communism.",How to Be Okay with Having a Communist Friend2," Learning from one another is essential to any relationship, and friends should have a lot to offer. Inquire about your friend's Communist beliefs. Ask open ended questions that start with what or how, and let yourself refrain from any interruptions or judgement., Communism is a theory, and when you focus on the errors of those who falsely practiced that theory, you prevent yourself from learning. Try reading The Principles of Communism by Engels, The State and Revolution by Lenin, or The Communist Manifesto by Engels and Marx. Also, be careful with the sources you seek; propaganda and biased journalism exists to create fear and hate at times., A common misconception people hold about communism is what we've seen in the past. Most countries that have attempted to execute a communist economy have resembled more of a dictatorship or a tyranny. A real communist does not support a dictatorship of rulers over the population.

, This is why communists refer to capitalism as the ""dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (capitalists)"" and refer to socialism as the ""dictatorship of the proletariat (workers).

, Go online and read books about communism. You will not be sacrificing your own beliefs by educating yourself on the subject. You might be interested to see that communism can be made up of several differentiating political parties similar to what the United States has. Also, communism shares a lot of views that are not necessarily political; communism cares about the environment in a similar way the USA and other countries do."

Trying to debunk a political theory by slandering the personal life of the person who supports such theory is called an ad hominem.,
Understand your own beliefs.,
Listen with interest and reply without sarcasm.,
Leave out harsh judgments.,
Realize you cannot impose your beliefs.,
Listen to each other.,
Admit when you are wrong.",How to Be Okay with Having a Communist Friend3," This is a common logical fallacy so be careful.

, In order to have a good discussion, you must be informed. Learn more about your beliefs. A lot of times, our belief system can be influenced by our surroundings and become innate; however, that natural feeling towards a belief system does not always insure we will be properly informed. Moreover, politics is a huge subject that can change and present new information daily., A discussion can turn in to an argument quickly, and the best way to avoid that is by listening like a good parent or student. Listening to someone does not mean you are submitting to their beliefs. Also, when you reply, speak kindly and intelligently. We enjoy a lot of political analysts who use sharp and sarcastic delivery in both monologues and dialogues. However, all that is done for entertainment. In the real world, sarcasm is not received well by all and is taken offensively by a lot people., Your friend doesn't hold communist beliefs just to anger you. If you start feeling angry during a conversation with your friend, ask yourself where the anger is coming from. It might not actually have its source in your friend's beliefs. Distinguishing your vulnerability before hand can help you avoid certain specific topics. If ever you feel the discussion may have triggered you, be kind enough to ask to change the subject.

, Having a discussion with your friend is meant to open up friendship and share ideas. If you enter discussions with hopes of manipulating the conversation and influencing your friend's beliefs, then nothing well will come out of it. Ignore any thoughts of changing how your friend views the world. Even if you are passionate about the subject, that doesn't give you the right to impose upon your friend., A successful dialogue happens when individuals create new ideas together. The creation and problem solving can only happen with good listening. When your friend is discussing a point, don't interrupt. Give the person time, and don't counter argue by repeatedly stating but but but; using that word immediately negates what was just said, like it didn't even matter. If you wish to get along, you should treat each others ideas as though they do matter., If discussions lead to arguments all the time, then something must be changed, and someone must be wrong. If the discussions lead to an argument that you keep bring up over and over again, chances are you can be wrong for trying to manipulate the discussion. Try to refrain from confusing facts for opinions. Facts should speak for themselves--whether you like believing them or not. Opinions are arguable, so when you feel the discussion is getting very opinion heavy, refrain from being stubborn on a certain point. Admitting you're wrong is fine around friends. If you feel admitting you are wrong is some kind of defeat or concession to your friends beliefs, then reevaluate why you have discussions with your friend."

Dial *67 before your call.,
Dial #31# before the number.,
Dial the specific blocking code in your country.",How to Block Caller ID1," Phone providers in North America offer a *67 feature for landlines and (many) cell phones that prevents your information from being shown on the receiver’s display. This only works on a per-call basis, and you have to dial *67 before every blocked call you want to make. Using a temporary blocking code may also allow you to make calls to phones that have blocked your number.


To use this feature, most providers simply require you dial *67, followed by the 10-digit number (the area code plus the number) you are calling.
Some providers, such as Xfinityand Bell,will provide a confirmation beep or tone after you dial *67, so wait for the regular dial tone to return before dialing the 10-digit number you wish to call.
For those wishing to temporarily block their phone number from being seen on an iPhone on the Verizon network, use this trigger before dialing the number to block your number from being seen on the recipient's phone's caller ID box. As you'll learn later, setting up permanent block with Verizon is done through their web interface and can become a nuisance. Other branded iPhones come with Block Caller ID settings in the settings app that can work, but Verizon's iPhones work differently and don't come with these and *67 works wonders.;
, This feature works that same as *67, but will work for different cell phones in North America. This code also works on mobile devices in many other countries, including New Zealand,Australia, and GSM (Global System for Mobile) phones in Europe., Many countries offer a service for landlines that’s similar to *67 that works on a per-call basis. Dial the particular code that's specific to the country you're in before dialing the rest of the phone number.


Dial 141 in the United Kingdom.Dial 1831 in Australia.Check your phone carrier’s website for the specific code to dial in other countries.

Ask your phone provider to set up a line block.,
Change the settings on your mobile phone.,
Install a blocking application on your mobile.",How to Block Caller ID2," Most cellular and landline phone carriers offer a permanent line block that will prevent your caller ID information from being transmitted to the receiver for every call you make. There will likely be a fee for this service, but you won't have to punch in an extra code before every call.


Most North American cellular providers can be reached by calling 611 on a mobile device.
Some callers have automatic rejection systems set up that will decline calls from blocked numbers. Your phone provider will have a code that will allow you to temporarily disable your caller ID block on a per-call basis in case you need to contact these numbers.

, Most mobile phones provide the option to turn caller ID on and off, and this should usually allow you to get through to phones that have blocked your number as well. Phones are configured differently and can even vary between carriers, but for cell phones that offer this feature:


On iPhones: go to Settings > Phone > Show My Caller ID. Then turn off caller ID. This will work for many carriers but not all; for example, Verizon requires that you change these settings on their website rather than on the phone itself.On Samsung phones: go to Apps > Settings > My Device. Then select Call, and from there Call Settings > Additional settings > Caller ID. Then select Hide Number.On HTC phones: from the Menu, select Settings > Call > Additional Settings > Caller ID. Select Hide Number.On LG phones: from the Phone application, select Call Settings. Find and select Caller ID, and then select Hide Number.On Blackberrys: from the Phone application, select the Blackberry button > Options > In-Call Settings. Under Restrict My Identity, select Always. Press the Blackberry button > Save.

, There are several apps for mobile phones that will block your caller ID if your cell phone doesn’t offer the option to turn it off. From your application store, look for apps such as CallerID Blocker.

Some people prefer communicating electronically while others like to use penpals as a means of creative communication.


The International Union of Mail-Artists is a website dedicated to those who like sending postal art to their penpals. IUMOA is a much more niche community as it has roughly 4,000 active members. However, it is the perfect medium for those who like to have an artistic element to their penpal correspondences. Swap-Bot is another website dedicated to creative forms of corresponding. The website focuses on swapping where users exchange postcards, stickers, coins, and a variety of other small crafts. Swapping is ideal for hobbyists and those interested in sending hand-assembled mail. Global Pen Friends is a good example of a website designed to facilitate more traditional penpal relationships. Users can search for potential penpal partners from around the world, using a nuanced search engine to find their perfect penpal. Instead of sending crafts or postal art, users communicate through writing. ;
, Some websites don’t allow users to add their postal addresses, preferring more secure electronic communication. If you prefer old-fashioned snail mail and the feel of fresh paper, then it’s best to find a website that facilitates postal communication. Global Pen Friends allows both electronic and postal correspondence, where users can exchange physical addresses after establishing contact. , Many websites allow you to search for penpals for free, but require premium memberships where users pay a low monthly or annual fee in exchange for communication with their penpal. Other websites allow for free memberships, but that often comes at the cost of excessive advertisements. InterPals is a reliable free penpal website with a robust database of users and minimal advertisements , Check out any suggestions listed in this guide, but feel free to search for a website on your own. However, there are a great deal of poorly run or defunct penpal websites so it’s important to know how to find the right one.


Look at the website’s design. Is it clunky, filled with oversized text, and stuffed with annoying advertisements? These are all telltale signs of an inefficient penpal website. A trustworthy website should have a sleek, user-friendly layout with a well-defined explanation of how the website works.
Check out the frequently asked questions section. This part of the website should answer all of the important questions about whether it’s a paid website, how to setup a profile, and whether it allows for postal and/or electronic communication.
Play around with the website before you decide to make a profile. Check out the search engine and see how easy it is to use. Look at how many users are available to communicate with and see if you can find users from the countries you’re interested in.

, When you have activated your account, it's time to set up your own profile which other pen pals can see. Designing a profile plays a key role in getting new pen pals. Depending on this information, members will choose to click on your profile when they are searching for members and whether to write you a message. Complete the about me and hobby boxes with great detail, because this is how users decide if they have anything in common with you. Upload at least one good profile picture so people know you are a real person. Be thorough with your personal description, but careful not to give away any personal information you aren’t comfortable with sharing.

, Consider where you want your penpal to be from, how old you want them to be, and whether you want a male or female penpal. It's best to be flexible on terms of locations and stick to someone only two years older or younger than you if you are a kid, maybe even a difference of five or so if you are an adult. Having a penpal can be a wonderful educational experience, so put some thought into what you want to learn.

, When looking through profiles pay attention to what the users enjoy doing so you can find someone who shares your particular interest. Or choose someone with a completely different set of hobbies so the both of you can teach each other something new.

, Think about a part of the world you’ve always been curious about but never had a chance to visit. A penpal can give you a personal look into a country that you wouldn’t be able to get through any other means. Many people pick penpals in faraway countries with varying host languages, which is a crucial aspect to consider when choosing a communicant. Make sure that you and your penpal will be able to understand each other using some common language. Penpals are fantastic ways to learn and practice new languages, so consider looking for one who speaks a language you're interested in learning or understanding better.

, There are often elderly users who are interested in developing friendships in their old age. Communicating with these penpals can not only allow you to make a friend across generations, but help somebody who needs a friend.

, Most penpal sites have many search options that allow you to sift through multiple possibilities for new pen pals. For example, Global Pen Friends has a robust search engine that lets you tweak various search parameters.


In its basic search, Global Pen Friends lets you choose gender, age, country, state/province, city/town, and whether you only want to search for profiles with photos and registered postal addresses.
There are even more options available on its advanced search where you can choose the preferred race, religion, hobbies, language, and whether you want to communicate via snail mail or electronically.
It’s important to be flexible with your search as it may be difficult to find your ideal penpal. Try searching for penpals with different interests and experiences as you often learn much more from these correspondences. , When you find a penpal you’re interested in, websites will allow you to add them as friends or send them a message. Don't get attached to them before they write back to avoid letdowns. Paid websites will typically only let you send one initial message or a smiley, so make sure you have a premium membership if you’re trying to maintain contact.

, Write a bit about yourself and why you are writing. For example, you could say “I am a high school student in Allentown, Pennsylvania looking to find friends abroad who are interested in botany.” Don’t give too much information upfront so you can decide if this is the right penpal for you before disclosing a physical address.

, As you communicate with your penpal, you will inevitably start sharing more about yourself. Developing a friendship is a game of give and take where you each reveal more personal information as time goes on. Try to progress your communication naturally like you would in any friendship. Start off by talking about the basics such as your profession and interests, then start to divulge difficult emotions, hardships, and insecurities as you and your penpal can begin to know each other on a deeper level. However, only reveal more about yourself if you feel absolutely comfortable with the individual you're communicating with.

, Penpals offer up a wonderful opportunity to make friends across the world, but it also puts you in a vulnerable place. Be careful when giving out personal information, even simple things such as your Skype, email, MSN, phone number, etc. Wait some time before giving out or asking for other information. Build up trust over time. Be wary of displaying your email address on your profile as spammers can use it to send unwanted emails. Always use your judgement when sharing personal details with your penpal, making sure you trust this person before revealing anything too intimate.

, Keeping in contact with a penpal seems like something that should be painless, but it’s easy to slip up in your communication. Developing a lasting friendship with your penpal is like maintaining any other friendship - it requires time and dedication. You must make the effort to regularly correspond with your penpal, otherwise your friendship could slip away. Create a routine. Whether it’s once a week or once a month, carve out an hour in your schedule to sit down and write a thoughtful letter to your penpal.
If your penpal starts to correspond less, consider sending a follow-up letter to make sure they are okay.
Think about keeping in touch through social media outlets like Facebook and Instagram in order to strengthen your relationship. Social media can be a great way to maintain regular contact with your penpal and learn more about their lives.
Consider meeting in person or at some point in the future. This option may not be available if you don’t have the financial means to travel a great distance, but if the relationship with your penpal is strong then an in-person meeting is the perfect way to take your friendship to the next level.

, Developing an enriching penpal friendship takes even longer than normal friendships considering how long it can take snail mail to travel around the world. Realize that you should be ready to at least correspond for a few years in order to truly get to know your penpal. Slowly understanding the ins and outs of someone else can be a rewarding experience that only becomes richer with time. If you make the effort to keep a consistent correspondence and allow time to know your penpal, then a distant stranger could become a lifelong friend.

It is important that you cut opposite sides off otherwise the you stand a 50/50 chance of screwing up step three. If you look at the connectors with the hook down you should see four wires in this order Black, Red, Green, Yellow from left to right and the other connector will have them in reverse order.

, Using a sharp knife or razor blade remove an inch of the outer plastic covering from the end you just cut. This should reveal four wires, strip 1/2"" off of each of these individual wires.

, If you cut the wires properly you should be able to match up the colors if you didn’t just make sure the wire that is on the far left of one connector is on the far right on the other side of the wire. (See diagram)



Viewed with hooks facing down on all connectors. (TOP) If the wires were properly cut they can be spliced by matching up the colors. (BOTTOM) If they wires were not properly cut be sure the wires are in reverse order (from left to right) ie bottom wire remains on bottom.







, Twist each wire with the wires you are connecting it to. If you have access to a soldering iron you should solder them together.

, If you have electrical tape (black plastic tape) on hand use this, otherwise any tape can be used for a TEMPORARY fix. If you do not tape each wire individually the wires could short and your cable will be useless.

Make sure that you have the correct access numbers for your call destination.",How to Avoid Phone Card Problems," These are the charges imposed in a phone card that include maintenance, connection, and service fees. These are additional charges for the maintenance of the telephone line, whenever your call is connected and for the service provider of the card. Usually, cards with very low rates have hidden charges. Your calling time will be reduced. Better buy a card that has a smaller amount and then you consume in one call. If your card already includes hidden charges, be sure that your calls are made longer to avoid the connection fee. As much as possible, avoid hidden charges that limit every call that you make.;
, Some cards, when used in a mobile or pay phone, charge you with certain amount. Restrict your calls to fixed phones so that you will have longer time for your other calls.

, The billing increment in your card should be lower. Better phone cards have one minute rounding since these cards avoid extra charges and shorter talking minutes. When your call is less than a minute, your card will charge an amount corresponding to the next full minute of your call.

, When you have already purchased your chosen card for your calling needs, you should not forget that there are still important information you needed before you can make a call. You should confirm that you acquired the valid PIN for your phone card especially if you are going on a travel. Confirm to the retailer and service provider that your card is ready to use even to the place of your destination.

, Together with the PIN, these numbers must also be confirmed to be correct. When you are planning to travel, be sure that these numbers can be used in the place where you are going. To be sure that yo have the right numbers, dial the one access number and follow the voice instruction. You can try calling the customer service because companies do not impose extra charges for this transaction. With the correct access numbers, you can save from your calls because the rates are cheaper and you will have extra usable minutes.

Problems?,
Remove air bubbles.,
Finished!",How to Apply a Screen Protector," They typically come custom-cut. (In a pinch, see the ""Tips"" to cut one down to fit.) There are a few basic materials:


Semi-hard, slick, clear soda-bottle style such as PET, the most common and generally best. (Gimmicky variations such as semi-reflective or matte can be fun, but less practical.)
Very hard, clear tempered glass, like a stronger microscope coverslip. Should have a plastic layer to hold together if damaged. Extremely scratch resistant, but brittle; tends to flake apart progressively once chipped.
Very tough, thick plastic such as polycarbonate. Provides direct impact protection. Not very scratch resistant--won't stay pretty. May reduce accuracy of touchscreens.
Soft vinyl plastic. Not recommended as generally less pleasant to use, but does prevent scratches.;
, Screen protectors mostly ward off light cosmetic scrapes and scratches, not breakage--a particular danger for fancy cell phones with their all glass fronts and often minimal plastic edge cushioning. A ""bumper"" case that wraps around the front edge of a phone can provide fairly effective yet stylish impact protection. Keep it out of back pockets and other crush danger areas.








, Anywhere indoors with calm air is a good start. You can improve things with steam. Running a hot shower works well, which fills the room with steam. When the steam has subsided, there will be less dust in the air than usual. This is the best time to apply the screen protector.








, Dry them with a clean towel. Shake off any excessive lint.

, Wipe it with a mild solvent like eyeglass cleaner or rubbing alcohol--or a damp soapy rag, which would not risk damage to low quality surrounding finishes. Rub it dry with a soft cloth and remove as much lint as possible with a blower or by wiping lightly with a lint free cloth, such as the microfiber wipe often provided with the screen protector.








, Carefully remove it from its box or packaging.Before you lift its backing, position the screen protector over the screen to see how much margin to leave on each side and ensure clearance of features such as camera spots (with which the screen protector's less even surface would interfere) and microphone holes.








, Dust is the most important thing to remove from under a screen protector: bubbles will eventually diffuse out through the plastic and tiny finger marks will probably merge with the glue, but dust specks stay. Lightly dab a sticky note (such as a ""Post-it"") all over the screen. Looking at the reflection of a bright area in the screen at an angle will confirm the presence or absence of dust. Quickly attach the screen protector before dust can gather!









Some fancy screen protector kits include a special sticker to pick up dust.

, Peel back the screen protector's backing from one end (leaving it on the other allows more control by holding that end). Align it with the correct edge of the screen, leaving the margin you determined previously and watching how the alignment of the sides perpendicular to it will fall. Then peel off the entire backing and smooth down the protector.








, Little mistakes like tiny dust specks should be ignored, as trying to fix them will do more harm than good, the screen protector will soon absorb worse damage exactly as intended, and it will eventually be replaced for a fresh one. If you need to reposition the screen protector, lift an edge carefully with a thin but not sharp implement like a piece of backing material, fingernail, or plastic spoon edge. If a big speck of dust is underneath, try fishing for it with a sticky note, length of cellophane style tape (such as ""Scotch"") or sticky note, taking care not to disturb the adhesive.








, Wipe the air bubbles toward the edges with a smooth implement like a credit card. Don't do this forcefully unless the screen protector has a surface protector to peel off after installation: the air will eventually diffuse out and too much force could scratch the brand-new protector.








, Enjoy your gadget without fear.

Determine whether or not you really need a phone plan / sign a contract.,
Figure out what you want to use your phone for?,
Do your research.,
At the same time, research the handset (phone) you want to get.,
Once you decided on the plan and phone you want, read all the fine print.,
Go to the store where you will be buying your mobile phone.,
Once you arrive, approach one of the salespeople.,
Next, show them the phone you wanted to get with it.,
When you receive the contract, read through it as best you can.,
Before you are set on you way, the salesperson will have to activate the phone for you, usually with a SIM card.,
As they are finishing up on the sale, the salesperson may try to sell you additional plan features or a warranty plan.,
This is also your final opportunity for any questions you might have.,
When you get home, run a check of your phone.,
If you're good to go, enjoy your new phone.",How to Avoid Signing Into an Unwanted Mobile Phone Contract," How often do you expect to use your phone? Several times a day, or just once a week? If you don't see yourself being a heavy phone user, you might want to consider a prepaid phone, which offers cheaper service you pay for as you need it, without being locked in for several years.;
, Are you a talker, texter, or both? Or do you prefer being able to connect to the internet on the go on a smartphone using a mobile data (3G, 4G) plan? It's important to understand what you need and what you don't so you don't end up paying for something you'll never use. This may have an influence on the kind of phone you get, see below.

, Look at all the major mobile phone providers in your country to see what rate plans they have available. Check back often to each to watch for price changes and never pick the first plan you see. Allow plenty of time to compare your options.

, Not all carriers support all phones, and not all plans do either. Features vary immensely, and it is important to consider each of them. For example, what kind of big texter wants to use a phone without a QWERTY keyboard? You may also be tempted to get a fancy new smartphone such as the iPhone; however, these are often not free (as most handsets tied to plans are)and require more expensive plans to run. Plus, make sure you read plenty of customer reviews.

, This may seem daunting, but it's a vital step to make sure you know exactly what you're signing up for -- plus to avoid being swindled later on. When you're confident, print out a copy of the plan outline to bring to the store.

, You may go to either your carrier or an electronics store, it's up to you. Note that the handsets at electronics stores are often cheaper. It also helps to call ahead of time to make sure they have your phone in stock.

, Tell them you're interested in signing a contract for a mobile phone, and show them the plan you want. Let them look it over to verify it.

, They should tell you whether or not you can get this phone (if you did your research properly, this shouldn't be a problem). Let them pick it out and bring it over to the table where the contract signing will occur.

, Salespeople will often rush you through this, however, you have the right to your time. Make sure everything lines up with what you wanted, and you are signing up for just that.

, This often requires an additional fee, so be prepared.

, Try to avoid signing up for these last-minute. However, if you are interested, make sure you understand them fully before buying them.

, make sure you get them answered before you leave, or you may not have the support you need later.

, You might want to try out all the features in the contract to make sure it works; otherwise, you will have to go back to the store and discuss your issue with the salespeople.

, Make sure you pay all your bills as they arrive, as you would with any charge. Feel free to contact your provider if you have any further questions.

Foil/film screen protectors are thinner, but tempered glass and hard plastic protectors last longer, provide better protection and are easier to apply.
, It is recommended to apply the screen protector in a low-dust environment, somewhere indoors. Also, make sure the surface you'll be working on is clean., Dry them with a clean towel. Or wipe them down with some rubbing alcohol., First remove any case you might have on the smartwatch. Add a little screen cleaning solution or rubbing alcohol to a soft, non-scratching cloth (such as a microfiber cloth), and rub your screen with it., Make sure you are holding its sides and you don't touch the back surface.

, Position it over the center of the screen to see how much margin to leave.

, Once the screen protector is aligned, carefully lay the protector down on the screen. If needed, give it a soft press in the center with your fingers and work your way outwards to make sure the protector grips to the screen properly.

",How to Answer the Phone Safely," Caller ID lets you know who is calling. Numbers that don't have an ID on them could be anyone. 1-800 numbers are never safe, as that code is used by scheming retailers everywhere. If you know that it is a number that is your friend's, put a caller ID on it with your friend's name, instead of being curious whenever getting a call from that number.;
, If you answer it, and it's from a gangster threatening you, call the police. Gangsters are never safe.

, If you get a call, and you left the phone at home, you're not going to be there to answer it, and you don't know who called until you get home and listen to the voice message.

, 503 and 541 numbers are from the Oregon area. 702 is from Nevada. Any number you find suspicious should be blocked. You need to also block numbers that allow your children to receive unwanted things that aren't allowed in the house.

Determine your operating system and what printer manufacturers support your operating system (Lexmark printers, for example, don't support Linux).,
First we need to know what kind of printer you want.,
Now you have to know how much money you want to spend.,
Once this is set, we can look for features which are more important and which ones you don't want.,
Now place everything together and choose the right printer for you.,
What do you need the printer to do?,
Consider the Following Factors And Your Needs.,
Deciding If a Color Inkjet Printer is the Best Choice


Ink jets are a good choice if you are looking for high quality color photo output for a reasonable price.,
Deciding if a Laser Printer Is Right For You


If you do a lot of document printing, don't use an inkjet printer.,
After Determining Which Printer You Want, Comparison Shop!",How to Choose a Printer,";
, You have to choose whether you will only need black and white and you want it printed fast. If you do and you work in an office, then choose a laser printer. Do you want a scanner with it? Does it have to have a memory card reader in it and the ability to print pictures straight off your memory cards?

, You must not go over this budget. Make the amount realistic for what you want.
, Modern printers have wireless functionality which may be very useful to you. Some users might need PictBridge.

, You can check online for cheaper printers. Browse to eBay for second hand printers. Remember to choose your brand. You might want HP for functions or Epson for picture quality.

, This is probably the most important question to answer. If you just need to occasionally print out documents such as letters, copies of Web pages from the Internet or simple spreadsheets, a low-end inkjet or laser printer is fine. If you need to do presentations or high quality photographs, you want a photo printer. If you print over 100 pages on a daily basis and don't need color, you may want to look at the faster laser printers. And, of course, if you are starting a home business and you need a combination of scanner, printer, copier, and fax machine, a multifunction printer is best.

,


Resolution - the number of dots a printer prints in a square inch (over 1440 dpi is good). Choose a higher end model with a higher resolution if you will be printing lots of presentation-quality text, graphics and photos.
Operating Cost - Calculate the cost of replacement ink cartridges and paper, because printer users must continually purchase more ink cartridges and toner when the old ones run out or dry up. Be aware that the cost of paper, toner and ink can amount to more than the original cost of the printer within a year or so.
Speed - the volume of printout (pages per minute) is essential if you are printing large numbers of documents in black and white
Size of the printout - will you be printing on oversized or non-standard paper, heavy cardstock, blueprints, transparencies, etc? Then choose a printer whose paper path is no sharper than 90 degrees to allow printing on various types of media without jamming.
Post-Script Fonts - most inkjet printers are not PostScript-compatible. If you need to print PostScript graphics or fonts, consider a laser printer.
Photo Quality - Specialty color printers that have photo lab quality are essential if you are looking for a printer that can print high-resolution images on photo paper.
Digital camera cards and Memory Sticks - does the printer need to have built-in slots for these de vices?
Network enabled - will you be connecting the new printer to a home or office network?
Image processing - Processing images takes a lot of power, so printers often have as much computing horsepower and memory as a PC. Some printers form the complete image in memory prior to printing it, which allows them to handle large files quickly.
Ease of use - how easy is the printer setup process?
Compatibility - The newer printers are all USB-compatible, which means they will work for Windows 98/2000/XP, and with Mac System 8.1 or higher.
Warranty - be sure to purchase a printer that includes a manufacturer's and/or store warranty (at least 90 days).

, Prices start at less than $40, with only a few business-level ink jets costing more than $700-the starting point for color lasers. And ink jets that handle tabloid-size paper start at less than $500, which is thousands less than tabloid-size lasers cost.
First, you'll need to decide on the type of machine you want: a standard ink jet for reasonable photos and a low purchase price, or a photo ink jet for superior photo quality. All of the top models offer 4800-by-1200-dpi resolution, but they vary quite a bit in terms of printing speed.
Specialized photo printers may not work as well on general tasks such as word processing. Even if they do, their per-page costs may be higher and their operation slower. The cost of the printer isn't the only consideration. Color ink cartridges can be expensive, offsetting the low cost of the printer. Special coated photo papers also add to the cost of color printing.
Choose an inkjet printer based on the cost of replacement ink cartridges, and not on the cost of the printer. Over time ink and paper costs can exceed the cost of the printer several times over. Avoid single-cartridge printers which only come with a color cartridge that can't print true color. It is more cost effective to purchase a color inkjet with multiple color cartridges (CMYK), so they can be replaced individually.

, Use a laser printer. Laser printers cost more to buy but much less to use - they are very cost effective to operate since their toner cartridges are not replaced as often.
With all costs figured in, each document page printed on a typical laser printer costs from 2 cents to 5 cents; on an inkjet, the cost per page can run from 10 cents to 15 cents, depending on the model. (This does not even count the cost of photo printing, which can cost up to a dollar per page on an inkjet when you include the high cost of photo paper and the additional ink that's used in that mode.)

,


Once you've finalized your list of requirements, check out some of the large comparison review sites, such as CNET or PC Magazine or PC World, to get an idea of what printers are currently out there in your price range. Also check the cost of printer ink cartridges, toner and paper for the different models. Finally, read all user reviews and note any comments regarding reliability, ease of use, and any hardware issues or defects.
Once you've identified some potential candidates, go to Best Buy, Staples, CompUSA or any other computer superstore to see the printers in person. If you have a small workspace area, consider the printer's footprint and how it will be connected to your existing system.
When you're ready to buy, consider buying from an online vendor such as Amazon.com in order to get the best possible price.

Think about what you want out of your distro.,
Consider using a tool to help you choose - or take all of these tests, as they all give a different perspective: Zegenie Studios (most thorough, and multilingual), (:^tuxs.org) (simple), or polishlinux.org (moderate).,
Download, burn and use a LiveDistro (i.e.,
If you want community support, look for a distribution with active forums or popular on Distrowatch.,
Optionally look for an errata page or release notes, and check that there's no conflicts with programs you want to run, or with your hardware.,
If you want distros for older hardware two popular ones are Damn Small Linux (hard for new users) and Puppy Linux (which ""runs as root"" generally considered not good practice for security).,
If you want eye candy try a distro with Enlightenment or Compiz (offered by many mainstream distros).,
If you want paid support you can consider Red Hat, Novell SuSE Linux Enterprise or Mandriva.

,
Assume that you'll have to try more than one distro before you find one that works and works the way you want.,
When you install to hard disk, partition the hard disk.,
Keep the old Live CDs, especially for the distro that you install - they can be handy if you have a problem with your hardware, or if you need to reinstall.",How to Choose a Linux Distribution," Are you looking for an easy to use distro, paid support, community support, pre-installed codecs, a fast distro or a distro for older hardware? Do you want a distro with a large community, or do you want to join a smaller group?;

, a Live CD, which can run without installing to your hard disk) to test hardware compatibility such as if you can connect to the internet, display your graphics correctly and hear audio.

, The most popular desktop distros long-term are Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE and Mandriva.

, If this is difficult or confusing, just try on Live CD before installing. Important note: just because a distro worked for you doesn't mean the newer version of that distro will also work. Try it out on Live CD before you install.

, Fluxbox is a window manager used by Damn Small Linux and Xfce is a desktop environment used by Xubuntu.

, Be aware this will slow your computer down (which may be noticeable, depending on your machine and how you use it) and will increase power consumption.

,, It can take a long time to find that perfect distro that ""just works"" for you.

, Make at least two partitions, plus swap. Keeping the operating system separate makes things much easier if you want to try a different distro, as well as when it's time to upgrade to a newer version. Mandriva has a very easy automated partition manager - once you run this, it will be easier to install any distro using the partitions you have already created.

,


If you want to help others set up Linux, the LiveDistros will come in handy - use them to demonstrate and give people choices, and see what works on their systems.
Linux LiveCDs can be especially useful if your computer fails, and you need to rescue your files. Simply boot from the LiveCD, and (if the hard drive is still intact) copy your files to a safe location, such as a flash drive or a network computer.

, This is the line you’ll need to modify in order to boot into single-user mode.


In CentOS and some other distributions, the line may begin with “linux16” instead of just “linux.”

, The line ends with ro, so place the cursor right after that.

, The end of the line should now look like this: ro init=/bin/bash.


Note the space between ro and init=/bin/bash.

, This will tell the system to boot directly to a root-level command prompt.

, This mounts the file system in read-write mode.

, Since booting into single-user mode gives you root access, there’s no need to pass additional parameters to the “passwd” command.

, Note that you won’t see the characters you type on the screen. This is normal.

, When the system confirms you’ve re-entered the same password, you’ll see a message that says “password updated successfully.”

Figure out if the pixel is stuck or dead.,
Send the screen back to the manufacturer (optional).",How to Fix a Stuck Pixel on an LCD Monitor1," A stuck pixel usually shows a color. A dead pixel is solid white (for TN panels) or solid black. Try to determine whether the pixel is merely stuck, or if it's completely dead.;
, If the pixel is dead, your best bet is to cash in on your screen's warranty and send it back to the manufacturer.


If the warranty on the screen has expired, you can attempt the following methods. Be aware, though, that they're meant primarily to remedy stuck pixels.

"
"
Turn on the computer and LCD screen.

,
Display a black image, which will show the stuck pixel very clearly against the background.,
Find a narrow object with a blunt, narrow end.,
Use the rounded end of the object to gently tap the stuck pixel.,
Tap harder.,
Apply pressure instead.,
Check your results.",How to Fix a Stuck Pixel on an LCD Monitor2,", It is very important that you are showing a black image and not just a blank signal, as you need the backlighting of the LCD to be illuminating the back of the panel.

, A Sharpie marker with the cap on, an extremely dull pencil, a plastic stylus, or the end of a makeup brush would all work for this.


Before you proceed further read the warnings at the end of this article. Physically rubbing your monitor might actually make things worse.

, Don't tap hard to start with, just enough to see a quick white glow under the point of contact. If you didn't see a white glow, then you didn't tap hard enough, so use just slightly more pressure this time.

, Increase the pressure on the taps gradually for 5-10 taps until the pixel rights itself.

, If your tapping hasn't yielded any results, grab a damp (not wet) washcloth or paper towel. Fold the fabric so that you don't accidentally tear it, and hold it over the stuck pixel, and apply gentle but consistent pressure with the same object you used for tapping.


Try to apply pressure only to the stuck pixel and not the surrounding area.

, Display a white image (such as an empty text document, or sending your browser to about:blank and going to fullscreen with F11) to verify that you haven't accidentally caused more damage than you fixed. If you fixed the stuck pixel, your whole screen should be white.

"
"
Turn on the computer and the LCD screen.

,
Dampen a washcloth with water that's as hot as possible.,
Put on gloves, or cover your hands with oven mitts.,
Put the hot washcloth in a plastic sandwich bag.,
Hold the plastic bag with the hot washcloth up against the stuck pixel.,
""Massage"" the pixel in slow circles.",How to Fix a Stuck Pixel on an LCD Monitor3,", If you can, heat water on the stove until it's just beginning to show air bubbles at the bottom of the container. Put the washcloth in a colander, and dump the hot water over the washcloth.

, You don't want to burn your fingers in the next steps.

, Make sure the seal is completely closed.

, Hold the plastic bag up to the screen such that the area you're using doesn't have a seam on it, because the seam may break open, and hot water may damage your computer. As much as you can, try to only focus the heat on the stuck pixel.

, Move the bag around the pixel a bit in a massage-like motion. The heat generated will cause the liquid crystal to flow more easily into the areas that were not formerly filled.

"
"
Try running pixel-fixing software (see Sources and Citations).",How to Fix a Stuck Pixel on an LCD Monitor4," Stuck pixels can often be re-energized by rapidly turning them on and off. There are screensavers available for download that will do this to your LCD screen.

"
"
Try a solid state solution like PixelTuneup (see Sources and Citations).,
Turn off the monitor.

,
Plug in and turn on PixelTuneup, then turn on the monitor.

,
Wait 20 minutes.

,
Turn off and unplug PixelTuneup.

,
Stuck pixels and other IR will be gone, and color/contrast will be improved.

",How to Fix a Stuck Pixel on an LCD Monitor5," These devices produce specially tuned video signals that eliminate stuck pixels while enhancing picture quality, color, and contrast. Also works on televisions, including LCD, LED, plasma, or CRT.

Make contact.,
Listen to them without judgment.,
Offer practical help.,
Let your friend deal with their emotions in their own time.,
Offer to be a support buddy.,
Encourage your friend to keep up with the basics.,
Don't take over their life.,
Take care of yourself.,
Continue to check in.",How to Encourage a Friend1," When you find out that someone is going through a crisis, whether it's a divorce or break-up or an illness or the death of a loved one, get in contact with them as soon as possible. People who are in a difficult or crisis situation tend to feel isolated.If the person is across the country or far away, make a phone call, send an email, or text them.
You don't have to mention that you know they're having a difficult time. Just being there for them, asking them how they're doing, offering your support can be a huge boon to someone who's struggling with life.
While you shouldn't just drop in on someone unannounced, it can be a good thing to visit someone in person. This is especially important if they're dealing with an illness that makes it difficult to leave the house.;
, People need to tell their stories in their own time, especially if they're going through a crisis. Of course you're going to have opinions about their situation, but it isn't always necessary to share that advice, especially unsolicited.Focus on your friend, and focus on giving them someone to confide in, so they work through the healing process.
If you have been through a similar situation as your friend, then you should use your past experiences to grant advice.
You can ask if they would like your advice, but don't be surprised if that isn't what they're really after.

, Instead of offering advice, what you can offer is some actual help. This can make a huge difference for someone who is struggling to cope with a difficult situation. Even doing some little things can make a difference.


Help them out with some chores like doing their grocery shopping for them, helping clean their house, take their dog for a walk. These basics tasks are usually the first to fall by the wayside when someone's life is coming apart.

, Emotions involved in difficult life changes (illness, death of a loved one, divorce or break-up) tend to come in waves. One day your friend might be coping okay with the change and the next day they're completely falling apart.


Never say something like ""It seemed like you were doing okay, what happened,"" or ""Haven't you grieved enough?""
Tamp down on your own discomfort in the face of their emotions. Sure, strong emotions especially from someone you care about can be hard to face. Remember though, this isn't about you. This is about your friend and the difficult time they're going through. Make sure they feel comfortable enough to express their feelings around you.

, Make sure that your friend knows that you are here to help them and support them. While it's best to have more than one support buddy for your friend so the burden doesn't fall entirely to you, make a point of being one of those buddies for your friend.


Let your friend know they're not burdening you. Say something like ""Call me anytime you are feeling upset or overwhelmed! I want to help you deal with this difficult situation.""
This is especially important when it comes to breakups or divorces. The support buddy is the person that they call when they want to call their ex.

, When someone is going through a difficult life event, the basic functions of life tend to get forgotten. This why people who are going through an illness or grieving a death and so on tend to forget to eat, stop caring for their physical appearance, and are less likely to leave the house.


Remind them to do things like shower, and exercise. The best way to do this is to offer to go on a walk with them, or to take them out for coffee so they have to put a little effort into their appearance.
To get them to eat, it's good to bring over food so that they don't have to do the cooking and the washing up afterwards. Or you can take them out to eat (or order in if they aren't up to much human interaction).

, While many people have totally good intentions when it comes to helping someone having a tough time, you can overwhelm someone with your help. You can also take away the power from them. Times of divorce or illness, or the death of a loved one can have feelings of powerlessness.


Offer options. Don't just take your friend to dinner, ask them where they want to dine and when they want to dine. Letting them make decisions, even if they're small decisions can go long way towards reclaiming their power.
Don't spend lots of money on them. Taking them to their nails done for cheap is one thing, but spending too much money on them will make them feel like they owe you and will make them feel like they can't care for themselves.

, When there's a crisis in a friend's life it has a tendency to drag up all kinds of emotions in you, as well. This is especially true if you've experienced something similar to what they're going through.


Set boundaries. Even though you want to keep up with your friend as they struggle through their problems, you need to make sure that your life doesn't start to revolve around them.
Know what behaviors and situations trigger you. If you're dealing with a friend who has recently escaped an abusive home, and that's something you've had to deal with, you might need to back off a little.

, People have a tendency to be very solicitous towards someone immediately after their life falls apart, but fall away as time goes on. Make sure you don't do this. Make sure your friend knows that they can call on you if they need to, and that you keep up with how they're doing.

Recognize the symptoms of depression.,
Validate their pain, but don’t stay there.,
Avoid taking their depression personally.,
Don’t underestimate how serious depression can be.,
Offer to help with small things.,
Be a compassionate listener.,
Remember that you aren’t their therapist.,
Encourage your friend to seek professional help.,
Know that depression can come and go.,
Set your own boundaries.",How to Encourage a Friend2," Sometimes people aren't necessarily depressed, they're simply going through a difficult time of life. However, if a friend shows signs of depression, you may need to pay close attention to make sure that it doesn't get worse.Do they exhibit persistent sad, anxious, or empty moods? Do they present feelings of hopelessness or pessimism (nothing will ever get better; life is terrible)?
Do they have lots of feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness? Are they fatigued, have decreased energy? Do they have difficulty concentrating on things, remembering things, or making decisions?
Have you noticed insomnia, or oversleeping? Have they lost or gained significant weight? Are they restless and irritable?
Have they mentioned or talked about thinking about death or suicide? Have they made or talked about making a suicide attempt? This could show by them saying something about how the world world be a better place if they weren't in it.

, Remember that their pain and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness are real. Validate the fact that they feel these negative feelings and then do your best to turn their attention elsewhere.Depressed people may respond to distractions. You don't have to make the distraction super obvious. If you're taking a walk, for example, pointing out the beauty of the light on the water, or the color of the sky can turn the conversation.
Going over the same negative feelings again and again can actually make things worse, because it encourages a depressed person to remain in that negative place.

, When someone is depressed they often have difficulty connecting to anyone on an emotional level, because of what they are going through. Taking it personally will mean that they will have a more difficult time reaching out.


A depressed person might lash out by saying something hurtful or angry towards you. Remember that this is the depression not the friend who is saying those things.
This doesn't mean that you need to take abuse from them. If your friend is becoming abusive, as well as depressed, then they need the help of a therapist. You're probably not going to be able to help them except by assuring them that you'll be there for them when they stop hurting you.

, Depression is often linked to a chemical imbalance in someone's brain. It is much more than simply being sad, or being unhappy. It can feel, to the depressed person, like they're being swallowed by despair or by emptiness.


Never do things like tell someone to “get over it” or that they could be happy if they’d only “do yoga” “lose weight” “get out more” etc. This will simply make them not trust you and will make them feel worse and guilty about what they're going through.

, Depression can make it incredibly difficult to do anything, including clean the house, wash dishes, go to work. Doing little things to lighten their burden can make a huge difference.


People who are dealing with depression spend most of their energy struggling against and being swallowed up by their mental disorder. That doesn't leave much energy for doing household tasks.
Occasionally bring by a nice cooked dinner, or offer to help them clean their house. Ask if you can take their dog for a walk with them.

, Depression is not something that you can simply fix. Offering a listening ear to someone can be more helpful than giving lots of advice or opinions about what they're going through.Some ways to help start the conversation might be: ""I have been feeling concerned about you lately"" or "" I wanted to check in with you because you have seemed pretty down lately.""
If they're having difficulty with expressing their feelings or opening up you can ask some questions to help: "" Did something happen that made you start feeling this way?"" or ""When did you begin feeling like this?""
Some good things to say: ""You are not alone in this. I'm here for you,"" and ""I care about you and I want to help you through this difficult time,"" and ""You are so important to me. Your life is so important to me.""

, Even if you are a trained therapist you shouldn't be practicing on a friend, especially if it's outside of your working hours. Being there for someone going through depression and listening to them does not mean that you get to take responsibility for their mental state.


If your friend is consistently calling you in the middle of the night when you need your sleep, or talks about committing suicide, or seems to be stuck in the same horrible place for months or years, they need to talk to a therapist rather than you.

, While you can offer encouragement and support for a friend, you can't give them the professional help they need, and you can't make the depression go away through sheer force of will. This can be a difficult conversation to have, but if you care about your friend, it's important to have.


Ask them if they've ever considered or gone to a professional for help.
Recommend helping resources, or if you know of a good professional, recommend them.

, Depression isn't something that comes once and then is gone once you've taken a little medication (this isn't the chicken pox). It can be a lifelong struggle even if your friend finds the right medication.


Don’t give up on them. Depression can be incredibly lonely and isolating and it can make someone feel like they're crazy. Having people who support them can make all the difference.

, Your friend is important to you, of course, and you want to do everything in your power to encourage their healing. You can't lose sight of yourself while you're offering your support.


Make sure that you’re taking care of yourself. Take breaks from the depressed person. Spend time with people who aren't depressed and don't need your support.
Remember, that if you aren't getting (or haven't had) a reciprocal relationship with this friend then the relationship could end up abusive and one-sided. Don't get sucked into that type of situation.

Don’t tell them they need to lose weight.,
Become an active part of their weight-loss program.,
Focus on what they’re doing right.,
Celebrate achievements along the way.,
Care about the person, not the diet.,
Avoid going overboard with helpfulness.",How to Encourage a Friend3," You are not the boss of anyone but yourself and telling a friend they need to lose weight is rude and can lose you their friendship. People are going to make their own decisions and at a certain point they need to be allowed to decide what they need for themselves.This is true even if their weight has become a health problem. Chances are they recognize that it's a problem and if they want to do something about it, they will.

, When a friend is committed to losing weight they will need the support from their friends. If they're willing to share with you, find out as much as you can about the diet and exercise regime they're undergoing.Commit to exercising with them. Tell them that you'll bike to work with them, or go for a run in the evenings every day. Go to the gym with them and offer encouragement.
Eat the dishes that they prepare, or some of their diet food with them so that they don't feel so isolated in their food choices.

, It isn't your job to monitor how they're doing. Unless they specifically ask you to do this, don’t focus on how they’re doing, what they’re eating, when the screw up, and so on. You aren't the diet police. You're here to support and encourage them, not take them to task.


Cheer on the little victories and the things they accomplish.
Avoid criticizing when they fail to do something right. If they eat the wrong foods or go a little slack on their exercising, that isn't your job to tell them to shape up.

, When they've lost some weight, or when they've managed to step up their exercise program, make sure you celebrate that. Make sure that these celebrations don't focus on and aren't centered around food.


Take them out to a movie, or buy them a pedicure, or that lovely new book they've been craving.

, When you talk to them, don't focus on the diet, on what they've accomplished or where they've fallen short. Instead, ask how they've been doing (them as a person), how their dog is doing, how their schooling is going, and what the new changes are at the job.


Remember: whether they succeed or fail with losing weight, this is your friend. Their life shouldn't have to revolve around weight-loss and how much they weigh.

, It's tempting to show someone how much you're there for them by giving them lots of ""helpful"" ideas for how to do things better, or giving them exercise plans and weight-loss books. Don't do this.


It’s better to ask what they need, and simply be there for them, than to push in where you’re not wanted.

Identify the friends who bring negativity to your life.,
Take stock in the friends who are consistently there for you.,
Reduce contact with insincere friends.,
Maintain your usual social circles but reduce overall interaction with the friend.,
Have prepared what you'll do or say if the insincere friend confronts you.,
Get on with your life.",How to Ditch Insincere Friends," If you have friends who eye roll or whisper behind your back, you may want to put them on the “naughty” list. Personalities to watch out for include:


Judgmental: this friend tries to make you think that he knows better than you and/or attempts to correct you at every turn.
Manipulative: he doesn’t have your best interest at heart, but rather his own. This friend will dig into your weak spots and use them against you for his gain.
Narcissistic: it’s all about this friend 24/7. This friend is completely focused on his needs and is not concerned about you or your feelings.
Noncommittal: this friend never makes you a priority and when you really need a friend, he won’t be there to support you.;
, In order to truly determine which friends are insincere (or negative), first think about the friends whom you have no doubts about; the ones who are always there for you through thick and thin. Qualities to compare with your friends who are on the chopping block include:


Instances where you needed a friend. Think about the last time you had a crisis or even wanted to share a bit of wonderful news. How did your true friend react and how did the other friend respond?
How you share a conversation. During a conversation with a true friend, it's all about give and take. You share something from your day or life and then ask about your friend’s day or life, much like a game of tennis. Do you have conversations like this with your potentially insincere friend or is it one-sided, where your friend only wants to talk about himself and doesn’t ask about you?
Does your friend try to fix your problems or tell you what to do in order to get you to stop talking? A good friend will often just listen and commiserate with you when you are having a tough day or wrestling with difficult issues. If you don’t ask for advice, does your friend try to rush in and tell you what to do (or what you are doing wrong) so the conversation can be shifted back to them?
Spending time with your friend. Aside from long-distance friendships, do you spend quality time with your friend when it is mutually convenient for both of you, or only the times when your friend can squeeze you into his schedule?

, Once you’ve confirmed that certain friends aren’t enhancing and enriching your life, cut the cord. You don’t have to get into a fight and yell and scream at the person, but you can bow out of the relationship gracefully. In some cases, the other “friend” may not even realize that you left the relationship because they had so little invested in it! (In other words, don't get too worried about their reaction.)


Stop calling the friend. Especially if you're the one who always initiates the calls, stop dialing the phone to have a conversation with him.
Don't comment on social media updates or posts. Don’t “unfriend” your friend, but don’t track and comment on photos or posts.
Keep communication short and to the point. If you have to email or call the insincere friend for any reason, be polite but keep the conversation or email topical. A simple “how are you?” is fine, but stay focused on the task at hand and don't delve any further into the other person’s life.

, Don’t cut yourself out of a mutual circle of friends in order to get away from this person, but in a social situation, migrate towards the folks who are your true friends and let the insincere friend float from person to person.


It may help to tell trusted friends why you're not hanging out with this person anymore, so they can understand your reasoning behind the cessation.

, In some cases, the insincere friend will wake up and realize that you aren’t calling or hanging out with him anymore. If you're going to ditch him for good, have a plan or a speech prepared in the event he confronts you and wants to know why you haven’t called. Some reasons you could use are:


“I’ve been busy.” The universal language for “I’m blowing you off so I’m going to say I’m busy” works because no one is going to question your schedule. Of course, saying that you're too busy never gets to the root of the problem, but if you're non-confrontational, this method may do the trick. Moreover, if this friend really did care, they'd try harder but since it's unlikely that they do, this brush-off will soon work.
“I’m not feeling the love.” Go for the gusto if you are prepared for a little fire. If you plan to tell your friend that you feel the relationship isn’t working for you, take responsibility for your feelings and avoid saying, “you make me feel....” If you own it, there is little the other person can do to accuse you of being wrong. If you plan to have this conversation, be ready to allow the other person to express how he feels. Don’t name-call or make accusations. The point of “breaking up” with the friend is to end the relationship, not to create more drama.
Complete avoidance. Another way you can deal (or not deal) with a potential confrontation is to completely hide from the other person. The “head in the sand” method may get tricky, especially if you share mutual friends or go to the same restaurants, bars or other retail establishments. Check caller I.D. before answering the phone (if it's “the friend,” let it go directly to voicemail) and don’t reply to emails, tweets or Facebook inquires. Hopefully after a few weeks, your ex-friend will get the hint and not pursue your friendship.

, Your other friends are still there and you're a strong person for putting aside this energy-sapping insincere former friend. Don't dwell on it; the sooner that you learn to distance yourself from insincere people while remaining civil, the sooner you'll be better prepared for dealing with such people in all walks of life. View this crazy experience as a lesson learned.

, If your connection seems to drop off during peak hours or partway through downloads, Comcast may be throttling your bandwidth.

, Compare the speeds you got from the test to the speed level which you're paying for. You may have to call Comcast to find this out. You can also ask about possible throttling, if you discovered this during the previous step.


If you are getting the speed you're paying for but find that this is too slow, you may want to upgrade.

, Are several people in your house all using the internet at once? Is anyone downloading something big, like a movie or playing an online game? This can significantly slow your internet.

, Much like the above, if your neighbors are putting pressure on your bandwidth by using your internet, everyone will have slower internet.

, Some areas will simply have very slow internet. If you live in a major city, or a newer city, this should not be a problem. However, if you live in a rural area or an area which has not seen recent infrastructure updating, Comcast's connection equipment may simply be dated. Call Comcast for more information.


Your location within a given room can make a difference too. Try moving next to the router. If your connection improves, you will know that your location was part of the problem.

, An overworked processor will bog down even the fastest internet connection.

, First, run a scan for viruses and other malware. A virus will significantly slow your connection.Then, make sure that the software itself isn't slowing the system too much. Many common anti-virus programs can slow your system down significantly.


Try switching to a faster anti-virus program, like Avast!.

, Some browsers are significantly faster than others. If you think the browser might be the issue, consider switching to Chrome, since this is usually the fastest browser (that is compatible with most sites).

, Close programs which communicate with the internet (which are not currently in use). Examples of such programs include Skype and updating programs.

, The DNS (or Domain Name System) Server is sort of like the phonebook for the internet. Your computer will choose one to use automatically, but using a bad one can be like the difference between using a 20lb paper phonebook and using Google. If nothing else works, consider manually finding a better DNS server. This can improve your internet speed by a significant amount.

, These are programs which find the best DNS Server for you to use. A good, reliable, reputable one is Google's ""namebench"" program.

, It is usually the one which is geographically closest.

, Change your computers settings to default to the recommended DNS Server. This is done differently depending on your operating system.


On a PC, from the Control Panel click Network and Internet →Network and Sharing Center → Manage Network Connections. Right click the connection that you want to change and then click Properties. Click Networking → This connection uses the following items → Properties and then specify a DNS address in the specified area.
On a Mac, click System Preferences→ Network→ select your connection → Advanced → DNS and then add the new DNS server.

, If you have a big home, place it in a central location if possible. Don’t put it close to your modem or any other wireless devices, as this can cause line interference. (For example, a 2.4-ghz router may conflict with a 2.4-ghz phone.) If necessary, buy a longer cable to allow as much distance as possible between your modem and router.

, Type 192.168.1.1 in your internet address bar to connect to the router and fill in your user name and password. Once you have access, go to the Settings and make sure that the specifications listed here the ones recommended by Comcast. You can find these either in the information packet that you got when you first set up your internet or online.


If you haven’t ever set up a username and password, use the default settings for your router, which can be found in the manual or searched online. The default username is often admin and the default password is often either password or left blank.
To be safe, jot down your router’s current settings before modifying them. This will prevent you from making any major mishaps.

, If the above suggestions fail, the problem may be that your router isn’t fast enough to accommodate the connection speed you’re paying for. Compare the mbps (megabytes per second) on any new candidates to the mbps on your old one to see what your options are. If you do online gaming or a lot of big downloads, you may even want a gigabyte router.


Make sure the router is Comcast approved. Some may not function well with Comcast equipment.
Try to get a wireless G or N router with WPA or WPA2 support, which provide better encryption protection than WEP. (If you have an older computer or laptop, make sure it supports this.)

Plug in an ethernet cable.",How to Connect Two Computers1," To connect two computers that don't have access to a shared network, you can use an Ethernet cable to make a direct connection between the two computer's Ethernet ports.


Some computers require a special cable called ""crossover cable."" This is a specialized cable that is wired in reverse. Ethernet ports have both inputs and outputs, and the crossover cable is switched so that the output from one computer connects to the input of the other.
Many current computers do not need a crossover cable: they use Auto-Medium Dependent Interface Crossover (Auto-MDIX), and will automatically configure the Ethernet port.
Most Macintosh computers built recently do not need a crossover cable.
If you're not sure, check your documentation to see what your system needs. If that's not available, just use a crossover cable: an auto-sensing Ethernet port will work with a crossover cable just as well as with a standard cable.
A crossover cable is also known as twisted pair ethernet cable.;

Consider these additional options for increasing your browser's security.,
Click on 'Apply' or a similar button.",How to Make Your Wireless Network Invisible," Every wireless network has an SSID (Service Set Identifier). The SSID is a sequence of characters, with a max of 32 characters, which uniquely marks your wireless network. Think of it like your network's name. By default, most systems will broadcast this SSID to make it easier for you to find and use. However, this also lets people with malevolent intentions get access to your network.


The SSID is what you will actually be hiding when the process is complete.
If you have ever accessed a wireless network at a restaurant or a coffee shop, you have used an SSID. At many restaurants or coffee shops, the SSID will be the name of the place.;
, If you have never logged in to your router before, you will first need to figure our your router's IP address. The default address for almost all systems is ""192.168.1.1."" In order to login to your router, enter this address into your internet browser when you are connected to your network.


If the above address does not take you to a page which prompts you to enter login credentials, consult your router's manual. You can also try looking at the label on your router which lists information like network key, SSID, and encryption key. This label is usually found on the bottom of most routers.
You can also check this page for common default IP addresses. One of these will likely take you to your router login page when entered into your browser's address bar. http://www.techspot.com/guides/287-default-router-ip-addresses/


, If you entered the right IP address, you will be prompted to log in with a username and password. Hopefully you have set this to be something other than the default. If not though, consult your router's manual for the default username and login information.


If you have never customized the login information, it is likely that the username will be ""admin"" and the password will be blank. Be sure to change this at some point to increase your network's security.

, This will be the section of the control panel which will let you modify certain default settings for your network.


Click on the option will let you configure the network. This button may say ""Configure"" or ""Modify"" or something similar

, The option may say ""Hide SSID."" Making this change will stop your browser from automatically broadcasting its name to anybody with a WiFi capable device. Know, however, that anybody who you want to connect to your network will now have to enter in the network's name into their device.

, If you are trying to make your network invisible, you are likely worried about people accessing your network. Hiding your network's SSID will not really help that much. Hackers can still intercept the radio waves constantly being sent out from your router and access your network. Make these changes in the same part of the control panel in which you hid your SSID:


Enable MAC filtering. MAC (Media Access Control) addresses are identifiers which all WiFi capable devices carry. If you enable MAC filtering, you will have to manually enter in what addresses have access to your wireless network. In order to find out what your device's MAC address is, consult our article about how to find your MAC address.
Enable WPA2 encryption. WPA2 encryption is one of the best ways to increase your network's security. Navigate to the security section of your network's control panel. Select WPA2 from any dropdown menu or option list. You will be prompted to enter in a PSK (Pre-shared key). This will be the key that any device that connects to your network will have to enter in before they can access the network. Keep it in a safe place and try to make it as long as possible.

Note that older routers (pre-2007) will not have WPA2 capabilities.

Select the transmission channel.,
Change other settings.",How to Jam a Network1," Using a jamming device is illegal in many countries, including the United States.If it is legal in your area, all you need to do is buy one and turn it on close to the source of the network. However, in most areas, you will need to resort to the more complex, legal methods below. Alternatively skip to the section below instead for legal ways to prevent neighbors from using your signal, and reduce nearby signals' effect on your own network.


Jamming can interfere with emergency radio communications and other vital communications. Even if it is legal in your area, it's best not to use a jamming device in a densely populated area.
Don't assume jamming devices are legal just because someone in your area is selling them. These merchants may be breaking the law.;
, Assuming jamming devices are illegal in your area, you'll need to use a more targeted method. Each wireless device sends signals on one or more frequencies. To drown this signal out, you'll need to operate on the same one. Look up the name of the device you're trying to jam, or use this guide to WiFi frequencies:WiFi routers that follow the 802.11b or 802.11g standards operate at a frequency of 2.4GHz. This is a safe bet if you can't identify the router.
WiFi routers with the 802.11a standard operate at 5GHz.
The 802.11n standard can operate at either 2.4 or 5GHz. You may need to jam both frequencies. Some modern routers with this standard can alter their frequency automatically, which will make it much harder to jam.If you don't know the type of router being used, try downloading a program or app for viewing nearby wireless networks. Some of these will identify the frequency and channel being used, but the free versions usually do not.

, You can block a 2.4GHz wireless signal by operating a microwave, an older cordless phone, a Bluetooth advice, and many other wireless devices. As long as it's labeled 2.4GHz, it should interfere with a nearby 2.4GHz network. The effect can vary between a slight slowdown and a complete shutoff, but unfortunately there's no way to tell in advance which it will be.


The device must be broadcasting a signal. For instance, play music into a phone, or tape down the number buttons so they're being pressed continually.
Do not run a microwave with nothing inside.
To improve the jamming ability of a 2.4GHz cordless phone, expose the circuitry, then attach the antenna leads to a wire taped to a CD.This may violate laws where jamming is illegal.

, If your WiFi router operates on the same frequency, you can fine tune its settings to cause intentional interference. Start by accessing your router's settings. To do this, open an internet browser and enter the address of your router in the URL bar. Try the following common options, until you see a page of router options:


http://192.168.0.1
http://192.168.1.1
http://192.168.2.1
http://192.168.11.1
If none of these work, search for your router model's IP address online, or try to find it listed in the Network or WiFi settings of your computer or mobile device.You may need to log in before you can view the settings. Refer to your router manual if you do not know the password.

, A router does not use its entire range of possible frequencies at once. Instead, the range is divided into 14 channels in the 2.4GHz range, and 23 channels in the 5GHz range.Depending on your router, you may not have access to all these channels, or you may have limited ability to change this setting. Do your best to use as many channels as possible. If you can only use one or two channels at a time, switch between each channel and test whether the nearby network's signal strength has dropped.


At 2.4GHz, most routers operate on the 1, 6, and 11 channels. Use these channels as well to interfere with the other network.
Nearby channels overlap with each other, causing some interference. Using channels 3, 7, and 11 will slow down almost any nearby WiFi network, at least a little.
At 5GHz, there are many more channels available.

, There's no standard settings menu for all routers. You may not have access to all these settings, or your router may use different names. Look at your router's documentation for more information. If you do see any of the following settings, make these changes:Set ""Channel Width"" or ""Bandwidth"" to the largest possible range.
Disable automatic channel selection.
Boost power output to maximum.

"
"
Position physical barriers.,
Reduce your router's power level.,
Install a directional antenna.,
Alter your router channels.,
Improve WiFi security.",How to Jam a Network2," Walls and other objects will significantly reduce the range and strength of a WiFi signal. Metal objects, containers of water, and other conductive objects have an especially strong effect. Positioning these in front of thin walls and windows can make it harder for a neighbor to steal your signal. This can also block incoming signals that interfere with your own device.


5Ghz WiFi signals are are particularly bad at penetrating objects.

, Most high-quality WiFi routers have an adjustable power level setting. Turn this down to reduce the strength of the signal. You may need to experiment to find a setting that keeps your WiFi at a suitable strength throughout your home.


If your kids are sneaking online when they're supposed to be sleeping, consider turning the power level down to minimum each night. Increase it again in the morning.

, Replace your router's antenna with a directional antenna if you only need to broadcast the signal to one spot, such as your desktop computer or living room. This will significantly weaken the signal everywhere the antenna isn't pointing.


To save some money, make your current antenna ""directional"" by placing a sheet of aluminum foil in any direction you don't want the signal to travel.

, Access your router settings through an internet browser, then change the channel setting to avoid interference with other networks. Test channels 1, 6, and 11, testing the WiFi signal strength around your home at each setting. One of these will usually provide a fast, low-interference network.


If your router allows access to channels 12 or higher, test the highest channel.
Many modern routers have the option to automatically detect low-interference channels and switch between them. Enable this option if available.
Each router manufacturer arranges its own settings. If you can't find a channel option, refer to the router manual for a guide.

, Change your router password if you suspect a neighbor is connecting to your network. This option is available in your router settings, through your browser.

, This will open your computer's Task Manager, from which you can alter or end PC processes., This is near the top of your Task Manager window; doing so will bring up a list of the programs that boot up when you start your PC., Note that ""disabling"" a process will not disable it from running at all; rather, it will prevent the program from starting up automatically., This is in the bottom right corner of your Task Manager window.

You can also right-click a process and then click ""Disable"" in the context menu.

, Some common high memory-usage culprits include Skype, Steam, and most antivirus apps.

If you're unsure of which programs to disable, look at the ""Startup impact"" column on the right side of the Task Manager window; generally speaking, you should disable any ""High""- or ""Medium""-rated programs.

, To get the most out of this process, you'll also need to clear out the Hidden Icons menu., This is the upward-facing arrow on the right side of your taskbar and to the left of your clock. Click or tap it to open your menu., Often, you'll find background processes running here (e.g., Dropbox or Google Drive). Killing these processes will free up random access memory (RAM) which will in turn increase your computer's processing speed. You can end these processes from within this menu., For example, if you aren't using your computer's cloud storage app, you should consider ending this process., This will usually prompt you to confirm your decision by clicking ""Exit (App Name)"".

When your hard drive has been around for awhile, its subfolders and their respective contents get scattered around your hard drive (in other words, your drives ""fragment""). Running the Disk Defragment tool will consolidate your files and these fragments, which will increase the speed at which your hard drive can access information.

Do not run the Disk Defragment program if your computer has a solid-state drive installed. SSDs are made to resist fragmentation, so running a defrag on them can seriously damage your files.

, It should be labeled something like ""OS:C""., This will begin to defragment your drive. Depending on how long it has been since your last defrag, this can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours., Hard drives recall the first 50 percent of storage placed on them much quicker than they do the bottom 50 percent; for example, if you have a 500 gigabyte hard drive, the first 250 gigabytes of information you put on your hard drive will be quicker to access. You'll notice significantly less slow-down on your PC if you limit your file storage to half of that of your hard drive's capacity. The best way to do this is by increasing your hard drive capacity with an external flash drive or hard drive.

You can also move your files to any one of several free cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox).

, You can view all of your PC's programs and apps from inside of the Start menu; simply scroll down to view all of them.

You will also see folders here; they often contain more apps, so click them to view their contents.

, Generally speaking, apps like ""News"" or a radio app that ship with your OS are completely unnecessary (and easily replaced with better programs or online plugins).

If an app is crucial to your computer's functionality, you won't be able to delete it; that being said, most mandatory apps take up minimal processing power.

, This will prompt a context menu., This will immediately uninstall your app or program, negating the need to visit the ""Programs and Features"" folder.

You may have to click ""More"" at the bottom of the context menu to access the ""Uninstall"" option.

, Most Windows computers ship with a large quantity of stock apps, plugins, programs, and free trials; these should all be candidates for deletion., For every stock installed app, there is at least one viable alternative:

Replace Microsoft Edge with Chrome or Firefox. Both of these browsers are faster, easier-to-use alternatives to Edge.
Replace ""Groove"" with iTunes. Again, you can't delete Groove, but it takes much more processing power to run Groove than it does to run iTunes.
Replace your default video player with VLC. VLC can play almost any video format and has a simpler, cleaner interface than default Microsoft video players, which translates to quicker processing speed.

Save the file.",How to Write a Batch File," Notepad allows you to create code as a text file and then save it when you're done as a batch file. You can open Notepad by clicking Start → Programs → Accessories → Notepad. You can also enter notepad into the Run box.
, Batch files run a series of DOS commands, so the commands that you can use are similar to DOS commands. Some of the more important ones include:


ECHO - Displays text on the screen
@ECHO OFF - Hides the text that is normally output
START - Run a file with it's default application
REM - Inserts a comment line in the program
MKDIR/RMDIR - Create and remove directories
DEL - Deletes a file or files
COPY - Copy a file or files
XCOPY - Allows you to copy files with extra options
FOR/IN/DO - This command lets you specify files.
TITLE - Edit the title of the window. , One of the easiest ways to learn how to create batch files is to focus on doing basic tasks first. For example, you can use a batch file to quickly create multiple directories:MKDIR c:\example1
MKDIR c:\example2




, Once you have entered your code, you can save the file using the Batch filetype. Click File → Save As.


Click the ""Save as type"" dropdown menu.






Select ""All files"".






Enter a name for the program followed by .bat or .cmd.






Make sure the encoding is ANSI and save the file

, Batch files are great for running multiple commands, especially if you configure it to be able to run multiple times. With the XCOPY command, you can make a batch file that copies files from select folders to a backup folder, only overwriting files that have been updated since the last copy:





@ECHO OFF 
XCOPY c:\original c:\backupfolder /m /e /y





This copies over files from the folder ""original"" to the folder ""backupfolder"". You can replace these with the paths to the folders you want. /m specifies that only updated files will be copied, /e specifies that all subdirectories in the listed directory will be copied, and /y keeps the confirmation message appearing every time a file is overwritten.

, Once you have entered your code, you can save the file using the Batch filetype. Click File → Save As.


Click the ""Save as type"" dropdown menu.
Select ""All files"".
Enter a name for the program followed by .bat or .cmd.

, While simply copying the files from one folder to another is nice, what if you want to do a little sorting at the same time? That's where the FOR/IN/DO command comes in. You can use that command to tell a file where to go depending on the extension:





@ECHO OFF 
cd c:\source
REM This is the location of the files that you want to sort
FOR %%f IN (*.doc *.txt) DO XCOPY c:\source\""%%f"" c:\text /m /y
REM This moves any files with a .doc or 
REM .txt extension from c:\source to c:\text
REM %%f is a variable

Skip the DVD altogether.",How to Play DVDs on Your Windows PC for Free," It may seem obvious, but make sure you have a DVD drive, not just a CD drive. A CD drive will not play DVD media. Look for the DVD symbol on the front of the drive.


If you don't have a DVD drive, don't despair. Your CD drive can usually be replaced with a DVD drive.;
, Sometimes, the best things in life are free—–and right in front of you! See if you have Windows Media Player.
Go to Start > Search and type Windows Media Player. If you have it, you can play your DVD on Windows Media player.






If you don’t have Windows Media Player, or yours is out of date, upgrade to the latest version. Go to the help menu to find a link to the latest upgrade, which is currently version 12.

, If Windows Media Player is unable to read the DVD, you can download other media players, or you may simply need to install an MPEG 2 codec.
You can download the latest codec installation package from Microsoft here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=507.






You can check for all the codecs you could ever need at: http://www.free-codecs.com/download/ffdshow.htm codecs.com.






You can also download and install RealPlayer, GOM Player (which will hunt down codecs for you whenever it can’t play something), BSPlayer, UMPlayer, and VLC. See ""Tips"" below for more information on these and other media players.







, If all else fails, you can always add an external USB DVD drive to your system.


An external drive has many advantages, including:

Plug into any computer
Can be ""retired"" when the technology becomes obsolete
Is easier to connect than a built-in drive
Reduces the weight of your laptop if you remove the old drive and replace it with a cap to cover the hole.



, For whatever reason, your computer or your budget is just not ready for a DVD player. Don't despair, there is always online!
Sign up for Netflix. For a few dollars a month, you have access to hundreds of movies and TV shows.






Download from iTunes. You can download or rent movies from iTunes, as well as the usual songs and CDs.

This method does not have a 100% success rate, and is not too difficult to bypass. It's a quick way to block a website on your personal computer, for productivity reasons. While not recommended as the only way to block other users' access, you can try it alongside another method for greater effect.

, If you make a mistake while editing the hosts file, you could block all access to the internet. Creating a backup copy allows you to return to the original version if this happens. This is as simple as a single command:In Terminal, type sudo /bin/cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts-original exactly as it appears.
Press Enter on your keyboard to execute the command.

, Terminal should prompt you for your password. Type it in and press Enter. The cursor will not move from its position as you type your password.

This command will open your Mac's hosts file in TextEdit mode within Terminal.Alternatively, you can edit the hosts file in the main Terminal window using the command sudo nano -e /etc/hosts.

, Your hosts file should already have several IP addresses linked to ""localhosts."" Never edit or delete this text, or your web browsers may stop working. Place your cursor on a new line at the bottom of the document.

A few users have reported a bug where adding new text to the hosts file only works if you add them above the existing text., This is the local IP address. If a web browser is directed to this address, it will fail to reach the web page.

, Do not include ""http://."" For example, if you want to block access to Facebook, the line should read ""127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com.""


The hosts file only checks for the exact URL you enter. For example, ""google.com"" will only block the Google home page. You will still be able to access google.com/maps, google.com/mail, and so on.
Do not copy-paste from another document. This can introduce invisible characters that prevent the text from working.

, Press Enter and begin a new line with 127.0.0.1. Follow it with another URL you want to block. You may block any number of websites, but you must start each new line with 127.0.0.1.


In theory you can include multiple URLs on one line (entering the IP address only once), up to a maximum of 255 characters.However, this may not work on all versions of Mac OS X., Close or quit the TextEdit dialog box when you are done, then confirm that you want to save the TextEdit file when prompted. (In some cases the file may save automatically.)


If editing in the main Terminal window, press ctrl+O to save, then ctrl+X to close the file.

, Type the command dscacheutil -flushcache into Terminal and press Enter. This will clear the cache so your browser is sure to check the updated hosts file immediately. The websites you listed should now be blocked on all browsers.


You may restart your computer instead to get the same effect. In many cases, the sites will be blocked even without this step.

, If you can still access one of the websites, your browser may be accessing a different subdomain, accessing the site via IPv6, or bypassing your hosts file for that site. You can solve the first two problems by adding more lines to your hosts file:


127.0.0.1 (URL) without the ""www""
127.0.0.1 m.(URL) will usually block the mobile version of the site
127.0.0.1 login.(URL) or apps.(URL) are a couple common variations of home pages. Visit the website and check your address bar for the exact variation.
fe80::1%lo0 (URL) blocks IPv6 access to the site. Most sites do not automatically connect you via IPv6, but Facebook is a notable exception.
If none of these variations work, there is probably no hosts file workaround. Try one of the other block methods on this page.

, Open your hosts file again and delete the entry for the URL you would like to unblock. Save, quit, and flush the cache as described above to push through the change.


To undo all changes and restore from your backup, enter sudo nano /etc/hosts-original in Terminal. Press ctrl+O, delete the ""-original"" in the name, and confirm the save.

Install a browser extension.,
Adjust your router settings.",How to Block and Unblock Internet Sites (On a Mac)3," Chrome, Firefox, and most other modern browsers allow you to install user-made extensions (or ""add-ons"") to adjust browser behavior. Search your browser's extension store for ""block websites,"" ""filter websites,"" or ""productivity"" to find apps that block websites. Install the app, restart your browser, then open the app settings and add the sites you would like to block.


Be careful of apps with low ratings, or too few reviews to judge accurately. Untrustworthy extensions may install malware to your computer.
This will only block websites on that browser.

, Blocking sites on your router will prevent any device using the wireless network from accessing those sites. Here's how to set this up:


Go to System Preferences → Network → WiFi → Advanced → TCP/IP tab.
Copy the IP address listed after ""Router"" and paste it into your browser's address bar. This should take you to your router settings.
Enter the username and password to log in to your router. If you have never set these, look up the default password for that router model. (User ""admin"" and password ""password"" are common defaults.)
Browse the router settings for site blocking options. Each router brand has a different set of options, but most allow you to block sites in an ""Access"" or ""Content"" menu.

If you're trying to securely erase the data on a drive before disposing of it, see the Securely Formatting a Drive section of this article instead.;
, You'll be using your Windows installation disc to format your drive. This is the easiest way to format the primary drive, as you cannot do this from within Windows itself. You don't need to use your own installation disc, as you won't actually be entering a product key (unless you proceed with reinstalling Windows). If you can't find your installation disc, you may still have options depending on your version of Windows:


Windows 7 - You can download an ISO file for Windows 7 be entering your product key here. You'll then be transferring this ISO file to a blank DVD or USB drive using the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool which you can download here.
Windows 8 - You can download the Windows 8 Media Creation tool from Microsoft here. This program will download and create Windows installation media on either a blank DVD or USB drive (4GB or larger). Run the tool and follow the prompts to create the installation media.
Windows 10 - You can download the Windows 10 Media Creation tool from Microsoft here. Run this program to download and create your Windows 10 installation disk on either a blank DVD or USB drive. Most users should download the 64-bit version of the tool. If you aren't sure, see How to Check if Windows is 32-Bits or 64-Bits.

, In order to run the installer and format the drive, you'll need to set your computer to boot from that drive (DVD or USB) instead of your hard drive. The process for this varies depending on whether your computer came with Windows 7 (or older), or if your computer came with Windows 8 (or newer).


Windows 7 (and older) - Reboot your computer and press the BIOS, SETUP, or BOOT key that is displayed when the computer first starts. The most common keys are F2, F11, F12, and Del. In the BOOT menu, set your installation drive as the primary boot device.
Windows 8 (and newer) - Click the Power button in the Start screen or menu. Hold ⇧ Shift and click Restart to reboot into the ""Advanced startup"" menu. Select the ""Troubleshoot"" option and then ""Advanced options"". Click ""UEFI Firmware Settings"" and then open the BOOT menu. Set your installation drive as the primary boot device.

, Windows will load the setup files and then start the installation process. You'll be asked to select your language and accept the terms before you proceed.

, This will allow you to format your hard drive during the installation.

, After proceeding through the initial installation screens, you'll be shown all of the hard drives and their partitions. You will typically have several partitions on your computer, one for your operating system, one recovery partition, and any additional partitions you may have created or drives you may have installed.


You can delete partitions on the same drive to combine them all into a single unallocated partition. This will delete any data on the partitions. Click the ""Drive options"" button to see the ""Delete"" option for partitions.
If you delete all of your partitions, you'll need to create a new one before it can be formatted. Select the unallocated space and click ""New"" to create a new partition. You'll be able to set the size of the partition out of the available free space. Note that you typically cannot create more than four partitions on a single drive.

, Click the ""Format"" button after selecting the partition or drive. If you don't see the Format button, click the ""Drive options"" button to reveal it. You will be warned that the format process will delete all data on the partition. Once you agree, the format will happen automatically. This may take a few moments to complete., Formatting your primary removes the operating system, so you won't be able to use the PC until you install an operating system again. You can proceed with the Windows installation after formatting the drive, or you can install a different operating system such as Linux. To install Windows, follow the rest of the prompts in the setup program after formatting. To install Linux, you'll need Linux installation media. See How to Install Linux for instructions on installing a variety of different Linux versions.

Finish filling out your cases.,
Manipulate your data.",How to Enter Data in SPSS1," In order to enter data using SPSS, you need to have some variables. These are the columns of the spreadsheet when using ""Data View"", and each one will contain data that is all the same format.


To define your variables, double-click a column heading ""Data View"" A menu will appear, allowing you to define the variable.
When entering a variable Name, it must begin with a letter and capitalization is ignored.
When choosing the Type, you can choose between ""String"" (characters) and a variety of numerical formats.
See this guide for more details on defining variables.;
, If you are defining a variable that has two or more set possibilities, you can set labels for the values. For example, if one of your variables is whether or not an employee is active, your only two options for that variable might be ""Active"" and ""Former"".Open the Labels section of the Define Variable menu, and create a numbered value for each possibility (e.g. ""1"", ""2"", etc.).
For each value, give it a corresponding label (e.g. ""Active"", ""Former"").
When you enter in the data for that variable, you only have to type ""1"" or ""2"" to select the option you want.

, Click the empty cell directly underneath the leftmost column. Enter in the value that matches the variable type into the cell. For example, if the column is ""name"", you might enter in an employee's name.Each row is one ""case"", which is referred to as a record in other database programs.

, Move to the next empty cell to to the right and fill out the appropriate value. Always fill out one complete record at a time. For example, if you are entering employee records, you would enter a single employee's name, address, phone number, and salary before moving on to the next employee.


Make sure that the values you enter match the Type format. For example, entering a dollar value in a Date-formatted column will cause an error., After each case is finished, move down to the next row and enter in the next. Make sure each case has an entry for every variable.


If you decide you need to add another variable, double-click the next open column header and create one.

, Once you have finished entering all of your data, you can use the tools built-in to SPSS to start manipulating your data. Some possible examples include:


Create a frequency table
Run a regression analysis
Run an analysis of variance
Create a scatter plot graph

You will also need a full copy of Windows, either an installation DVD or an .ISO file.You can check if your Mac is using an Intel processor by clicking the Apple menu and selecting ""About This Mac"". Look at the Processor listed in the window; if it says Intel then you're good to go.
It is possible to install OS X on a Windows PC, but that is outside the scope of this article. See the this guide for detailed instructions for setting up a Hackintosh.;
, You shouldn't lose anything during the process, but it's always a good idea to have backups just in case something goes wrong. Make sure all of your important documents, pictures, and other files are backed up on a separate drive or in the cloud. See this guide for more details on backing up your data.

, You will be restarting your computer multiple times during the installation, so it's a good idea to have access to this guide or your Boot Camp manual before proceeding.

, This program is located in the Utilities subfolder in your Applications folder. Boot Camp Assistant will create a new partition on your drive and start the Windows installation process., If you are installing from a Windows ISO file, you will need to use a USB flash drive to create a Windows Installation Disk. This will copy the ISO to the flash disk and prepare it for booting.


Insert an 8 GB or larger flash drive into your Mac and check the ""Create a Windows 7 install disk"" box. If you are using a Windows installation DVD, you can leave this box unchecked.
Any data on the flash drive will be deleted when the installation disk is created.

, Check the ""Download the latest Windows support software from Apple"" box. This software is necessary to allow you to use your hardware in Windows.


If you are creating a Windows install disk, the files will be copied to the same flash drive. If you are using an installation DVD, you will need to insert a blank flash drive or blank CD/DVD.

, This will start the Windows installation process once you have created your installation disk and support software disk. Click Continue to start the process.

, Before installation begins, you will be asked to create a partition for windows. A partition splits your hard drive up so that it acts as multiple drives. Windows must be installed on a separate partition from OS X. You can use the slider to adjust how big you want the Windows partition to be.


You can only create a partition out of free space on your hard drive.
Make sure that you leave at 20 GB free for Windows, more if you are planning on installing a lot of Windows programs.
Click the Install button when you are satisfied with your partitions. Make sure that any open programs have been saved and closed before proceeding.

, After your disk is partitioned, the computer will reboot and load your Windows installation disk. From here, installation is just like it would be on a PC. See the following guides for detailed instructions for the different versions of Windows:


Install Windows 10
Install Windows 8
Install Windows 7
Install Windows Vista

, When you are prompted to choose a location to install Windows, be sure to choose the one labeled ""BOOTCAMP"". You will need to format this drive before you can install, as Boot Camp doesn't format it correctly.

, After Windows has finished installing, you will be taken to the Windows desktop. Insert the disk that contains your support software, and navigate to the Setup file that comes with it. Run the file to begin installing all of the necessary drivers.


Make sure that the ""Apple Software Update for Windows"" box is checked during installation.

, Once all of the drivers have finished being installed for Windows, you're ready to start booting between the two operating systems. When you reboot your computer, hold down the ⌥ Option key until the Boot menu appears. You will be able to choose between your OS X installation or your Windows installation.


If you want your computer to boot up to OS X by default, you can set the default startup disk in the Windows Control Panel. Open the Control Panel from the Start menu and select the Boot Camp option. Select the ""Macintosh HD"" disk and click Apply to set OS X to start as default.
You will need to reboot your computer each time you want to change operating systems.

Back up any important data.,
Install Windows first.,
Start the Linux installation.,
Set the partitions.,
Choose your operating system.",How to Dual Boot2," In order to dual boot Windows and Linux, you will need a Windows installation disk and a Linux distribution installation disk. You will also need to have at least 20 GB available for each operating system.


You can use any Linux distribution you'd like. Some of the most popular ones include Ubuntu and Mint.

, This method will start with a fresh installation for both Windows and Linux, as this is the most foolproof way to successfully install both operating systems. Make sure all of your important documents, pictures, and other files are backed up on a separate drive or in the cloud. See this guide for more details on backing up your data.

, Windows takes over the boot sequence, so you'll always want to install it first so that your boot sequence isn't messed up later. When installing Windows, you can make the entire hard drive a single partition. The Linux installation will let you split it up later. See these guides for instructions on installing Windows:Install Windows 10
Install Windows 8
Install Windows 7
Install Windows Vista

, After Windows has finished installing, you can start the Linux part of the installation. Insert your Linux installation disc and reboot your computer. Boot to the disc and start the installation program. See these guides for detailed instructions for installing various Linux distributions:


Install Ubuntu Linux
Install Linux Mint

, During the Linux installation, you will be asked if you want to install Linux alongside your Windows installation or replace your Windows installation. Make sure to install it alongside your existing Windows installation to allow dual booting.


Once you choose to install alongside, you will be allowed to set the size of your partition. Make sure that you allow at least 10 GB for the operating system files, as well as extra space for programs. Use the slider to adjust the Linux partition size.
Click the ""advanced partitioning tool"" link if you want to create a third partition that can act as storage for both operating systems. You can allocate most of your space to this partition to ensure that you have plenty of space to store your files.

, After you finish installing Linux, your dual boot setup is complete. Whenever you reboot your computer, you will be given the option to choose which operating system you would like to boot.


You will need to reboot in order to change operating systems.

When they say they don't want to buy a Mac, because they are too expensive, tell them about Linux.;
, Windows is too open when it comes to allowing what programs can do to the operating system itself, that makes it easy for viruses to do whatever they want, because all it takes is to run the .exe file that you downloaded from Internet, which might be fake, so it is up to user to be careful. The only thing that anti-virus software does is take that right away from Windows and recognize threats. Many years later (felt like centuries), Microsoft ""invented"" the dreaded User Account Control which is annoying so most people disable it, defeating the purpose. Macs and Linux are designed to limit what can programs do to the system. Furthermore, there are infinitely many viruses designed for Windows 8-10 than for Macs (because so few people use Macs), and probably none for Linux. The inventors of Ubuntu provide frequent free security updates, and no one else makes Linux security: There is no need for it!

, Switching to a new operating system is a big change for many, one new program is not. It is best for them to try open source software one by one, if they use Internet Explorer, recommend Firefox. When they need to get the job done, recommend to them software that will also work on Linux, such as VLC instead Windows Media Player, because it can do so much more than Windows Media Player.

, Make sure they are around to see how you are doing it. Leave it on for them to try, and tell them that it would run incredibly fast when it's installed on their PC.

, If there is something that is not available for Linux, such as Microsoft Office, make sure you show them how to perform any task they want with LibreOffice for example. Remember that you are something called system administrator and they are only users so you only need to show them how to use Linux, don't try to teach them how to maintain it. It will be too confusing for most users.

, When you install Linux on their PC, also Install WINE, but do not tell them about it, until they want to use a program that is only available for Windows, you want to make sure they use Linux software natively as much as possible.

, Make sure you tell them about Software Center, so they can install software that is available for Ubuntu. Also, tell them about the Linux communities on the Internet, so when they have a problem they can get help from more experienced Linux users.

Play multiplayer games.",How to Use Bluetooth Technology," Bluetooth is a wireless connectivity tool that allows you to ""pair"" your devices so that they can interact with each other. For example, you can pair a headset with most smartphone, allowing you to talk without touching your phone. You can pair a gaming controller to a computer or console so you don't have to worry about the cord. You can send music to a Bluetooth-enabled speaker from your smartphone or laptop without having to connect them, or set up a home theater system without running speaker wire everywhere.


Bluetooth has a maximum range of about 30 feet.
Bluetooth transfer speeds top out at about 24 Mbps.;
, Bluetooth has been around for a long time (about 20 years), and is the market leader in wireless connectivity. Chances are that your wireless device comes with Bluetooth support. The big exception to this is desktop computers. While nearly all laptops will have Bluetooth built-in, most desktops do not include it. You will need to purchase a Bluetooth dongle if you want to connect your desktop computer to Bluetooth devices.


Many modern cars now have Bluetooth capabilities, allowing you to pair your phone while you are driving.
Virtually every smartphone is able to pair with Bluetooth devices.
Many newer printers are Bluetooth-capable, and can print wirelessly across the room.

, Every Bluetooth device has either single or multiple functionalities. For example, some cell phones may only allow you to use Bluetooth for making phone calls; whereas other cell phones may also allow you to transfer files to and from other cell phones. Every Bluetooth device has slightly different functionality.


Review the manuals or consult with the manufacturers for your electronic devices to determine the ways in which you can use their Bluetooth technology.

, In order to use Bluetooth technology, you must connect your devices to one another wirelessly, also known as ""pairing"". The pairing process varies from device to device, but generally you will have one device that is ""listening"", and then the secondary device gets put into pairing mode. For example, if you are pairing a headset to a phone, your phone would be in ""listen"" mode, and the headset would be put into ""pairing"" mode. The phone would then ""discover"" the headset, and the connection would be established.


Follow the instructions provided with your Bluetooth devices to complete the pairing process. In most cases, you will be required to perform a series of specific steps that will result in the pairing of your devices.
When pairing devices, you typically will be asked for a PIN before the connection is made. If a PIN was never set, the default is usually 0000.
Pairing typically only needs to be done once. AS long as Bluetooth is enabled on the devices, future connections will happen automatically.

, Some Bluetooth devices will allow you to transfer files and documents from one device to another. For example, if your friend has a bunch of good pictures on their camera, you can pair it with your phone to quickly get copies of them.Transfer files between cellphones, cameras and camcorders, computers, televisions, and more.

, Bluetooth earpieces can be paired with some land-line telephones or cellphones so you can talk on the phone without having to hold its receiver. This is especially useful if you find yourself on the phone a lot for work and don't want to have to fish it out every time you get a call.

, Tethering your device allows you to share your phone's mobile network connection with your computer. This lets you browse the internet on your computer without having to connect to a Wi-Fi network. Not all services allow tethering, so check with your mobile carrier. Sometimes extra fees are required., Enable the Bluetooth technology built directly into your automobile or wear a Bluetooth earpiece when you drive so you can keep both hands placed on the steering wheel. In some regions, it is illegal to hold a cell phone in your hand and talk while you are driving. Bluetooth will allow you to talk on your phone while driving without breaking the law.


Certain phones and car stereos will allow you to play music over the car stereo when connected to the phone via Bluetooth

, Some devices will allow you to synchronize data such as contact lists, emails, and calendar events between one another. This can be a great way to sync your phone contacts with your computer, or to transfer data to another phone.

, Bluetooth devices can significantly decrease tangled cables, and allow you to work more freely. Bluetooth keyboards and mice allow you to type from anywhere without sacrificing accuracy. Bluetooth printers allow you to place the printer wherever you'd like without having to worry about stretching a cable from the printer to your computer.

, Bluetooth speakers and remotes can make controlling and interacting with your media much easier. With a Bluetooth remote, you don't need to point it at the TV to use it. Bluetooth speakers allow you to set up a surround sound system without having to run speaker wires all over your living room. In order to set up a Bluetooth home theater system, you will need a Bluetooth-capable receiver.

, Bluetooth technology is available in wireless entry systems that can unlock your home or car with the tap of a button on your smartphone. You'll never have to search for missing keys again! Check your local hardware store for Bluetooth-capable deadbolt systems, or contact your local car stereo store to ask about Bluetooth car lock mechanisms., If your computer is Bluetooth-capable, you can connect a PlayStation 3 or 4 controller to use a gamepad for your PC games. This is not supported by Sony, and requires the use of third-party software, but is relatively easy to set up.

, Bluetooth allows you to create a local network between two phones, which is a quick and easy way to set up a multiplayer gaming session. Although this only works if you're in the same room, it's much more reliable than trying to game over the internet.

Bluetooth signals are able to pass through obstacles much easier than IR signals. You don’t necessarily need to worry about having line-of-sight between the dongle and the device.
You should see multiple messages in your System Tray informing you that the drivers are being installed and that the Bluetooth dongle has been successfully connected. A Bluetooth icon will appear in the taskbar.;
, You can find this in the Start menu on your computer, or by pressing the Windows key + X and selecting Control Panel in Windows 8


Open ""Bluetooth Devices"" (Windows XP) or under ""Hardware and Sound"", click the Add a device (Windows 7).

, Check the box next to "" My device is set up and ready to be found"" and click ""Next"".

, Windows will begin configuring your device and automatically downloading the correct drivers.


You may need to enter a PIN or code to connect the device. If you don’t know the code, try entering 0000.
You will only need to pair your device with the computer once. After that, the device will be automatically connected as long as it is within range and the dongle is plugged in.

Understand how Bluetooth works.,
Learn the most common pairings.,
Connect your devices.,
Enter a PIN (if asked).,
Use the device.,
Read guides for specific pairing instructions.",How to Use a Bluetooth Device," Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows two different devices to connect. Every Bluetooth device has one or more profiles installed. These profiles determine what the device is capable of, such as ""Hands-Free"" (mobile headsets) or ""Human Interface Device"" (computer mouse). In order for two devices to connect, they must both have the same profile.You can generally tell what devices will work with each other by looking at them logically. You wouldn't be able to pair a mouse with a camera, since the camera isn't designed to be controlled by the mouse. On the other hand, it would make sense to connect a headset to a mobile phone, since they are designed to work together.;
, If you are unsure as to whether your devices will work together, there are several cases where Bluetooth use is very popular. Knowing these can help you determine how to connect your devices.


Connecting a hands-free headset to a mobile phone.
Connecting wireless mice, keyboards, and printers to laptops and other computers.
Connecting portable media players and smartphones to speakers and car stereos.
Wirelessly connecting video game controllers to computers and game consoles.

, The method to connect to devices will vary in every situation, but generally it follows the same basic process. You will need to make one device discoverable, and then search for devices with the second device.


For example, if you wanted to connect a headset to your smartphone, you would put the headset into the discovery mode (refer to the documentation), and then search for discoverable devices on your smartphone.

, You may be asked to enter a PIN when connecting your devices. If you don't know the PIN, it is generally 0000, 1111, or 1234. This can vary for some devices, and if you can't find it you may need to reset the device.

, Once your devices are connected, you can start using them in conjunction. For example, you may have connected your smartphone to some wireless speakers, allowing you to play music through them. You may have connected a mouse to your laptop, and now you can use your mouse to move the cursor.


When connecting a Bluetooth device to a computer, you may need to install the drivers for the device. This is usually done automatically, though the device may have come with a driver installation disc. You can also download drivers from the manufacturer's website.
There is no general ""Bluetooth driver"", only drivers for specific devices.
If you want to connect a Bluetooth device to a desktop PC, chances are the desktop PC does not have Bluetooth functionality. You will need to purchase and install a Bluetooth USB dongle in order to connect devices to the PC. Most laptops and virtually all Macs have Bluetooth support built-in., If you are having difficulty pairing your devices, there are a variety of articles on wikiHow that can help you get it all sorted out.

Talk about dietary restrictions.,
Consider time limitations.,
Think about location.,
Consider the cost.",How to Choose Where to Eat with Friends1," Before choosing a place to eat with your pals, you should first discuss any dietary restrictions they might have. For example, if one of your friends has a gluten intolerance, you will want to choose a place with gluten-free options like a Thai restaurant or sushi bar.Ask everyone in the party whether they have allergies, food sensitivities, or other restrictions.
Always respect your friends’ dietary restrictions, even if you don’t understand them.;
, When planning a meal with others, it is important to think about how long everyone has to enjoy the meal. For example, if your friend has to be at work after the meal, you will want to choose a restaurant with fast, reliable service instead of one that is known for being slow., Chances are your friends live in multiple neighborhoods, which means that you should consider the location of a restaurant you choose. Think about how long it might take each member of your party to reach the restaurant. You should also consider whether or not everyone has reliable transportation to get to a suggested dining location.

, It is important that you think about your friends’ budgets when choosing a place to eat. Not everyone has the same financial resources, so it is important to pick a place that everyone can afford. For example, your friend who is a successful engineer might be able to afford the hip new four-star restaurant, but this restaurant might be unaffordable for the friend who teaches high school."

Pick a place from a hat.",How to Choose Where to Eat with Friends2," Ask your friends to each suggest one restaurant. Their suggestion should take everyone’s dietary, time, and budget constraints into consideration. Once everyone suggests a restaurant, make a list of the proposed dining options.

, Once you make a list of proposed restaurants, you can then take a group vote on where to eat. Each person gets one vote. Tally up the votes to see if there is a clear winner. If there is a tie between restaurants, you can break it with another vote or by flipping a coin., If your group of friends is having trouble deciding where to grab lunch or dinner, you can simplify the process by appointing a decision-maker. After making the list of suggested restaurants, the group can give a single person the responsibility of deciding which of the restaurants you will eat at.If deciding where to eat is a common issue with your group, you can set up a rotating list of decision-makers. When a particular person comes to the top of the list, they make that night's decision.

, If you can't decide where to go, you can always rely on a tried and true restaurant. Does your group have a favorite Italian restaurant or burger joint? Fall back on these favorites in moments of indecision.

, It's always fun to go someplace new when eating out with friends. Try asking everyone in the group if they have heard of any new restaurants they want to try. Take a vote on which one you'll visit if there are multiple choices.

, When you’re having difficulty choosing a place to eat, you can enlist the help of an app. Apps like Zomato, OpenTable, EatStreet, Grubhub, and Yelp can show you what restaurants are nearby, link you to menus, and provide you with reviews from other hungry people., If your group still can't figure out where to eat, you can use an old fashioned method to choose. Write down at least three choices of restaurants on slips of paper. Place the slips of paper in a hat or other receptacle, like a bowl. Appoint someone to pick a slip of paper from the hat. This is where your group will eat.

Call or message friends that miss school.,
Make like a boy scout -- be prepared.,
Find a way to get rid of bad emotions.,
Do what you need to feel confident.,
Stand your ground and draw boundaries.","How to Be a Sweet Friend, but Not Taken for Granted"," You may feel weird and awkward, but think about it--if you're stuck home sick it means a lot to hear somebody remind you that you were missed. If it's somebody you don't have much contact with at all, just the kind of person you nod at in the hallway, like a crush, then you don't need to call. Just make sure to say ""Hey, we missed you yesterday"" when they come back. But if it's somebody you eat lunch with, you probably need to call.;
, Go to a drugstore and buy some of those little tissue packs and (if you're a girl) some of those tampons in discreet wrappers. Put the tampons in a change purse. Other handy items include hand sanitizer, lotion, a watch, hair ties, pens, contact solution, first aid supplies, etc. Put all the stuff in your backpack or bag. If somebody's complaining about a cut or blister, sniffling because of a cold or allergies, or having an ""emergency"" in class, you can whip this stuff out and fix their problem. Also, this way if somebody's crying, you can come up to them, pat their back, and offer them tissues.

, It's hard to be considerate if you're full of anger or unhappiness. You need a way to let out your bad emotions like everyone else. Journals and exercise help release some anger and frustration. If you get depressed or are prone to doing self destructive things, like punching or cutting yourself, try to think of a replacement to that. For example, if you enjoy writing but get really negative and depressed, try writing about how you feel every time you sense that emotion coming on. For more active people, try doing star jumps or running around. If you really need help, it might be a good idea to talk to someone like a counselor.

, It's easier to be sweet if you're confident-how you can you help someone if you feel scared to approach them? Whatever makes you feel confident-dancing like a crazy person, writing, wearing your favorite clothes-whatever makes you feel happy in your own skin, do it.

, Being sweet is great, but you may be taken advantage of. An important way to avoid this is to stand your ground. Sure, give a buddy a second chance if they're really late meeting up with you, but don't smile and say it's okay when they do it a fifth time. Make sure you respect yourself.

Foster their budding friendship.",How to Be a Friendship Match Maker," This might be existing friends you have who haven't yet met, relatives such as your cousins or siblings, people you know at school or work, or people you know through sports and hobbies.;
, Perhaps they have a good sense of humor, maybe they play the same video games or they could each have the same kind of pet. Find things that they have in common they're dedicated to or passionate about. It's not about checking all the boxes, their uniqueness is as important as what they have in common, but finding one or two really important things that they have in common will help to make the material of friendship.

, Tell each of them beforehand that you hope they'll find each other interesting and that you think they'd make great friends. This will help them to realize that you're making a kind gesture and they can at least have a chat. Also make it clear that there is no pressure though, it's just something you thought might work out for both of them.


The sort of occasion might be something like: Going to a cafe together, taking a walk together, visiting the beach/a park/somewhere local, having them over to your house, holding a party and inviting them both, having a sleepover, and so forth. Choose whatever you're comfortable with doing.

, Give a brief rundown on each of them, stating their common interests and suggesting that they might like to get know each other. Ensure that they feel comfortable, then leave them to it.


Decide whether you are best hanging around or hovering off at a distance. If you feel they're acting awkward without you to smooth things over, stay with them but if it's clear you're the third wheel, leave them be and find something else to do. Do keep an eye on them though, in case things don't work out and they're both desperate for an excuse to get away from each other!

, If it becomes clear to you that the two are likely to become good friends, do what you can to keep this growing. Invite them over a few more times to do things with you, make arrangements for them to get together and help out in any way that you can. After a while, you probably won't be needed but don't neglect your own friendship with either of them––be sure to stay in touch and continue your friendships.

Let people know you're down for anything.,
Provide your contact information.,
Be friendly and approachable when you see people in person.,
Contact your friends first, on occasion.,
Do not take perceived rejections personally.,
Talk about the issue.",How to Encourage Your Friends to Contact You More1," You may not get contacted if people think you're not interested in certain events or activities. Try to let people know you're interested in trying new things. This way, when someone wants to hit up a new bar or try a new restaurant, you're more likely to get an invitation.


When a moment comes in conversation to show you're interested in trying new things, take it. For example, say a couple of friends are talking about the new Japanese restaurant that opened up. You could say something like, ""I love trying new food. If anyone wants to hit that place up, let me know.""
If you're not contacted a lot, this may be because people think you're simply not interested in spending time doing certain activities. By presenting yourself as someone with a variety of interests, you're more likely to get an invitation.
Let people know you're comfortable with a variety of situations. If you're not a big drinker, for example, people may be hesitant to contact you if they're heading to the bar after work. If you hear people talking about drinking, say something like, ""I'm not into alcohol that much myself, but I don't mind having a club soda and chatting while other people are drinking."";
, Friends won't be able to contact you if they don't know how to reach you. When you have the opportunity to do so, provide friends with your contact information. You should also let them know how to reach you best. Say something like, ""I don't have free texting on my phone, so calling, e-mailing, or talking to me on Facebook works best.""


Don't be shy on social media. In this day and age, many new friendships blossom because people reach out to one another via outlets like Facebook and Twitter. If you know someone from school or work, find them on Facebook and send a friend request. This conveys you're interested in socializing with this person. Many people feel shy about calling or texting, and may feel more comfortable casually chatting online.

, When you see people in person, this presents you with an opportunity to make a good impression. If you come off as sociable and approachable, people will be more likely to reach out to you after a party or get together.If someone strikes up a conversation with you, be engaging. If a person asks how you're doing, don't simply say ""good"" or ""okay."" Give that person a small bit of detail about your day and ask him or her how he or she is doing. For example, ""I'm great. I got a wonderful walk in after work today. How are you?"" People are drawn to those who are interested in them. Asking a lot of questions, and paying attention to the answers, will make people more likely to contact you after an event.
You should also work on having approachable body language. Try to keep your shoulders down and avoid crossing your arms. Make eye contact with friends and acquaintances from across the room and then offer a nice smile.

, If you're worried others aren't contacting you, consider whether you reach out to them. Your friends may feel like you're not interested in being contacted if you rarely text, call, or e-mail them. Try sending a few texts out a day to friends. Like people's posts on social media. Take steps to be more socially engaged. If you interact with others regularly, others are more likely to interact with you.

, In friendships, especially long-term friendships, we develop certain expectations of others. You may think it's your friend's turn to ask you to coffee if you asked the last time, for example. However, sometimes expectations can lead you to take perceived rejections as personal slights. Unless the two of you had a specific falling out, chances are a friend lessening contact is not personal. If you get angry or confrontational over the issue, you could hurt your friend's feelings. Work on de-personalizing a lack of contact.Consider a variety of other factors before deciding your friend is being rude to you. Has your friend been busy lately? Is he or she undergoing any changes? A variety of factors could make a friend taper off contact. Chances are it's not about you.
Try to be understanding if you're not offered an invitation to a particular event. You may feel left out if you see on Facebook a few of your friends went out without you. Chances are they did not consciously leave you out. Your friends may have assumed you were busy, wouldn't be interested in the activity, or maybe just wanted a smaller group.

, If you feel a friendship is becoming one-sided, it's appropriate to talk about the issue. However, do so in a calm and respectful manner. You do not want to make your friend feel bad, resulting in hurt feelings. The goal of talking things out is to find a mutually beneficial solution.


Let your friend know you want to talk. You can try to gather your thoughts ahead of time by writing them down. Try to go into the conversation with empathy. Consider your friend's perspective. Why might he or she be contacting you less lately? Try to take this into consideration.Use ""I""-statements to express yourself. These are statements that begin with ""I feel,"" after which you state your emotion. Then, you explain the actions that lead to that emotion, and why you feel that way. ""I""-statements can lessen blame, as you're putting the focus on your feelings over objective facts. For example, don't say, ""I'm always the one who calls you and invites you out. It's disrespectful that you never take initiative to make plans."" Instead, say, ""I feel disrespected when you never call me and make plans because it makes our friendship feel one-sided.""
Give your friend some specifics on how you would like things to change. For example, maybe you want your friend to make plans on occasion instead of always waiting for you to do so.

Consider if you're the leader of the group.,
Think about whether you fly under the radar.,
Watch out for one-sided relationships.,
Consider whether you're giving the wrong impression.,
Explore your own insecurities.",How to Encourage Your Friends to Contact You More2," Oftentimes, one person inadvertently becomes the leader of a group of people. You may be the one making plans and calling the shots for the group. This may mean your friends don't contact you as much. This is not necessarily because they dislike you, but because you're usually the one responsible for organizing get-togethers.Think about the last few times you've gotten together with your friends. Were you the one who picked the place, made reservations, and sent out Facebook invitations? Are you consistently the one hosting or organizing? If so, your friends may not feel the need to contact you. They assume you'll contact them if something is going on.
There's nothing inherently wrong with a group dynamic in which one person is the leader. However, if you feel constantly planning things is taxing, ask your friends if they'll take the reins sometimes. Try not to be rude about it, but simply say you'd like to take a break from hosting and planning once in awhile.

, You may not be on the receiving end of a lot of contact if you fly under the radar in a group. If you're part of a social circle, but feel like a peripheral member, people may simply not think to include you. While this is not personal, it can feel frustrating. There are steps you can take to put yourself out there more if you feel like you go unnoticed.How often do you talk in large social settings? If you tend to be more shy or introverted, you may find yourself remaining quiet a lot of the time and simply listening. You may also only be really close to one or two members of the group. Other group members may think of you as ""Lisa's friend"" or ""Andy's roommate"" rather than a full-fledged group member.
If you don't want to go unnoticed, take measures to assert yourself more. Try to participate in conversations when you're out with people. If you're shy and have a hard time in big group conversations, feel free to start side conversations of your own.
If you're new to a group, it can take a while for people to notice you. Try to give it time. Eventually, people will get to know you and begin contacting you more frequently.

, If you're always the one making contact, you may be in a one-sided friendship. These kinds of relationships are often not sustainable long-term. Learn the signs of a one-sided friendship. If you believe your friendship is far more give than take, consider finding different friends.All friendships have a natural ebb and flow. At certain times, one person may be more needy or clingy due to difficult circumstances. However, if your friend is constantly focused on his or her own needs, and tends to only contact you when he or she needs something, this may be a sign the friendship is one-sided.
Honestly evaluate the friendship. Has this person ever checked in with you when you've been going through a difficult time? Do you feel like this person would be there if you were in need? If not, the friendship may be one-sided, which is not fair to you and your needs.
If you're not invested in saving the friendship, work on simply severing contact with this person. However, if you're interested in salvaging things, have a frank talk with your friend about how you feel. If someone is worth keeping around as a friend, he or she will make an effort to change to avoid hurting your feelings in the future.

, If you don't get contacted all that often, you may be giving people the wrong impression of yourself. Consider how you act in groups. If you're more shy or reserved than others, you can come off as being disinterested or unfriendly. People may think you don't want to be contacted.If you're worried you come off the wrong way, work on ways to compensate for shyness. Force yourself to talk to others, even if it's difficult. If you're worried about face-to-face interactions, try breaking the ice via social media. Comment on posts of friends. If you establish a solid connection via Facebook, this may make it easier for you to open up and talk in person. This can result in people contacting you more.

, If you feel like you're not contacted enough, some of this may be in your head. You may be making assumptions about people's behavior that are not entirely accurate. Try to explore some of your own insecurities to see if there's really a problem between you and your friends.Consider your past. If you had trouble making friends as a kid, you may be more insecure about your friendships as an adult. If you had an unstable relationship at some point, this may drive abandonment issues that can seep into friendship.
Try to assess the situation honestly. Do your friends really not contact you that often? Go through your phone, Facebook account, and e-mail. You may find you've been contacted far more than you realized.

"
"
Avoid holding grudges.,
Alter your expectations.,
Show appreciation when you are contacted.",How to Encourage Your Friends to Contact You More3," If you're the type to get angry or hold grudges, people will not be drawn to you naturally. Try to let go of past treatment and be empathetic of others. If a friend forgot to return a text, this is probably not worth getting upset over. If you're a kind, forgiving person, people will feel at ease around you. They'll be more likely to contact you, as they'll feel comfortable in your presence.However, there's such a thing as being too forgiving. Remember to watch out for one-sided friends. At a certain point, it is appropriate to assert yourself. Letting go of small indiscretions does not mean you should put up with long-term mistreatment.

, A lot of times, people have high or unreasonable expectations of their friends. Consider what you expect from those around you. Is it fair? Is it reasonable? If not, you may want to let go of certain expectations. This will help you relax more, allowing others to feel comfortable and welcome in your presence.Do not pick your friends apart too quickly. Accept that your friends are imperfect and make mistakes. If a friend fails to return a text message, don't jump to accusing him or her of disrespect. It's not reasonable to expect text messages to always be returned. Chances are, you've failed to return a text or two as well at some point.
Understand your friends aren't going to match you all the time. While you may be excellent at returning e-mails and phone calls, other people are less organized. You can't expect your friends to be at your level in every respect. Chances are, there are things about you your friends find frustrating as well.

, Let people know you enjoy being included. Being gracious and kind will encourage people to contact you again. After a night out, for example, text a friend something like, ""Thank you so much for including me tonight. I had a great time, and I appreciate the invite.""

Determine how you feel about the person, and how they feel about you.",How to Be Just Friends with a Member of the Opposite Sex1," Be honest with yourself.


Do you find yourself fantasizing about what a relationship would be like with them?
If you weren't in a relationship, if they were single, or if something else wasn't in the way, would you probably be romantically interested?
Do they seem to be romantically inclined towards you? Remember that actions speak louder than words. Trust your gut feeling.
Do you really believe that this person is better suited to you as a friend than as a romantic partner? Why? Your answer to this question is what makes all the difference, and what will keep the relationship platonic when or if boundaries ever become blurred.;
"
"
Define your relationship as a friendship from the start.",How to Be Just Friends with a Member of the Opposite Sex2," In any relationship, cross-gender friendships included, communication is key. Presumptions can lead to broken friendships, misunderstandings, and other problems down the line. Egos aside, address why you both want to be just friends. There's a period in most opposite sex friendships when you question whether or not you should be more. Address it early on. Both of you must want a strictly platonic friendship and understand that's all it will ever be. No matter what anyone says, it is possible to be just friends as long as you have that understanding (and a commitment to the friendship as just that) from the start.

"
"
Talk to your significant other.,
Involve the significant other(s).",How to Be Just Friends with a Member of the Opposite Sex3," Ask your friend to talk to theirs. Any insecurities or trust issues within a relationship will be magnified by a cross-gender friendship, especially if the friend is obviously attractive. The opposite-sex friend can often become a scapegoat for relationship problems, and a repeated source of contention. Honesty is the best policy.


Acknowledge any borderline feelings from the start, and provide a reason for friendship that outweighs those feelings.
Remind your significant other that you're committed to the relationship, and why.

, You should make an honest attempt to befriend their significant other and include yours. Coordinate get-togethers that you all can enjoy as a group. Include your significant other in outings with your friend. Jealousy is much less likely to be an issue if your significant other can get to know your friend. It's going to take time, especially if they don't believe in platonic friendships. Likewise, even if you don't like their significant other, understand there might be a little doubt and jealousy over the friendship. Find out what they like to do and suggest an outing for just the two of you. By becoming a friend to the couple, the doubts and jealousy usually vanish in time.

"
"
Minimize sexual tension.,
Prevent borderline situations.,
Reduce contact or end the friendship if the boundaries can't be clarified or upheld.,
Be careful with your decisions.",How to Be Just Friends with a Member of the Opposite Sex4," Don't be ""touchy feely"" with your friend, even if you consider yourself to be a naturally affectionate person, and especially if either of you are in a romantic relationship with someone else. Sure, it's possible to make physical contact without inciting sexual attraction, but hormones can play tricks on us. Don't give those hormones a chance to confuse your status as friends. Limit hugs and physical contact to the same amount you share with a sibling or a co-worker, depending on what you feel is appropriate, and what you think your significant other (or theirs) would feel comfortable with. If you find the need to hug and touch them more, then maybe you're not just friends.

, Don't give people a reason to think you're more than just friends. Having a night out together is fine, but don't bring your friend into social scenarios where everyone else has a date. That is called dating, not friendship. You wouldn't ask your same sex friend to accompany you to your sister's wedding, so don't ask your opposite sex friend! If you are going somewhere that might appear romantic (e.g. a movie or a fancy restaurant) but you do not want it to appear that way, invite another friend of the same sex. Even then, people may insinuate that you are more than friends; be prepared for those suggestions, and think of how you can deny them gracefully.

, If your friend is attracted to you as more than a friend and can't seem to put that attraction aside, it's probably best to take the friendship down a notch. Keep contact casual, conversations short, and get-togethers brief. If the friend continues to press for a romantic relationship when you've made it clear that you don't want one, if they constantly trash talk your significant other (without good reason), or if they let their own significant other demean you, then perhaps the friendship isn't worth keeping, and this person should just be more of a friendly acquaintance.

,


Simply choosing to meet for lunch over the alternate meeting for dinner, can portray a significant difference to your friend.

Be concerned when your secrets get out.,

Use your phone around other electronic devices.,

Go to the police.",How to Tell if Your Phone Is Tapped," If secure information that only a small number of trusted individuals should know suddenly gets out, there might be some chance that the leak came about as a result of a phone tap, particularly if you have discussed the information over the phone at some point.


This is of particular significance if you are in a position that makes you a valuable person to spy on. For instance, if you have a high-level position in a powerful company with many competitors, you might be in danger of falling victim to the underground information industry.
On the other hand, your reasons for being tapped could also be as simple as going through a messy divorce. Your soon-to-be-ex-spouse might wiretap you if he or she wants to dig up information that could be useful during the divorce proceedings.
If you want to test this out, you can do so by confiding a fake piece of information that seems important to someone you know you can trust not to tell. If that piece of information gets out, you know that someone else was listening in.;
, Sometimes this can suggest that someone broke into your home for the sake of putting a wiretap on your phone.

, If you hear a great deal of static or other background noise when you talk to people on the phone, there is a chance that the noise is coming from interference created by a tap.


This is not the best of signs when taken alone, though, since echoes, static, and clicking can also be caused by random interference or a bad connection.
Static, scratching, and popping can be caused by a capacitive discharge resulting from two conductors being connected.
High-pitched humming is an even greater indication.
You can check for sounds that your ear cannot pick up by using a sound-bandwidth sensor on a low frequency. If the indicator pops up several times per minute, your phone may very well be tapped.

, If you suspect that there might be a tap on your phone, walk over to a radio or television during your next phone call. Even if there is no audible interference on your phone itself, there is some chance that interference could occur when you stand next to another electronic device, causing static with that device.


You should also look for distortion when you are not on actively using the phone. An active wireless phone signal could disrupt the transmission of data even without additional software or hardware being installed on your phone, but an inactive signal should not.
Some bugs and taps use frequencies close to the FM radio band, so if your radio squeals when set to mono and dialed into the far end of the band, one of these devices might be in use.
Likewise, taps can interfere with TV broadcast frequencies on UHF channels. Use a TV with an antenna to check the room for interference.

, Your phone should be quiet when you are not using it. If you can hear beeping, clicking, or other noises from your phone even when it is not in use, there could be a tapping software or hardware installed.


In particular, listen for a pulsating static noise.
If this occurs, it could suggest that the microphone and speaker are active even when the phone is not in use via a hook switch bypass. Any conversation you have within 20 feet (6 m) of the phone might be heard.
In the case of a landline, if you can hear a dial tone when your phone is on the hook, this is another sign of a tap. Verify the presence of this noise with an external amplifier.

,


Of course, a hot battery could just be a sign that it has been overused. This is especially true if your cell phone is already older than one year, since cell batteries tend to decline over time.

, If the battery life of your phone suddenly drops without reason, prompting you to charge it twice as often, the battery might be dying because of tap software constantly running in the background and eating up power.


You also need to consider how often you have been using your phone. If you have used it a lot lately, the increased need for a good charge is probably just due to the fact that you have used more of its power. This is only applicable if you barely touch your phone or have not used it any more than normal.
You can monitor the life of your smart phone's battery over time by using an app like BatteryLife LX or Battery LED.
Also note that a cell battery will lose the ability to stay charged as it gets older. If this change happens after you have had your phone for a year or more, it could just be the result of an old, overused battery.

, If the shutdown process gets delayed or cannot be completed, this strange behavior could indicate that there is someone else controlling your phone through a tap.


Pay close attention to determine if your cell phone takes longer to shut down than usual or if the back light remains on even after you shut it down.
While this could be a sign that your cell phone is tapped, it could also just mean that there was a glitch in the hardware or software of your phone that is completely unrelated to a tap.

, If your phone lights up, shuts down, starts up, or begins to install an app without you doing anything, there might be someone hacking into your phone and controlling it through a tap.


On the other hand, any of this could happen if there is random interference during the transmission of data.

, If you have recently gotten SMS text messages that consist of randomized strings of letters or numbers from unknown senders, these messages are a major red flag that there is an amateur tap on your phone.


Some programs use SMS texts to send commands to the target cell phone. If these programs are installed sloppily, these messages can appear., If the cost of your data jumps up and you know you are not responsible for the increase, there might be someone else using your data through a tap.


Many spy programs send logs of your phone records to online servers and use your data plan to do so. Older programs used large amounts of data, making them easier to spot, but newer programs are easier to hide because they use less data.

, If you are already suspicious of a tap on your landline, examine your surroundings carefully. If something seems out of place, like a couch or a desk, do not automatically disregard it as a symptom of paranoia. It could be an indication that someone has been snooping around in your space.


A wiretapper might move furniture around while trying to access electrical lines or phone lines, which is why this is an important element to note.
In particular, look at your wall plates. You should pay special attention to the wall plates around your phone connection inside the room. If they seem moved or otherwise disturbed, they may have been tampered with.

, You might not know what a phone box should look like inside, but even if you only have a slight idea, take a look. If the box seems tampered with or if the contents inside have been disturbed, someone might have been installing a wiretap.


If you notice any hardware that seems hastily installed, even if you do not know what it is, you should consider having someone check it out.
Take a good look at the ""restricted"" side of the box. This side needs a special Allen wrench to open, and if it looks like it has been tampered with, you might have a problem.

, If you see an increase in the number of utility trucks around the property, this could indicate that those utility trucks are not really utility trucks. They could be trucks belonging to the people listening in on your calls and maintaining the wiretap.


This is especially note-worthy if no one ever seems to get in or out of the trucks.
Generally, people listening in on a landline call via a bug will be 500 to 700 feet (152 to 213 m) away. The vehicles will also have tinted windows.

, If someone comes to your house claiming to be a repairman or an employee from your telephone carrier, but you have not called and requested someone, it could be a trap. Call your phone company—or whichever utility company he claims to be from—to verify his identity.


When calling the company, use the phone number you have in your records. Do not use a phone number provided by the mysterious stranger at your door.
Even if you get verification, you should carefully watch this repairman's actions during his stay.

, A tap detector is a physical device you can hook up to your phone. As the name suggests, it can pick up on outside signals and taps, letting you know that your suspicions are correct and that someone else has been listening to your calls.


The usefulness of these devices is in question, but in order for any such device to be of any use in detecting a wiretap, it will need to be able to detect electrical or signal changes over the phone line being tested. Look for a device that measures impedance and capacitance levels, along with high-frequency signal changes., For smart phones, you might be able to install a tap detecting app that can pick up on tap signals and unauthorized access to your cell phone data.


The effectiveness of these apps is debatable, so even these may not provide you with irrefutable proof. Some apps of this nature are only useful in detecting bugs placed by other apps.
Apps that claim to detect bugs include Reveal: Anti SMS Spy.

, If you have strong reasons to believe that you phone is tapped, you can ask your phone carrier to check using professional equipment.


A standard line analysis performed by the phone company will be able to detect most illegal wiretaps, listening devices, low frequency devices, and phone line splicing.
Note that if you have asked your phone company to check for wiretaps and bugs, but the company refuses your request or claims not to find anything after barely searching, there is a chance that it could be administering a government request.

, If you have strong evidence that your phone really has been tapped, you can also ask the police to check. Moreover, you can enlist their help in catching whoever is responsible for the tap, as well.


Most police departments have the equipment needed to test your phone for a bug or a tapping device, but if you do not have decent evidence that your concerns are justified, they might not be willing to use it.

Choosing mobile phone for the system Get a GSM mobile phone which has auto-answer and mute functions.,
Noting the IMEI number Take down the IMEI Number of your mobile phone.,
Getting a new mobile connection Buy a new post-paid mobile connection.,
Mounting the SIM Card Mount the SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) in the mobile phone and test whether the connection is working well.

,
Making the phone quiet Mute the phone by removing its speaker.,
Settings Switch on the auto-answer and Automatic Network Search options in the mobile phone.,
Mounting the system in your car Get a suitable car-mobile charger.,
Test the installation by calling to the mobile installed inside the car from another phone.,
What to do when you find your car is missing When your car is found missing, immediately report to the police and inform your mobile network.,
Maintenance Test the system once in a while to ensure it is working properly.

",How to Make a Smart Car Surveillance System Using a Mobile Phone," It should have good reception and a perfect microphone. The ones with small external antennae are the most suitable.;
, This number is usually printed inside the battery compartment, located beneath the battery of the mobile phone. Detach the battery to find it. Alternately, you can get this number displayed on the screen by dialing *#06# on the keypad of the mobile phone. If you are not sure, seek help from the vendor.

, Any plan which would ensure a long-term reliable connection, with wide coverage and roaming facility would suffice. Choose the most economic plan available since the connection will be rarely used. Keep the mobile number to yourself.

,, If you choose not to remove the speaker, make sure to turn off the speaker phone, ring tones and alerts. Also, turn off the screen light and vibration options. The idea is to make it totally silent and quiet.

, Enable the PIN (Personal Identification Number) feature. Lock the keyboard of the mobile phone.

, Connect the 12 volt input of the charger to the car battery, with some wires. For connecting, soldering the wires together is the best method. Keep in mind that the 12V cigarette lighter plug will contain electronics to convert the 12V car voltage to the phone voltage. Cutting the wire and connecting the phone directly to the 12V battery - like the video below suggests - means you that the phone gets 12V instead of the lower voltage (like 5V) and will most likely destroy your phone. Connect the output pin of the charger to the mobile phone. Now, mount the mobile phone and the mobile charger securely behind the dashboard or some other inconspicuous place inside the car. Both should be smartly hidden.

, The auto-answer feature should work. Ask a person to get inside the car and to keep on speaking something. You should be able to hear him clearly speaking over the other phone. If that is accomplished, your Smart Car Surveillance System is properly installed.

, Tell them about your Smart Car Surveillance System, the phone number and IMEI number. They'll be able to track down the culprits easily, basing upon the location of the GSM tower which acquires the signals transmitted from the mobile phone. Remember to tell the network not to block the SIM, which they would normally do, whenever a mobile phone is reported stolen. All the way, you can hear the car thieves talking to each other and that too can give you helpful hints to track them.

Locate the right partition.,
Locate the Grub/Grub2 files.,
Boot up.",How to Bypass Grub Rescue on a Linux Computer," Once the command prompt shows up, type ""ls"".  This command should show a list of partitions that look like this: (hd0), (hd0,msdos1), (hd0,msdos2), (hd0,msdos3), etc.  To find a partition's filesystem, type ""ls (name partition you want to see)"".  

An example would be ""ls (hd0, msdos5)"".  The partition you want to find should have a file system of ext2 or something similar to that.  Most, if not all of the others should have an unknown file system.
For the purposes of this article, ""(hd0,msdos6)"" will be used to represent the correct partition. ;
, Once you find the partition with the ext2 file system, you will want to find the Grub/Grub2 folder.  This will require a little more work than the previous step.  First, type ""ls (hd0,msdos6)/"".  Do not forget that slash!

With the slash right behind it, it should display all the folders contained within the partition.  You will want to search through them one by one until you find the Grub or Grub2 folder.  (Sometimes, you may end up being extremely lucky and have the grub/grub2 folder displayed immediately.  If you aren't, you will have to a bit more searching.)
Search through the other folders. Type ""ls (hd0,msdos6)/foldername/"".  This will display all subfolders within the selected folder.  If you see a ""boot"" folder, search through that one first, it's the most likely one to contain the files. Continue to search through the folders until you find one that is called ""grub"" or ""grub2"". Once you find it, write the path down and continue on.

, Now that you have located the grub/grub2 files, you are now ready to boot up.  Simply type ""set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/PathToGrubFiles"", ""insmod normal"", then ""normal"".  Again, this will be different for every computer.  

For example, you may have to type ""set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/grub2/  insmod normal  normal  "", or ""set prefix=(hd1,msdos6)/boot/grub/"".

If you get an ""authentication error"" message, your root account is likely locked. See the next section for instructions on unlocking it.

, When you are logged in as root, the command prompt should end with # instead of $., Once you've used su - to log in as root, you can run any commands that require root access. The su command is preserved until the end of the session, so you don't need to keep re-entering the root password every time you need to run a command.

, sudo (""super user do"") is a command that lets you run other commands as root temporarily. This is the best way for most users to run root commands, as the root environment is not maintained, and the user doesn't need to know the root password. Instead, the user will enter their own user password for temporary root access.Type sudo command and press ↵ Enter (e.g. sudo ifconfig). When prompted for the password, enter your user password, not the root password.

sudo is the preferred method for distributions like Ubuntu, where it will work even when the root account is locked.

Avoid running complex programs while logged in as root.",How to Become Root in Linux3," Logging in as root is not recommended for regular use, as it is very easy to perform commands that will render your system inoperable. Only log in as root when performing emergency repairs, such as dealing with disk failures or restoring locked accounts.


Using sudo or su instead of logging in as root will help prevent unintended damage while logged in as root. Using these commands gives the user a chance to think about the command before severe damage is done.
Some distributions, such as Ubuntu, leave the root account locked until you manually unlock it. Not only does this prevent users from unknowingly doing too much damage using the root account, it also secures the system from potential hackers, as the root account is typically targeted first. With a locked root account, hackers aren't able to gain access with it. See the previous section for instructions on unlocking root in Ubuntu.

, If the root account is unlocked and you know the password, you can log in as root when you're prompted to log in with a user account. Enter root as the user when prompted to log in.


If you need root access to perform a command, use the method in the previous section.

, After entering root as the username, enter the root password when prompted.


In many cases, the root password may be ""password.""
If you don't know the root password, or have forgotten it, see the next section for instructions on resetting it.
In Ubuntu, the root account is locked and cannot be used until it has been unlocked.

Look into the files README and INSTALL that should be at the top folder in the downloaded project.,
Some projects provide the build script as a shell script (usually named build.sh).,
Search for the file called configure which also must be present in a project top folder.,
Search for the file called makefile which may be initially present or appear after you run configure.,
If there is no configure nor makefile in the project tree, it may be an ant - powered project with the build.xml file instead.,
If ant doesn't work either, or the project is C or C++, try running ./autogen.sh to create the configure and makefile files.,

Otherwise, proceed to the following steps.

, It is usually a .sh script that will tune the project build system to your machine. If you find it, type ./configure or sh configure to run this script. ./configure usually has a lot of options that may help if the ""default"" run fails with error messages. Run the script with the key --help to see the options. If there is no configure script, it may be an old - style project which only uses make files, so you can proceed directly to the next step.

, If you find it, type the command make. It should find the make file in the current directory and build the project for you., In this case, type ant in the project root folder. While make is more popular for C and C++ projects, ant is popular for java projects., This uses autoconfigure, automake and libtool to create these files.

If you wish to split a non-system partition, use GParted, a powerful utility to built for editing hard drives. This article gives a detailed tutorial on how to split a partition.
If you need to split your system partition, you will need to live boot another system from a USB. Ubuntu OS contains GParted pre-installed, so go ahead and download the ISO file from here. Then, after you complete the ISO download, follow this article to make your USB bootable using a ISO file. Then restart your computer and boot from your USB drive. Launch GParted from the Live USB and continue to step 2.;
, Open GParted, then select the partition you wish to partition and unmount it. Right-click the partition and click Resize/Move. Then resize the partition to be at least 1 GB smaller. Then select the unallocated space, right-click it, and format it as linux-swap. After you have finished, click Apply in the top toolbar. Depending on the size of your partitions and the speed of your computer, this process could take quite a while. This article will give you a more detailed guide in how to resize a partition in Linux.

, This can by done using the terminal, so launch the terminal. The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Alt+T. Then type in the following command: sudo blkid /dev/sda3, assuming that the swap partition you created is sda3. To verify your partition path, open GParted and check your swap partition. It should be located under the Partition column. After giving the above command, press ↵ Enter. You will be required to provide an administrator password. The UUID code will be displayed; copy the code to a notepad or something.

, Check underneath the last message you sent.

, Many users have read receipts turned on, so if you no longer see ""Read at..."" underneath your sent messages you might have been blocked, or the person may have turned off read receipts.

, If you used to see ""Delivered"" when messages were sent and no longer do, you might have been blocked.


The ""Delivered"" receipt is known to show inconsistently, so this method may not always be reliable., Using a test phone call is one of the more reliable indicators as to whether or not someone has blocked you.

, If you hear exactly one ring and are then sent to voicemail, you may have been blocked.


Just because your call goes straight to voicemail doesn't mean you have been blocked. Your contact's phone may be dead.

, If you receive the same result after calling a couple times, it's a good indicator that the person you're trying to reach has blocked you or has a dead phone.


Users are not notified if they are receiving a phone call from a blocked number.

, You can use a masked number to double check the status of another person's phone.

, Doing so will start a call without your contact information appearing to the recipient.

, Many people avoid answering calls from blocked numbers, but if you hear the call going through like a normal call should, you may have been blocked.


If the call goes directly to voicemail after one ring, your contact's phone may be dead.

This stands for Digital Living Network Alliance and is a standard for streaming content over local media devices. Press and hold Windows key and hit R. A small box will open in the lower left-hand side of your screen. Type in “wmplayer” and hit Enter. Windows Media Player (WMP) should then start.;
, Once WMP starts, you should see a series of three different options in the upper left-hand corner of the window. These options are “Organize,” “Stream,” and “Create playlist.” Click the down arrow to the right of the Stream option to bring up a drop-down menu. You should see an option called “Turn on media streaming…” Click this and a new window should open with a button near the top that says “Turn on media streaming,” and there should be a little shield icon to the left of it. Click this to continue.

, The page should now show a series of different options. At the very top, you will see an area that says “Name your media library.” Click inside the box and rename the library to something more specific. When you are streaming content over your network,, you will want to know which device the content is streaming from. The other options in this area will should configure automatically, so click “OK” to continue.


If you are connected to a Homegroup, you may have a “Next” button in the lower right-hand corner instead of a “OK” button. Click “Next”, and a small window should pop up and give you a series of different libraries that you can share with the homegroup. There should be a total of five: Pictures, Videos, Music, Documents, and Printers & Devices. These will each have a drop-down menu to the right. Click the drop-down box and choose either “Shared” or “Not Shared” to adjust each permission. After choosing “Shared” while joined to a homegroup, this library will become available to all other Windows devices on the homegroup as well. Click “Next” and a new screen should appear and display the current homegroup password. Click the “Finish” button to continue on.

, Back inside of WMP, open the Stream menu again and select the “Allow remote control of my player” option from the list. A small window will appear with two different options inside of it. These should be “Allow remote control on this network” and “Do not allow remote control on this network”; click the top option to enable this feature.


Many media players on mobile devices will have the option to be a remote control as well, so having this enabled is just a good idea. You won’t have to worry about enabling the option in the future, should you want it. You will be able to control media playing on the remote media server as well, basically using your mobile device as a remote control (Play, Pause, Stop, Skip, etc.). This is limited to the features of the application you are using.

, On your device, open up your app drawer and scroll through until you see the Google Play icon. It should look like a white shopping bag with a play icon inside of it. Tap to open. At the top, you should see a search bar. Tap and enter “UPnPlay” then hit either the return key on your on-screen keyboard or tap the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner.


The very first result should be the app you're looking for. The icon will have the Android icon inside it with 3 different remote control icons below it. Tap the 3 dots in the upper right-hand corner of the white box that it’s in. Tap “Install” and hit “Accept,” then wait until it's finished.

, The best part of this particular app is that it is simple to use. Simply pull down the notification bar and tap the UPnPlay icon. As soon as the app opens, give it a few seconds to find the DLNA media server on your Windows PC. As soon as it does, it will be listed on the front page. It should be listed as “PC-Name:email@address.com,” or “PC-Name:Username” for Windows 7 devices or local accounts on Windows 8 or higher. When you named your media library earlier, the email address or username will be replaced by that. Once it appears, continue to the next step.

, Tap on your Windows PC media server. Once you do, it should load a series of available libraries (Music, Pictures, Playlists, Videos, and Search). Music will always load faster than video will, so try testing some music from the server first. Tap “Music,” then “All Music,” and wait until it loads.

, Press and hold on a song, and select “Play Track” from the list that appears. It should be the top option. Wait until the track starts playing, and if it doesn’t, hit the Play button. You should hear your music, and if you do, hit the little disc button in the lower left-hand corner, then the yellow arrow twice to return to the main menu.

, Now that you know the streaming will work, you can now select the video you would like to stream. You can play a video the same way you played music when you tested the streaming. Enjoy!

, From the home screen of your Windows Phone, swipe in from the right, and scroll through until you find the Store app. Tab to open and hit the search icon at the bottom center. Type in “smart player” and hit the enter key in the lower right hand corner.


The top result should be what you are looking for. A simple black icon with white around the outside and a white play button inside. Tap, then tap install in the bottom left. Wait for it to finish downloading and installing. Then hit “View” in the lower left corner. Then tap to open it from the given list.

, On the main menu, you should see a whole series of different streaming options. Scroll down to the bottom of the list until you see your media server listed. You should see “PC-Home: Username(Email Address)” listed. Tap to load the libraries page. You should see Music, Pictures, Players, and Videos. Tap “Videos” to continue.

, You should now see a series of different options. Tap “All Videos” to see a list of all videos, then tap on any video. Now comes an interesting feature of this app. You can choose an available network player from the screen in front of you. The top option should be your current device, and then every other option below should be a network-connected device with a media player running. Select a player and then you should see a series of different remote control options at the top of the screen. Tap “Play” to start the video.


Please note that in order to use a network media player, that player will have to be open on the device. So if you want to play a video on your Windows PC in another room, you will need to have it open and keep it open to have it appear in the network-connected players list.

For those who are very committed to having a customizable iPhone, this is perhaps one of the best options. However, it isn't for everyone.Check if jailbreaking your iPhone will void its warranty. Unless you are very experienced with jailbreaking, you may want to wait to jailbreak your iPhone until the Apple warranty expires 1 year after purchase. Apple has attempted to create an environment that--because it is highly regulated--is safe for virtually all users. You don't have to worry about malware or scams like you would without the protections provided by Apple restrictions., Make sure you have a backup of your files before you make any switch, just in case anything bad happens.


Update iTunes to its latest version.
Back up your iPhone on iTunes and/or with use of a cloud.
Select a jailbreak program. Programs like RedSn0w or RageBreak are options. You should research the newest and best programs for jailbreaking your iPhone model. There are a number of options out there, but determining which is best can be tricky unless you know people who have had success with one particular program. These are, after all, not Apple-approved programs and thus have not been professionally vetted.
Many of these programs are updated to work on particular versions of iOS and not on later varieties (often because Apple intentionally alters the operating system to prevent jailbreaks). It is very common that, for example, a program can work on iOS 8.1.1 but not 8.1.2. There should be information available discussing what the program can and cannot do.

, You will actually have to download the file to a separate computer in order to complete the jailbreak process.


Download a jailbreak program onto your computer.
Install the program onto your computer. Remember, it may provide you a passcode to use later. Do record it and keep it at hand.
Download the latest iOS firmware. You can find the firmware file . When you run the jailbreak program as an administrator, you will need to select this firmware file.

, Check that your phone and computer are connected to the same wireless connection.

,


Place the iPhone in device firmware upgrade (DFU) mode. (To put the iPhone in DFU mode, you should hold down the Power button for 3 seconds. Then, hold the Home button down with the Power button for 10 seconds. Release the Power button while keeping the Home button down.) Turn off the phone and connect it to the computer. Then, you will prepare to place the programs you just downloaded on the iPhone.
The jailbreak program should activate on your iPhone. Release the home button on the phone. Wait for the iPhone to reboot.
After the jailbreak tether is activated, you will be asked to place it in DFU mode again. Your iPhone may need to reboot a few times.
Find the IP address your iPhone uses. It is listed in the Settings app in the Wi-Fi area.
Launch the terminal on your computer. Type the following command: “ssh root@<IP address>.” (Type your iPhone’s IP address between the brackets).
Type the password that was given to you when you installed the jailbreak program.

, Cydia is an application that will allow you to download new programs to your iPhone after the jailbreak. Some jailbreak programs will automatically install Cydia, and so there is no need to install it separately. If the program that you used did not, then type the following code into your Terminal: ""wget -q -O /tmp/cyinstall.sh http://downloads.kr1sis.net/cyinstall.sh && chmod 755 /tmp/cyinstall.sh && /tmp/cyinstall.sh.""

, You should have a Cydia app on your Home screen.

, Search for a program that will allow you to customize substantial parts of the iPhone interface, such as text or iMessage colors. Two of the most common options are Winterboard and Dreamboard, but others exist as well. Install it to your iPhone. A new app should appear on your home screen., Check the mark next to the message bubble colors you want to use. There are a number of colors you can use with outgoing and incoming messages."

Create a network security key.,
Add computers to your network.",How to Configure Internet Access for a Laptop," If your modem wasn't set up for you by your Internet service provider (ISP), follow the instructions that came with your modem to connect it to your computer and the Internet.


If you're using Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), connect your modem to a phone jack.
If you are using cable, connect your modem to a cable jack.
For more information, see Set up a broadband (DSL or cable) connection.;
, Put your wireless router somewhere where it will receive the strongest signal with the least amount of interference. For the best results, follow these tips:


Position your wireless router in a central location. Place the router as close to the center of your home as possible to increase the strength of the wireless signal throughout your home.
Position the wireless router off of the floor and away from walls and metal objects, such as metal file cabinets. The fewer physical obstructions between your computer and the router's signal, the more likely that you'll be using the router's full signal strength.
Reduce interference. 802.11g networking equipment uses a 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) radio frequency. This is the same frequency as most microwaves and many cordless phones. If you turn on the microwave or get a call on a cordless phone, your wireless signal might be temporarily interrupted. You can avoid most of these issues by using a cordless phone with a higher frequency, such as 5.8 GHz.

, Security is always important; with a wireless network, it's even more important because your network's signal could go beyond the boundaries of your home. If you don't secure your network, people with computers nearby might be able to access the information stored on your network computers and use your Internet connection to get onto the web. To help secure your network, do the following:


Protect your router by changing the default user name and password. Most router manufacturers have a default user name and password on the router as well as a default network name. Someone could use this information to access your router without you knowing it. To avoid that risk, change the default user name and password for your router. Check the information that came with your device for instructions.

, Just as file cabinets have keys and safes have combinations, wireless networks have a network security key to help protect them from unauthorized access. To set up a network security key, follow these steps:


1. Open Network and Sharing Center by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type network, and then click Network and Sharing Center.
2.Click Set up a new connection or network.
3.Click Set up a new network, and then click Next.The wizard will walk you through creating a network name and a security key. If your router will support it, the wizard will default to Wi‑Fi Protected Access (WPA or WPA2) security. We recommend that you use WPA2, if possible, because it offers better security than WPA or Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security. With WPA2 or WPA you can also use a passphrase, so you don’t have to remember a cryptic sequence of letters and numbers. For more information, see different How to secure your wireless network.

, Write down your security key and keep it in a safe place. You can also save your security key on a USB flash drive by following the instructions in the wizard.


Use a firewall. A firewall is hardware or software that can help protect your computer from hackers or malicious software. Running a firewall on each computer on your network can help control the spread of malicious software on your network, as well as help to protect your computers when you're accessing the Internet.

, To connect your laptop or desktop computer to your wireless network, follow these steps:


1. Open Connect to a Network by clicking the network icon (a picture of the wireless network icon or Picture of the wired network icon) in the notification area.
2. In the list of networks, click the network that you want to connect to, and then click Connect.
3. Enter the security key. You can either type in the key or insert a USB flash drive that contains the security key into a USB port on the computer.

Uninstall unused applications.,
Clear out unnecessary items on your desktop.,
Disable widgets.,
Remove unneeded programs from the startup list.",How to Speed up Your Mac1," Keeping your software and operating system up to date will make sure that your system is secure and running at its best. When software is updated, oftentimes the performance of the software can increase. Staying updated and secure will also help keep malicious files from slowing down your computer.


Open the Mac App Store and switch to the ""Updates"" tab. This will check for available updates for your operating system and any applications that you've installed through the App Store.
On older Macs, click the Apple menu and select Software Update. The program will check the internet for any available updates for your installed applications and your operating system.;
, While they may not be actively running, unused applications take up storage space. This can be an issue if you are running out of room on your hard drive, as low free space can decrease performance.


To uninstall applications, you normally just need to drag them from Finder to the trash can. This will leave behind old files and preferences, however, which can bog down your system. If you are sure you won't need to reinstall the application sometime in the future, use an uninstaller application to completely remove old programs. There are many free and paid applications available to do this.

, Having too many icons on your screen can negatively impact your computer’s performance as Mac OS X dynamically generates each of the thumbnails and must store the previews in the RAM. The impact may be small, but can be noticeable if you have a large number of icons.

, If you are using the Dashboard and widgets, you may be eating up your system’s memory. Widgets are mini-programs that are constantly running in the background. Because of this, they are a small but constant drain on your system resources.


Disable individual widgets by opening the dashboard and clicking on the - button (Yosemite) or the + button (older operating systems). Click on the x button at the top left of a widget to disable it.
Disable the entire Dashboard by opening System Preferences, clicking on Mission Control, and setting the Dashboard to ""Off"".
For operating systems older than Yosemite (OS X 10.10), you can disable Dashboard through Terminal. Open your Applications folder and then open Utilities. Select Terminal. In the Terminal, run the following commands:defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled –boolean YES
killall Dock

Use a system cleaner.",How to Speed up Your Mac2," Keeping your hard drive clean and error-free is a great way to keep your Mac running smoothly. While you can go through your hard drive file by file to find things to delete, there are programs that will simplify the process.


Two such programs are Disk Inventory X and DaisyDisk, both of which will graphically portray how much of your hard disk space is being taken by what kinds of files. You can then use the program to clean out specific files from your computer.

, If you typically only use one or two languages with your Mac, you can remove the other language files to free up a substantial amount of hard disk space. To do this, you will need a program called Monolingual. This program is free and open-source, and older versions support older operating systems.


Removing the English language files from Mac OS X can cause it to malfunction.

, Regularly checking your hard disk can catch errors before they become a serious issue. OS X comes with a hard disk verification tool. You can access it by opening your Applications folder and then the Utilities folder. Select Disk Utility.


Select your hard disk from the frame on the left. In the main frame, click the First Aid tab, and then click the Verify Disk button. Disk Utility will then begin checking the disk. The results will be displayed in the readout frame. The check process may take a while, especially if you have a large drive.
Repair a damaged disk. If Disk Verification says that the disk has errors, click the Repair Disk button in the First Aid tab. Disk Utility will attempt to repair the errors. If the errors are serious, the hard drive may need to be replaced. There are other programs that will help with repairing the hard drive. Some of these options are Drive Genius or Disk Warrior.

, There are a variety of system optimizers available for both free and for purchase. These programs will optimize your applications and remove old, unused files. Some of the more popular options include CCleaner and Onyx

Purchase more memory.,
Determine what RAM will work in your Mac.,
Open the computer.,
Eject the old RAM.,
Install the new RAM.,
Reboot your computer.",How to Speed up Your Mac3," Depending on your computer model, you may be able to add more RAM (Random Access Memory). RAM allows programs to store information into quickly accessible memory, which increases the speed at which programs can operate.

, Different systems will require different types of RAM. MacBooks will use different RAM than desktop Macs, and different models will use different speeds. Be sure to research what type of memory to purchase for your model, as well as if you can actually add more.


To find out how much memory you have installed, as well as the speed of the memory, click the Apple menu and select About This Mac. This will open a window showing your installed version of OS X, your processor, and your memory.
This screen does not tell you how much memory your system will support. Typically you can install up to 4GB, though there are some models of MacBooks that only support up to 2GB. Be sure to double check your documentation to see how much memory you can use.
If you have 2GB installed, and you want to install another 2GB, it may not be as simple as buying one stick of 2GB memory and inserting it. Chances are that you have two slots for RAM, and that each of these currently has a 1GB stick installed. In order to upgrade to 4GB, you would need to purchase 2 2GB sticks.

, If you are installing MacBook memory, you will need to remove the back casing from the laptop. Be sure to note which screws belong to which holes, because some of the screws may be different sizes. If you are upgrading a desktop computer, you will need to remove the case so you can access the components.


When working with components inside the computer, be sure to discharge any static electricity by touching the bare metal of the laptop casing.

, If you are uninstalling MacBook RAM, the RAM slots will have metal ejection levers on the side. Press these in to pop the existing RAM up at an angle. Pull the RAM straight out by gripping the notches on the side and pulling firmly. If you are removing desktop RAM, the slots are vertical, and the latches are plastic and located on each end.

, If you are installing MacBook RAM, insert it in at the same angle that it ejected. Install memory into the lower slot first, then the upper slot. Push firmly with even pressure directly into the slot until the stick clicks into place. If you are installing RAM for a desktop, insert it straight into the slot and push evenly until the stick clicks into place.

, You can verify that the RAM was installed correctly by clicking the Apple menu and selecting About This Mac. Verify that the correct RAM total is displayed. If it is not, you may have incorrectly installed the RAM, or installed the wrong type.

Brainstorm!,
Choose an overall color scheme.,
Buy a laptop skin.,
Decide if you want any stickers or decals.,
Choose your desktop wallpaper.,
Choose your screensaver.,
Decide if you want a mouse or a mouse pad.,
Look over your finished computer.,
Give yourself a pat on the back, then show off your computer to all your jealous friends!

",How to Accessorize Your New Mac Laptop," What are your favorite colors? Designs? Shapes? What do you want to be seen on your laptop? Your laptop can be an expression of yourself, so make it accurately reflect you. Choose a design because you like it not because it's popular.;
, For example, if you like blue, then everything, your wallpaper, your cover skin, your screensaver etc. should have a bit of that color. Having one overall color links everything up and makes your computer look more whole.

, These fit right on your laptop, come in color, and protect it from scratches and other everyday wear and tear. You can find them at an Apple store, or even order them online, at Speck. The cool thing about Speck is you can choose the model of your laptop, so you're guaranteed that it will fit perfectly. You can also find the model at Speck, then order on eBay. Other sites also have skins though they might not be organized by model. Keep in mind your color scheme when choosing the color.

, If you do, choose something that represents you. Unless you got a clear cover, realize that you will probably have to put the sticker on top of the cover-skin, so choose one that is durable. Make sure you like it; some of the stickers are permanent or hard to take off.

, Your wallpaper should be something you like, because this is what you're going to be looking at every day. If you feel the options on your computer are too limiting, Google ""free mac wallpaper"" or a similar phrase. You'll find many sites which offer free abstract backgrounds as well as other cool designs. Keep in mind your color scheme when you look at different backgrounds.

, Your computer usually comes with some pretty cool screensavers, but if you want to get one online, it's the same as finding a wallpaper. Remember your color scheme, but a screensaver is the least important factor in your color scheme since it won't be seen most of the time.

, Choose those according to your color scheme.

, Is there anything you want to change? Remember, this is your computer, so you should make it look the way you want. Also remember: it doesn't have to stay the same; your computer's look can evolve. If you want to add a sticker, or change your desktop, feel free. Your overall look doesn't have to remain constant; just as your personality changes, your computer's look should.

Determine your operating system.,
Determine your computer's available resources.,

Ponder how you want your desktop to look.,
Ask yourself if there are any special programs you plan to run.,
Determine if speed is a factor.,
Figure out whether or not there is a specific theme that you want.,
Decide if you want a floating window manager (the kind used by most people).",How to Choose Your Window Manager," Microsoft Windows can support LiteStep, SharpE, Blackbox and KDE 4. Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD etc.) can support FVWM, Blackbox, Enlightenment, KDE and GNOME.;
, The simpler (lighter) a window manager, the less resources it consumes. But the lighter the window manager, often the less ""eye candy"" and appeal there is in its appearance.


For computers with little memory available, a light window manager like Fluxbox, Enlightenment (Unix-like systems only) or FVWM (Unix-like systems only) would be ideal.
For computers with a lot of resources and that aren't running memory-intensive programs or tasks, something bigger like KDE or GNOME (Unix-like systems only) would be better for looks.

, Power users may want something lighter and faster, while the senior citizen might want something easy to navigate such as Ubuntu Netbook Launcher.

, If you want it to look good, then you want something with a lot of eye candy (Enlightenment or Compiz or KDE 4 with its new plasma interface will satisfy) but if you want something extremely plain and basic you want something like Blackbox.

, Larger window managers like KDE and GNOME come with applications like office suites, CD Burners, and media players. But these added features can add a lot of weight to the desktop. Remember that some programs (e.g. Amarok, Konqueror, KOffice, Kontact, digiKam, K3b) only work if a certain window manager is installed.

, A larger window managing system consumes more memory, resulting in slower execution time. But a lighter system will launch the program somewhat faster.

, Themes may be specific to certain window managers.

, A tiny few expert users may want a tiling window manager such as AwesomeWM or one with support for multiple key bindings or one based around the keyboard like Ratpoison.

It may be helpful to Google for this setting as well (""Dropbox start up settings"", etc.).;
, How many programs start automatically really won't have a huge effect on your computer. What really matters is how much processing power they take up. Take a look at how much processing power they're using and find the biggest culprits. Those are the programs you should stop from starting automatically.


For Windows computers, you can look into this by opening the task manager (ctrl+alt+del) when the computer first boots and look at which programs are sucking up the most processing power.

, You should always do a little homework before you stop a program from starting when you boot up your computer. Certain programs are necessary to the normal function of your computer and stopping them can cause serious harm. Don't remove anything unless you know exactly what it is. Google is your friend.

, There are many unofficial utilities or programs which will tell you that they can streamline the process of changing your startup programs, and they may work. However, you should always be extremely cautious of free programs or even paid programs which come from places other than your computer or OS's manufacturer. Read the directions below to find out how to change the startup programs without risking getting a virus or otherwise compromising your system.


One program which is generally reliable and safe is CCleaner, which you should always download from a reliable, safe source like CNet. Go to Tools->Startup to change the programs.

Once you have changed the boot order, you must make sure whatever device you are going to boot from is inserted/connected.,Restart Your Computer

,
If you have successfully changed the boot order to the correct device, restarting your computer should cause it to boot from that device.",How to Boot from a Drive,", that contains the necessary files for a boot.


If you have your original Windows or Mac operating system CD, this will work. You will be able to use that disk to boot up after reading this article.
It is also possible to make a bootable USB drive. This is a separate process that requires downloaded software.
Once you have your boot device ready, you can begin the process.

,, This menu is where you can change basic computer settings - including how the computer boots up.


When you first turn on your computer, the screen usually displays what key you can use to access the BIOS, usually Del or F2.
Once you know the key to press, restart your computer and repeatedly press that key as your computer comes to life. The BIOS menu should appear. It will look much different than your desktop - usually a fairly simple full-screen options menu.
If you see the Windows Logo appear, you are too late; restart the computer and try again.

,, You will essentially be telling your computer to read a CD or flash drive upon starting up, rather than accessing data in its hard drive. BIOS menus differ slightly from one to the other, but it is usually easy to find the boot-up options.


Navigate the menu using the arrow keys on the keyboard - your mouse will not usually work on this screen. If you are using a USB keyboard and can't navigate the menu, you will have to use a standard PS/2 keyboard.
In one of the tabs, there should be an option to specify your boot device. Look for a setting that says Boot Order, First Boot Device, Boot Management, or something similar and select it.
The screen will show a list of devices that your computer can boot from. Change this setting so that the device of your choosing is at the top of the list.
Make sure you have the right drive prioritized. Some computers have multiple CD/DVD drives (usually named D: or E: or F:). The one you pick must be the drive you are using for your CD.

,,

If using a CD/DVD, insert into the drive selected.
If using a USB drive, make sure it is plugged in to your computer.

,,

If successful, you will be able to see the boot menu of respective operating system. Just follow the steps shown on the screen to boot your system.
If this isn't working, try entering the BIOS again and making sure the drive you are using is at the top of the priority list.

Make sure that you are near your Bluetooth device when trying to pair your iPhone with it.;
, Before you can pair your iPhone, the device needs to be powered on. Also consider that you might need to look for a special Bluetooth setting on the device, if the technology does not automatically turn on when the device does.


It is possible that you will need to turn on the Bluetooth technology with a button or switch. Examine the device carefully for this option.
If your Bluetooth device is another smartphone or a computer, you will need to open the device's Settings and search for the Bluetooth settings to turn on the technology.
You should ensure that your Bluetooth device is fully charged or that it has new batteries, in some cases. You will not be able to pair if the device powers off during the pairing process.

, If you do not see pairing mode as an option, then you will need to look for the option to make the device “discoverable.”


Being “discoverable” means that other Bluetooth devices can pair to this device if they are in range of it. When devices search for nearby Bluetooth devices, yours will populate on their lists.
If it is a device that has the Bluetooth technology turn on automatically when it powers on, you likely will not have to search for this setting.

, In order to get into the Settings, you need to unlock your iPhone.


Press the Home button and then hold your thumb over it so that the Touch ID technology can scan your fingerprint.Alternatively, you can type in your 4-digit passcode to unlock it once you press the Home button.

, The Settings app is a gray icon with a symbol on it that looks like a cog. Upon finding it, tap it with your finger to open it.

, Once your Settings app is open, the Bluetooth setting should be toward the top of the list, near Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi, and Cellular. Tap it to navigate into the next page, which will allow you to access the Bluetooth settings.

, One option should appear on the next screen, and that is to turn on the Bluetooth technology with a slider. Tap the slider with your finger, and the dot will slide to the right, while the background of the slider turns green.You may briefly see the loading symbol, which is a series of small dashes in the shape of a circle.
Once the Bluetooth is turned on, you will see a message below the slider that reads, “Now discoverable as _____________'s iPhone.”

, Locate your device on that list once it populates.


Hopefully your device will be the only Bluetooth device that appears on the list. If other devices appear, be sure to know the brand name and possibly the model number of your device, as it will likely be named in that way on the list.

, Do so by tapping the device's name once it has appeared on the list of available devices.


You may be prompted to enter a password.Common factory-generated passwords include 0000, 1111, and 1234. Try any of these to see if it is accepted. If not, refer to the user's manual for the device; in some cases, like with computers, you may have to generate the password yourself.
Wait for the notification alerting you that your iPhone has paired with the Bluetooth device.

, Once you are paired and begin to use the device, you need to stay within range of it in order for it to continuing working. If you walk out of range, you may have to reconnect.Now that your iPhone and the device are paired, the device will always appear as a pairing option when you turn on the Bluetooth on your iPhone. You will not have to go through the process of pairing the two again in the future, unless you tell your iPhone to unpair or “forget” the device.

, In some cases, your iPhone might be too old for Bluetooth technology. This is usually the case with iPhone 4 and older, since all iPhone versions released after iPhone 4S are equipped with the Bluetooth technology., You may have turned on the device too late while your iPhone searched for available devices, or there might just be a bug in how it is working. Try restarting the device to see if this helps., On the other hand, your iPhone may be the reason why you cannot pair with the Bluetooth device. If you are still experiencing issues, try restarting your iPhone and then attempting the pairing again., Perhaps the reason your iPhone will not pair is because you have not installed the most recent iOS version.


Backup your iPhone to iCloud or iTunes and plug it into a power source. Next, connect your iPhone to Wi-Fi, if it is not already. Then, open your Settings app and tap General. After that, tap Software Update. If you have a software update available, tap Download and Install and enter your passcode. Your iPhone will restart when the installation is complete, and you will have to set up a few settings, like iCloud.Then, you can try reconnecting to Bluetooth.

, Make your iPhone “forget” or unpair the Bluetooth device, and put it back into discovery mode so that it will search for devices again. Then, reconnect to the Bluetooth device."

For almost all headsets, this is done by starting with the headset power off, then pressing and holding the multi-function button (the button you press to answer a call) for a few seconds. First, a light will blink showing you that the unit is on (keep holding the button) and a few seconds later, the LED on the headset will blink in alternating colors (often red-blue, but this can be anything). The blinking lights indicate that the headset is in pairing mode.
If your headset has a sliding on/off switch, slide it to the “on” position before pressing and holding the multi-function button. , The devices will need to be close to one another in order to pair.

Decide between earbuds or headphones.,

Finally, use your ears!",How to Choose Headphones,"


Earbuds are best for people who are short on space, but still want a way to listen to their music. The higher-quality earbuds, like from Sennheiser or Ultimate Ears, usually come with little cases to put your earbuds in when you're not using them, so they won't get ruined or dirty at the bottom of your bag. If you keep a very small purse and want to keep your iPod Nano and earbuds together in it, or you're a guy with limited pocket space, earbuds are probably a better choice. They're also great if you are on a limited budget, because there's a lot more to choose from and they tend to cost less.

Cheaper earbuds often run into problems like falling out of ears, hurting ears, or simply making dents in them from the cheap plastic. With higher prices (but still low-end in terms of quality) ranging from $25-50, you'll get more comfortable 'buds, and they are well-worth the money you spend. However, if you're an audiophile, you should consider other options. A pair of buds from Sennheiser (like the CX 500, $130), Shure (SE 115, $120), EtyMotic Research (HF5, $150), Sony (XBA-H1, $150), or even Ultimate Ears (minimum Super.fi 4) will be preferable.


Headphones are great if you enjoy putting them around your neck while you're walking from one place to another, or if you just carry your headphones that way. You also tend to get beefier cords and fun options like wireless/bluetooth headphones. The drawback is that good headphones within your budget might be hard to find. They take up more space than earbuds, and the DJ-style headphones take up a ridiculous amount of space if you don't carry around a larger bag.

DJ-style headphones are just that. Huge, bulky, awesome-looking headphones that are reminiscent of what you'd see someone named Double D mix his jams with. The structure lends itself to good sound containment but bad size usage. And a lot of music buffs get them because of the better sound quality and less pressure exuded on the eardrum, resulting in longer listening time and less damage to the eardrum.
Behind-the-neck headphones are exactly that as well, headphones with a connecting band that goes behind the neck instead of over the top of the head. This is recommended for joggers or people who wear hats a lot and also for sunglasses fanatics. Therefore, if you're a girl (or guy) with long hair, and you hate headphones that press your hair down or dislike headphones that irritate your ear piercings, this type would be a good choice. Besides that, there are very few things that separate them from DJ-style or ""regular"" headphones.

;
, Generally, more expensive headphones are made with higher quality materials and better engineering, improving the sound quality. $30 headphones will sound good, but not as good as $60 ones. Up in the $80-90 range, you may hear stuff in your music that you've never heard before. $9.99 bargain bin earbuds or headphones may last, at longest, a year, and will not sound great to begin with. So spending at least $20 on them insures you at least get basic music quality. One guideline is to spend $50 on portable headphones and $250 on a pair for a home stereo. Another thing you get with quality is durability. There are probably people out there with headphones from the 70's and 80's that still work because they're made well, and made to last. When you get a brand name you aren't just paying for the name sometimes; you're paying for the trusted quality.

, This refers to how well they keep music in and block outside noise. Nothing is more annoying than having to turn up your volume to drown out the sound of the bus. There's also the fact that if you're rather deaf, enjoy turning your music up loud, and/or use it to drown out background noise and the headphones are very open, you'll end up giving everyone around you something to gossip about. Sound isolation will also keep you from having to waste precious battery life or turn up the volume to hear properly.


Earbuds and in-ear headphones tend to be better at sound isolation, due to the seal they provide in your ear; and the same with (huge) DJ-style headphones that create a little sealed environment around the ear.
When buying over-the-ear stereo headphones, notice if they are open-backed or closed-backed. Open headphones tend to sound more natural and not distorted, but people will hear your music and you'll hear the environment around you. They're recommended for home and tend to be more comfortable. Closed headphones isolate noise better and sound more like the music is in your head, not in the environment. They tend to be less comfortable and have some reverberation from sound waves bouncing off of the closed, plastic back. Some people like closed-backed for the booming bass sound and isolation, while some prefer open-backed for the natural and precise sound.

, A wider frequency range means you can hear more from the music; large ranges such 10 Hz to 25,000 Hz will often be recommended - anything within that range will be fine.


More importantly, notice the sound curve, frequency response curve, sound signature, whatever you want to call it. If the low end is higher on the line graph, there will be more bass. This does not mean that the bass will be more precise or better. For example, Beats headphones tend to be very bass boosted, yet the bass is commonly described as muddy and boomy with no precision.
Typically, most headphones under $100 will have a U curve - meaning the mid-range is cut out. They may sound ""fun"" and pleasing to the ears at first, but you won't be able to analyze the layers of music easily. Flat response headphones don't favor any range, meaning you'll hear every layer of the music equally. However, the first impression if you're used to U curves is usually ""these have no bass"" or ""they sound boring"". Most people just need to grow into that sound signature to enjoy it.

, Anything less than around $200-250 isn't worth the price. Even if you're the frequent traveler type, noise-canceling, 90% of the time, just isn't worth the money. Some of your music might get canceled out as well, forcing you to turn up the volume. If you really do need noise reduction, however, look for brands like Etymotic, or Bose which have spongy earplugs that fill the ear canal.


A cheap way to cancel background noise might also be to just put over-ear hearing protectors (from the hardware store) over earbuds to cancel out most ambient noise. On the other hand, if you're not overly fussy, you may find lower priced noise-cancelling earbuds or headphones have considerable benefit for reducing background noise in airplanes, cars or public transportation. Panasonic (just one brand of many) makes an acceptable noise-cancelling earbud for just $50.

, The best way, really, to know if headphones can go loud enough for you is to test them out. Try on a friend's pair (if they're cool like that) or go to a good electronics store that will let you try on the headphones. Having around $200 in cash handy and going to a store with a 30-day return policy will make the electronics store your unwilling friend while you learn what types of headphones you really want. Out of courtesy, however, always clean the wax out of your ears before trying on any headphones or earbuds!

, To get the best out of your headphones, you should match the impedance of the headphones to the audio equipment you are using.This is measured in ohms. In reality if you don't this usually means that you will need to turn up the volume slightly compared to a matched pair of headphones.

, You are the person who is going to be using these headphones day in day out. If a $50 pair of headphones sounds the same as a $1000 pair of headphones, go for the cheaper pair. The sound quality is not going to change just because they are more expensive! The only thing to remember is the overall build quality of the headphones - are they going to last as long? Does it matter if they are that much cheaper?

, You may only need to be able to call people in your city or you may want to be able to call all over the country. Check rates for both. And consider using your cell phone for long distance (inside of USA) to keep your costs even lower.

, There are only a few options for landline home phone service in Texas cities, the largest being ATT. One of the cheapest discount providers is Section 8 Phone service, and they offer discounts for people on limited income. Expect to pay anywhere from $10 per month up to $60.

, Once you decide on a carrier, then sign up for service. Some carriers require a deposit while others do not. Pick the extra services you need like call waiting or caller ID among others. Just read the forms when signing up so you know the rates. Ask for any special offers too.

, When picking a phone device for the house, a handset, be sure to get a plain corded one and IF you want a cordless one. The corded one does not require regular home electricity and will work even if the electricity in the area goes out. Installation usually happens within 3 to 7 business days and may require some wiring inside of the house - so check with your service provider about their rates for inside wiring.

, Enjoy your services but be aware of long distance charges or any limits on minutes of talk time. Discuss it with your family members, especially children. You may even consider blocking long distance calls.

, Knowing that your children can call you from home and you can call them at home and that your phone will work even when the neighborhood's electricity is out is a good feeling.

Explain what happened.,
Answer questions concisely.,
Ask for a supervisor if you need more assistance.",How to Talk to a Vodafone Customer Care Executive," Call the Vodafone support number and go through the automated prompt until you reach the option indicating you would like to speak to an agent. In most areas, Vodafone Customer Care Executives are available to take your call from 8am to 9pm every day.The contact numbers vary depending on which country you are calling from. Check the Vodafone support website for the correct number in your area.
The main Vodafone customer support number is +44 7836 191 191.
You can also dial 191 from your Vodafone mobile phone.;
, The Vodafone website has a chat feature that allows you to contact customer care representatives online through their website. Simply visit the support page at https://www.vodafone.co.uk/contact-us/index.htm# and click on the chat icon. You will need to fill out a short form with your name, mobile number, and a brief description of your problem before they connect you to an agent.For business queries, Vodafone has a separate contact form that you can fill out online., Check online to find out where the closest Vodafone retail store is in your area. Stop by the store during business hours and ask to speak to a customer care representative.Sometimes visiting a store in person is the best way to handle a problem or dispute. It’s easier for customer care agents to refrain from being personally invested in your problem if they don’t have to interact with you face-to-face.

, In order to get your issue resolved, you may need to provide some documentation or proof of what has occurred. Before you make the call or visit the store, find your most recent Vodafone bill, the bill in question, and any receipts or other relevant documents you may have.The more prepared you are for the conversation, the more likely that your issue will be resolved.
You are also more likely to get resolution if you have more documentation to back up your query, whether it is a complaint or a question.

, People will be more willing (happy, even) to help you if are nice and attempt to connect with them as people. Treat the Vodafone agent with respect and kindness, just as you would treat a friend or other person in your life.Remember that the customer care agent is not directly responsible for your problem. It is their responsibility to help you resolve the issue, and you are more likely to get this done if they feel that you are being respectful and polite.
If you direct your anger at the Vodafone agent, it will probably make them want to end the conversation as quickly as possible. This means that you might not get the same level of service that you otherwise could have if you had made the experience more pleasant. Try to keep the conversation constructive by staying calm., Remember to write down all the details you can while you are conversing with Vodafone customer care. This will help you if you have to call back again, or if you need to speak to a manager.Write down the date and time of the call, the agent’s name and ID number (if available), as well as any pertinent details relating to the call.

, Once you have the Vodafone customer care representative on the line, recount the details of the problem in a clear, concise manner. Give an account of the facts, but only those that are directly relevant to the problem. A short, 30 second summary of the issue is all that is needed to begin with. You can go more in-depth later when prompted by questions from the agent.Try to leave out emotions when discussing the issue. Focus on the facts and work towards a resolution.

, In order to help the Vodafone agent do their job, you should try to answer their questions quickly and concisely. Provide specific information and leave out any emotional comments or unnecessary stories or anecdotes.Don’t speak over or interrupt the Vodafone agent. This will only slow the process down and make the agent frustrated. Let them ask their questions, and then answer them with the relevant details.

, If the person you’ve initially contacted doesn’t seem to have the authority, knowledge, or desire to resolve your issue, feel free to ask to speak to a supervisor. Supervisors have more authority to make decisions and resolve situations, especially when dealing with unhappy customers.Remain calm and polite when asking for a supervisor. Try saying something like, “I appreciate the help that you’ve provided me so far. But I think I need to speak to a supervisor to resolve this issue to my satisfaction.”

Determine if your number is eligible for porting.,
Understand why your number is ineligible.,
Do not cancel your old mobile phone service.,
Understand your financial obligations.,
Sign up for a new plan in store or online.,
Provide information about your old provider account during checkout.,
Allow your new provider to issue a number transfer request to your old provider.,
Wait for confirmation.",How to Port a Mobile Number," Prior switching to a new provider, make sure your current number is eligible for transfer. Check eligibility online with your old provider by entering your phone number and submitting a request.


If you are switching to AT&T, navigate to its “Transfer Your Number to AT&T” web page.
If you are switching to Sprint, navigate to its “WLNP: Check Eligibility” webpage.
If you are switching to Verizon, navigate to its ""Switch to Verizon and Keep Your Current Number” webpage.;
, There are two primary reasons why your phone number may be ineligible for porting: you are part of a family plan or your phone number was issued through work.


If you are part of a family plan, you must leave the family plan, establish your own plan with your current provider, and then port your mobile number.
If you have a work issued phone, you will not be able to port a number that is under your company's plan., Once you have decided to switch networks, do not cancel your old plan. Your number (and therefore your current plan) must remain active until the porting process is complete.

, When you switch providers, you may incur fees.


If you are terminating your plan early, you may have to pay a cancellation fee.
You will continue to pay for your current plan until your number is ported and the service is officially cancelled.
While AT&T, Sprint and Verizon do not charge a porting fee, other networks, such as Google Voice, do charge for this service. Aside from the fee, the porting process is not different.

, Do not cancel your current plan.


If you are not the primary account holder of your old account, you will need the primary account holder standing by.

, Whether you are starting the porting process in store or online, you will need to provide the following information:


Your phone number.
Your account number for your account with the old provider
Your account password or pin for your account with the old provider
Your Social Security number or Tax ID
Your billing name and addressInformation about your old account should be on any bill from your old provider. If you are starting this process in-store, bring the bill with you., After you provide the details about your old account, your new provider will take over the porting process. If the information you provided is incomplete or incorrect, a representative of new provider will contact you.

, Number transfer requests can take between 1 to 10 business days to process. While you await confirmation, your old phone will continue to receive calls and messages. Once you receive confirmation (via text message) that the porting process is complete, your old account will be terminated and your old phone will stop receiving messages and phone calls."

Try to resolve your issue using the normal channels but do not use 611 from your wireless phone.,

Avoid rude behavior, profanity or shouting at all times.,

Be Patient!,
In December 2008, the Verizon Wireless Pay-As-You-Go rates of 99 cents for a day of use plus 10 cents per minute, was the lowest pricing level, but Verizon Wireless customer service representatives insist you cannot change from a ""post-pay"" account to a ""pre-pay"" account without suffering a phone number change.,
Because Verizon wireless has an extensive number of billable features and options, a thorough reviewing of their detailed monthly bill deserves your attention.",How to Win a Complaint Dispute With Verizon Wireless," Dial 1-800-922-0204 from your home telephone only. Press 1 for English, and press 2 to speak with a rep. Enter your mobile number. Then press zero for an agent.;
, It is the best customer service on the planet when it comes to problem resolution. Customer service will allow you to speak to what they call supervisors however, they are just glorified customer support reps who will tell you anything to get you off the phone.

, The instance will be noted to your account. Once your account has been flagged it becomes very difficult to be heard, taken seriously or advanced to someone in management. From that point you are seen as a troublemaker or an abusive client and you will not receive the benefit of the doubt or more than the required common courtesy.


Try being overly polite and thankful. If you seem pleasant, thank even the lower people on the totem pole for listening, giving advice or just being pleasant about the situation they will be more inclined to advance your complaint.

, Ask them to verify the amount due. Once the agent has viewed your account and confirmed your balance, they have entered into the account database and this ultimately leaves an audit trail of who you have talked to and when.(if you are in one bill to get your balance you need to speak to residential, dial #BAL from your wireless phone, or visit verizon.com keep in mind verizonwireless.com and verizon.com are two different web sites)

, In many cases you will need to wait a day for a call back. That's alright, just be patient.(if you are a one bill customer and requesting credit on the wireless bill you will either need to wait until adjustment appears on next statement or place a claim with residential. when enrolled into one bill residential is paying the wireless bill on the customers behalf and forwards to you for the reimbursement. all payments are due to residential and not wireless when enrolled with one bill)

,, Tell them you would like to avoid the expense and hassle of Verizon having to send a legal representative to your town's court system.


You may want to make these calls when you can sit, take notes and wait on hold. Avoid calling when you are on the road or have something pending. You may get connected to management as you are running into a meeting or dropping the call.

, Underlings will often make promises to get you off the phone and not note your account of exceptions or agreements. Don't be ugly or snide but ask them to ""read the notes to the account to you"". Document the names, dates, and times involved in each conversation, of who you talked to and what was said. Get last names, case numbers and be diligent to write the information down.

, You do not need an attorney! It generally costs less than $240 to file a claim. Once you file, you will get a court date and Verizon Wireless will be notified the very same day you get your ""date"" in the mail.

, They will call you. Don't be greedy. If they (Verizon Wireless) have wronged you, they will make it right. If you are just being a pain in the butt, they, and the courts, will see right through you.

, Explore the In-pulse plan of theirs, but explore competitors plans also, to be familiar with available offerings in the cellphone marketplace.(customers are able to port a post-pay number to a pre-paid cell phone just keep in mind if you are in contract with a post pay number that by porting your number to a pre-paid phone will result in the breaking of that contract and can result in early termination fee)

,(you do have 120 days to dispute any billing)

, The best part about the new iCloud App is that it’s pretty easy to use, though that may be due to its limited functions (for now). Upon opening the app, you can already view your files and select them by tapping. When you select a file, you can choose to delete it, move it, or share it by tapping the icons on the top, similar to how the Photos app works.


You can’t actually edit the files using the iCloud Drive App at this point, just organize it, so if you want to edit it before synchronizing, you’re better off editing it from its app or from the computer itself.
All changes are reflected in your iCloud Drive in all devices.
You can also search for specific files using the search bar on top.

, Select a file to move to open it, and tap the move (folder) icon. A list of destinations in your iCloud will be displayed. Tap on the folder where you want to move the file.

, Select a file, and tap the trashcan icon at the top. Be careful as deleting from the app deletes the file from the iCloud Drive itself, and all apps synchronized with it.

, Select a file to share, and tap the AirDrop icon, which looks like a box with an arrow pointing upwards. A pop-up will appear; from this pop-up, choose which app or person you want to share it with.

Sharing the files from iCloud will just place a copy in the program you share it to.

,, iCloud Drive lets you store up to 5 GB worth of data for free, but for bigger storage you’ll need to subscribe to its storage plan, which is a monthly subscription. In Storage, tap the “Change Storage Plan” button, and browse the different offers.


The current monthly subscription choices are 20 GB for $0.99, 200 GB for $3.99, 500 GB for $9.99, and 1 TB for $19.99.

, Then when you have chosen one that you like, tap it and select the “Buy” option on the upper-right hand corner of the screen. You’ll automatically be charged through whatever your payment plan is, and an email will be sent to you by Apple to the email registered in your Apple ID. If you can’t pay, then iCloud will not let you edit, remove, move, or delete any files currently in it until you manage to pay."
