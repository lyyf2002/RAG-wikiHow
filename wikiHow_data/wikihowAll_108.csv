iPad - Mini 2/3/4, Air 2, Pro

iPod - 6th generation

, Make sure you click the link provided here rather than searching independently., It's the first link beneath the ""Yalu10.2 Beta 7"" heading on this webpage.

As of March 2017, there is no iOS 10.3 jailbreak. It will likely appear on the Yalu home page once it's available.

Linux (32 bit)
Linux (64 bit)

You should be able to find the Pangu app on one of your Home screens.

If you can't find Pangu, pull down on the middle of your screen and use the search bar to look it up.

, This is required to run the exploit that allows the jailbreak to work. Since your iOS device is in Airplane Mode, your photos won't be transferred anywhere., Once Pangu has access to your photos, the jailbreak will proceed. After the jailbreak completes, an app called ""Cydia"" will appear on the Home Screen.

, It may take a moment for the TaiG window to appear, but when it does, you should see your device listed there., You don't need this program for the jailbreak to work, and it can cause issues with the installation process.

Make sure you keep ""Cydia"" checked.

, The jailbreak will begin on your iOS device; you can monitor the percentage of the installation progress that has completed in the TaiG window.

, Once ""Jailbreak succeeded!"" displays in the TaiG window, you'll see Cydia--a brown box-shaped app--on your iOS device's Home Screen. Tapping it will begin finalizing the jailbreaking process., When you launch Cydia for the first time, it will configure its file system and then reboot your iOS device. Once your device reboots, the jailbreak will be complete., If you update your device to the latest version of iOS, you'll lose your jailbreak as well as your ability to revert to iOS 8., This is a free jailbreak utility released by the Pangu jailbreak developers.

To access the iOS 7.1 version of Pangu, click ☰ in the top-right corner of the page and then click for iOS 7.1.X.

, Doing so will open Pangu. You will see your device's name displayed in the Pangu window., This will begin the jailbreak process., Since iOS 7.1/7.1.2 are older than the current iOS version, you'll need to set your iOS device's clock back., The jailbreak process stalls at this point. Once Pangu is open, allow the app to run when asked to confirm., Your iOS device will reboot once Pangu is finished.

Be careful not to power down your iOS device or computer during this time.

, This is the App Store of your jailbroken device. Your iOS device will reboot after Cydia is finished configuring; once it finishes restarting, the jailbreak is complete., Do this from the official website to avoid viruses., Doing so will open it., A window will open, and you should see your device displayed in it.

If your device isn't plugged in, plug it in before continuing.

, This will begin the jailbreak process., You may get asked to put your device into DFU mode. Don't worry--this process will be explained to you in the on-screen window., Once the jailbreak finishes, your iOS device will restart itself., It's the brown app on the Home Screen. Tapping it will force your device to restart automatically after Cydia completes its initial setup., Once you see the ""Reloading Data"" box disappear, the jailbreak process is complete."

Look up the MFi cable's serial number.",How to Charge Your iPhone with an Unofficial Lightning Cable1," MFi (Made For iDevices) cables are certified by Apple to work with your iOS device, even if they aren't made by Apple itself. MFi-certified cables will not cause your iOS device to stop charging when you use them.


While MFi cables are cheaper than Apple cables, they still aren't inexpensive.;
, This box will be somewhere on the packaging of the cable you're trying to purchase; it will say ""Made for"" followed by the iOS devices it supports (e.g., iPhone, iPad, iPod) and their respective silhouettes. If you don't see ""MFi"" in the title of the cable and the ""Made for"" certification somewhere in the packaging, the cable won't work with your iPhone.


If you're shopping online and can't see the packaging, consider emailing the provider for more information.

, If recent reviews mention that the cable stopped working for a new release of iOS, the cable probably won't work.


In a traditional retail store, simply ask to talk to the tech department or customer service.

, If you see positive reviews outside of the site or store in which you found the cable, you should go ahead and purchase it. Otherwise, keep looking for an MFi-certified cable.


Some MFi cables that worked with one version of iOS cease working when your iPhone updates. For this reason, try to purchase a cable manufactured recently.

, To do so, simply hold down the Lock button until the white Apple icon appears on the screen. If your iPhone's battery life has increased at all, turn your iPhone back off and let it charge for the next couple of hours.


Depending on your iPhone's operating system and the cable type, this method may not work. If so, you'll need to buy an MFi-certified cable.

Figure out which of three categories of callers you fall into: ATA, IP Phones, and Computer-to-Computer.,
Adapt with an ATA or Analog Telephone Adaptor.,
Convert with IP Phones.,
Try it now with Computer-to-computer calls.,
Understand that with any of these VoIP ""phones"", if your internet goes down, your phone goes down.",How to Use VoIP,";
, This is the most common way of using VoIP. This adapter actually allows you to hook up the phone, which is already in your house, to your Internet connection. What the ATA does, is turn the normal analog signal that your average home phone sends into digital signals that can be sent over the Internet. Setting up an ATA is quite simple: Order an ATA, plug the cord from your phone (the one you normally plug into wall socket) into the ATA, and then an internet cord from the ATA into your router or internet connection. If you don't have a router you there are even ATA's that can do that for you as well. Some ATAs include software that has to be installed on your computer before it is ready to be used, but basically it is quite a simple process.

, The IP Phone looks just like a normal phone, with all the same buttons and cradle. The only difference is that instead of having a normal wall jack connector, it has an Ethernet connector. So, instead of plugging in your IP phone to the wall jack (like you would with a regular analog phone), it is plugged directly into your router. This option allows you more options like placing the call on hold and works just like any office phone you have probably ever used. The only difference is the calls are going over the internet rather then the normal phone line. It also means that you will not need an ATA because it is all built into the phone. In addition, with the availability of Wi-Fi IP phones, subscribing callers can make VoIP calls from any Wi-Fi hot spots. All these features make IP Phones an extremely exciting option.


If you want intercom office extensions in your home, or other countries, this is the way to go.

, With some service these calls are entirely free, meaning that there is no need for any calling plans. The only things you need are the software (which can be found for free on the internet), a good internet connection, a microphone, speakers and a sound card. Depending on which service you pick, except for your monthly internet service fee, there is literally no cost for making these calls, no matter how many you make. However, in most cases you will only be able to call people who have the same computer-to-comptuer calling service you have.

, 911 is affected, also.

Enjoy your new RAZR functionality!",How to Hack a Verizon RAZR v3m Mobile Phone," Motorola's v3m drivers for Microsoft Windows are required to connect your RAZR to a PC via a mini-USB cable. One approach is to download a ""USB Driver Tool"" and the ""USB Device Drivers"" from Hack the RAZR's site. For the latest version, download Motorola's EU Driver Installation from their developer's site. You will need to create a free account to get to this download page if you don't directly follow the link above.;
, For Motorola's official driver release, the extracted file is ""Motorola_EU_Driver_Installation_v?.?.?.msi"" (question marks represent digits of the version number), and for third party distributions, the extracted files should include eight .inf files and one .sys file.

, None of the v3m drivers are Microsoft-certified, so be sure you've obtained them from a reliable source before you continue.



Recommended install. This requires the official Motorola drivers from their developer site:

Launch the installer by double-clicking on the ""Motorola_EU_Driver_Installation_v?.?.?.msi"" file (question marks represent version number placeholders).

1st window: click the ""Next"" button.

2nd window: select the ""I Agree"" radio button if you agree to the license shown in the window, then click the ""Next"" button.

3rd window: click the ""Close"" button.

Connect your RAZR. Find a ""Type A"" USB to ""Type B"" Mini-USB cable. Connect the USB end to your PC, and the Mini-USB end to your RAZR. The Windows hardware wizard will show a series of notification balloons from the system tray as it detects and automatically installs drivers.

Alternative install. For drivers distributed by a third-party that have no installer:

Connect your RAZR. Find a ""Type A"" USB to ""Type B"" Mini-USB cable. Connect the USB end to your PC, and the Mini-USB end to your RAZR. This should prompt a hardware wizard to appear in Windows.

1st window: select ""No, not this time"" radio-button, then click on the ""Next >"" button.

2nd window: select ""Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)"" radio-button, then click on the ""Next >"" button.

3rd window: click on the ""Include this location in the search:"" check-mark box, enter the path to the downloaded p2k drivers, then click on the ""Next >"" button.

4th window: click on the ""Continue Anyway"" button. This only appears when Driver Signing is set to ""Warn"" in the ""System Properties"" > ""Hardware"" > ""Driver Signing"" options of Windows XP.

, Motorola's Product Support Tool version 7.2.5 is the latest as of this writing, but version 7.2.3 will also work with current p2k software. The PST software is intellectual property of Motorola, so no additional help or screen shots may be provided for obtaining the software.

, The p2k Seem Editor is a tool that provides a direct means of manually changing bits of a mobile device's settings. The program only needs be extracted from its archive to function, as it has no installer to run.
Originally found on HowardForums.com years ago, the original author and/or distributors have left no information to track the application's version or contributor history. Fortunately, the application is quite stable and reliable in its currently distributed form. Distributions of the application contain a Functions.csv file that assigns comments to specific seem bits, a hexedit.dll file, usually a readme.txt or .nfo file, and the p2kseem.exe program file.

, The Seem Editor is sectioned into three main interface groupings: the seem location, hexadecimal grid, and bit switches. To use the seem editor, values are manually entered into the seem location area in the bottom right corner of the window. This will provide search criteria when the ""Load from phone"" button is clicked. Upon a successful read, hexadecimal data will appear in the top left corner of the window. Clicking on any byte will show the appropriate data in the bit switching area at the bottom left corner of the window.


Load the p2k Seem Editor.
Enter 2742 into the ""Seem"" text box of the ""Load"" group.
Leave the ""Record"" text box of the ""Load"" group at the default value of 1 or 0001.
Enter 0000 into the ""Bytes (h)"" text box.
Click on the ""Load from phone"" button.
Rows of hexadecimal values should appear in the upper left corner. If you received a connection error, close the Seem Editor and reset the connection with PST by creating a new phone book, then load phone's data into the new phone book.
Locate the row designed by the number 000060.
Click on the 11th column of dual digit hexadecimal values on this row. The ""Offset"" will read 006a in the ""Selected byte details"" group. Alternatively, click on the first column of row 000060 and use your keyboard's arrow keys to navigate right until ""Offset"" reads 006a.
""Bit 0"" in the ""Selected byte details"" group should have a comment next to it: ""Bluetooth Or USB file transfer..."". Put a check next to ""Bit 0"" (comment's suffix will change to ""on""), and a check next to ""Bit 1"".
Double-check your bit changes and an offset value still showing 006a. Verify that the ""Save"" group and ""Load"" group check boxes' values match. Ignore the text alignment of the text box contents.
Click on the ""Save to phone"" button.
Click on the ""Yes"" button.
Change is complete. Unplug your phone from the USB connection and power cycle it for the changes to take effect.
Search for other seem edits online to change settings that would otherwise be unavailable in Verizon's modified RAZR operating system.

, Popular file transfer utilities include Mobile Phone Tools, BitPim, and P2k Commander. Find one that works best for your tastes. None of these applications are perfect, but each offers a different twist of functionality. P2k Commander is often touted as the easiest and most straight-forward of p2k-based file transfer utilities, even though it is full of bugs and coded with poor error handling.
P2k Commander is authored by an individual from Hungary, with contributors from all over the world. As of this writing, the current version is 4.9.E.
Once you're comfortable with one, you should be able to browse, copy, and delete files, as well as view individual file and storage information.

, Now you'll be empowered to use all of your RAZR's features. Insert a 1GB flash card in your v3m and treat your phone as a camera, thumb drive, and MP3 player, all in one device. Enable Java and download Java apps to your RAZR (Brew-based Java apps only). Enjoy the new-found freedom of a completely unlocked mobile device.

Find out if your internet connection is ""VOIP-ready"".,
Look at your phone bill to see how much you're paying in services and what services you really need such as call waiting, call forwarding, three way calling, caller ID, etc.,
Research several different VOIP providers to find out which has the features that you need or desire for the best price.,
Look at the money back guarantee, contract term, and equipment return policies.,
If you are using DSL, be aware that you may not be able to cancel your phone service.,
Look into number portability for the provider that you're considering.,
Order your VOIP service and enjoy all of the fancy phone features for free that you would normally pay an arm and a leg for through your local phone provider.

",How to Choose a VOIP Service Provider," Most of the time when people are unhappy with VOIP service it's not the fault of the service itself, but the internet connection of the subscriber. Go to voip speed test and run some of the call quality tests there to see if your connection is fast enough to support VOIP.;
, Jot down your total amount paid each month for services. If you're looking to VOIP to save you money, consider how much it would cost you to lose ""bundled services"" such as DSL, and Television if you were to cancel your landline phone service.

, Google Talk (http://talk.google.com) and Skype offer both free and paid services.

, Make sure that any service provider that you're considering has at least a 30 day guarantee. If they don't offer a guarantee then don't even consider them. All of the major providers offer a solid guarantee. Be sure you understand the contract term and know how long you are committing  yourself too. Watch out for ""FREE"" ploys which lock you into a long term contract or charge you for the equipment when you cancel service. No contracts required for some service provides.

, Most phone companies will offer a ""metered service"" that you will pay for per call. Since you're going to be using VOIP, you will not be making many (if any) calls over your copper line, only running DSL over it. It's really essential to look into metered service if you're using DSL. After all, why would you want to pay for a standard line if you're going to be paying for VOIP?

, If you need to keep your current phone number then don't consider a provider that cannot let you keep your current number.

Look out for range of services offered by different providers.,
Compare different costs.,
Look out for after sale services.",How to Choose a Good Business VoIP Provider," It is a good practice to go through the services provided by your desired provider. The more the range of services provided, the wider your choices are. There is also a very big likelihood that you will get good deals from such a provider. In future expansions, you will not need to seek the services of another provider but just get the  services from your current provider. This can save you a lot of time and you can start enjoying the  services right away.;
, Another thing that you need to check of a provider is the costs charged for the services you seek. This will help you get good deals at the right prices. Never allow yourself to be overcharged. Take your time to compare different costs so as to know the price ranges for different services. A good provider will never charge exorbitant rates but will charge reasonably. Avoid exploitation from any provider and know exactly what is expected of you.

, From the first day, you never expect to install the systems without any technical assistance,  unless you have the technical knowhow or you simply want to mess your new acquisition. A good services provider will offer post sale services such as installation and troubleshooting. Choose a service provider that will offer the much needed technical assistance. The provider should also be of help in case of any malfunction. It is common for systems to have hitches within the first few months after installation. Your service provider should be willing to offer assistance in case this unfortunate event happens.Finding the best business VoIP provider in most cases is a compromise of the above characteristics. In most cases, the provider you find may not be good from all angles.

Take advantage of pay as you go options if you have poor credit or no credit.,
Purchase a pay as you go card at hundreds of wireless locations or discount stores.,
Opt for pay as you go plans if you only want to use your phone for emergencies.,
Use a prepaid or pay as you go plan as a trial run for a service provider.,
Use the pay as you go plan if you have someone who's calling you want to limit.,
Choose the pay as you go option if you want a fairly low-tech phone.,
Consider a pay as you go option if you are relocating for a short period of time.,
Consider a contract, instead of a prepaid plan, if you use a lot of data or need an extensive family plan.,
Recognize that if you use your phone every day, the pay as you go option is likely to be more expensive.,
Understand that rural areas may not provide good service.,
Accept that you will get fewer calling advantages with a prepaid or pay as you go plan.,
Decide if you have a phone that may work.,
Visit a local Best Buy, Walmart or discount store to look at all the options.,
Decide if you want text messaging included.,
Choose either a daily rate or a pay as you go minutes card.,
Pay ahead of time for minutes.,
Set up your cell phone number.,
Keep track of your minutes.",How to Understand Pay as You Go Cell Phone Plans," Pay as you go minutes or daily rates can last for 30 days or up to a year, depending upon the brand. Prepaid cell plans are usually monthly rates without a contract.


However, sometimes these terms are used interchangeably, since you also ""pre-pay"" for minutes plans.;
, Taking out the necessity to buy a phone with a wireless provider will save you money.

, Since you can buy a card with a number of minutes on it, there is no need to check your credit for future billing.


Some pay as you go cell phone plans may ask for your billing information. This may be the case with daily rates with the major providers, such as AT&T and Verizon.

, Most places will accept cash payments and reduce your paper trail.

, In this case, a daily rate is ideal, because you will have unlimited calling that day for $3 or less; however, it can stay charged and unused without costing you money most of the time.

, If you have few calls dropped and you are pleased with the rates, you may be able to return and get a better contract.

, In this case, opt for a minutes card. When it is near expiration, the user will get a warning and have time to refill them.

, Some companies, such as Virgin Mobile will sell you a phone for $14.99 and you can use it with a talk and text pay as you go plan.

, If having a new cell phone number is not a problem, then you can avoid racking up roaming charges with your normal phone. It is also a good option if you travel to other countries where you only need it occasionally.

, The pay as you go model is not designed for heavy phone users, and you will end up spending more than you would with a prepaid plan or contract.

, AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Boost Mobile offer daily plans that are between $.99 and $3 per day.


Buying prepaid minutes can also be more expensive. In addition, some companies make you pay $20 every 3 months to keep it active.

, Pay as you go plans are best in urban centers, because cell phone towers are common. You may not have the opportunity to choose an affordable pay as you go option in all states.

, Most contracts exclude calls at certain times or to certain numbers. Prepaid phone options rarely have unlimited features.

, Newer models are most likely to work, although they do not need to be smart phones.

, Best Buy keeps all the prepaid and pay as you go options in 1 place so you can do your research.

, In most cases, text messaging will use up your plan quickly and ensure you are charged your daily rate. Make sure you are accounting for text messages ahead of time.

,


With a daily rate, scrutinize the text message rates and data rates. Ask about roaming charges if you are out of the area.
With a minutes card, ask about activation fees and expiration days. If the minutes expire after 30 days and cannot be used within a longer time, then you may lose them. Also ask about roaming and text message usage.

, Set up billing for monthly rates. You will be charged for what you used at the end of the month.

, Unless you are starting a prepaid phone plan with a company where you have previously had a contract, your number will usually switch. You can activate it from the store or home.

, You may want to switch to a contract or monthly prepaid option if you want unlimited minutes.

Familiarize yourself with the Linux file system.,
Keep investigating the potential of your Linux install.",How to Use Linux," Try downloading and installing it on your computer. If you're not sure, be aware that it's possible to keep your current operating system and dedicate part of your hard drive to Linux (and you can even run both at the same time if you run one on a virtual machine.);
, This is helpful if you feel uncomfortable with installing a second operating system on your computer. A live CD will allow you to boot into a Linux environment from the CD, without the need to install anything on your computer. Ubuntu and some other Linux distributions also offer CDs or DVDs that allow you to boot into a Live mode, and then install from the same disk.

, Search for solutions if you can't word-process or burn a CD for example. Make a note of what you want to do, can do and cannot do before you take the plunge.

, When referring to ""Linux"", this most often means a ""GNU/Linux Distribution."" A distribution is a collection of software that runs on top of a very small program called the Linux kernel.

, This will help you understand partitioning as well as letting you continue to use Windows. But be sure to back up all your personal data and settings before you try to set up a dual boot.

, Get used to installing and uninstalling software as soon as you can. Understanding package management and repositories is good for fundamentally understanding Linux.

, This is known as 'Terminal', 'terminal window', or 'shell'. One of the primary reasons many users switch to Linux is because it features the terminal, so don't be intimidated by it. It is a powerful ally that doesn't have the same limitations of a Windows command prompt. You can just as easily use Linux without ever using a terminal as you would on Mac OSX. Using ""apropos"" can help you find a command that does a certain task. Try ""apropos user"" to see a list of commands that have the word ""user"" in their description.

, You will first notice that there is no longer the ""C:\"" you are used to in Windows. Everything starts at the root of the file system (aka ""/"") and different hard drives are accessed through the /dev directory. Your home directory, which you typically find in C:\Documents and Settings in Windows XP and 2000, is now located in /home/(your user name)/.

, Try encrypted partitions, new and very fast file system (like btrfs), redundant parallel disks that increase both speed and reliability (RAID's) and try to install Linux on a bootable USB stick. You'll soon discover that you can do a lot of things!

Publish the app.",How to Make an Android App With App Creation Software," A good app focuses on one thing and does it well. Determine the need that your app will be addressing. This will help you figure out what your audience is, as well as the types of features it should include.


For example, if you're creating an app for your business, determine which facets of your business should be addressed by the app. You may want to allow the user to quickly contact technical support, or allow them to pull up the nearest location of your business.
If your app gets too complicated, there's a good chance that any app creation program you choose will not be powerful enough. Complex apps will typically require custom coding and art design.;
, Apps live and die by their design and usability. Take some time to create some initial sketches of what each screen of the app will look like. Use arrows to show how each screen will transition to the next.


These sketches don't need to be detailed, but should include all of the information that you want to include in each screen.
Try to keep a unified design throughout the app. Similar elements should generally be in the same location on each screen. This will make the app feel more natural for the user.

, Browse through the Google Play Store and look for apps that are similar to what you are trying to accomplish. Play around with them and see what works and what doesn't. Don't be afraid to crib design ideas and flow from the better apps that you find.

, There are a large variety of app-building tools available, ranging from free to quite expensive. Most of the free options have very limited publishing options, or may force you to include ads (which you won't receive revenue for). If you pay for a program, you are more likely to be able to publish the app yourself and monetize it however you'd like. Some of the most popular tools for Android app creation include:


ShoutEm
Appery
Mobile Roadie
The App Builder
Appy Pie
MIT App Inventor
AppMakr

, Most of the popular app-creation programs allow you to take online tours that can give you an overview of how the program will work. This can give you a good idea as to whether or not the app will be good for your needs.


When touring the program, ensure that it will be powerful enough to create the app you want. Most app creation programs are collections of prebuilt functions that you can string together to create a cohesive app.

, Many of the programs listed above have free versions or trial versions available. Use these to get a feel for each piece of software and find the one that suits your needs and skills the best.

, Almost all app-creation programs will require you to create an account and log in before you can get to work. You may need to download software, or apps may be created entirely through the website.

, After logging into the creation tools or downloading the creation software, you will need to start a new project. The process varies from program to program, but generally involves naming your app a name and description.

, Most app development programs will ask you to set a basic theme and color palette before you begin building the app. You will be able to change these choices later once the app is under construction.


You may be able to add your own images for screen backgrounds. These images should typically be 1024 X 768 px.

, Most app creation programs work by letting you add prebuilt functions into your app. The combination of these functions and how they link together is what will make your app yours. There are a variety of different functions you can add to your app, including calendars, photo galleries, podcasts, Facebook integration, audio players, and more.


Typically, each one of these functions will be its own screen on your app.
As you add functions, you will be able to customize each screen with your own text and content. For example, if you add an RSS feed function, you can link to your blog's feed and automatically populate the app with your latest posts.

, After you've added a few functions to your app, spend some time organizing the layout of each screen so that you have a cohesive look for your app. Your title bars should all be in the same location, and content should appear in consistent parts of the screen.


Different app creation programs will give you different levels of control over how everything is laid out. Some apps only let you add completely prebuilt functions, while others allow you to drag and rearrange each element on the screen.

, You will have the opportunity to assign icons to each of your app's functions. Many app creation programs have a library of icons you can choose from, or you can design and upload your own. Good icons will help set your app apart and contribute to the overall feel of the app.

, Once you are finished adding features and filling out content, you can build the app so that it can be ran on your Android device. The process will vary depending on what program you are using. If you are using an online app creation program, you may have to wait a few minutes for your app to be constructed by the program's servers.


You are generally provided with an APK file that can be downloaded onto your device. You will need to set your device to allow installation from unknown sources. You can allow this from your device's Security menu.
Some app creation programs will email you the link to your app that you can open from your phone.

, Once you've installed the app on your device. Test it out to ensure that it is functioning properly. Send the APK file to some friends and family so that other people can help you test it. You are more likely to catch bugs and problems if you have more people looking at the app.


Try to do things during testing that the app isn't made to do. This will help you find ways that your users may accidentally break your app.

, After you have tested the app for a bit, fix any errors that you come across or anything that doesn't work as well as it should. Your app should be easy to navigate above all else, so ensure that your app flows smoothly from one task to the next.

, Your publishing options depend heavily on what program and package you signed up for when choosing your creation software. If you chose a free service, your app will most likely be ad-supported, and may only be available through that company's app store. More expensive options allow you to publish directly to the Google Play Store and may even include promotion and marketing.


Consider releasing a free version with ads and limited functionality and a paid version with no ads and full functionality. This is one of the most common ways to monetize a mobile app.
Make sure that your app has a good description and accurate tags. These tags will help users find your app through relevant searches, and are essential if you want your app to succeed.

Make sure you have a broadband cable or dsl connection to the Internet, unless you plan on using the new network for local file sharing between your computers.,
Choose a wireless standard, there are four different standards commonly used at this time, which are: A, B, G, and N. Recently a new standard came up called AC which is very very fast compared to all the previous standards.,
Buy a router that has your preferred wireless signal, some popular brands are Linksys, Netgear, and D-link.

,
Connect the router to the ethernet cable from the broadband modem and turn the router on.,
Keep in mind that you will also need a wireless adapter for the computer as well if not already installed or built in to the computer.,
Be sure to secure your wireless network, by turning on the WEP or WPA encryption, changing the administrator password, and adding MAC filtering.,
One important thing to keep in mind: As the speed of your wireless network increases the range decreases.",How to Add a Wireless Router to Your Network,";
, It will generally cost more for the faster standards (N and AC) than the slower ones (A and B.) For serious gaming, pick AC, for Internet surfing or business work pick B or G.

,, The router should automatically broadcast the wireless signal, and if the modem is working, so should the Internet.Note, you have to manually input the IP configuration given to you by your ISP.

, It is recommended (if possible) to use the same brand name router and adapter.

, Refer to your router's documentation for information on these settings.

, For home networks it doesn't matter that much but if you need a much larger range then you have to compromise on speed a bit or install multiple access points( in places like large office buildings).

Verify that your configuration meets the basic conditions:


Your printer and wireless router must support WPS pushbutton mode.,
Start the WPS pushbutton mode on your printer.",How to Add an HP Printer to a Wireless Network2," As there are many makes and models, you will need to consult the manuals of both the printer and router to verify compatibility.
The wireless router must have a physical WPS pushbutton available.
Your network must use WPA or WPA2 security protocols. WPS wireless routers, in general, won't connect with the WPS method if set up using WEP security, or no security at all. Also, WPS routers won't connect using the WPS method if you're using the router's default network name and no security.

, As setting this mode depends on the particular model of printer you are using, consult the manual for details on how to accomplish that.


Once WPS mode is engaged on your printer, press the WPS button on your router. You must do this within two minutes.

Access your wireless router.,
Find your wireless security settings.,
Select an encryption type.,
Choose AES algorithms for WPA2-Personal.,
Enter your passphrase and SSID.,
Save your new settings and refresh your router.",How to Add a Password to Your Wireless Internet Connection (WiFi)," Ideally, you can do this with the setup disc that came with your router, but routers are also designed to be accessed remotely through the Internet. To access your router through your web browser, enter the address into the URL. Typical router addresses include 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, and 192.168.2.1.


If you can, access the router using a computer that is connected to the router via an Ethernet cable. If you access it via Wi-Fi, you will be kicked out when you change the settings, and will have to reconnect to the network and log back in to make any adjustments.
The default username and password for most routers is “admin” in both fields. If this doesn't work, try leaving one field blank and typing admin into the other. If that fails, consult any available support for your specific router manufacturer.
If you have changed your access password in the past and can’t remember it, you can press and hold the Reset button on your router to return it to factory defaults. This will clear out all of your settings.
If you don't have access to your original documentation, you can look up your router's model online to find the default IP address and login details.;
, The section labels will vary from router to router, but this is generally located in “Wireless Settings” or “Security Settings”. If you are having difficulty finding it, enter your router’s model number into an internet search and look for how to access the security settings.

, Most routers have several options available when it comes to security. You can typically choose between WEP, WPA-PSK(Personal), or WPA2-PSK. If you can, select WPA2 because it is the most secure form of encryption available for wireless networks. Some older routers don't have this option.


Some older devices will not be able to connect to a network that uses WPA2. Keep this in mind if you have multiple older devices that you need attached to your network.

, If you are given an option, choose AES as the encryption algorithm for your WPA2 security. The other option is TKIP, which is older and less secure. Some routers will only allow you to select AES.AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard and is the best set of algorithms for wireless encryption.

, The SSID is the name of the network, and the passphrase will need to be entered by any device that connects to that SSID.


Your password should be a combination of letters, numbers and symbols. The more basic your password protection is, the easier it is for someone to guess, or ""brute force crack,"" as hackers call it. There are password generators online that will create strong password protection for you, if you need them.

, Click the Apply or Save button on your Wireless Settings page to save your new wireless security settings. Most routers will refresh automatically, and any device connected wirelessly to the network will get kicked off and need to sign on again.


If your router does not refresh automatically, you may need to do this manually. To refresh your router turn off the power and count to 10. Then turn it back on and let it run through its boot cycle (you'll know it’s done when all the lights on the front are done flashing).
Make sure to add your new login and password credentials to all devices that regularly access your wireless Internet connection. For added Wi-Fi security, you can change your password protection every 6 months or so.

;
, Using 128-bit encryption or higher makes your Wireless Network more secure. WEP and WPA are entirely different encryption schemes. WEP has been proven insecure and can be cracked in a few minutes using free utilities that can be downloaded from the Internet. Using at least WPA is recommended, because it is much more secure, but is sometimes a bit harder to set up correctly than WEP is, and isn't completely secure.Some older access points or wireless cards do not support WPA2. If you have one of these, it is recommended that you purchase a newer one that supports WPA2, depending on how important you consider your security. However, WPA2 still uses static Pre-Shared Key, which is easy to capture and break. You have an option to use a very long network password (at least 10 alphanumeric characters) or use a RADIUS server and the WPA2-Enterprise mode that uses username/password combination and generates a temporary session encryption key. As it might be challenging to configure your own authentication server, you might want to use a commercial Virtual RADIUS server., Anybody who gains access to the router configuration settings can disable the security you have set up. If you forget the password, most routers have a hardware reset that will restore all of the settings to factory defaults. The best option is to use a random sequence of the maximum length of characters - you only have to type that once, so it is not a big thing. When you connect to the router via LAN cable while setting it up, you can copy and paste the password onto the router and onto your local setting, so you never need to type it again.



Use a secure password. Don't use easily guessed passwords for your WPA2 or router access passwords, such as ""ABC123"", ""Password"", or a string of numbers in order. Use something hard to guess that contains both upper and lowercase letters as well as numbers. Special characters such as !@#$% are not supported by some routers. The longer the key, the better, although the WPA2 key has a minimum and maximum length. Try to make a little mental effort -- good passwords might be hard to remember, but they are harder to crack.
If you use a weak key then even WPA and WPA2 can be easily cracked within a day using a combination of special precomputed tables and dictionary attacks. The best way to generate a secure key is to use an offline random number generator or write the entire alphabet in uppercase and lowercase and numbers 0-9 on separate pieces of paper, mix the paper up and randomly pick up pieces and return them, mixing them up again each time; each character you pull out becomes a character in your key. You can also try throwing a pair of dice and using the resulting numbers as your password.

, A default SSID indicates to hackers that the network was set up by a novice and that other options (such as the password) are also left as the default. Use a name you can remember and identify, as the SSID has no influence on the security of your network (not even if you choose not to broadcast it).

, A MAC (not to be confused with the computer model 'Mac') address is a code unique to every wireless networking card in existence. MAC Address filtering will register the hardware MAC Address of your networked devices, and only allow devices with known MAC Addresses to connect to your network. However, hackers can clone MAC addresses and still enter your network, so MAC address filtering should not be used in place of proper WPA2 encryption.

, Do not disable the 'SSID Broadcast' feature of your Access Point or router. This seems counter-intuitive, but it is actually a bad idea.Although this would make your network invisible to your neighbors, any determined hacker can still sniff out your SSID; and you are implicitly forcing your computer to shout out your SSID anywhere you are, while it is trying to connect to it. Anyone could then impersonate your router with that SSID, and get your credentials that way.

, The first router worm brute forces its way into the router in this manner. Most default usernames are set to Admin. It isn't hard for a virus/worm to crack the password if the username is known. The good thing is that routers normally have this disabled by default. Be sure to confirm that it is disabled when you first set up your router and periodically thereafter. If you need to update your router setting remotely, only set up access for the time you are going to be connected.

, Finally, change the setting that allows administrating the router through a wireless connection to 'off' (meaning that you need to connect with a LAN cable for administration). This disables any wireless hacking into the router.

, Take the Internet cable (the thicker one) from the package and connect it to one of the ports labeled “Ethernet” at the back of the 2Wire router. Take the other end of the cable and plug it to the Internet/LAN port at the back your computer or laptop.


There’s only port at the back of your computer where the Internet cable can fit so it won’t be hard finding it.

, Take the power adapter and plug your router to an electric outlet. Press the Power button on the device itself to switch it on.


After pressing the Power button, allow the device to load for a few moments. Once all the lights on the router have steadied out, you can now access its settings.

If you have more area that you need to cover, or have lots of walls in your home, you’ll need a router that offers the option of upgrading antenna(s) with high gain types - if not supplied in the box. If more than one wireless device will be connecting at the same time at different speeds, a MiMo type router is recommended, otherwise the speed for all devices will drop the highest supported by all at that time.


All modern routers should support 802.11n, or Wireless-N). This is the most stable, offers the fastest speeds and is backwards compatible with older standards such as 802.11g.;
, Routers and wireless routers enable you to share your broadband internet connection with multiple devices. To do so, you will need to connect your broadband modem to the router. For best results, place your router near your modem.

Connect the router and the modem with an Ethernet cable. Most routers come packaged with a short Ethernet cable that you can use for this.
Connect the modem to the WAN / Internet Port on your router. It is usually offset, and may be a different color from the LAN Ports. WAN stands for ""Wide Area Network"" which is what the internet actually is. LAN stands for ""Local Area Network"". The router will assign a local or ""private"" IP address to any device connected to its LAN Ports or WiFi signal from a pool of private addresses (listed further below).

, If you have computers that are close, or a video game console or TV, you can connect them to the router via Ethernet. This will result in a more stable and faster connection, and doesn’t require any extra configuration., You will need at least one computer connecting via Ethernet cable in order to adjust your router settings. You can disconnect this computer afterwards if you want to connect wirelessly. You can also connect your laptop wirelessly for the first time, the wifi network name and the default password will be printed on the router's label, To connect the router to the internet, with some internet providers (i.e. GTPL in India), it is required to register router's MAC address to the internet service provider's website.,, Log in with the username and password provided by the internet service provider and go to MAC address update option. one can see their existing laptop / computers MAC address there. Add the router's MAC address there and save it. This process means that the router is authorized to use the internet provide by the broadband company., If this is a new installation or new router, determine the default IP address that may be printed on a label affixed to the router or in the documentation. If you can’t find the router’s IP address anywhere, you can do a web search for the router model to see what the default address is.


IP addresses are formatted as four groups of up to three digits, separated by periods.
Commonly found ""default"" Local IP addresses for routers are 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.1. Note that all the addresses in the follow ranges: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 & 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 have been set aside for exclusive use in a LAN; and one address in the range of any of them of them would be assigned to the connected router.

, Enter in the IP address of the router into the address bar and press Enter. Your browser will attempt to connect to the router’s configuration menu.


If your router came with an installation disc, you can run the configuration program from that instead. It will accomplish many of the same functions.

, In order to access the configuration page, you will need to be on the router's IP address and enter a valid username and password at the prompt. Most routers have a basic account set up that you will need to use to log on. This varies from model to model, but should be printed on the router or in the documentation.


The most typical username is “admin”.
The most typical passwords are “admin” and “password”.
Many routers will only require a username and a blank password, and some allow you to leave all fields blank.
If you can’t figure out the correct IP address, your username or password, search for your router model online to see what the default login is. If it has been changed, press the Reset button on the back of the router for 10 (to 30+ seconds as dictated in the instructions for the router model) to restore factory defaults and try again.

, When you log in to your router, you will be taken to the router’s main menu or status screen. There will be several options to choose from. The Internet section can usually be left at default settings, unless you received specific instructions from your internet service provider. The Wireless section will allow you to set up your wireless network.

, In the Wireless section, you should see a field labeled SSID or Name. Enter a unique name for your wireless network. This is what other devices will see when scanning for networks.


Check the box to enable SSID broadcast. This will essentially “turn on” the wireless network so that it may be readily seen by anyone in range of the signal. *See the Tips section below for additional information on the SSID setting.

, Choose from the list of available security options. For the best security, choose WPA2-PSK as the encryption method. This is the most difficult security to crack, and will give you the most protection from hackers and intruders.

, Once you’ve chosen your security method, enter in a passphrase for the network. This should be a difficult password, with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Don’t use any passwords that could be easily deduced from your network name or from knowing you.

, Once you are finished naming and securing your wireless network, click the Apply or Save button. The changes will be applied to your router, which may take a few moments. Once the router has finished resetting, your wireless network will be enabled.

, Once you have your network configured, you should change the username and password that you use to access your router. This will help protect your router from unauthorized changes. You can change these from the Administration section of the router configuration menu., If you want to prevent devices that are connected to your network from accessing certain websites, you can use built-in blocking tools to restrict access. These can be found in the Security/Block section of the router.


You can usually block by specific domain names, or by keywords.

, Scan for the wireless network with the SSID you provided above. On any device that supports wireless networks, you should see your new network as long as you are within range of the router. Select it and you will be prompted for the passphrase.

, Once you enter the passphrase, your device will be automatically connected to the wireless network. The network will be stored in your devices memory and will automatically connect whenever you are within range.


For detailed instructions on selecting and joining a wireless network for your specific computer, tablet, or smartphone, follow this guide.

, Besides other computers and tablets, you can connect other devices as well, such as printers, game consoles, TVs and more. See the following guides for instructions for your specific device.

This section contains the apps on Facebook that you use and are linked to your account. Click on Bubble Witch Saga from this list, and the app will load within Facebook. Select the level you want to play and click on it.

Launch the game’s mobile app. Look for the Bubble Witch Saga app on your mobile device, and tap on it to launch it. Select the level you want to play and tap on it.;
, Get to know the current level and get an idea how deep or how many bubbles you need to go through to clear the level. Know also the points needed to get at least one star. If you don’t get at least one star even if you clear the level, you will lose.

, Start playing the game by shooting the colored bubbles. Bubbles are cleared when you hit your bubbles to the same-colored bubbles at the top., The bubbles you shoot follow the path indicated by the dotted line. You will know where your bubble will land by observing the direction of the dotted line. You can also bounce the bubble off the walls to reach those hard-to-reach spaces.

, If you can, go for the gaps between bubbles and aim higher. If you’re able to clear out higher bubbles, the lower bubbles attached to them will fall off and bounce towards the jars at the bottom, giving you extra points.

, For each turn, you have two bubbles to choose from. You can swap these bubbles if you prefer to use the other one, especially if the two bubbles are of different colors.


Analyze which colored bubble you need before you shoot. Swap the bubbles by clicking or tapping the current bubble being aimed. It will be swapped with the other bubble in the cauldron.

, Do not settle with just clearing out a few bubbles. Go for huge combos by clearing out a huge collection of same-colored bubbles with one shot. You can also get some chain reactions, and you will be able to clear out the level faster and get huge points with that.

, These are the game boosters. Use these sparingly as they can cost you real money. Use these only as a last resort and when you’re confident that you can complete the level. Otherwise, it will be wiser to just restart the game.


The Magic Potions and Magic Scrolls can be equipped for use pre-game. On the pre-game window, click or tap on the Magic Potions and Magic Scrolls you want to use for your game. The costs are indicated on each of the items. Click or tap the items to purchase and equip them.

, The bubbles you shoot are limited. When the bubbles run out and you haven’t reached the goal, you will lose the game. The bubble count is clearly indicated on the middle cauldron where you get your bubbles from.

, Towards the bottom, right on top of the jars, you can find some colored spiders. These spiders give you score multipliers. If you have some bubbles that can fall off, get them to hit these spiders to give you more points.

Do not undo the licorice.,
Remove the chocolate.,
Move on to jellies.,
Watch how the left and right boards change.,
Take left-hand specials if you can.,
Attack the chocolate directly.,
Attack the chocolate from the side.,
Avoid getting overwhelmed by the chocolate.",How to Beat Level 70 on Candy Crush," Breaking the licorice X's will release the chocolate, making the level much harder. Do not do this until you have to.;
, Deal with the chocolate as early as you can. This will be the hardest part. Shoot for striped candy at the same level as the chocolates to remove them quickly.


Other special candies can also be useful on this level, like a wrapped-striped combo.

, After the chocolate has been dealt with, you can break the licorice chains and move on to dealing with the jelly.

, The candies do not move as normal and move different depending on what side of the board you're moving on. Pay attention so as not to miss out on opportunities.

, Even though the focus will be on the right, if you see the opportunity to create a special candy on the left-hand side, do it. These specials can help you on the right as well.

, One approach to this level is to start freeing the caged jelly as soon as possible and start removing the chocolate from the board. The problem with this approach is that since the grid on the right is smaller, you have less space to make combinations in. However once you start removing the cages, the chocolate is free to move through the entire grid, and will slowly reduce your working area to just a few squares. This approach works best if you have several future combinations in mind, and can see how the board will look a few moves ahead.

, One of the easiest ways to remove the chocolate is to create two horizontally striped candies in the left grid, and once they are in the lower rows, set them off. Remember that since the two boards are not the same size, this move only works from Row 2 and 3 from the bottom on the left grid. You can also use a striped candy to remove all cages from the right side grid in one move. This move requires planning and the ability to make striped candy.

, Once the chocolate is free, it will start taking over adjacent squares. Remember that if you remove a piece of chocolate, it won’t grow in the next move. So keep working on combinations close to the chocolate, and attacking it using special candy, to reduce its spread.

Focus on unlocking the licorice candies located in the bottom row.,
Look for opportunities to make one or more striped horizontal candies.,
Clear candies that will help bring down the ingredients after you’ve unlocked the licorice candies.,
Look for opportunities to make striped vertical candies after the licorice candies have been unlocked.,
Focus on making color bombs, which can wipe out a mass number of candies to help bring down ingredients.,
Try to combine color bombs with striped candies whenever possible.",How to Beat Level 39 on Candy Crush," The licorice candies must be unlocked before you can bring any ingredients to the bottom. Licorice candies can be unlocked by matching the candy under the blocker with two other candies of the same color, or by using a special candy effect, or combination.;
, Striped horizontal candies can be moved to the bottom row and detonated to wipe out all other locked candies in the bottom row.


Striped horizontal candies can be made by matching four candies in a row, as long as you move the last piece into the combo in a horizontal direction., Two cherries and two hazelnuts must be brought to the bottom.

, Striped vertical candies will help bring ingredients to the bottom in just one move, since these candies will wipe out all candies in the same column.


Striped vertical candies can be made by matching four candies in a row, as long as you move the last piece of the combo in a vertical direction., Color bombs will detonate all candies that match the color of the candy the bomb is swapped with., This special candy effect will turn every candy of the same color as the striped candy into more striped candies, which will wipe candies in the same rows and columns horizontally and vertically. The color bomb and striped candy combo will help bring your ingredients down to the bottom sooner.

Make the first move.,
Include her name somewhere in the first message.,
Craft an intriguing first message.,
Use proper grammar and spellcheck before you press send.,
Mention something you found interesting in her profile.,
Ask thoughtful and genuine questions.,
Stick with short, focused messages.,
Ask for her number or a date.",How to Talk to Girls on Tinder," While some girls will message you first, it’s often up to you to make the first move. Waiting around for a girl to message you is passive, but starting the conversation is active and shows you are interested. Be sure to wait a few hours after you’ve matched so you don’t seem too eager.Girls often don’t want to move first for fear that a person will assume they are more interested than they actually are.
Remember that even though you matched, it’s not a guarantee that a girl is going to respond to your message. Don’t take it too seriously if girls don’t always respond when you message them.;
, If you want to make her feel like you are talking to her personally, that she’s not just another girl, use her name. People are more likely to respond positively when you use their name in conversation.Don’t go overboard and use it in every sentence. Once is enough.
Include it at that beginning of the message like, “Hi, Layla. I was wondering how many people have quoted song lyrics to you on here?”
Use it later for emphasis with something like, “I’ve always heard that you existed but I never quite believed it. Now it’s confirmed for me: a girl named Mallory really does exist.” It’s silly, but if you’re lucky she will think it’s cute.

, Girls get many messages that are boring and all sound the same, so your goal is to stand out. Write something that is specifically for her and doesn’t seem like a line you use over and over again. You want her to be curious about talking to you.For example, say, “I can’t believe this happened again…” Follow up by mentioning how you get paired with lots girls that are food snobs (or another defining trait). Ideally, she’ll want to show you that she is different from the other girls.
Your main goal is to get her thinking, so avoid anything that’s simple like “Hello,” “How are you?” or “What’s up?” Those won’t stand out to her and won’t make her want to talk to you.
Other options are, “Tracy, could you settle a bet between me and my friend?” or “Jen, what should I message you if I really want you to respond?” or “Emily, if you had to pick any other person with my name to message you, who would it be?

, Making a good impression is unlikely if you send a messy text with lots of slang and typos. You don’t necessarily have to capitalize and use punctuation, but definitely use full words and complete sentences. Girls appreciate when you care enough to write well.Don’t type: “Ay gurl, ben wondrin wut UR rely like, u wanna go out”
Say something like, “Stacy, I saw you like Cage the Elephant. Are you going to see them at Coachella this summer?”
Don’t second guess what you decide to write, but check it over to make sure you didn’t misspell anything. Also, make sure that autocorrect didn’t change what you meant to type.

, Before you start talking, check out her profile and find something that you have in common or that you find interesting. Reference this in your first or second message. Use it as topic of conversation to show her you are interested in her for more than just her profile picture.For example, if she mentions that she likes biking, ask her what brand she thinks makes the best bike. Or if she has a photo that appears to be from a vacation, ask her where she travelled and what she thought of it.
If you notice a common interest like a band, a hobby, or an organization, tell her your connection to it and ask her what she likes about it.

, As you continue talking, she may mention something you find interesting. Respond in a way that acknowledges what she said and responds specifically to it. Say something about what she said and then ask a follow up question.Don’t respond with something like, “Oh, cool!” which makes her have to work to keep talking. Other things like “Sounds like fun,” or “I can’t believe it,” tend to be speed bumps in conversation.
If she tells you she likes to play guitar, ask her if she has ever recorded herself playing, and if you could see the video.
Other general follow up questions are, “Have you always wanted to do that?” “What was the hardest part of that?” or “Did you start on your own or did someone help you?”

, Long text messages are okay sometimes, but short is better when you’re first talking to a girl on Tinder. Write a maximum of two sentences, and don’t use lots of commas for complicated sentences. Focus on one thought or point per text so she can give a simple response.Don’t ramble like this: “I thought that I had seen you before. You were in my chem class, which was so boring. The only time I’ve used chemistry since then is mixing drinks, lol. I made a killer cocktail last weekend. But I ended up forgetting a meeting I had the next day.
Keep it simple by saying, “I actually recognized you because we had a chem class together. Do you remember that professor who said ‘um’ all the time?”

, After you talk a while, move onto the next step. If she has been talking to you and seems interested, she will probably give you her number. Since you’re already talking on the app, it’s okay to ask for a date from there. Suggest a neutral spot like a coffee shop close to you.


Say, “It’s been fun messaging, but I’d like to hear your voice, too. Could I have your number?” It’s direct and she will either say yes or no. Even if she says no, ask her if she would like to keep talking.
If you want to go out, say, “I’m not sure exactly where you live, but the Verve is a pretty central spot. Would you want to meet up there tomorrow night?

Measure its current performance.,
Revisit the app Name.,
Change app Icon.,
Make Attractive Screenshots.,
Write Engaging App Description.,
Do Keyword Optimization.,
Localize in different Languages.,
Measure the Performance Regularly.",How to Do App Store Optimization (ASO) for iOS Apps/Games," Measuring the current performance of the app absolutely vital. The performance of the app is a combination of following things.


Track the download numbers from iTunes Connect and note down the average download per day and average download per week number.
See the app’s ranking in the App Store. If the app is app is not ranked inside top 200 of the app’s category, then search for its ranking in Appannie.  If is currently unranked, note that down.
Calculate app’s average revenue per day and per week, include both In App Purchase (IAP) earnings and also earnings from Ad Network(s).;
, Many apps do not do well in the App Store because they are not named properly.


Choose a name that is unique and represents your app.
Use terms or words which represent the genre or type of the app. For instance, if the app is a music downloader app, use the words “music downloader” as part of the name. This helps the search ranking of the app.
Don’t stack keywords in the app name. App name should sound natural and not artificial. If the app name is “Music downloader App for all Pop, Jazz, Rock, Metal fans” then it would sound artificial and is very likely to be ranked low for these keywords.

, Most apps with poor downloads are due to poor icon. Change the app icon.


Research app icon of similar apps and others apps in the same category for inspiration. For instance, if the app is a music app, research on similar music app icons and get inspiration.
Make the icon unique and catchy. Users would click more on icon which is unique and attractive.

, Screenshots are the most powerful tool to demonstrate the app for users. So, make attractive screenshots.


Try to highlight the key features of the app in the screenshots. Don’t try to stack all features, users will get confused.
Use clear and catchy graphics that grasps the attention of users.
Use small words and sentences to explain the functions of the app. Don’t write really long sentences, the purpose of words and sentences are to compliment the graphics, NOT overpower them. For instance – “Music downloader customized specially for iPhone users who use iPhone 6 Plus” will dilute the attention from the app features. Instead, just write “Customized for iPhone 6+”.

, The app description explains what the app is all about. So, use the app description to explain to the users that this app is worth their time.


First 200-250 characters of the description should highlight the key feature or unique selling point of the app. Most users download app from their iPhone or iPad, and all they see in the App Store when they search for an app is the icon, screenshot and first couple of sentences of the App Description. So, the first couple of sentences are very crucial.
Write small sentences instead of long paragraphs.
Be precise and to the point. Users want to read about the app features, not an essay.
Avoid using spam marketing phrases(marketing phrases associated with spam), such as “Exclusively for you”, “Download Right Now”.
Write correct and simple English. Users get annoyed when there are grammatical errors in the app description.

, Most users discover apps by searching in App Store. So, the 100 characters of keywords section have to be properly used to increase search ranking of the app.


Research keyword which are relevant to the app. Try to figure out what words or phrases would an average user use if he/she was trying to find an app of this type.
Search for competitors keywords from Sensortower and Appannie. Get an idea on what keywords are used by similar apps.
Choose keywords with quality traffic and lower competition. Common keywords are very high competition and the app’s search rank shall be very low with those keywords.
Separate two keywords with a (,) comma, using spaces in between is unnecessary.
To rank for phrase searches such as “jazz music”, don’t use “jazz music”. Use “jazz,music” instead.
Don’t repeat the same keyword. For instance, don’t write “jazz,music,rock,music,salsa,music”. Instead of that, use “jazz,rock,salsa,music”. The App Store algorithm shall do the permutation and combination.
Don’t use plurals with an “s”. For instance, write “wallpaper”, NOT “wallpapers”. App Store algorithm can detect plurals with “s”. But, if the plural of a keyword is unique, such as “shelf” and “shelve”, include both if both are good keywords.
App Name, Company name and app category is automatically counted as keywords; don’t repeat them in the keyword section. For instance, if the app is a music app is released in Music category, no need to use “music” in the keywords section. But if it is released in Entertainment category, then “music” can be added in the keywords section.

, More localization leads to more visibility from users of different countries, which possibly may lead to more downloads.


Priority languages should be Simplified Chinese, Japanese and Spanish, followed by Thai, Filipino, Russian, Turkish etc.
For best results, localize everything. App description, keywords, app name, screenshot texts, texts inside the app, notifications etc.
If you have money, hire a professional service provider. There are many reliable providers, a simple Google search would suffice.
If there is no budget for localization, try to find a fellow indie developer who is proficient in that language.  Most indie developers are very helpful to the community. Usually developer forums such as iPhoneDevSDK are good places to find developers from different countries.

, ASO is not a one-time thing, one has to constantly measure the effects of every changes and its impact on app download and revenue. So, measure the performance on daily and weekly basis.

Invest in a high quality App icon.,
Optimize your title and description.,
Choose the right category and app type.,
Include screenshots and a demo.,
Maintain good app ratings and reviews.,
Focus on your app download numbers.",How to Do App Store Optimization," The very first thing that your users will see is your app icon. It needs to be clean, informative and memorable. Avoid using text; something related to your app/game is a much better choice. Remember that the icon is the very first thing potential user will notice - so keep it clean and simple.


Research your competition and see what kind of icons they use - this way you will be able to create one that stands out from the crowd and is easy to spot. Use colors and shapes to your advantage. If majority of your competitors are using color red - use blue to stand out.;
, Make your title short and to the point, but include your main keywords in it. This will help you to rank higher in search results. Use description to explain in detail what your app does, why is it better than your competitors and how it will help user. Use first few sentences to attract users to keep reading it.


Currently there is a 4,000 character limit on descriptions, so make the most out of it by promoting your app. Hire experienced sales pitch writer if you lack ideas to create proper call-to-action description.

, Is it an application or a game? All games are applications, but not all applications are games! If you are not sure which one is your application, ask around developer communities. You also have to choose the right category. Unfortunately, you can only choose one category, so if your app fits into more than one category choose the most relevant one - one where the most targeted users will see it.

, Including a demo for a paid app is a great way to attract more users and sales. You should also include screenshots of your app so potential users can get a hold of what you are offering. This is an important part of attracting users to trusting your app and downloading it!

, Reviews are important part of an offsite ASO. iOS store ranks higher apps with positive reviews and ratings. They will also build a trust factor that will translate in more downloads per visitor. Genuine reviews will help you to reach top rankings.


You can achieve that by asking your beta users about rating your app. Also including in-app request will give you a boost.

, App Downloads are the most important part of an offsite ASO. The more downloads you get for your app, the higher chance other users will see it, download it and boost your rankings. It is as simple as it gets - as long as app provides a high quality product, it will attract new downloads thanks to high rankings. You can get an initial boost in downloads from forums and family by simply asking them to check and review your application for you.

You can also look around the sides of the tablet or behind its battery for any slot that a SIM card might fit in. It’s a small slot only a little larger than that of a memory card, and is very easy to find.;
, There are two ways you can get a SIM card:


the first is by purchasing a prepaid type SIM from your local gadget store. You can get these SIMs for under $5, depending on the provider it’s from. You also don’t have to pay any monthly bill, just top-up from your local store or carrier outlet before you use it.
The second way is by getting a postpaid SIM directly from a mobile carrier. Unlike prepaid SIMs, you can get a postpaid SIM card for free, but you have to pay a monthly phone bill to keep it working.

, Remove the SIM card from the package and insert it into the SIM slot of the Galaxy Tab.


For tablets with the SIM slot located along the sides, you no longer need to turn off the device first before you put the SIM card in. For the other models, switching off your tablet may be necessary before inserting the SIM card.
After inserting the SIM card, you should see the signal icon on the upper right-hand corner of the screen go up, telling you that it’s now connected and receiving signals from the SIM card provider.

, To start making calls, tap the phone icon from your tablet’s screen to bring up its on-screen numeric keypad. Here, type in the phone number you want to contact and press the green phone icon to place the call.


To end the call, simply tap the red phone icon and the call should terminate at once, leading you back to the home screen.

, To start making calls, tap the message icon from your tablet’s screen to bring up its dedicated messaging app. To send a text message, just type in your message on the text box using the on-screen keyboard.


Tap the “Recipient” field found at the top of the app screen and type in the phone number where you want to send the message to. If you already have contacts saved on your Galaxy Tab, suggested names will appear as you type in the number.

, Once you inserted a SIM card, you can now start browsing the Internet even without connecting to a Wi-Fi network. All you need to do is the following:


Enable mobile data. Open the notification tray by sliding your fingers from top to bottom of the tab’s screen. Once the notification tray has been expanded, tap the “Mobile Data” quick setting button (the arrows point up and down) found on the upper portion of the tray to enable this feature.
Start surfing. Tap the “Internet” application from the home screen to open the tablet’s native web browser. Type in the address of the website you want to visit and press the “Go” button on the keyboard to start surfing.

Move and delete notes.,
Browse your attachments.",How to Use the Notes App in iOS 9," If you don’t use this too often, you may have forgotten what it looks like. And for those who think they may have deleted it, know that this is a base app (an app that already appears when you buy your iPad or iPhone), and can’t be deleted, so you probably just misplaced it somewhere. Its icon is what appears to be lined pad paper with a yellow border on top.


You can also look for it via the Spotlight Search option, which you can access by going to the Home menu and swiping down from anywhere but the topmost portion of your screen. Just type in “Notes” in the search bar, and it will appear.;
, The first time you launch the app after updating, you'll be asked if you want to upgrade to the new Notes app. Simply select “Yes,” and it will update shortly. Afterwards, rejoice on receiving your new and shinier Notes app!


Don’t worry about losing your old Notes from the app if you have any, since the update affects only the app, but not the data inside.

, If you forgot how, just tap the pen-and-paper icon on the upper-right portion of the screen to make your new blank note. This is where (most of) the magic happens, now.


If you don’t have any existing notes, just tap on the blank half of the screen and you will automatically make a new one.

, For aspiring artists or for people with kids in their care, this new function is a lifesaver. If you press the squiggly line on the lower-right part of the screen, you’ll be taken to the drawing interface, where you can freely draw in until you press the “Done” option on the upper left of the drawing screen to exit, and it will be automatically added to your note.


If the keyboard is loaded, the new additional options (sketches, photo attachment, formatting) will appear on the top-right part of the keyboard, or by tapping the + symbol on the same spot. This also applies for the Photos option.
You can add your doodle above or below any text you make, and the same applies for the Photo and Video Attachment function.

, You got a selection of “pens” you can choose for different effects (pen, pencil, marker), a ruler tool, an eraser tool, and a variety of colors. Simply tap on the tools you want to use, then slide, dot, and swipe your finger to make art.

, The pen, pencil, and marker tools have different textures when you draw. Both the pen and pencil tools have thin lines, but while the pen has more solid, opaque lines, the pencil has a less opaque line and a rough texture. Marker has thicker, almost watery-textured lines, but the colors are less opaque. You can layer marker and pencil lines because of their textures and less opaque colors.


You can pick your colors by scrolling through the color picker on the lower right portion of the screen, then tapping your desired color.

, This tool may be a bit confusing at first, but it’s pretty useful once you’re used to it. When you use this tool, a ruler appears on the screen. You can rotate the ruler to any angle you want and position it anywhere you want. Then when you have it in position, you tap on one of the pens you want, then just draw a line on either side of the ruler. As long as the stroke is along the side of the ruler, it’s all right even if you don’t draw exactly beside the ruler, just know that the stroke appears only where the ruler touches. And once you’re done, just tap the ruler icon again to remove it.

, To undo or redo some of your previous strokes, you can find the Undo and Redo buttons on the upper left of the screen. Undo is the curved arrow pointing left, and redo is the one pointing right. You can also rotate the picture you just drew by pressing the rotate button,which is a square with a curved arrow around it, on the upper right of the screen.

, If you want to add anything to the drawing, just tap the drawing itself. You can even undo some previous strokes even when you exit. You can also add regular text below or above the drawings.


If you want to delete the drawing, just tap and hold it, then press the “Delete” option on the pop-up.

, If you tap on the camera icon next to the squiggly line, you can use it to add a photo either from your album or take a new video or photo for your note-taking needs. Once you're done, it’s added to the note. Then you can cut, copy, share, or delete it by tapping on the photo or video on the Note and picking from the pop-up options.

, When you pick “Take Photo or Video,” you are redirected to the Camera app, and you can pick whether you want to take a video or snap a pic. Afterwards, you are asked whether you want to retake it or use it. Retaking it just brings you back to the camera app, and using it automatically embeds the photo or video on that note.

, When you choose the “Photo Library” option, you can scroll through your pictures, and you can just tap the “Use” option to embed it. Like with the sketches, you can add text above or below the photo or video for both methods, making this a good way to track significant photos and jot down notes.

, When you’re typing in the Notes app, you can see two icons: one that looks like a checkmark and one that has a capital and lowercase A. These two new icons will let you format your text to however you like.

, The letter A icon lets you choose which kind of list formatting you want—bulleted list, dashed list, or numbered list—or use a plain text body without bullets or dashes preceding every new line. You can highlight the text you want in a different format, too.

, The other icon is a special thing that enables a specific format that lets you literally check off the stuff on your list. It will first resemble empty circles, but when you tap on those, a check appears inside. It also precedes every new line you make, and you can disable the checkmark on specific lines too.


To disable the checkmarks, press the check icon on your keyboard again. You can also highlight specific text and assign and remove checkmarks that way too.

, You know how in some apps, you can share things to other apps using the AirDrop “Share sheet” option? You know the little box with an arrow pointing up that you can find in the corner of most apps? You can do that with Notes now! You can embed pictures, web pages, maps, news articles, and possibly even more in the upcoming updates in the future.


When you tap the AirDrop icon, or select some text and press “Share,” you can choose to open it in a list of apps, which will be the Notes app for this example. A small pop-up window will appear, and you can see your selection, which you can either save as a new note (default option), or you can chose to attach them to an existing note by tapping the “Choose Note” option when you’re sharing it and picking the note you want from the list.

, If you want to store your doodles, chores, or writing in different places, you can make folders. On the left half of the Notes screen, where your notes are listed in, you’ll see an arrow icon that’s pointing left. Tap on that, then you’ll see a list that contains some base folders, like “All on my (iPad or iPhone),” “Notes,” and “Recently Deleted.” Now, on the very bottom of the list, you can see a “New Folder” option. Tap on that, and you’d have made yourself a new receptacle for your notes!

, Now, on the top side of the list screen, you can see an “Edit” button. If you tap on that, you can move or delete any note or folder currently in the screen. Once you’re finished, just press “Done” and you can now relish your freshly organized notes. You can also press “Cancel” to exit the Edit function without doing anything.


Tapping on the name of the folder while in the Edit screen will let you rename it.
You can move or delete notes around individually or by bulk, or you can delete or move them all at once. For bulk and individual moving or deleting, tap the individual notes you wanna move, then press the “Move To” at the bottom left side of the list and decide where they end up, or the “Delete” option on the right side. If move or delete all at once, just tap either “Move All” or “Delete All” on the bottom of the list.
Tapping on a note or the checkmark beside the folder will let you delete it. However, any notes you delete are moved to the Recently Deleted folder, where they will stay for 30 days until you either recover or delete them. When deleting folders, you can chose to delete the folder and contents, or just the folder. If you only delete the folder, the contents of the folder will be moved to the Notes folder.

, Lastly, if you feel disorganized or couldn’t find a specific picture in a specific note, just tap the icon of small four boxes on the lower left of the screen. This will take you to the Attachments window, which lets you scroll through all the stuff you added to your Notes, from pictures to maps to even web pages.

Choose a dog that matches your physical activity level.,
Choose a dog based on the attention they require.,
Default to getting an older dog.,
Ensure your home is safe for the dog you're considering.,
Consider your options at local shelters.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for a Single Adult1," Regardless of the type of dog you get, it’s important to recognize that caring for a dog requires a significant commitment, particularly in terms of active time you'll need to spend together. Of course, different types of dogs will require different levels of attention and activity every day.For instance, a young American Husky will require large amounts of physical activity every day, while an aging Beagle may be content with one or two daily walks.;
, Before you choose a dog, evaluate how much time you have to spend with your dog. Ultimately, your availability will help you decide what type of dog will be the best for you. Note that different types of dogs will impact your social freedom too.For instance, if your chaps wish to go for a beverage after work, you may have to decline. If you have an active dog that is waiting for you to return after a full work day, you’ll need to get back to them to take them for a walk, etc.
Many of the most popular dog breeds - including Labs and Golden Retrievers - are not ideal for single people, as they require ample time commitments in terms of both attention and activity.

, As a single adult, it will likely be best to get an adult dog. Puppies require especially large time commitments, and cannot be left at home as readily. Older dogs will also require less training, and you may be able to learn more about their personality from those who have cared for them., One of the main challenges of raising a dog on your own is the unfortunate amount of time they will likely spend alone. If you will be regularly leave your dog at home alone, you need to make sure it will be safe to do so for the dog you choose. To help identify potential concerns, ask yourself the following questions:Can they explore your home? In order for a young dog to be happy at home alone, they will need to be able to explore safely.
Is there space to play? The more active the dog, the more stimulation they'll need.
Will your dog be stressed by what they can see and here from your home? If your dog is constantly in guard mode the whole time you’re gone, they will be stressed and unhappy.

, Before determining which breed you hope to get, go to a few local adoptions agencies to see if they have any dogs that would be appropriate for a single human household. The employees will likely be able to talk to you about what you’re hoping for and which available dogs will match your lifestyle."

Do not get a dog from a herding or retrieving breed.,
Choose a Basset Hound, Maltese, or Shar Pei if they'll frequently be home alone.,
Get a Whippet, French Bulldog, or Greyhound if you live in an apartment.,
Consider getting more than one dog.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for a Single Adult2," Many of the most popular dogs breeds are poorly suited for someone who lives alone. This is especially true is you work away from home. More specifically, Labradors, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, and Border Collies all need more exercise and attention than many single adults will be able to provide.If left to roam your home freely, they will become frustrated and likely misbehave. Meanwhile, leaving a dog - especially a high-energy, active dog - in a crate for several hours, is considered abusive.

, While some dogs can be left at home alone for reasonable portions of the day, others cannot. These breeds in particular are content to nap for large portions of the day. Their daytime activities will be low enough to stay out of trouble at home, especially if you provide them a comfortable napping environment.While they need attention and exercise like all dogs, they will be content if you’re able to spend some time on the couch with them in the evening after a walk together.
Be aware that a Maltese is going to favor your furniture to a dog bed. That said, they are less likely to get bored and act out than many other dog breeds when left alone, and are especially good for older folks., Some dogs will be content to spend time alone even if you don’t have much room to explore. Whippets and Greyhounds in particular are clean, quiet dogs that enjoy spending the day on something soft. Meanwhile, Frenchies are as small and as content to nap as they are silly looking.If you get a Greyhound from a rescue facility, there’s a good chance they’re accustomed to sleeping in crates for much of the day. Offer them a couch or especially fluffy dog bed instead once they are comfortable in your home.
Note that Greyhounds, though content to rest for much of the day, also require at least an hour of vigorous exercise every day.
Whippets are more likely to hide then go into defense mode. For this reason, they may ideal for apartments where they can hear other things going on, as they won’t be compelled to bark at everything all day.

, One great way to prevent your dog from getting bored during the day is by getting another dog to keep them occupied. While Chihuahuas are great dogs for single people - in part because they aren’t too active - they don’t like to be left entirely on their own."

Expect loyalty and looks from a Pit Bull.,
Go with a German Shepherd for home defense.,
Get a Doberman or Rottweiler for personal protection.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for a Single Adult3," If you’re looking to feel more secure, but aren’t too worried about actual security, a Pit Bull (or American Pit Bull Terrier) may be perfect for you. It’s certainly true that Pit Bulls are among the scariest looking dogs - which can work wonders in keeping maleficent humans at a distance. They are also extremely affectionate, which risks an overly friendly demeanor that is not necessarily ideal for guard dogs.Pit Bulls are also very easy to adopt, as Pit Bulls are often passed over by many people who perceive them to be overly aggressive.

, Given the widespread use of German Shepherds as police and military personnel, it’s well known that this breed takes protection seriously. Often, their bark and reputation is enough to deter strangers from poking their nose where it doesn’t belong.Further, German Shepherds are extremely intelligent and will quickly warm up to those you welcome into your home.

, Doberman Pinschers were bred specifically to protect the person with whom they have the strongest bond. For a single person who wants a dog for protection, they are one of the best options. Their intelligence makes them easy to train, especially for guarding duty.Like any dog trained to guard you, Dobermans will need to be properly socialized with other dogs and people by you or a professional trainer.
While Rottweilers also excel in personal protection roles, they are also larger and can be harder to handle. This makes socialization at a young age very important.

All of the apps in the list will add up to a 100% total.

, By default, the list will show usage over the last 24 hours. Switching to the 7 day view will better show how apps behave over longer periods of time.

To restart your phone, hold down the Power button on top of your phone's casing and then swipe the slide to power off switch at the top of the screen right. After a minute, press and hold the Power button again until the white apple icon appears on your iPhone's screen.

If you're using an iPhone 5 or older, the Power button is on top of the phone.;
, Having Bluetooth on while not connected to a device (e.g., a car's stereo or headphones) can mute your iPhone's audio. To disable Bluetooth, swipe up from the bottom of the screen and tap the blue Bluetooth circle to the right of the Wi-Fi icon.

If swiping up opens the music control tab, swipe right to view the Bluetooth icon.
If the Bluetooth icon is grey rather than blue, your iPhone's Bluetooth is already disabled.

, The problem might actually be with your iPhone's music volume and not your headphone jack. To change playback volume, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the Control Center, swipe left to access the music section, and drag the slider at the bottom of the page right to increase the volume.

Your Control Center may open to the music section.

, Third-party headphones (e.g., any plug-in headphones that didn't come from Apple) can cause the iPhone's headphone jack to jam and get stuck in headphones mode. This problem is fixable either by using Apple headphones or by avoiding plug-in headphones entirely., Bending your plugged-in headphones increases the chances that the headphone plug will break off inside of the headphone jack.

For example, if you're listening to music with your iPhone in your pocket, place your iPhone so that the headphone jack is facing up.

, To avoid moisture or grit build-up in your iPhone, don't leave it in places where dust, dirt, or moisture may accumulate (e.g., the console of your car or inside your desk drawer).

To remove grit or moisture, you can use a can of compressed air or a hair dryer on low respectively.
Often times, iPhones stuck in headphone mode are simply suffering from a dirty headphone jack.

, Not only will having a case on your iPhone protect it from impact damage, it will also increase the space between the iPhone's bottom and the surface on which it rests. This will decrease the chances of lint and dirt ending up inside of your iPhone., To do so, hold down the Power button on the side of your phone's casing and then swipe the slide to power off switch at the top of the screen right.

If you're using an iPhone 5 or older, the Power button is on top of the phone.

, Once dust or grit builds up in your headphone jack, it can cause a whole host of problems such as getting your iPhone's audio stuck on headphones mode or making your headphones malfunction; you can use a Q-tip to remove the aforementioned build-up.If you're using an iPhone 7, you'll need to cut the top three quarters or so off of the Q-tip so that it can fit into the lightning port at the bottom of your phone.

, Do so gently, without forcing the Q-tip., Doing so should remove some of the dust or dirt from your headphone jack.

You may have to repeat this process several times before your iPhone's headphone jack is clean.

, To do so, hold down the Power button on the side of your phone's casing and then swipe the slide to power off switch at the top of the screen right.

If you're using an iPhone 5 or older, the Power button is on top of the phone.

, Some examples include the following:

A paperclip
A needle
A tartar scraper
A toothpick

, Do so at as much of an angle as possible, rather than jamming your tool straight up into the jack--otherwise, you run the risk of damaging the jack further., If a piece of paper, some lint, or an otherwise soft object is lodged in your headphone jack, you can coax it out by repeating this gesture until it eases out of the jack.

Be careful not to apply a lot of force to the sides of your iPhone's headphone jack.
You can also try wrapping a piece of double-sided tape around your object to better capture the object.

, If your headphone plug broke off inside of the iPhone, you can insert a straw around it and gently pry the plug out. Doing so is much less likely to harm your iPhone's headphone jack than using needle nose pliers or tweezers., If you aren't able to remove the lodged object without causing damage to your iPhone, taking it into a Best Buy tech department or an Apple store will likely prove cheaper than replacing the now-broken headphone jack entirely."

, Your text formatting will apply to your current line or paragraph, so you can keep typing and still maintain the formatting. When you tap ""Return"" on your keyboard, the new line will revert to the ""Body"" format.


Tapping ""Return"" while using one of the list formats will create the next entry in the list.

, The Title format is quite large, and very distinct from other text. Use this to create titles for the different sections of the note. The Heading format is a little smaller than the Title format, and is useful for sub-sections.


For example, in a note about remodeling a room, the title of the note could use the Title format (""Remodeling ideas""), while the Header format can be used for the different sections (""To-Do list,"" ""Contractors,"" ""Paint colors,"" etc.)

, You can use the list formats anywhere in your note, so stick lists in where they'll be most useful. You can use the Heading format to create titles for lists.


Use numbered lists for lists where you need to perform actions in order, and bulleted or dash lists for items that don't necessarily need to be in order.

, You can add a whole bunch of different items to your Notes with the new version, including pictures, videos, maps, web pages and more. The Heading format works great for captions. Add captions to help remind you why the item was included in the note.

Visit RadioShack.",How to Get an iPhone," If you're simply using it for business, for example, you probably don't need 128 gigabytes of storage space or a huge screen; on the other hand, you might want to take advantage of some of the nicer features on newer models if you're planning on holding onto your iPhone for the next few years. Some other aspects to consider are:



Locked or unlocked - If you travel internationally, purchasing a carrier unlocked phone will allow you to buy international SIM cards for cheap use as you go. Unlocked phones are more expensive than the phones you'll buy from a carrier, however.

Screen size - The iPhone 5 has a 4-inch screen, as does the newer iPhone SE. By comparison, the iPhone 6, 6S, and 7 have 4.7-inch screens, and the iPhone ""Plus"" models have 5.5-inch screens. If you have trouble seeing items on an iPhone 5's screen, consider buying a phone with a 4.7- or 5.5-inch screen.

Performance - As a general rule, the more RAM an iPhone has, the faster it will respond. The same goes for the iPhone's processing chip--an iPhone with an A9 chip will react to input faster than one with an A8 chip and so on.

Features - While additional features don't matter for business-only phones, you may care about your personal iPhone's camera resolution or storage space. Have your ideal features in mind before researching your iPhone options.;
, You'll likely need to budget for a minimum of $400 if you plan on purchasing one of the three models listed on Apple's site, though you can probably shoot for around $300 if you want to buy a used or older iPhone.


Most carriers will let you purchase an iPhone from them for a fixed monthly fee in addition to your monthly contractual fees. This is a good way to purchase an iPhone if you can't afford the total cost of one up-front.

, As of March 2017, you can purchase the iPhone SE, 6S, and 7 from Apple's website. In order to acquire a phone that can use the current operating system and take advantage of features provided by Apple, you'll want to buy one of the following models.


If you want an older model that will comfortably run the latest software, consider the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus:Pricing - As low as $340 (6) or $445 (6 Plus)

Memory - 1 GB RAM

Storage Space - 16, 64, or 128 GB

Screen Size - 4.7 inches (6) or 5.5 inches (6 Plus)

Resolution - 1334 x 750 pixels (6) or 1920 x 1080 pixels (6 Plus)

Processor - A8 64-bit


For a compact phone with a higher processing speed than the iPhone 6, look at the iPhone SE:


Pricing - As low as $399

Memory - 2 GB RAM

Storage Space - 32 or 128 GB

Screen Size - 4 inches

Resolution - 1136 x 640 pixels

Processor - A9 64-bit


If you want a high-end phone with a fast, motion-sensitive processor, consider the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus:


Pricing - As low as $549 (6S) or $649 (6S Plus)

Memory - 2 GB RAM

Storage Space - 32 or 128 GB

Screen Size - 4.7 inches (6S) or 5.5 inches (6S Plus)

Resolution - 1334 x 750 pixels (6S) or 1920 x 1080 pixels (6S Plus)

Processor - A9 64-bit


For an iPhone built for iOS 10 that is up to forty percent faster than the previous model, learn about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:Pricing - As low as $649 (7) or $769 (7 Plus)

Memory - 2 GB RAM

Storage Space - 32, 128, or 256 GB

Screen Size - 4.7 inches (7) or 5.5 inches (7 Plus)

Resolution - 1334 x 750 pixels (7) or 1920 x 1080 (7 Plus)

Processor - A10 64-bit



, You can usually buy second-hand or surplus iPhone 5 handsets on Amazon or eBay. iPhone models that are several generations old are often heavily discounted, especially if they have been used before; however, there are a few things to keep in mind when considering an older iPhone model:


iPhones older than the iPhone 5 won't support iOS 10, which is the current operating system. This isn't an issue if you simply need an iPhone for casual browsing or texting, but any features outside of basic phone functionality will be severely limited on phones that aren't capable of supporting iOS 10 due to app developers focusing on the latest version of the software.
The iPhone 5 line (iPhone 5, 5S, and 5C) will soon become obsolete because they won't be able to keep up with subsequent renditions of iOS.
Even though iOS 10 is technically supported on the iPhone 5, the phone will suffer from performance issues due to outdated hardware.

, If you're on the fence about buying one of two comparable iPhone models, viewing their specific software and hardware attributes may help you decide. To do so, go to the Apple website and do the following:


Click the iPhones tab at the top of the page.
Click the name of the model in which you're interested.
Click Tech Specs to the left of the ""Buy"" button in the top-right corner of the page.

, Before you embark on a quest to purchase your ideal iPhone, understand that it may not be available from your selected retailer. If you need to buy your iPhone immediately, having a back-up plan will make the experience much less stressful.

, Once you know where the closest Apple store is, you can consider visiting the store itself to purchase an iPhone in-person.


You can also order your phone online from the Apple store website and have it shipped to you.

, You can buy the newest versions of the iPhone at any Apple retail store while supplies last.Sales associates at Apple stores can typically answer your questions in a satisfying and unbiased manner.
When you go into the store to get your iPhone, the sales associate should be able to help you choose a rate plan and carrier that fits your needs.
The employees at the Apple store can also help you set your phone up by transferring contacts, setting up your email, and getting you started on iCloud.
When you go to an Apple store to pick out a phone, make sure you have your current mobile phone, your carrier information, and two forms of identification.

, Shopping online gives you a wide variety of accessories to choose from, and if you have any questions, you can search the Apple online store's help pages.


When you order online, you can have your iPhone ship directly to your home address or you can pick it up at the nearest Apple retail store. While having it shipped to your house will save you the effort of going to the store, picking it up at the store will give you the option of having an Apple store employee help you choose a carrier and rate plan.
If you have additional questions during the shopping process, you can call for help at 1-800-MY-APPLE or use the online chat feature provided on the website.

, You can purchase a carrier-locked or unlocked iPhone from Amazon and have it delivered to your doorstep; additionally, Amazon still stocks older models of iPhone (all the way down to the iPhone 3G for $24) from certified Apple sellers.


You may end up paying more for a newer phone on Amazon than you would in-store.

, When you shop at Best Buy for your iPhone, you can buy any version of the iPhone still being produced. Shop in store or online, and buy an iPhone with a carrier contract or from a no-contract carrier.Best Buy has an upgrade checker that allows you to determine if you are eligible for a new iPhone based on your current carrier plan. You can also trade in your iPhone and get store rewards, and the store staff will set up your iPhone for you so that it will be in working condition when you walk out of the store.

, You can purchase iPhone versions still in production, along with both contract and no-contract mobile plans through Walmart.


Walmart allows you to trade in an old phone for store rewards, and you are also given options in regards to warranty and installation plans.

, RadioShack offers both contract and no-contract plans when you buy your iPhone, and you can also have your pick of any iPhone currently in production. You can shop in store or online.


RadioShack will also help you check to see if you are eligible for an upgrade, and the store has it's own ""trade and save"" program that allows you to earn store credit toward certain products.

The first way is GSM/GPRS represented by a dot. It's the slowest of the connections and has a speed of about 32-114kbps. It is the most common network to find if there is no EDGE network.
The second way is EDGE represented by an E. It's a moderate connection and has a speed of about 400Kbps. It's more common than GPRS so, if you have 3G disabled, you will most probably find an EDGE network.
The third way is 3G. It's represented by its name. It's the best mobile connection and has a speed of about 200-1024Kbps (1Mbps). If you have 3G enabled (by Settings -> General -> Network), you will mostly have 3G which is the fastest of all the connections.
The last, and fastest way is Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi (aka Wireless Internet) is represented by a symbol. If you have Wi-Fi enabled and you're connected to a Wi-Fi Network/Hotspot you will see that symbol. It's speed depends on the ISP and the network. It mostly is 1-24Mbps. The most useful connection - although not mobile. If you want a mobile connection consider having 3G.;

If the answer is either ""No"" or ""Yes, but I can't afford one"" then there are ways to prolong the life of your iPhone until you can afford to buy a new one or it dies. You have to be comfortable, patient and disciplined in using an older iPhone. Comfortable with yourself, patient with the iPhone and disciplined on how you use the iPhone. You won't be able to download the newest apps after a while. It will become slower without an upgrade. But it can still do the basic things when you first got it out of the box. After all, if you remove the 'i' it's still just a phone. If you're ok with this, read on.;
, What do you use you iPhone for? Gaming? Social Media? Business? Lifestyle? It's going to come to a point when your iPhone won't be able to upgrade these apps because the developer has decided to no longer support your iPhone. So, if you're planning on keeping your iPhone, you're going to have let go of these apps. Banking apps are tricky because it's convenient to see on your phone if your pay has gone in or transferring money into another account when you're caught at the shops. You can do phone banking or go online, but it's not practical. You quickly see how much we rely on technology, so how much can you do without? Look at your priorities. An app that you use a lot for your business is more taxing than say 'Angry Birds'. Delete the apps you don't really need and keep upgrading the ones you do.

, How much more time have you got left on it? If your contract is up, then upgrade if you must. But it is nice to have that extra cash in your pocket now you own the phone, isn't it? It's your choice. But remember to measure up the differences. An iPhone 5C is similar to an iPhone 5, except for that pretty coloured plastic case. Are the exit fees in your contract worth that pretty coloured case? Didn't think so. Unless you're carelessly wealthy, there isn't enough reasons to upgrade to the latest when you bought the latest last year. And don't fall for marketing hype. Fingerprint technology is great for security... but then so is putting a pin number on your phone. An A7 processor is only as good as the app it is built for... which is probably in the process of development.

, Have you been looking after your iPhone? Is there any signs of wear, have you got a broken screen, maybe need a new cover or some screen covers or cables? Buy them now. Get them fixed. It's good to have everything working and in fresh condition. Buy your hardware items as soon as possible. Some items may already be in clearance due to the public release of a new iPhone, but better to get them now when you can't at all.

, Have you upgraded your iPhone recently? Get the closest upgrade you can get for your phone model ASAP. Obviously you are reading this because your phone no longer supports the new iOS 7,8,9, etc. But have the confidence and preparation knowing your iPhone can do it's best with what it has. Ideally do it before the new release of the latest iPhone comes out, or on the upgrade date iTunes recommends. A word on speed: Over time your iPhone will get slower. Most say around 18-24 months of the life of the iPhone. There is some theories as to why. Conspiracy with Apple that they programmed them that way and so on. A simpler explanation is that everything you do on your little phone is logged in it's processor and over time it makes it harder to retain all this information while trying to run 'Call of Duty'. It's too hard on the poor thing. If this does happen, it may be a good idea to restore your iPhone back to its factory settings, then load all your stuff back on the phone. Use this link from Apple for help. Remember to look after your little iPhone and in turn should give you years back. **Note: If you do choose to restore your iPhone, remember to back up all your information on your computer first, especially photos (which isn't backed up via iTunes) and other information that could be stored in apps, like passwords or pictures. If you have a favourite gaming app, be aware that there is the potential of losing your level in the game.

",How to Keep Your iPhone Sexy," Most popular is the front right trouser. Only iPhone – no keys or wallet – no scratching and bulges other than the iPhone. For the people that we know who strictly follow this rule, they have seriously reduced the risk of losing or damaging their iPhone.;
, It is a wise move to get a good iPhone insurance cover to insure your iPhone. Use Google to locate good iPhone insurance cover.

, Despite anti-scratch screen the back is very scratchable

, Apps backup, contact book in Outlook etc. When you plug it into your computer go to “My Computer” and locate the iPhone and copy and paste your images and files onto your computer. Also use iTunes to automatically backup and synchronize your details, addresses and data as soon as it is connected. It would be horrible to lose your photos or data.

,, Hold it firmly with your full hand while using it. Be aware of idiosyncratic and very recognizable white earphones. These are a sign to potential thieves that you have an iPhone or iPod in your pocket. Keep it hidden where possible. 28% of all street involves a phone.

, This does create a slight increase in size but it is far more likely to survive a fall. While the screen is resilient to scratching, with the rest of the iPhone is pot-luck as to whether it will survive a fall or not. It just depends how it falls. Sometimes it miraculously takes a massive tumble yet comes out largely unscathed – yet other times one simple pocket drop and it lands badly on its corner and shatters the screen or similar. A case will help prevent this.

Consider sewing an old necktie into an iPhone pouch.,
Measure out the pouch.,
Cut the tie straight across where you marked with the sharpie.,
Sew the bottom of the ""pouch"" shut.,
Attach the snap button using a snap fastener.,
Button your iPhone into its new case.",How to Make Your Own iPhone Case1," This method is perfect if you're looking for a stylish way to carry your iPhone, but you aren't concerned with using the phone while it's inside the case. This is a great opportunity to ""upcycle"" and re-purpose something that you might otherwise throw away.To make your iPhone pouch, you will need:


A necktie that matches or exceeds the width of your phone. Pick out a tie that catches your eye. If you don't have any vintage neckties lying around your house, you should be able to find something suitable at a thrift shop or a vintage clothing store.
Sharp fabric scissors or a rotary cutter.
A ruler.
A sharpie.
A cutting board.
A needle and thread, or a sewing machine. Pick a thread that complements the color of the tie.
A decorative snap button or a traditional ""buttonhole"" button. You may be able to remove a button from an old piece of clothing. Otherwise, you should be able to find a button or a set of buttons at any arts-and-crafts or fabric store.
A snap fastener or snap fastening pliers. This is only necessary if you want to put a snap-shut button on your iPhone pouch, rather than a traditional ""buttonhole"" button. You should be able to find these tools at an arts-and-crafts or fabric store.;
, Fold over the large pointed end of the tie, and use the ruler to measure from the straight edge that this creates. This edge will become the top of your pouch.









Use a sharpie to mark off a space that will fit your iPhone. This may be anywhere from five to seven inches. Slide your iPhone inside the tie to make sure that you have marked out a large enough pouch.
Leave an extra half-inch for a seam at the bottom of your pouch.

, You should be left with the large end of the tie. Turn this cut piece inside-out.









Leave the inner lining of the tie in place if you'd like the extra padding for your phone. If not, feel free to remove it with scissors.

, Stitch a straight line to close the end of the pouch, leaving about a half-inch of space along the edge that you severed from the rest of the tie. Now you should have an iPhone-shaped pouch.









Consider folding the corners in and sewing them down to give your pouch rounded edges.
Trim the excess fabric from the bottom of the pouch, and turn it right-side-out again.

, Secure the bottom (""receiving"" end) of the snap in place through the fabric in the front of the pouch, about a quarter-inch down from the ""V"" of the pouch opening.









Affix the other end of the snap button to the outside of the pouch flap, right at the tip of the tie. Make sure that the two halves of the snap button line up evenly before you attach them.
Refer to the directions on the snap button package to make sure that you're assembling the pieces correctly.
If you want to use a traditional ""buttonhole"" button, simply sew the button where you would fasten the receiving end of the snap: about a quarter-inch down from the ""V"" of the pouch opening. Use fabric scissors to cut a slit in the pouch slap where the top of the snap button would sit. The slit should be as long as the diameter of the button that you are using.
Consider using Velcro to the same effect. You should be able to find a strip of Velcro at an arts-and-crafts store. Simply replace the top and the bottom of the snap clasp with the two parts of a Velcro clasp. Cut the Velcro into small squares and carefully glue it to the fabric.

, Make sure that the phone fits snugly into the pouch, and make sure that it cannot slip out.









If you are going out and you don't need to take a large bag, you can slip cash and a photo ID into the pouch along with your iPhone. This case functions as a stylish, compact on-the-go carrier.

Consider crafting a custom iPhone case out of duct tape.This particular design includes a sturdy flap to hold your iPhone in place, as well as a plastic ""window"" that will allow you to use your touchscreen while the phone is inside.,
Measure the width of the plastic screen cover.,
Take the iPhone out of the slipcover.,
Put the iPhone back into the case.,
Cut four strips of duct tape, each as long as the height of your phone.,
Attach the duct tape to the slip case.,
Turn the slip case over so that the duct tape covers the entire sharpie-marked ""back"" of the case.,
Make another duct tape sheet for the front of the case.,
Stick the duct tape sheet to the front of the slip case.,
Make a flap for your case.,
Neaten up the top of the case.,
Neaten up the bottom of the case.,
Consider thickening the flap of your case.,
Mark where the microphone and the headphone jack of your iPhone will fit when the phone is in the case.,
Punch holes for the microphone and the headphone jack.,
Put the iPhone in the case.",How to Make Your Own iPhone Case2," This may not look as professional as other cases, but it will protect your phone while preserving its functionality. You will need:


Duct tape. You will not need much. Feel free to use classic grey duct tape or to spice up your design with more colorful duct tape.
A plastic CD slip case. Make sure that the case is flimsy, clear plastic; this will cover the screen of your iPhone, and you want to be able to use your screen through it. If you don't have a CD case,you can use a small sandwich bag or any other thick, transparent plastic.
Scissors or a craft knife.
A ruler.
A sharpie.

, Put your iPhone into the CD slip case. Push one long side of the phone up to the sealed bottom of the case, and use a sharpie to mark how far the other side extends into the case.









This will ensure that your screen cover perfectly fits your particular iPhone. You will cover up most of this plastic with duct tape.

, Use a ruler to draw a straight line through the sharpie mark you made, parallel to the opening of the slip case. Cut along this line, carefully, with a pair of scissors.









This should cut the slip case roughly in half. Keep the half with the sealed bottom: this will become the screen cover for your iPhone case.

, On the plastic slip case, mark out the edges of the iPhone screen. You will want to cover up everything but the screen with duct tape, so it's important to know where the screen sits.









Take the iPhone out and draw a rectangle on the slipcover to mark exactly where the screen fits.
Consider marking the circular ""Home"" button as a reference for how your iPhone will fit. Don't worry about the marks; you will use the other side of the slipcover for your screen. These marks are only for measuring purposes.

, Lay them out with the sticky side up. Overlap these pieces to form a rectangular ""sheet"" of duct tape.









It is important that your duct tape sheet is no higher than the height of your phone. When you stick your slip case to this duct tape, no duct tape should protrude over the top or bottom of the case.
Make sure that each side of the sheet is perfectly straight. Use scissors to trim the duct tape where necessary.

, Turn the slip case over so that the sharpie marks face downward. Carefully stick the sealed edge of the slip case to the edge of the duct tape sheet.









Align the edge of the duct tape sheet with one of the lines you drew to mark the vertical edge of your iPhone's screen. The duct tape should not cover the screen.

, Trim the duct tape sheet on the long end: the remainder of the sheet should be about 5 millimeters longer than the uncovered edge of the slip case.









Fold this five-millimeter length of tape over the open edge of the slipcover so that it fits neatly inside. This should give you a neat edge where the duct tape ends.

, This sheet should be roughly 110 mm (4.33 inches) long on one side, and only a couple of millimeters shorter than the height of the slip case on the other side.









Neatly trim this sheet so that each side is perfectly straight.

, Align the edge of the duct tape sheet with the other line that you drew to mark the vertical edge of the screen--this should be the side that's closest to the open end of the slip case.









Make sure that the duct tape sheet doesn't overhang on either the top or the bottom of the plastic slip case.
Turn the entire case over so that the sticky side of the duct tape sheet is facing upward. The ""window"" for the iPhone screen--the front of the case--should be facing down into your work surface.

, It's time to fold the duct tape sheet together. Take the right-hand edge of the duct tape sheet and stick it just inside the slip case, aligning it with the line you drew to mark the iPhone's screen.









This flap will hold your iPhone in place inside the case. Make sure that the flap is long enough.
Use the iPhone screen marking as a reference only. Stick the edge of the duct tape sheet to the opposite side of the slip case opening--the bottom edge of the opening, if the marks are on the top.
Be methodical. Before you press the sticky insides of the folded duct tape sheet together, make sure that the end of the sheet is tucked securely into the case. Make sure that the end of the sheet is perfectly lined up with the opening of the slip case.
Try to make the fold as neat as possible. A few wrinkles and creases will not impair the function.

, Stick a piece of duct tape along the line that you drew to mark the top of the iPhone screen.









Half of the tape strip should stick up above the slip case.
Align the left-hand side of the duct tape strip with the ""sealed"" left-hand side of the plastic slip case. Trim the duct tape strip to match the right-hand edge of the flap.
Flip the case over. Cut the duct tape strip into two parts, along the line created by the opening of the case, and then fold each side of the strip down against the back of the case. If you do not make this cut, then the duct tape strip will block the opening of your case.

, Stick a piece of duct tape along the line that you drew to mark the bottom of the iPhone screen.









Half of the tape strip should stick out below the slip case.
Align the left-hand side of the duct tape strip with the ""sealed"" left-hand side of the plastic slip case. Trim the duct tape strip to match the right-hand edge of the flap.
Again, flip the case over. Cut the duct tape strip into two parts, along the line created by the opening of the case, and then fold each side of the strip down against the back of the case.

, If you creased and wrinkled the flap of your case while you were folding it, an extra layer of duct tape will cover up the creases. Extra duct tape will make the flap more substantial.









Simply wrap another strip of duct tape along the length of the flap. Trim any overhanging tape away from the strip so that the flap still tucks neatly.
Do not make your flap too thick--make sure that you can easily fold it into the case!

, You will punch small holes into the case to allow the use of these functions. Turn the case so that the plastic ""window"" is facing up, and lay your iPhone on top of it.









Microphone: On the bottom of your iPhone, look for two oblong, mesh-filled holes on either side of the charging connector. The hole on the right is the microphone. Using a sharpie pen, place a small mark on the bottom edge of the case where the microphone will sit.
Headphone jack: Find the hole for your headphone jack on the top of your iPhone, and place a small mark along the top edge of the case where the jack will sit.

, Use a hole punch for a clean cut; in a pinch, consider simply poking a hole through the duct tape with a sharp object. Punch out each marking that you made--one for the microphone and one for the headphone jack.









Try to punch the holes such that you only bite a semi-circle out of the edge of the case. This way, you'll punch out the back and the front of the case at once, creating a clean, round hole.
The essential thing is that the microphone is not muffled, and that you are able to fit a headphone plug into the headphone jack.

, You should be able to see the screen clearly through the plastic ""window"", and the flap of the case should extend to the right of the front of the phone.









Tuck the flap into the back of the iPhone case to secure your phone in place. If you made the flap long enough, it should stay in place on its own.
Enjoy! You should be able to use the touchscreen of your iPhone while it's inside the case.

Wait for the paint, glue, or decoupage to dry.",How to Make Your Own iPhone Case3," You should be able to find cases in most stores that sell iPhones, though you may also purchase them online. You can use glue, paint, and other materials to decorate the surface of a plain iPhone case.


Decide whether you want a soft (plastic/rubber) or hard (plastic or aluminum) case. Hard cases look sharp and sleek, and they may provide a smoother surface for decoration. Soft cases are more flexible, but they may tear more easily. Plastic cases may be more likely to crack under stress than metal cases, although you can find hard polycarbonate plastic cases that are built to absorb the impact of being dropped.If you want to experiment, consider buying the cheapest case that you can find. That way, if you don't like the result, you didn't spend too much money. Basic plastic cases are often cheaper than metal cases and ""heavy-duty"" cases.
If you are worried about dropping your phone, consider using a heavy-duty, shockproof, or ""rugged"" case as the base for your creation. These models are usually more expensive than plain cases, but they may protect your phone from the hazards of everyday use.

, Consider what you want your custom iPhone case to say about you. Before you begin to decorate the case, sketch out your design on a piece of scratch paper. This will help you perfect your vision, and it will give you a template to work from.









Consider writing your favorite quote onto the back of the case. You can do this with paint, stickers, permanent marker, or cut-out decoupage letters.
Consider drawing your favorite animal, your favorite anime character, or the logo of your favorite sports team. Try tracing the image onto a piece of paper before you move it to your iPhone case.
If planning isn't your style, then choose a medium (e.g. paint, decoupage, stickers, glitter glue) and improvise! Take it slow, and carefully consider each new addition. It may be very difficult to remove certain types of paint and glue.

, Consider what you'll need in order to make your design come to life. You will need some sort of adhesive--glue, paint, tape, etc.--to make your materials stick to the iPhone case.



Paint: You can find acrylic paint in a variety of colors at most arts-and-crafts stores. Watercolor and oil paints will not stick well to the surface of an iPhone case. Consider buying a paintbrush or a set of brushes; you may also try painting with Q-tips, sponges, or other absorbent household items.
Nail polish: Consider using nail polish to cheaply paint your iPhone case. If you don't already own the colors you need, you should be able to find an assortment of polish at a local drugstore. Be sure to have polish remover or rubbing alcohol on hand to clean up any mistakes!

Glue: If you want to attach any shapes or objects to your iPhone case, you'll need some type of glue. Any standard craft glue should suffice--but if you are committed to your design, consider using superglue or a hot glue gun for a long-lasting attachment. Keep superglue and hot glue away from your skin, and use them only sparingly.

Decoupage: Arrange paper shapes or pictures on the outside of your iPhone case, then brush a thin layer of decoupage glue over the surface to seal them in place. You can buy pre-mixed decoupage glue (e.g. Mod Podge) from an arts-and-crafts store, or you can make your own decoupage from regular craft glue by mixing 3/4 cup glue with 1/4 cup water.Stickers: Consider incorporating stickers into your design. Stickers are easy to apply and relatively easy to remove, but bear in mind that they may wear down more quickly than other decorations as they rub against fingers, fabric, and other surfaces. You make your own stickers using glue, packing tape, or sticker paper.
Glitter: Consider using glitter or glitter glue to jazz up your iPhone case. You will need to use an adhesive (e.g. glue, paint, tape) to make the glitter stick to the case. Consider using glitter with acrylic paint. Be careful: glitter rubs off easily and gets everywhere. You may find glitter in your purse, your pockets, your hair, and beyond.

Jewels: Consider bedazzling your cell phone with rhinestones, costume jewels, or other fake gems. You can find faux jewels at costume shops and arts-and-crafts stores. Some rhinestones come with peel-away adhesive backing, but otherwise you will need to use superglue to attach your gems.
Consider mixing media. There is no reason why you can't combine acrylic paint with stickers, decoupage with glitter, or rhinestones with all of the above. Get creative and dream big!

, Find a clean workspace, and give yourself plenty of time to unleash your creative flow.









Work carefully and methodically. Work from your sketch. Keep a small towel on hand to quickly wipe away any excess paint or glue before it dries.
Be sure to put down a layer or two of newspaper before you begin. If you work on top of the newspaper, you won't need to worry about spilling paint or glue onto any household surfaces.

, Leave the case alone for at least a few hours before you slip it onto your iPhone.


Do not touch paint until you are absolutely sure that it's dry. Even the slightest touch can leave an imprint that ruins your design.
Enjoy! Remember that once your decorations dry, you can always paint over your design if you don't like it.

The Power button is on the top of the right side of most iPhones, though you'll find it on the very top if you're using an iPhone 5 or older.;
, SIM cards have gotten smaller over the years, and older iPhones may not support newer SIM cards (and vice versa). Make sure that your SIM card will fit in the iPhone you are using.


iPhone 5 and up use a Nano SIM (12.3mm x 8.8mm).
iPhone 4 and 4S use a Micro SIM (15mm x 12mm).
iPhone 3G, 3GS, and original use a Standard SIM (25mm x 15mm).

, For most iPhones, the SIM card tray is located along the right side of the iPhone, about halfway down.iPhone 3G, 3GS, and original have SIM card slots along the top of the iPhone.
Every iPhone model except the iPhone 4 CDMA (A1349 Verizon/Sprint) has a SIM card slot.

, Many phones come with a SIM eject tool, which is a tool with a small pointy end that allows you to release the SIM tray. If you don't have this tool anymore, you can straighten a paperclip instead.

, With a little force, the SIM tray should pop out a little bit.

, Do so gently, since both the SIM card and its tray are fragile.

, Because of the indentation on the card, you should only be able to place the new card in the tray in one way. If you aren't sure, just insert it the same way the original card was, with the gold contacts facing down.

, The tray will only insert one way.


Make sure the tray is all the way back in the iPhone before continuing.

, Doing so will turn your iPhone back on. Your iPhone should connect to its new network automatically, though you may first be prompted to activate it.

, Depending on your carrier's data plan, you may not see the activation prompt until you connect to Wi-Fi., If your iPhone isn't activating over Wi-Fi, using a computer with internet access may invoke the activation process. To do so:


Plug your iPhone into your computer using the USB charging cable. If it doesn't automatically launch, open iTunes.
Wait for iTunes to activate your SIM for you.

, In the event that your iPhone simply won't recognize the SIM card, restoring your iPhone may prompt the SIM to activate upon restarting.

, Provided your phone still won't activate the new SIM card, calling your carrier (e.g., AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint) may be your only option. Once they verify your account ownership, you'll be able to ask your carrier about the new SIM; if the problem isn't simple enough to diagnose over the phone, you'll probably have to take your phone into a carrier store to have it examined or set up for you.

Replace your SIM tray.",How to Prepare to Sell Your iPhone," The large end of the cable should fit into your computer's USB slot, while the smaller end should fit in your iPhone's Lightning port (the charging port).


Use the USB cable that came with your iPhone for best results.;
, While the iTunes program should open automatically after you plug your iPhone in, you may have to manually open it.

, The bar at the top of your iTunes window will tell you how many steps remain in the process; after your iPhone finishes syncing, you can back up your iPhone.

, This icon resembles an iPhone and is located beneath the ""Account"" tab; clicking it will open your iPhone's summary menu., This will back up your phone's data. When it comes time to restore this data, you'll use this backup to transfer your phone's data over to a new device.


If you have automatic backups enabled, you don't need to back up again--your phone will have done so when you plugged it into your computer. Check the date of the latest backup under the ""Backups"" section to confirm that your phone's data backed up.
When backing up your phone, you can choose either iCloud, which backs up your phone to your iCloud account, or ""This computer"", which saves your phone's data on your current computer.

, Now that you've backed up your data, it's time to sign out of your iCloud account.

, The Settings app resembles a grey gear.

, You'll need to scroll down to reach this option; tapping it will open the iCloud settings menu.

, This is located at the very bottom of the iCloud settings menu.

, This will confirm that you're ready to sign out of iCloud., This will definitively sign your iPhone out of iCloud, erasing all of your iCloud-stored notes from your iPhone in the process.


You'll be able to get these notes back when you sign into your iCloud account again.

, If your backup is in iCloud and you're still signed in when you erase your iPhone, you can inadvertently erase your backup file.


If you don't see your name or an Apple ID at the top of the iCloud settings menu, you've successfully signed out of iCloud.

, This will return you to the Settings main menu.

, You'll find this toward the top of the Settings menu.

, This should be at the bottom of the General menu.

, This will prompt you to enter a passcode if you have one enabled.

, This will prompt a warning regarding the ramifications of deleting your iPhone's data.

, Before doing this, you should have backed up your iPhone to iTunes or iCloud and then signed out of iCloud.

, This will begin erasing your iPhone's data.


If you have ""Find My iPhone"" enabled, you might need to enter your Apple ID and password before your iPhone will begin erasing your data., The best way to remove your SIM card is to take your iPhone to your current carrier; if that isn't an option, you can remove your SIM card with a paperclip. Holding down the Lock button is the first step in powering down your iPhone.

, This should be at the top of the screen; doing so will turn off your iPhone.

, You'll need to access the SIM card slot, which is beneath the Lock button on the right side of your iPhone when looking at the screen.The SIM card slot is also on the right side of iPhones newer than the iPhone 3, regardless of Lock button placement.

, You should see a small hole on the right edge of your iPhone. The SIM card holds all of your carrier data, so you'll need to transfer your card over to your new smartphone.

, The SIM tray should pop open.


You can also use any similarly-proportioned item, such as a needle, a pin, or a SIM removal tool.

, Be gentle when doing this, since the SIM card is fragile.


Until you have a new phone, store your SIM card in a ziploc bag or an airtight container for safekeeping.
If your new phone uses a different SIM card model than the one you're selling, you'll need to take your SIM card into a carrier store and have them transfer the data for you.

, Again, be careful when doing this--don't force it back into place. You are now ready to sell your iPhone!

You can follow these instructions on a PC or a Mac, as long as you have music in your iTunes library. , The maximum length of a ringtone is 30 seconds, so you’ll really just be choosing a great 30 second segment of a song based on your personal preference.


When you’ve found it, write down (on paper or in another window) the time your chosen segment begins. The exact time is right beneath the song information at the top of the screen. If the part you like begins when the timer is at 1:40, that’s the number you’ll write down.
Now, decide where the segment will end. Keeping the 30-second limitation in mind, start your song at the time you wrote down previously and press the pause button where you want to stop. Write down the stop point timer number. For example, you may want to end the song at 2 minutes and 5 seconds in. In that case, write 2:05.

, Click and drag right from the library in iTunes. You can do this on a Mac or PC.

, ⌘ Cmd+Click (right-click on a PC) the file on the desktop and select “Rename.” You will now change the file name—type the name of the song (or whatever you’d like your ringtone to be called) followed by .m4r. For example, “UnclePhranc.m4r” if the name of your song is “Uncle Phranc.” The extension .m4r will convert your file to a ringtone. , Double-click on the .m4r file and it will be added to iTunes as a ringtone.
