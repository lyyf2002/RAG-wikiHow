, Once you have your iPhone, press and hold the power/lock button on the top side to switch it off to avoid any possible short circuits.

, Wipe off excess water from the body of the phone. Once it’s all dried up, get a hair blow dryer and blow off any water that might be left between the gaps or holes on your device. Do this for a couple of minutes to make sure that you’ve removed any moisture on the outside.


If you don’t have a hair blow dryer, you could try blowing through the gaps and ports of the phone, or leave it at the front of an electric fan for a few minutes to remove any moisture left.

, Take three to five cups of uncooked rice and put inside a plastic bag or a zip lock. Make sure that you have enough rice to submerge your iPhone.

, Make sure that your iPhone is completely covered with rice, then seal the bag of rice with a string or its zip lock. Uncooked rice is good at absorbing moisture. The rice inside the bag will try to absorb any water that may have leaked in the inside of your iPhone, removing any moisture that may damage its circuit board.

, Although rice is good at taking in moisture, it will take time before it can absorb all the water from your iPhone. Leave it for at least two days inside without opening the bag to make sure that your iPhone’s all dry.

, After two days, take your iPhone out of the bag and press the power/lock button to switch it on. You’ll find that your device’s working like nothing happened.

Power on your iPhone.",How to Repair an iPhone from Water Damage," The longer your phone stays submerged, the more chance it has of shorting out. Quick reflexes can mean the difference between a working phone and a dead one.;
, To do so, press and hold the Power button, then slide the button at the top of the screen right when prompted. The sooner you can turn off your iPhone, the higher its chances of recovery will be.


If the screen is off but you're not sure if the phone is on, quickly press the Power button to see if the screen turns on. If it does, proceed to power the phone off. If it doesn't, leave it off.

, If your iPhone has a case, it may be holding in moisture; removing the case will allow the phone to breathe.

, To do so, insert a SIM removal tool or an unbent paperclip into the SIM tray's hole to pop the SIM tray out. Completely remove the tray so that water can escape.

, Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent cloth. Make sure to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume keys, the headphone jack and any other crevices.

, Get a thin piece of cotton, like an old shirt, and wrap a single layer around the end of a toothpick. Use this to absorb any excess water from the charging port and headphone jack.

, The best way to get rid of the water inside of your iPhone is to simply let it air dry in a warm place for as long as possible.


Many guides will report that placing your iPhone in a bag of rice will help draw the water out. This has been proven false--simply letting your iPhone air dry is the most effective way to fix it.Air drying will be more effective if you are able to remove the battery from the iPhone.

, The longer you can wait, the more successful your drying process will be. If you can wait longer than 48 hours, 72 hours may be even more effective.








, Each iPhone has a small indicator that tells repair technicians that the phone has received water damage. The indicator is a piece of plastic that turns red when it comes in contact with too much water. You can check this indicator yourself to see if your phone may be damaged. Use a flashlight to help you see inside the port. This indicator usually means that you likely won't qualify for free repair, in which case you may want to consider fixing the phone yourself.iPhone 5 and up - Look for a red indicator in the SIM tray port on the screen side of the phone.
iPhone 4S - Look for a red indicator in the charging port or in the headphone jack.

, Backing up your iPhone as soon as possible will ensure that, even if your iPhone quits working a few days later, its information can be installed on a new device., A common symptom of water damage is a non-working Home button; you can bypass this issue by enabling the ""AssistiveTouch"" accessibility option that places shortcuts for hardware buttons on your screen.


AssistiveTouch will also allow you to lock your screen, alter your phone's volume, and take screenshots.

, If water damage has caused your iPhone's headphone jack to malfunction, you may need to use an alternative audio output device instead of traditional headphones.


Try to connect a USB dock that is compatible with your iPhone to the charging port at the bottom of your iPhone. It should be detected automatically.
If your phone's charging port won't recognize input, you won't be able to charge your phone.

, If your power button stops working, powering your iPhone on and off becomes very difficult. You’ll need to keep it charged and turned on to keep using it.


If your iPhone runs out of battery and shuts off, it will turn on again when you plug it into power.
On phones with the ""Raise to Wake"" feature enabled, simply picking up your iPhone will turn on the screen.

, Standard AppleCare does not always cover water damage, but you may be able to get your phone serviced if it is new enough or you get a nice representative.

, To do so, press and hold the Power button, then slide the button at the top of the screen right when prompted.

, Take the SIM card tray and the SIM card out before you begin taking apart the iPhone.

, You’ll need a pentalobe (5-prong) screwdriver to remove the screws. The screws can be found to the left and right of the charging port.








, A strong suction cup is one of the easier ways to remove the front part of the iPhone body. This will prevent scratches when trying to pry the halves apart.


Place a suction cup on the front, and hold the back of the case with your other hand.
Once the suction cup is applied, pull it apart from the back half.

, Set the battery off to the side for now.








, There are several cable connectors that will need to be removed before you can access the logic board. Some of these will be pried off while others may require a Phillips screwdriver.

, Once you’ve completely detached the logic board, you can remove it from the plastic housing.








, Let it soak until any visible residue has become loose.








, Make sure to clean all contacts and connectors. Scrub the chips on the logic board. Repeat the cleaning process if necessary.

, Make sure the logic board is completely dry. If it is still damp, you may cause more damage when you try to turn it on.








, Wiping down the LCD screen can remove any liquid residue. Avoid submerging the screen, as this can cause permanent damage to the display.








, Isopropyl alcohol will take a little while to completely dry, so leave all of your components out for at least four hours before reassembling the iPhone.








, Put your iPhone back together by replacing all of the connectors and reinserting the screws in the reverse order that you took them out in.








, If you’re sure that the iPhone is dry, you can try powering it on. If you performed a thorough cleaning and the parts weren’t too corroded, the phone may work again."

Learn what your iPhone is capable of doing, even without a subscription to a phone service.,
Know what your device will no longer be able to do, unless another active SIM card is implanted.,
Consider what practical uses will work for you.,
Know what to do if you choose to sell your device:


Transfer all the data from your device onto your PC, Mac, or iCloud.,
Give it away for free.",How to Make Your Old iPhone Useful," Some stores may pressure you to trade it in or recycle it. But your old iPhone is worth a lot more than you can be offered.;
, This way, under iCloud, you will have a way to distinguish the devices.

, Some things it is capable of doing include:


Internet access in a WiFi zone
Photography
Videography
Almost all apps will continue to be useful

Many games depend on 'accounts' that are device-specific and cannot be transferred to another device



, This includes:


Phone calls over the cellular network
Internet access over a 3G network

Will not be useful as a navigational device unless you have MiFi in the car



, Some practical uses include:


As an extra camera, if you need a lot of camera space, and your current device cannot hold all the pictures you plan to take before you plan to delete them.
As a video camera simultaneously with your other phone. This way, you can take still photos with one device while filming with the other. Be sure to hold the phone you are using for filming in the 'landscape' position for better results.
For multitasking. If one device cannot perform two tasks simultaneously, you can perform one task with one device and another task with the other. (e.g. using Maps on one, Skype on the other). If you are not in a WiFi zone, the older phone will be limited to uses not dependent on a connection.
As a music player. You can use the device just like an iPod, storing your favorite music purchased from iTunes. If that is going to be your only use for the device, try removing as many photos, videos, and apps as possible, and you will have more room for songs.
For international travel. Most smartphone owners find it hard not to use their devices or to have limited use of them. But once you step out of your home country, talk, text, and data can become prohibitively expensive. For a more affordable price, you can rent a SIM card that can be placed in the old iPhone that can provide your with reasonably priced (sometimes free) minutes and texts and plenty of data, sometimes unlimited. iPhone SIM card rentals are now available from many companies for many countries. You may need to get your phone unlocked for this to work. Once you get your SIM card and find yourself in a foreign land, you can use your device like there is no tomorrow!
To keep an older version of iOS. This is especially good for those who like iOS 5, which has the old version of Google Maps.
To store more apps that do not require an internet connection for their use, such as games. This could be useful if you need more room on your current phone. And most games do not depend on an internet connection.
For jailbreaking, if you wish to enjoy the benefits of a jailbroken device. Jailbreaking voids the warranty. But once your device has finished its contract, it is likely the warranty will be expired.
As an emergency replacement phone. In the event your current phone is lost, stolen, or damaged, and you do not a warranty of insurance to replace it before your next upgrade, you can reactivate your old phone.

,
Wipe the device's contents. This is very important for your own security.

Check prices of similar devices of comparable age on the site on which you plan to sell (e.g. Amazon, eBay, Craigslist). This will help you decide on a competitive rate.
Include at least one charger together with the device. If not, this may reduce the device's rate. The rate could increase if you include other accessories, such as a car charger or hands-free device.

, Maybe you are a little more generous than someone trying to make a buck. If that is the case, you could give it to a relative, friend, or even a complete stranger. This way, you can help do a good deed and save its next owner some money. The upcoming owner can subsequently subscribe to a contract-free plan with a carrier of choice with the option or changing carriers at will throughout the life of the device. For your own security, before making your donation, be sure to back up and remotely wipe all your data.

Take the phone out of the water.,
Unplug it.,
Turn the phone off.,
Take out the sim card.,
Wipe it down with a towel.,
Remove water from the ports.,
Pick a type of drying element.,
Submerge the phone.,
Leave it to dry.,
Replace the sim card.,
Try turning it on.",How to Dry Out a Wet iPhone," While this step is logical, you may start to panic as soon as you drop it in the water. Calm down, and pull it out as quickly as you can., If the phone happens to be plugged in, unplug it as soon as possible. Be careful when doing so, as you don't want to electrocute yourself.That is, be sure not to get your fingers near the connection. Hold the phone in one hand, and pull out the charger by grasping the cord several inches down. Normally, you don't want to pull from the cord because it ends up fraying it, but in this case, you need to do so to keep yourself from being electrocuted.

, Ideally, you'd want to remove the battery first. Since you can't do that with an iPhone, the next best thing is to turn off the phone as soon as possible., You'll need a paperclip or the sim card tool.Find the sim card tray on your iPhone. It is usually along the right side of the phone. You'll notice a small hole.Insert the paperclip or tool into the hole. The sim card tray will pop out. Leave the whole tray out for now., Run a towel over your device to dry the outside of the device as quickly as possible.You can also run it over the ports to help draw out the water.

, Try shaking out the water.You can also carefully blow out water with compressed air. However, you definitely do not want to blow it back inside the phone, so be careful.To use compressed air, hold the can of air so that it's blowing across the hole rather than into it. Spray the air, and the water should jet out the other side.

, Some people use regular rice to dry it out, but that is not the most effective option. Instant rice is somewhat better, but it an also get rice in the ports.A better option is silica gel. Silica gel is what comes in the little packets along with many electronic items. It absorbs water better than rice. You can try gathering enough from your home or trying purchasing them from a craft store. You'll need enough to surround the phone.A final option is a drying pouch, specifically designed for this purpose. You can find them online or at electronics stores.If you can't find enough silica gel packets, you can try crystallized kitty litter, which is essentially the same thing.Some tests show that it may be best just to leave the phone in open air rather than trying to submerge it in a drying agent., If you use rice, protect your phone from the rice by wrapping it in a paper towel before submerging it.Submerge the phone in a bowl of rice. For the silica gel packets, surround the phone with as many of them as you have.For a drying pouch, simply drop the phone in the bag, and seal the pouch., Let the phone dry for at least 2 days.You want to make sure the inside components are dry. Otherwise, you can short it out when you turn it on.

, Insert the sim card tray back into the phone. Make sure it goes in the same way it came out.

, After it is completely dry, you can try turning it on again. If you're lucky, it will work, and you can continue using your phone."

Plug your RFXcom transmitter into a mains socket and into a spare port on your wireless router using the Cat5e cable.,
Install Lantronix DeviceInstaller onto your PC (DI_4.3.0.3_Web.exe).,
Run DeviceInstaller.,
Make a note of the IP address listed for your transmitter.,Now that you have the ip address of your transmitter, install and run RFtransmitter.exe again found on the cd.,
Click the top left icon,you should now see this:


Input is your transmitters ip address in the ip box.,Now select the button '48 bits mode' in the row 'Don’t use XRTS-XCTS' The transmitter should respond with an ACKnowledge '37'.,
If you have HomeEasy or Byebyestandy devices with the address wheel style identification, go to the X10 lighting tab and select 'Enable KlikAan-KlikUit RF'.,
If you have the newer HomeEasy devices go to the HomeEasy tab and select the device to control in Device and Unit.,
If you do not have a HE unit paired yet with RFtransmitter you can do now.,
Now you should be able to control all of your devices using the RFtransmitter program.,
You now need to log into your HomeAutom8 account(www.homeautom8.com) and click '+property'.,
Click the tab for the property you have just set up.,
Click '+Add a new device' for the room you wish to start on.,
Download and run the HomeAutom8 test client, which can be found under the downloads tab on the HomeAutom8 website.,
Once you are happy everything is working as it should be, run the iAutom8 app on your iPhone/iPod touch (Available from the App store), input your login details and you should then be able to control your devices.

","How to Control Your HomeEasy, Byebyestandby and Other Home Automation Equipment Using Your iPhone",";
, This can be found on the the RFXcom CD that came with your transmitter., You should now have a screen that looks like this:

, (The transmitter may have a DHCP assigned ip address which could cause future problems for example, if you switch off the RFXCOM and the router and you switch on the DHCP server (maybe your router) it is possible that the DHCP server assigns that to another device. When you switch on the RFXCOM you will have two equal IP addresses in your network and lots of problems, please see tips section to see how to assign a static ip.)

,, You need to input the port number 10001 or 10002 depending on the position of transmitter in the LAN interface. If you look to the back side of the interface, if the transmitter’s yellow antenna wire is on the right side it is port 10001 and if installed on the left side it is port 10002. Then click 'OK'.

,, This KAKU (KlikAanKlikUit) mode is the mode used for older HE (HomeEasy) products with address wheels and BBSB or for the new HE modules with program button when you want to control this module with BBSB codes (A-P/1-16). In KAKU mode you cannot set dim levels of the HE unit and only use dim levels using 2 ON commands and a dim cycle. You should now be able to switch these types of units on and off.

, IMPORTANT: set Device code 0 0 0 0 to another value (it does not matter what) because 0000 will switch under some circumstances all HE units in your house.

, For example set Device to 1000 and Unit 1, press the program button on the HE unit and press On in RFtransmitter. The HE unit should respond with clicking On/Off and is paired now with Device 1000 Unit 1 and can be switched On/Off and a dim level 1 to 16 can be set.

, You need to make a note of all of the codes that the program uses to switch your devices on and off. For example, If you have an older address wheel plug in unit with the x10 address A1 and you switch it on using the program the code '20609F00FF' appears in the yellow box below. So now for example write down: Lounge Lamp 'ON': 20609F00FF. You will also need to write down the 'OFF' command in this case: 20609F20DF.

Cut open your USB charging cable.,
Plug the charger into your iPhone.",How to Charge Your iPhone without a Charging Block4," You can build a battery from acidic fruit to give your phone a temporary charge. Note that you’ll still need the charger cable, though a power block and electrical outfit won’t be necessary. Note: this has the potential to damage your device, so only proceed if you are ready to accept any possible risks. You will need:About a dozen acidic fruits, such as citrus, apples, or pears.
A copper screw or penny for each piece of fruit. If you are using pennies after 1982, they will need to be sanded to expose the copper.A zinc (galvanized) nail for each fruit.
Insulated copper wire.
Rubber gloves. Wear these at all times to prevent getting shocked.

, Make sure you leave a bit of the nail exposed so you can connect the wire to it.

, Insert the copper piece near the zinc nail, but do not let them touch or the battery will short. If you are using citrus fruit, try to get both objects into the same segment of fruit.

, Insert the objects into the rest of the fruit. Take care to ensure that none of the metal pieces touch each other when inserting them.

, Use the copper wire to connect each fruit into a circuit. Connect a wire from the copper piece of one fruit to the zinc of another. Connect the copper piece on the second fruit to the zinc of the third, and so on.

, Cut the large end of the charging cable off to expose the wires inside the cable. Connect the power wires to the end of the fruit chain..

, Each piece of fruit should be producing about half a volt, which should add up to the five volts you need to charge the device.As the zinc dissolves in the fruit, it releases zinc ions, which releases energy. The zinc ions also reduce copper ions, which releases more energy. When combined in a circuit, they release enough energy to charge the device.

, With Siri Suggestions enabled, Spotlight Search will provide suggestions the moment you access the search screen even before you type anything on the search box. Siri Suggestions anticipates your search interests by collecting information on what app you usually use, who you usually contact, your current location and even the time of day. These suggestions will differ depending on how you accessed Spotlight Search.


Once you access Spotlight Search, Siri Suggestions will display a list of app (in the form of icons). You will see these app suggestions below the search field under the heading “SIRI APP SUGGESTIONS.” Spotlight Search bases these suggestions from your recently used apps, apps you frequently use, or apps you often use on a given time or a given place. Tapping an app icon will launch the app.
If you swipe right to reach the Spotlight Search interface, you get not only app suggestions but also other suggestions.as well. You will see a list of frequently used or recently accessed apps, contacts or contents. There could also be icons for maps to nearby places as well as news stories and some other items. You can see app suggestions and contact suggestions under the heading “SIRI SUGGESTIONS,” suggestion on interesting places near your location under the heading “NEARBY,” and news items which may be of interest to you under the heading “NEWS.”

, If Siri Suggestions is enabled and you have a lot of apps with deep links, the list search results may become unwieldy. To make searches more manageable, you can disable some of the search items. To do this, first go to the home screen and tap “Settings.” This will open the Settings menu.

, The right pane will show the Settings options for this section.

, This will transfer the right pane to the “Spotlight Search” settings options. You will see several items with toggle switches. By default, all search items are enabled; you will see that all toggle switches are colored green. Tapping the toggle button turns off or disables the item (the toggle switch becomes grey). Tapping on a greyed toggle switch turns this into green and enables the item.

, First among these items in the right pane is “Siri Suggestions.” By default, “Siri Suggestions” is enabled. If the “Siri Suggestions” toggle switch is grey, Siri Suggestion is turned off. Tap the greyed toggle switch to turn it on. If the toggle switch is green, tap this to turn it off.

, Below the “Siri Suggestions” toggle, under the heading “Search Results,” are the apps that will be covered by the search. By default, all the listed apps will be covered by Spotlight Search.


The search results you get when you use Spotlight Search are controlled by the items enabled in the “Search Results” list. If too many items are enabled, the search results may become unwieldy. Thus it would be wise to leave enabled only those items you desire, and turn off all others by tapping on its green toggle switch.

It is highly recommended that you use the latest version of iTunes, as syncing your ringtones has become much easier in later versions.

, You'll need to add the song to your iTunes library before you can create a ringtone from it.


You can drag and drop the song into the iTunes window to add it to your library.
You can also click File → Add File to Library (PC) or iTunes → Add to Library and browse for the file.
If you can't add the song to your library, it may not be a compatible format. See Convert a WAV File to a MP3 File for instructions for converting most audio files to MP3 format.

If you don't see ""Create AAC Version,"" click the ""Edit"" or ""iTunes"" menu and select ""Preferences."" Click the ""Import Settings"" button and select ""AAC Encoder"" from the ""Import Using"" menu., A file explorer window will open and your new copy will be highlighted.

, You'll be changing the file format by renaming the extension, but these are hidden for many Windows users. If extensions are enabled, you'll see "".m4a"" at the end of your segment file name. If you don't, you'll need to enable file extensions in order to proceed:


Windows 10, 8.1, and 8 - Click the ""View"" menu in the Windows Explorer window. Check the ""File name extensions"" box to enable extensions.
Windows 7 and earlier - Open the Control Panel from the Start menu. Select ""Folder Options"" or ""Appearance and Personalization"" and then ""Folder Options."" Click the ""View"" tab. Uncheck the ""Hide extensions for known file types"" box.

, This will let you change the file extension.


Make sure you right-click on the file in the explorer window, not in your iTunes library.

, This will change the file into a format that iTunes and your iPhone will recognize as a ringtone.

The app is available for both Apple and Android smartphones and is free to download.
You can log in using either your Facebook account or by creating an entirely new account with an email address.;
,

Keep in mind that you cannot change your username later on.
This will be your ""handle"" on the app and will be displayed for everyone to see.
You will be asked to input your shoe size, shirt size, and your zip code - although all of this information is optional.
You are required to upload a profile picture - to do this, click on the camera icon next to ""Profile Picture"" - you can change it at any time.

, This will begin to create your customized homepage feed.

Do some research – look at other user’s closets to get ideas for how to take quality pictures. Read the comments under other user’s listings and use them as a model as to how to write appropriate titles and descriptions for your own items.
Follow a lot of other closets and “share” their items frequently. In turn, other “Poshers” (users) will often share your listing as a thank you for sharing theirs! This is especially helpful when you’re a new seller and a seller with thousands of followers shares your items.

,


You will be brought to a screen titled “Find Your Friends”. The options listed below are: “Find Contacts”, “Find Facebook Friends”, “Find Twitter Friends”, and suggested users. This is not required, so if you wish to skip this step, click the “Done” icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

,


There is a maroon toolbar at the bottom of the app with 5 icons that read: “Feed”, “Shop”, “Sell”, “News”, and then your unique username is the furthest to the right.

, The “Feed” section shows a feed of the “Covershot”s of new items posted from the closets of Poshers you follow, as well as the Covershots of listings they have “shared” with their followers. In the “Feed” tab you can also use the “Search Poshmark” bar at the top of the screen to search for items in specific categories. To the left of the search Poshmark bar is a button that allows you to search for people from your phone’s contacts, social media accounts, as well as Poshers from “My City”, “My College”, and “New People”., The “Shop” section has a “Search Listings” bar where you can search for items in specific categories. The “Shop” tab also features a section where you can quickly access the people you follow, titled “PEOPLE”. The other sections are: “BRANDS”, “LIKES”, “PARTIES”, “WOMEN”, “KIDS”, “MEN”, “WHOLESALE”, “DISCOVER PEOPLE,” “SHOWROOMS”.

, The “Sell” section will immediately open your phone’s camera through the app. You can choose to either take a picture within the app with the round, center button or choose a photo from your phone’s photo library by clicking the folder icon in the bottom left corner. The first photo you take or upload will be your “Covershot”, or the picture that shows up in your follower’s feeds and in your closet. You can add more photos and information by clicking “Next” in the upper right corner of the screen.

, The “News” section will feature a red circle with a number inside, indicating the number of unseen notifications you currently have. You will be notified in the app when someone new follows you, likes an item in your closet, shares one of your item, tags you in a comment, comments on one of your listings, and when “pm_editor” invites you to an upcoming party.

, To learn more about any unfamiliar terminology, the icon with your username on it contains helpful guides listed under “Your Guide to Poshmark”, “Posh Etiquette”, “Poshmark Support Center”, and “Frequently Asked Questions”.

, The far right icon with your username is arguably the most important tab to become familiar with. It is where you can change your profile’s settings and preferences, view purchases you have made on the app, sales you have made, your account’s balance. Most importantly, it is how you can view your closet (“My Closet”) and access all of your listings.

,

Poshmark supports the selling of women’s clothing and shoes, men’s clothing and shoes, children’s clothing and shoes, brand-new cosmetics, women’s and men’s accessories.

,

On the maroon toolbar at the bottom of the app, there is an icon with an image of a camera with the word “sell” underneath. The “sell” button is in between “shop” and “news”.
This icon allows you to create a new listing.
Listing is free, so you can list as many items as you wish.

,

Take a very close look at your items – you want to take pictures of any flaws in the item and mention it in your description of the item.
Buyers like having the clothes modeled, however this is not always possible, so laying the clothing flat and taking precise measurements is the second-best option.
You are allowed 8 pictures per listing.

,

Create a title that includes the brand (if recognizable) and the name of the item.

Example: Dark Wash Jeans


Under the title, there is a space for a “description” where you should include all relevant information including measurements, if applicable. This is your space to “sell your item."" Poshmark’s app will prompt you through the remaining items that you need to include before you list:

This includes: “Category”, “Quantity”, “Size”, “Brand”, “Color”, “New With Tags”, “Original Price”, and “Listing Price”


If you do not know the original price, you can estimate the price you paid or just put “$0.00”.












,

Consider how much “wear” the item has – is it new? Has it been laundered several times?

Items that are brand new with tags can usually be sold for a higher price than those that have been worn several times.


Also consider if the item you’re selling is limited edition or in high demand, in which case your item may warrant a higher selling price.
Keep in mind that Poshmark will deduct 20% of your earnings, so price accordingly.

Example: If you list a jacket at $25.00, you will earn $20 when it sells.
For sales under $15.00, there is a flat fee of $2.95.


Also keep in mind that Poshmark charges the buyers a flat shipping rate of $6.49 – shipping is paid for entirely by the buyer.

If your item is more expensive, the shipping rate may not affect a potential buyer’s decision, however if you are listing an item at $10, a buyer may be more likely to take the $6.49 shipping cost into their decision of whether or not to purchase your item.



,

You will be brought to a page titled “Sharing” with the option to share your new listing on Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, and/or Tumblr. You do not have to complete this step. You may skip to step 7 if you do not wish to share your listing to your other social media accounts.

,

Your item will now be public, meaning, people can share the listing as well as purchase it.

,

Once an item in your closet is sold, you will receive a notification from the ""News"" tab on the bottom toolbar. You will also receive an email congratulating you on your sale.

,

Attached to the congratulatory email will be a pre-paid shipping label, along with specific instructions on how to package and mail your sold item.

,

The label is for 1-3-day shipping through USPS Priority Mail.

,

The priority mail envelopes/boxes are free at any USPS Post Office.
Buyers appreciate nice packaging! You can accomplish this by wrapping the item in colorful tissue paper and including a personal thank-you note. This is not required, but may entice buyers to shop your closet again.
The weight must not exceed 5 pounds.

Bring your package to your local post office and they will weigh it for you before shipping. Although you can arrange for your packages to be picked up at your house, it is safer to bring them to the post office so you can get a receipt with the tracking on it for your personal records. Also, if there are any surprises, they can be addressed on the spot.

Possible ""surprises"" you may encounter when shipping your item include: finding out your package exceeds the 5-pound weight limit or the packaging you used is incorrect (you cannot use a Flat Rate box or Priority Mail Express box).


You have 7 days to ship your order, but buyers often expect you to ship within 2 days.



,


On the maroon bar at the bottom of the app, there are 5 icons: “Feed”, “Shop”, “Sell”, “News”, and your username – click on your username.
Once you have clicked on your username’s icon, you can track the package by clicking “My Sales”.
After clicking, ""My Sales"", you will then see a larger picture of the item you sold, as well as the title of your listing, the price, the size, the buyer’s username, and the status of the order

By clicking on the listing, you will access further, more detailed information about the sale including the “Order Date” and the “Order #”.
You will also see ""Order Status"", which shows the current status of the order.


You want to make sure that your buyer receives their purchase from you. Sometimes the USPS can make errors, so you want to keep track of the package’s progress yourself.

,

Under the ""My Sales"" tab is ""My Balance"". Here, you will see how many credits you have, pending earnings, and redeemable earnings.

Pending earnings will become redeemable after the item is delivered to your buyer.


Poshmark will automatically release your earnings 4 days after the tracking says the item has been delivered.
Poshmark encourages buyers to leave a rating (out of 5 possible stars), as well as a “lovenote” (a public comment about the purchase) about their experience buying with you. Your earnings will be released to you immediately after the buyer rates you (if before the 4-day mark).

Re-moisten your stylus.",How to Use Anything As a Stylus on a Samsung Galaxy," When trying to find a substitute for a stylus, you’d probably need to look for something that can give the same feel as a real stylus can. For this, you’ll need to get something long and thin. The best item for this would be an empty pen case, but you can use absolutely any item you have in mind—yes, even a stick can do the trick.;
, Take a small piece of cotton and attach it to the tip of the item you’re going to use as a stylus. If you don’t have any cotton, you can use a tissue or a piece of cloth—any item that can hold or absorb water.

,, You don’t need to submerge the entire stylus, just have the end with a cotton touch the water, enough for the cotton to be moist.

, Drag the tip of your new stylus (the one with a cotton attached) across the screen of the Samsung Galaxy, and you’ll notice it reacting to your gestures.


Android touchscreen devices react to electro-conductive materials like organic stuff such as our fingers or water. So, the device will react to a tip of a pencil only when it’s wet.
The cotton at the tip helps to hold water and allows your stylus to be used for longer periods. It also prevents the item you’re using as a stylus from scratching the screen of your Samsung Galaxy.

, When the improvised stylus starts to dry and lose its traction, simply dip the cotton tip in water again to keep it conductive.

Consider whether or not you qualify for free unlocking.,
Gather the information your carrier will need to unlock your iPhone.,
Call or visit a carrier location and ask them to unlock your phone.,
Provide your carrier with any information they require.",How to Carrier Unlock an iPhone1," For example, if you are a member of the armed forces and are soon traveling overseas, carriers must unlock your phone on request. Be sure to check with your carrier about any other specific circumstances you have.
, This information includes the following:


Account information - Typically, this comprises your first and last name, phone number, and a PIN (or your Social Security Number).

IMEI number - Your iPhone's IMEI number is an identifying tag found next to the ""IMEI"" heading in the ""About"" section of the ""General"" page, which you'll find near the top of the Settings app.

Other information - Your carrier may request details on your current plan, how long you've had your iPhone, and how much you've paid off if you're on a contract. Even though carriers typically have access to this kind of information, it's a good idea to have it on-hand just in case. If you're in the military, you'll need to bring your deployment papers.

, Ultimately, the decision is up to them; however, if you meet the proper requirements for carrier unlocking as outlined in your carrier's policy, you can usually get your phone unlocked:Verizon - Most Verizon phones come unlocked to begin with. Call or visit you local Verizon store to make sure your iPhone can support your preferred network.Sprint - Sprint will unlock your phone if it has been active on the Sprint network for at least 50 days, you have fulfilled the conditions of your lease or purchase, the phone isn't locked by law enforcement or flagged for criminal activity, and you haven't missed any payments. AT&T - AT&T will unlock your phone if it is designed for and used on the AT&T network at the time of the call and not flagged for criminal activity. You also need to have paid any early termination fees or contractual obligations.T-Mobile - If your phone is registered to T-mobile, you have completely paid for the phone, the phone has been on the T-mobile network for either a year (prepaid phones) or 40 days (month-to-month phones), it hasn't been flagged for criminal activity, and you haven't missed any payments, T-Mobile will unlock your phone for you.Ask your service provider about device compatibility on other networks. Some phones won't work on other networks' cellular frequencies., If you have the necessary information and your carrier is contractually allowed to unlock your phone, they will do so.

After your carrier unlocks your phone, you'll need to visit a different carrier whom you'd like to use and purchase a SIM card from them.
To use another carrier's network on your iPhone, simply insert that carrier's SIM card into your iPhone. The carrier must first activate the SIM.

"
"
Make sure that your iPhone can support your preferred carrier's network.,
Find a service.,
Research your choice.,
Retrieve your iPhone’s IMEI code.,
Pay for the service.,
Purchase and install a SIM card from your preferred carrier.,
Activate your unlock.",How to Carrier Unlock an iPhone2," Some iPhones' hardware is geared toward using CDMA rather than GSM networks, meaning that trying to use a GSM network like AT&T on a phone built for CDMA will be a hit-or-miss experience.

For example, trying to activate a Verizon iPhone on an AT&T network might not work due to the iPhone being built to work with CDMA rather than GSM.The best way to figure out whether or not your phone will support your preferred network is by calling the carrier to which you'd like to switch and asking them.

, There are plenty of companies that will sell you stock unlock codes for your phone. These companies circumvent current restrictions by operating in countries not covered by US law.


Unlock Radar is a well-reviewed choice.

, Before paying any company to unlock your phone, research the company as thoroughly as possible. Find user reviews, and ask around in phone enthusiast forums. Always be wary of potential scams, especially when you are paying to skirt your carrier's policies.

Never enter your phone's information or your card details on a website that doesn't start with ""HTTPS"".
There are several apps that will claim to unlock your phone, but these are scams at best. Don't download unlocking software to your phone.

, Your iPhone will be added to Apple’s official unlocked phones list, which means it will stay unlocked even if you upgrade iOS versions. To add the iPhone to the list, the company you are paying will need your phone’s IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) code, which is unique to your iPhone. There are a couple ways to find this:On any iPhone, you can dial *#06# and your IMEI code will be displayed.
You can also open your iPhone's Settings, tap General, tap About, and look at the number next to ""IMEI"" near the bottom of the page.

, If at all possible, use PayPal to complete the transaction rather than using a credit or debit card.

Be sure to select all of the correct information about your device so that you get a code that works for your phone.

, After your phone is unlocked by your selected service, you'll need to have a SIM card from your new carrier in order to take advantage of their network., Once you receive confirmation that your iPhone has been unlocked, you will need to activate it before the unlock takes effect."

"
Look away from the screen when the icon animation is running (when you press the 'home' button).,
Look away, or look at a corner of the device when scrolling email and the like.,
Know why you are uncomfortable.,
Let your eyes and brain live with the paradox until they get use to it.,If you use a device with contrast control, decrease the contrast of the display and the experience will be more pleasant; unfortunately the iPhone has no such an option.,
Try to use the apple device when facing a wall or other neutral, low information content image.,
Avoid using the device when walking.,
Change the color of the 'home screen' to all white or all black, according to what works best to you.",How to Avoid iPhone or iPad Nausea2," Lower resolution devices such as the Android systems do not cause nausea (or are less likely to cause).

You might have vision problems but it is unlikely if you get nausea with the same animations or in a large screen (computer or iPad) seen from a reasonable distance.

,

Do you get nausea from 3D movies? A few people do. Even people who do not get nausea from 3D movies might get nausea from the apple high resolution screens + animations. The problem is that the apple icons are unrealistically sharp giving the impression of being 'floating' by the glass. Nothing in real life looks that sharp. The headache might be the result of the brain subconsciously trying to understand what is the physical reality of those icons. Decreasing the brightness might reduce the discomfort because it makes the icons and text to seem less realistic. Installing a protecting film that reduces the sharpness of the screen also makes the images on the screen less 'paradoxical' to the brain.

, Nausea might come from the fact that your brain thinks the images on the screen comes from real objects (3-dimensional). The images are so sharp that deceives the brain of some people into thinking it is a real object. However when the eyes try to focus to see the moving images in different planes, the light is coming from the same plane (screen). The eyes keep refocusing trying to predict the movement of the objects on the screen and this inconsistency cause the discomfort. Please try looking to the screen with one eye to see if the discomfort decreases (hard to tell because it is so subtle). In any case, if this is the problem, it is solved by looking at the screen at arms length. At arm's length the discrepancy between the images seen by each eye for a 3D object is much less and closes to the 'no difference' observed in the apple flat screen., For some people it means days; for others it might mean weeks or more.,, For some people the eyes still see what is going on around when looking at the small screen. The less information outside of the screen, the less strain to the brain., This tip is equivalent to the previous one., Black seems to work better on the home screen because it masks the 'shadowing' effect of the icons, decreasing the 3D illusion. This trick does not help for all the other screens (safari, settings, email, etc).

There is also another version of Heads Up! for the iPod and iPad called Heads Up! Kids. Decide on whether you'll be playing the game with children or with adults.Heads Up! Kids replaces text with pictures so that kids who can't read can also play along.;
, Visit the download page for the device you plan on playing the game with. Search for the name of the app and then visit the download page. If you have an Android device, visit the Google Play store. If you have an iPhone or iPad, visit iTunes.Heads Up! on the Google Play store is free.Heads Up! on iTunes costs $.99., Click the download button to start the download and installation process. Once the download is done, an icon for the game should show up on your home screen. If you are downloading the app on iTunes, keep in mind that you'll have to pay $.99 for the game.

, After the app has been downloaded and installed, it should create an icon on your home screen. Tap on the icon to open up the program so that you can start the play the game.

, If more than two people are playing, have everyone split up into teams of two. One player will guess the word on the screen while their teammate will provide clues to them. The goal is to guess the word that appears on the tablet without looking at it. Each time that a person guesses the word on the screen correctly, they receive a point.Rhyming is not allowed.

, In Heads Up! there are a variety of subjects that you can choose from. Talk to your friends and determine which subject everyone likes the best. Decks include celebrities, movies, animals, accents, and characters.There are new decks regularly being added to the game, such as the Chinese New Year edition., Once you tap the deck you want to play, you'll be brought to a brief description of what kind of clues will be in the deck. Talk to other people who are playing with you to determine if this is the topic you'd all like to play before starting the game.This description will also give you brief directions on the rules of the game.

, Decide who wants to go first, then have them put the phone against their forehead, with the face of the phone facing out so that their teammate can see the word. After a countdown, the game will begin. Putting the phone on your forehead will make sure that you can't see the word, but that your teammate can.


If you are using a tablet, you can put the tablet in front of you instead of placing it on your forehead.

, Your teammate will see the word and try to provide clues without saying the word directly. The person giving the clues should signal when you've gotten the word correct. Once you do, tilt the phone down so that the face of the phone points towards the floor. This will record your point., If you're totally stumped and aren't sure what the word is, tilt the phone upwards to skip the card and go on to the next one. This won't count against your score, but you won't get a point for the card.

, You have 60 seconds to guess all of the cards in the deck for your turn. Try to guess as many words as you can before the time runs out. Once the timer goes down to zero, it will tally up your points. After you have guessed the words in your deck, it's your teammate's turn to guess the word and your turn to hold the phone. Whoever scores the most points at the end of the round wins.You can play as many rounds as you want.
If you are playing with more than 2 people, you can combine the points on each team, and whichever team gets the most, wins.

, The best way to score more points is to be knowledgeable about the topic. If you love movies or TV shows, for example, you should pick the celebrity or movie deck. If you know a lot about biology and different animals, you should play the animal deck. The more you know about the topic in the deck, the easier the game will be for you.

, While you can play Heads Up! against each other, you can also play as a team. Instead of trying to score more points than the other player, try to score points together and get a high score. This can be a less competitive and more fun way of playing the game.

, One of the most common clues in Heads Up! is a description of a word. Try to visualize the object that is on the phone and describe it to the best of your ability. The more accurate and recognizable details you give, the better chance the person will be able to guess it.For instance, if the card says ""alligator"" you can say something like ""It's a green reptile with a long mouth and lots of teeth.""

, If the word is an animal that makes a certain sound, you can copy the noise to give a clue of the word. If the word is a famous television show or movie with a recognizable theme song, you can hum the song instead of trying to describe the show or movie. Think of sounds, noises, or songs that are related to the word and use them instead of describing it.For example, if the word is ""dog"" you can bark or say ""woof"" instead of describing a dog.

, If there is a widely used synonym for the word that is on the screen, you can use it. Think about words that related or mean the same thing as the word on the screen and use that as your clue.


For example, if the word on the screen is ""cliff"" you can say something like ""precipice, crag, or bluff.""

Ignore the pictures and description.,
Look at the reviews.,
Look at who made the app.,
View the other apps the publisher has created.,
Check how much storage the app takes up.",How to Identify a Scam App on the Apple App Store," Many scam apps are copies of legitimate apps, and the scammer might try to take the pictures and description from the real app and put it onto theirs in order to make their app look real so people buy it.
, If the app has been out for some while, there should be some one-star reviews that state that they ""didn't get what they bought"" or they ""received a different app than what was advertised"".


It isn't uncommon to have many fake reviews. Fake reviews are easy to spot if you know what to look for. First, look at the date that the review was posted and compare it to the day the application was released. If they are the same or are only a day or two after the release date, that is likely a sign that it's fake. Second, do the reviews seem ""too good to be true""? If all the reviews have high ratings, specifically 5- and 4-star scores, there's more potential the reviews aren't real. Third, compare all of the reviews that rate the app well. They all may look as if they have the same writing style and similar usernames (e.g. funnydog78, coolgorilla22, bestchair64, etc.).







, If the app is legitimate, it is likely that the publisher has few other apps and has a name that sounds more official, such as the name of their app or something that ends with ""Co."" or any other similar ending. If the app is a scam, the publisher may sound like an unpopular publisher or something unofficial, such as the publisher's name or something such as ""Fun Games For Kids And Teens"".

, Check for signs including:


They all cost money.
They all have fishy ratings, whether it's a low rating or a high rating.
They all seem like copies or ""helpers"" of a different app.
They were all published on close dates (e.g. November 24, November 25, November 26, all in 2016).
The storage they take up isn't as big as it seems it'd be.

, If the app is featuring, for example, stunning graphics and addictive gameplay, it's likely the amount of storage it'll take up is high, and may even take up gigabytes. If you feel a bit off about the app and you're unsure to buy it, however, you might want to check how many bytes the app will take up when you download it. If the storage seems lower than what it should be, you might want to reconsider your purchase.

Get a screen protector.,
Use only Apple branded or approved chargers.,
Use an Apple branded or approved cover.,
Turn off your device when you are not using it.,
Do not charge beyond 100%.,
Close all apps every 2-3 days.",How to Extend the Life of Your iPhone or iPad," You may think it is not necessary. Your screen may not get scratched or visibly damaged in any way without one. But the constant tapping and stroking of the device does wear down the innards over time. The screen protector helps absorb up to 50% of this impact.


Replace screen protector at least once a year.
If you need help installing one, many stores that sell them, such as mobile phone dealers, are willing to do it for you and have tools to make the task easy.;
, Avoid using knockoffs, such as those purchased for lower prices in non-Apple retailers or online. See warnings for more details.

, This can better help absorb falls and bumps that are an inevitable part of life. Many other companies make covers, many of that are quite beautiful and often have interesting features. But they lack the same advantages.

, This helps extend the life.


For iPhones, turn the device off at night when you are asleep. Keeping it powered down 33% of the time when you don't need it can translate into up to 33% longer life. Additionally, the battery will not drain much while it is powered off.
Presumably, an iPad will be used even less than an iPhone. Since it does not receive calls, it does not need to be on all the time. It can be powered down at least 50% of the time, if not much longer.

, When charging hits 100%, pull the plug immediately. 


To be on the safe side, charge to 90-something percent, then pull the plug. There is not a huge difference between 97% and 100% battery.
Avoid making overnight the time you charge up your device. Charge some other time of day, such as during the evening before you go to sleep. If you turn off the phone then, you will have a freshly charged battery in the morning.

, Do this by double-clicking the home button, and the open apps will appear. Hold down one of the open apps for a few seconds, and they will all wiggle. Then tap the - symbol on each app you wish to close.

, If your charger's writing is on the same side as the plug, your charger is a fake.Some Samsung chargers place the charger's information on the same side as the USB port.

, This should be in the lower left quadrant of the charger; the logo resembles a ""UL"" surrounded by a circle. UL stands for Underwriters Laboratories, which is a safety organization tasked with maintaining safety standards for all marketplace technology. If your charger doesn't have a UL logo, you shouldn't use it.

, If it's on a short side of your charger, your charger is authentic., Since Samsung chargers change in appearance frequently, it can be difficult to tell whether or not your charger is fake; however, if you're noticing that your charger is taking way too long to charge your phone or the USB cable is crooked/bent, it's time to get a new charger--regardless of the authenticity of your old one.

Pry the back of the phone up, then pull it away.",How to Take the Back Off a Samsung Galaxy1," If you have an external case on your Samsung Galaxy, you'll need to remove it before proceeding.;
, To do so, you'll hold down the Lock button, tap Power off in the pop-up menu, and tap POWER OFF when prompted to confirm your choice.









You run the risk of short-circuiting your phone or shocking yourself if you take the back cover off while the phone is on.

, This is not required but is recommended to ensure the heat applied to the phone does not damage your SIM and microSD cards, if present.









Use a SIM card eject tool and push it into the corresponding sized hole on the left side on top of the phone. This will eject the card tray with the phone's SIM and microSD card slots.

, This is to avoid scratching the screen while you remove the back cover.


For example, consider placing a towel or a place mat on a table.

, You'll do this for about two minutes. The best way to do this is by using a hair drier or a heat gun, though you must avoid heating one specific spot for more than a second at a time. This loosens the adhesive glue that binds the back of the Samsung Galaxy's housing to the phone's internal frame








To avoid damaging your phone, keep the heat gun aimed at the phone's back cover and quickly move it up and down in a zig-zag fashion.
Alternatively, you can use a microwavable heating pad made specifically for this task.

, There should be a crack where the front and the back parts of the Galaxy's housing meet; this is where you'll insert a spudger, a flathead screwdriver, a credit card, or a similarly flat object.









Your goal here is to leverage the back of the housing away from the front, but not to pry it off altogether.

, For example, you might use a guitar pick or a credit card. As you do so, the back of the phone should come away from the front of the housing a bit.









Make sure the item you use here isn't metal, as a metal object may scratch or otherwise damage the phone.

, This will result in the bottom of the back of the phone's housing, as well as both the left and right sides, being disconnected from the front of the phone's housing.









You may apply more heat as needed.

, The last of the adhesive should give way when you do this, since only the adhesive at the top of the phone will be holding the back of the phone in place.









You can apply more heat and/or slide your prying tool along the top of the phone to make this process easier.
Set the back of your phone aside in a warm, dry place so that you don't damage the phone's internals when you put it back on.

, Depending on your phone model, this slot's location will vary slightly:










S4 and S5 - Top-left corner of the back cover.

S2 and S3 - Top of the back cover.

S - Bottom of the back cover.

, You can also use a small flathead screwdriver, a guitar pick, or a similarly slim object as long as you do so gently.








, It should come away from the phone's body.








, Once you have a firm grasp on the case, you'll pull it away from the phone's body, thereby exposing the battery and SIM card.

DNA Gene - Metabolic Jump
Travel Gene - Native Biome/Teracyte
Evolution Gene - Sympto-Stasis
Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic
Environment Gene - Extremophile (Or any unlocked);
, China is one of the most ideal starting locations when you need to spread quickly as it has one of the highest populations, and infects surrounding countries quickly. China's airport and harbor mean the virus spreads to other countries quicker and easier.

, The virus will mutate quickly, so you need to be ready to devolve any lethal symptoms if they appear too soon.

, These will help spread your virus as quickly as possible, which is important as you are racing against your own mutations. Focus on the following symptoms first:


Rash
Skin Lesions
Sweating
Sneezing
Coughing

, You need to spread the plague fast before the mutating starts, so start working on some basic transmission abilities. Upgrading Air and Water makes your virus effective in crossing countries by airplane or ships. Evolve the following transmissions, in order:


Air 1
Water 1
Drug Resistance 1
Air 2
Water 2
Extreme Bioaerosol

, Return to your Symptoms screen and load up on every symptom you can that's not lethal.

, Make sure that you are always devolving lethal symptoms before they have a chance to cause too much damage.

, You'll want to start hardening your virus to help it travel to more hostile climates as well as slow down the cure. Evolve the following:


Cold 1
Heat 1

, You'll want to start actively spreading the virus now, and a large portion of China as well as some other countries should be infected. Evolve the following:


Bird 1 and 2
Livestock 1 and 2
Blood 1 and 2

, It's time to get a little lethal. Evolve a few symptoms that have minor lethality, such as Paralysis or Coma. These will give you access to the really deadly symptoms.

, Before you unleash the full effects of the virus, make it a little more resistant to slow down the cure. Evolve the following:


Genetic Hardening 1 and 2

, At this point, most of the world should be infected and you should have a large reserve of DNA points. Load up on the symptoms with low-lethality, and keep upgrading your transmission capabilities.

, You don't want to go full-lethal until everyone in the world has been infected. If you start too soon, the sick will die off before they can infect the last healthy people.

, Once everyone is infected, it's time to let loose with every lethal symptom you can evolve. Start with Total Organ Failure and Necrosis, and move on to Internal Hemorrhaging and other highly-lethal symptoms.

, If the cure starts sneaking up on you, use the Genetic ReShuffle ability to slow down the progress. You likely won't need to worry too much about the cure, but it may be an issue if you had difficulty spreading the infection early on.

Allies are overrated! Don't go code crazy! When you look for battles, you're going to be faced with players of same level and similar ally count. Typically, the players with a high ally count are experience

, When you battle, you only use (6 x number of allies you have) units. These units are the best units you own. So if you have 9 allies, you can use 54 of your best units. If you own only 54 Marines and 10000000 Minigunners, you're only going to use 54 Marines.

While doing so will void your warranty, it has the greatest chance of working the first time (unlike a factory reset).
, You can download your SP Flash Tool file from here., This is directly below the SP Flash Tool screenshot in the middle of the page; clicking this option will prompt your SP Flash Tool file download.

If you're running Linux, you can click the ""Linux 64 Bit"" option instead.

, Depending on your internet speed, this may take up to 20 minutes., Once your file is done downloading, you'll need to find it on your computer in order to extract its contents.

Your file should be in your usual ""Downloads"" folder unless you manually selected a different location.

, Most computers have a built-in extraction program for zipped files; if yours doesn't, you can download any one of several free unzipping programs.


WinZip and 7-Zip are reputable free choices for Windows.

, Now that your SP Flash Tool is downloaded, it's time to download your Samsung's stock firmware., When your Samsung Galaxy S4 shipped, it had stock firmware--the factory-issue phone processes and settings--installed on it. The first step in removing your phone's privacy protection password is to download that same firmware from a third-party site so that you can re-install it on your device., You're looking for carrier-specific stock firmware, so you can add your carrier's name onto the end of this search query if you can't find anything relevant. Your search results will vary depending on your phone's version and your carrier information; generally speaking, however, you should stick to sites that look reputable.


This site is a decent source for most major carriers (e.g., Verizon, AT&T, etc.).

, Again, your process for doing so will vary, but most firmware will download in a .zip file (a compressed file format).

Your download may take up to an hour to complete.

, Once your file is done downloading, you'll need to locate it on your computer in order to extract its contents.

Your file should be in your usual ""Downloads"" folder unless otherwise specified.

, You should be familiar with this process from the Flash Tools extraction.

For simplicity's sake, extract your stock firmware to the same directory you used for the SP Flash tool (e.g., your desktop).

, Now you're ready to reset your phone's stock firmware!, You may have to open another folder inside of this one in order to access the Flash Tool application., This will open SP Flash Tool; since this app runs from within its extracted folder, you need not install anything to run it., This is on the far right side of your Flash Tool interface, directly beneath the ""Download Agent"" option.

Clicking this will open a search window from which you'll need to access your stock firmware file. This is why you should keep both the SP Flash Tool folder and the firmware folder in the same directory.

, This should be on the left side of the search window that pops up; for example, if your directory is the Desktop, you'll click the ""Desktop"" option., You may have to click through a couple of different folders to find your stock firmware file; it will be in .txt format (also known as ""text"" or ""Notepad"" format)., This will upload your stock firmware file to the Flash Tool program.

If you can't find your text file, you may need to download a different version of your phone's stock firmware.

, You'll find this above the ""Name"" and ""Begin Address"" entries in Flash Tool. Clicking it prompts a drop-down menu., This will ensure that your stock firmware is correctly assimilated when you connect your phone., This will begin your firmware download., Your Samsung Galaxy S4 battery is located under a sliding panel on the back of the phone.

You can power down your phone by holding down the power button, then tapping ""Power Off"" when prompted.

, The small end of your cable should plug into your phone, while the larger end goes in one of your computer's USB ports.

It's best to use the factory-issued charger cable for this step.

, This may take several minutes.

When the download is complete, you'll receive a notification on your computer.

, You'll also need to place your battery back in your phone., Do this by holding down the power button until your phone's Samsung label appears, then releasing the button and waiting for the phone to boot up., These will include your wifi preferences, your geographical location, the date & time settings, and other items you should have completed when you initially received the phone., You shouldn't see a privacy protection password here!

Use a soft reset for minor problems and service hiccups.,
Close all applications.,
Remove the phone's battery.,
Wait at least ten seconds before turning the phone back on.,
Alternatively, just use the power button.,
Consider powering off your phone semi-regularly.",How to Reset a Samsung Galaxy Ace1," A soft reset essentially forces the phone to end all of its current processes, turn off, and then restart from a fresh state. No long-term data is lost — you'll still have all of your apps, messages, and contacts saved to your phone after you perform a soft reset. The only data you risk losing is unsaved data in programs that are running when the phone turned off. Because a soft reset is quick, easy, and relatively risk-free, it's a good first step when trying to solve minor issues.



Situations that might call for a soft reset include:You can't seem to receive calls or texts properly
Your phone seems slow or ""laggy""
You can't seem to connect to wifi networks that you know are broadcasting correctly
Your touch screen seems unresponsive or erratic
An app has become frozen or unresponsive



;
, To start the soft reset process, close any applications that are currently open. Be sure to save anything that you're working on, like important texts or emails (note however, that most modern phones will automatically save drafts of your messages.)


If the reason for the soft reset is that one of your applications is frozen and won't close, you don't have to waste time trying to close it. Just proceed to the next step.

, When you're ready to start your soft reset, slide off the rear casing. Carefully lift the battery out of its slot. This will cause the phone to immediately turn off., Give the phone a brief chance to ""cool down"" after removing the battery by waiting at least a few seconds. Then, simply replace the battery and turn the phone back on as you normally would by holding the power button down for a few seconds.


This brief waiting period is something that's also frequently recommended when resetting everything from desktop computers to network routers.The reason for this has to do with capacitors — small structures inside most modern electronic devices that store electric charge. Ten seconds is about how long it takes for most capacitors to discharge. Thus, waiting ten seconds before restarting your phone allows you to be sure that it's 100% ""dead"" before turning it back on.

, Another (slightly longer) way to soft reset your phone is simply to turn it off like you normally would by holding down the power button. Select ""Power off"" or ""Restart"" from the menu that pops up.


Note, however, that if your phone is frozen, you may not be able to get a response this way, so removing the battery will be necessary., Note that some sources of tech knowledge (including executives from companies like Apple) recommend powering off a phone at least once every few days to preserve battery life.Since performing a soft reset by turning your phone off is so quick and easy, you may want to make it part of your regular schedule, especially if there are times of the day when you don't use it (like at night.)


Another reason this can be a good idea is because it gives the phone a chance to (literally) cool off. The heat that can result from continuous use can eventually cause the lithium ion batteries in most phones to degrade."

Use a hard reset as a last resort for serious issues.,
Charge your battery and back up your important data.,
Use the ""Factory data reset"" option under the settings menu.,
Alternatively, dial *2767*3855#.,
Alternatively, hold the home, volume up, and power buttons.,
Select “Wipe data/factory reset” from the recovery menu.,
Wait for the reset to finish.",How to Reset a Samsung Galaxy Ace2," Despite its similar name, a hard reset has very different effects than a soft reset. Hard resets restore your phone to its factory state. This means that all of your personal data, including your apps, messages, and contacts, are deleted and your phone becomes essentially a ""blank slate."" For these reasons, it's generally a good idea to perform a hard reset only when a major problem makes it necessary.



Situations that might call for a hard reset include:You experience frequent errors that don't seem to get better with other fixes
Your phone's software is corrupted
Your phone is infested with viruses or malicious applications you can't seem to get rid of





, There's no ""coming back"" from a hard reset, so it's vital that you prepare by making a backup copy of any important files, images, or documents on your phone that you want to keep. Once you perform your hard reset, it's unlikely that you'll be able to get them back. In addition, you'll want to make sure your battery is at least most of the way charged — running out of battery in the middle of the hard reset process can lead to serious errors.

, There are several ways to hard reset your Galaxy Ace. The first is probably the simplest — simply go into your phone's settings menu (the icon looks like a silver gear), then tap the ""User and backup"" or ""Backup and reset"" option, then finally tap ""Factory data reset."" You'll be asked to confirm your choice.



To recap, the menu options you need to choose are:Settings (looks like a metal gear)
User and backup/Backup and reset (name may vary based on the version of your phone's software)
Factory data reset
Confirm your choice





, Another way to perform a hard reset on your phone is to type this code into your phone exactly as you would if you were dialing a phone number. Hit the ""call"" button to start the hard reset process.


Note that you should not get a confirmation message with this method.

, One final way to perform a hard reset is to hold these three buttons while the phone is powered off. Release these buttons when the samsung logo appears.This option is convenient if the problem with your phone is preventing it from starting correctly.


Note that you will still need battery charge to do this.

, Leave your phone alone as the reset process begins. It should eventually boot into a special stripped-down menu with various system options listed. Use the phone's volume keys to scroll to the factory reset option, then press the home/power button to confirm. On the next screen, scroll down to “Yes” and confirm your choice.

, At this point, your phone will begin to work through the reset process without any further input from you. At this point, all you need to do is wait for the operation to complete. This can take several minutes — be patient. When it's done, you may select the ""Reboot system now"" option from the menu or simply use the power button to restart your phone.


After a successful hard reset, your phone should look and behave exactly like it did when you first bought it. It should have only the basic starting apps installed, should use default wallpaper and ringtone options, and so on.

You will see a gear icon in the top right corner of the notification drawer; tap it to open the Settings menu.


The gear icon can also be found on your home screen or app drawer.;
, The Settings menu will have settings for each feature listed under category headers, like Motions and Controls, User and Backup, and Connectivity. Scroll down until you see the “Personalization” header, and under it you will see “Finger Scanner.” Tap “Finger Scanner” to begin registering your fingerprint.

, In the Finger Scanner menu, you will see configuration options like setting a backup password and setting up PayPal compatibility. Tap on the first entry in the menu, which is the Fingerprint Manager. This menu will guide you in setting up your fingerprint. Tap “OK” in the next screen, and prompts will appear to help guide you through the setup. You will see an animation in the middle of the screen that illustrates how you swipe your finger over the sensor on the Home key.

, The key to improving fingerprint scanner reliability is in the registering of the fingerprint. The wizard will prompt you to choose a finger whose prints will be registered. With each detected swipe of the Home button, the circles with numbers will turn green. Begin swiping the chosen finger over the home screen.


Most people have been experiencing inconsistent unlocking reliability, mostly because they have been swiping the same area of the finger during this step. One of the key suggestions to making it more accurately read the fingerprint is by swiping your chosen finger at more than one angle. You will be required to swipe 10 times, so make sure that you will have swiped the whole area of your finger within those 10 tries. Users have reported more consistent detection when not swiping the fingerprint at the exact same points every time.
Another suggestion is to hold the phone in the non-registered hand in order to comfortably use the registered finger. Using the scanner one-handed does not provide the optimal positioning for the scanner to accurately detect the fingerprint.

, When all ten swipes have been detected, you can tap the “Register Again” button on the lower right corner of the screen if you want to do it again.

, After swiping 10 times, a pop-up will appear that states your fingerprint has been registered. Tap the “Done” button at the lower left corner of the pop-up to enable Fingerprint Lock as the screen lock type.

, You are able to add up to three fingerprints with the Finger Scanner. To add another fingerprint, tap the Fingerprint Manager again to see the registered fingerprints. Tap the plus icon in the upper right corner of the Fingerprint Manager screen to do the registration on another finger.


To delete a fingerprint, tap the checkbox beside the fingerprint listed, and tap the trash can icon in the upper right corner to remove it.

, Passwords have to be at least 6 characters with at least one letter and one number.

, The key to improving fingerprint scanner reliability is in registering your fingerprint. You will then be instructed to put your chosen finger on the home key and lift it up when the phone vibrates. You will also be shown a live representation of the fingerprint in the middle of the screen as well as the percentage of completion.


Make sure that you will have scanned the whole area of your finger. Do not use the same spot over and over. The phone will also prompt you to shift your finger at every attempt in order to get a complete reading.
At some point (along 70–80%) of the registration, the phone will prompt you to scan the tip of the finger you are registering. Continue scanning just the tip of your finger until the percentage reaches 100%.

, After the finger is registered, you will be prompted to set a backup password. The password must be at least 6 characters, and must include at least one letter and one number. Press the “Continue” button below the password field to proceed. You will be requested to repeat the password to confirm, and press “OK.”

, After choosing Nova Launcher as your new UI, you will see that the home screen changes dramatically compared to the default TouchWiz. For instance, the Google search bar will be located at the top of the home screen instead of the middle in most Galaxy devices. It also does away with the My Magazine feature in the home screen on most flagship Galaxy devices. Furthermore, the markers for home pages on the bottom of the home screen will have circular shapes instead of the default TouchWiz squares.


Nova uses the same design as the stock Android launcher, with lots of tweaks regarding the customizability of the whole user interface, including the home screen, app drawer, and other animations. Tinker around with the interface and see which elements you like and dislike.

, Tap and hold a blank space in the home screen to bring up the home screen customization menu. Tap the wrench icon at the top right corner of the pop-up to launch Nova Settings.

In Nova Settings, you will see a host of customization options categorized according to the UI elements they affect (e.g., Desktop , Drawer , Dock, Folders, etc.) Tapping on these categories will open a submenu where you can tweak the element to your liking.


For instance, tapping “Desktop” will open the Desktop submenu where you can choose the size of the home screen grid by tapping on the Desktop Grid under “LAYOUT.” Here, you can choose how many rows to use by sliding the rolling number line under “Rows,” and then the same with “Columns.” You can also enable Subgrid Position by tapping on the checkbox below the number lines to allow widgets to snap halfway through grid cells. Tapping “OK” at the lower right corner will apply your changes and make the home screen reflect your choices.
Tapping the “Dock” menu button in Nova Settings will open up customization options for the row of shortcuts at the bottom of the home screen.

Icon size and font will let you choose the size of icons via the slider that will pop up. A similar slider is also available for the icon font at the bottom.
Scroll speed will let you change the speed of the animations when transitioning between home screens. These are the options arranged In ascending order in terms of speed: Relaxes, Stock, Nova, Fast, and Faster than Light. These also apply to the other animation options under Look & Feel, like Animation speed (for transitional animations like opening the app drawer or folders) and App animation (which affect the animation speed at which Nova will open apps and return to the home screen).


You can change folder options by tapping on “Folders.” Here you will see options to customize Folder Preview, background, as well as transition animations. Tap “Folder preview” to choose between Stack, Grid, Fan, and Line. These are the arrangements of the icons that are inside a particular folder in the home screen. “Folder Background” will let you choose the shape of the background behind a folder. Options include Circle, Square, Platform, and Disc.
There are many customization options in Nova Launcher, making it a great choice for making your Galaxy device truly your own.

, Apart from Desktop customizations in Nova Settings, you can add widgets and apps to your home screen to personalize it. Tap and hold an empty section in the home screen to bring up the customization menu.


Tap “Widgets” to add them. Widgets help you get quick info or shortcut buttons by choosing them from the list.

, Gesture controls offer quick ways to open applications or perform toggle actions. In Nova Settings, tap “Gestures and Buttons” below “Look & feel.” Under the GESTURES header, you will see a list of gestures you can map applications and actions to.


For instance, tapping the “Pinch In” gesture will open up the “Choose action” menu. You will see three tabs: NOVA, APPS, and SHORTCUTS. Under “Nova,” you will see things like “Add Drawer,” “Show Previews,” and “Toggle Notification Bar,” to name a few. Selecting these will map the action to the “Pinch In” gesture, so when you go back to your home screen and pinch into the screen with two fingers, it will execute that action.
Play around with the various shortcuts and app launching operations using gestures to get a customized UI experience on your Galaxy device.

, In the Nova Settings menu, scroll down and tap “Backup and Import.” Under the BACKUP header, tap “Backup” to open a prompt. Type the name of the backup in the text field (by default it uses the date and time as the name) and then the backup location under the text field to select where you want to store the backup data (external SD card or internal memory). This helps you keep the settings saved, which is useful for when you do a factory restore but do not want to go through setting up Nova over again.
