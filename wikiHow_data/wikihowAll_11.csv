Seek refuge instantly. If you have already called the police, and you are being attacked whilst waiting, this is when you must try to defend - do not put yourself in dangerous situations without even asking for help.
, Do not take this literally - if you would rather the situation closed peacefully without you having to fight, you there are a range of techniques you could try in attempt to end the fight before it has even started.

Grab the phone nearest to you. Dial for the police, but do not call yet. Place the phone to your ear. Tell the intruder that if he does not leave in peace, you will call. Do this, no matter whether they leave or not. But giving the fugitive a chance to leave without your possessions is more productive, as it cannot be guaranteed that the police will capture the criminal.
Take a photo of the intruder, if they are not disguised. Say you will leak it to the police, the media, and the Internet, if they do not drop any weapons and leave at that instant.

, Pick up the heaviest, like a vase, or sharpest, like a kitchen knife, object to you. Say you are not afraid to fight for your home and for your own life. Say you will not harm them if they leave calmly, without stealing any of your things., This method should only be used if you feel you wouldn't stand a chance in a confrontation of any kind with the intruders. Say you will give them anything they want if they leave you and your family unharmed. Do not do this unless they are armed, and phone the police as soon as they leave if you do this., The successful use of confrontational methods will depend on your own ability to carry them out, and on the attacker's ability to counter them. Use your common sense, and only do what's necessary in the emergency situation.

If the intruder has a weapon, an unsuccessful physical attack is likely to put yourself in more danger; be smart, and only use these techniques as a last resort.

, A crescent kick is a defending kick used to protect yourself from an opponent that has a blade. Use this with caution, as if you lose your balance it is possible that they could ruin you in an instant.First, straighten your left leg and bring your right leg up to the height of your left thigh.
Secondly, swivel the right leg (still standing on your left) from right to left. This is to block a punch or to hook in their arm.
Bring your right leg higher, preparing for the maximum power.
Propel your leg forwards with as much force as you can muster. You should now be powerfully kicking the hand holding the blade, and with luck, if performed correctly, the weapon will fly from their hand.

, This is a move used to block multiple punches by professionals in karate. It is difficult to master, but should protect your face and stomach from being injured in combat.

Start off with your right fist near your jaw and right elbow resting on your chest. Your left elbow should rest on your hip, the fist protecting your navel.
Bring the left arm up to protect your forehead, and your right arm should move further to your right, and complete a full circle of the outside area.
As you finish the circle with your right arm, bring your left back down to protect your right shoulder, and overlap your right arm to create a cross shape.
Bring your right fist down to point towards your feet, relaxing your elbow, and move the left fist up to protect your jawline.

, Right leg in front of the left, both slightly bent, with your fists protecting your face and chest. This will be the stance you hold yourself in when you are in combat., If your opponent goes to kick you, grab his foot and shove him backwards as far as possible, landing a punch to the side of his head while you do this., Unless you are trained in fighting or martial arts, putting yourself in harm's way is not wise unless you have no other option. If possible, hide, escape, or fend off your attacker by other means.

If the intruder has a gun or other deadly weapon, an unsuccessful physical attack is likely to put yourself at greater risk. Be smart and only use these techniques as a last resort.

, You should do this from the neutral stance, swivelling your hips for momentum as you land the punch with force. This move can kill people if done too powerfully, as the head will snap back and the neck could break. If you wouldn't kill in defence, it is best to avoid this move., Curve your finger and hook the inside of your opponent's mouth, pulling as far as you can. They may bite, so don't risk this for too long, but it should cause enough of a delay to enable you to land a good blow to their gut to severely wind them. This move could be completed with a ferocious kick to the shins., A sharp and swift elbow to the nose can be excruciatingly painful and even provoke a break if done right. Their head should fall to the side after carrying out this move, which would enable you to kick their crotch area for a nice finish., A short and sharp jab to the gut will wind them and possibly win you the fight - especially as if you are in close proximity they might not see it coming. Be as precise as possible, taking great care not to over-swing, and keep your feet firmly planted for extra strength. , If you see an aerosol lying around, or if you own pepper spray, pick it up and spray it in your opponent's eyes. They should stumble back, so a jab to the gut or kick in the calf should finish the move and injure them greatly. If you don't particularly want to fight any further, you could use this moment as a way of making an escape. Always be looking for an opportunity to end the fight, flee, or get help., If you are near a wall, you should back up your opponent into it. Punch them in the gut swiftly and this should wind them enough to enable you to grasp their head and push it with force against the wall. This could mean all sorts of legal implications if you injured the opponent too much through this. Aim for a knock-out, not a kill, and only do this if you are within inches of losing your own life., They will not be as familiar with the furniture in your household as you are. Backing them into a sofa arm and pushing them down is a great way of dominating your partner. Remember to make use of what's around you, and if you are in great danger of death, use the heavy/sharp object from earlier. , If you live in the United States, it is possible that you have a registered and licensed gun in your possession. Try to find this if you own one.

It is not advisable to shoot unless the other party, also, are armed, due to the legal implications. The damage you do in self-defence must be thought appropriate for the situation - for example, if you are up against an unarmed intruder who lacks in muscle, then yes the law still protects you, but your plea of self defence would be compromised by the fact that a gun would not have been necessary to conquer your opponent. Any damage you do must be enough to protect you, no more than this, so strongly evaluate the situation before jumping right in and firing shots. , A sofa, a table? You could consider hiding outside the door-frame of the room they are in, or crouching behind a bookcase. You don't need to be hidden, you just need to ensure that the main parts of your body are not exposed to their gun's chamber., It sounds ludicrously simple, but throwing things can cause a distraction enough for you to get to another room. It is utterly unsafe to be in a room with someone armed when you are not. Try ornaments, lamps - anything that will daze them. Don't always aim for their head, as this will make it easy for them to dodge. Throw some things at their stomach and calves., You know your house better than anybody. Consequently, if you can leave the room in a safe and orderly manner, you should find a nook or cranny to wait in. This should be out of the way, but somewhere you genuinely think they'll walk past. As they walk past, you have to make an extremely bold move that would not be suggested unless your situation was life-threatening, or you were being pursued.

Wait until they're just about to walk past your hiding place, and put them in a headlock from behind. Use two hands - this is not usual, but they might be able to escape if your grip is not secure. Then, wrestle the gun from them. You don't necessarily have to pull the trigger if this troubles you greatly, but keeping the gun safely out of your opponent's way should make you feel safer.

, If they do not know your whereabouts, but are actively pursuing you, it might be an idea to 'melee' them. Do this by waiting until their back is turned for you - perhaps if they are walking through the hallway or peering into a room to find you. You should find a sharp or heavy object. Sneak up on them as stealthily as possible, holding your breath, and hit their head from behind. This should alarm them, and buy you time to wrestle the gun from them and run., Everybody should know the best parts of the body to hit in what situation.The eyes. Gouging, poking or scratching your opponent's eyes is very effective as not only does it hurt them but it impairs their vision, giving you an escape opportunity. Do this if you are extremely close to your partner - it is not a move worth performing if there is a gap between the two of you.
The nose. Contrary to popular belief, the best time to target the nose is when you are directly in front of or diagonal to your partner, no gap between you. Go for a smack aimed upwards, throwing your entire body into the move. This will force an opponent to loosen their grip on you, and cause immense discomfort. If you are being pursued by an opponent (so they are behind you), elbow their nose or strike a side punch.
The neck. The side of the neck is a perfect target if you want to hurt the opposition, but not cause too much damage. Stunning the attacker with a knife-hand strike (whereby your hand is flat as if to slap them, but horizontal) to the throat or even elbow the throat of the assailant for maximum damage.
The knee. The knee is an easy target because it cannot be defended with fists and is vulnerable from every angle. Kick the side of the knee with vigor to harm and cause your partner to stagger. A kick to the front of the knee would also do the trick, but is less likely to cause an imbalance.
Below the ear. A strike to the area just below the ear will cause severe damage when performed correctly. This can cause death to the partner if executed too strongly, so be very wary.
The throat. Take your palm upwards to their nose, which will push their head backwards. This leaves their throat exposed. You can use this opportunity to punch their adam's apple or bash in their neck.

, Don't pull back or try to struggle - instead, get into a strong squatting stance and bend your towards your opponent until they can no longer hold your wrist., A sharp backwards kick to an assailant should weaken their knees and give you opportunity to escape a headlock from behind, whilst still attacking an opponent in front. This is performed very easily - just bend your right knee and jab it backwards as powerfully as possible., If there are multiple people attacking you want to shake them all off, fast, before they dominate you. A side kick to the stomach of someone harming you might be your last hope. To execute it right, simply bring up the leg on the side of the person you plan on kicking, jab them whilst sliding your opposite foot back slightly, and aim as high as possible. This should cause a definite stumble, which may leave a gap in their attack., You may be a whirl of arms and legs when being attacked by more than one person, but that's okay, as long as you are being effective. Elbow the nose of someone next to you if you are surrounded, whilst kicking their calf. This should lessen their defence, and you can dominate them., As animalistic and disturbing as this may be, it could completely shock them. And sometimes the element of surprise is what will buy you time, or eventually, win you the fight. If you do resort to biting, the best places to aim for are the neck and the collarbone. Remember to continue kicking others whilst carrying this out., Be honest about the outcome of the fight. Tell them in no uncertain terms how you defended yourself, and what has happened to the intruder now. Describe their appearance and the time they arrived. Try to recall objects that may have their fingerprints. Offer security footage from everywhere in the area that may be able to help them identify the criminal. If you went too far in the fight and took the life of your opponent, be honest with this too, and get a lawyer instantly. , The works. Repair any damage to doors or windows as soon as possible. Ensure every day that your door is locked and bolted at all times., Even the best fighters can get severely harmed in combat, so don't be afraid to get in an ambulance and treat any sprained or broken bones or blood clots. While waiting for the ambulance, compress any blood with a swatch of material and try to get comfortable if your bones are harmed. Don't try to get up., It will be hard to forget an experience like this. Seek counseling if you fear for your mental health and sanity. Take pleasure out of things in life. It is likely that you will be very paranoid for a while after the incident. That's fine, and only to be expected. Don't let this paranoia ruin you, though. Psychologically, it may be hard to feel safe for a long time after the event. Talk to as many people as possible - it will soothe you. "

Talk to someone that has a neck tattoo.",How to Choose a Neck Tattoo Design," You may already have a good idea of the tattoo you want to get. However, your idea may require a specific style of tattooing. For instance, if you just want the outline of a star or another simple “flash” design, any experienced, well-respected tattoo artist will likely be able to provide you what you want. However, if you want a certain type of pattern or a realistic image, you may need to go a specific tattoo shop, or even a specific artist, to get what you’re looking for.Different styles of tattoo include New American Traditional, Japanese, and tribal.
There are also shops and artists that specialize in even more specific styles, such as lettering or watercolor tattoos.;
, If you know you want a Koi fish wrapped around your throat, it’s highly advisable to find an experienced tattoo artist that has done neck tattoos before and that specializes in Japanese style tattoos. Not only will the final product be much higher quality, tattoo artists that are experienced in working with the styles you’re thinking about can help you pick a specific design.The more specialized an artist is, the more likely it is that they are often booked well in advance. This is especially true if the artist is particularly gifted, as people who want the type of tattoo they specialize will seek them out from far and wide.

, Ensure that the portfolio includes many photos of actual tattoos (as opposed to illustrations), and that they were taken in the shop in which they work. Ask about neck tattoos in particular, as this can be a challenging place to give a tattoo.An additional benefit of looking at an artist's portfolio is that it might inspire a specific aspect of your own design.

, The more well-known and well-respected a tattoo artist is, the more valuable their time and artwork. Always ask what an artist's minimum price is, as well as their hourly rate. They will likely give you an estimate on the total cost of your tattoo. It is also customary to tip for tattoos.The artist will be happy to answer your questions. Simply say something like, ""What should I know about your pricing?""
Those incredible tattoo artists you see on Instagram are often booked years in advance, and charge high prices for their time. Note that there are likely gifted, professional artists in your area.

, A final factor to consider when selecting the artist you want to work with is the cleanliness of their shop and equipment. In particular, you should watch the artist remove a new needle and tube set from its sealed envelope just before they begin working on your tattoo. Feel free to ask any questions you have about sterilization and safety. A professional tattoo artist will entirely understand your desire to ensure safety.Similarly, make sure your artist uses a new ink supply and a new disposable container for every tattoo. They should also wear a new pair of disposable gloves while handling the equipment and giving you your tattoo.
Never work with an artist that is evasive about answering your questions or works in shop that does not have your complete confidence in terms of sanitation.

, Small, subtle neck tattoos often look great. Meanwhile, large, colorful tattoos can make a prominent statement. Either way, size is important, and deciding how big you want your neck tattoo to be can help you finalize the tattoo’s design.


For instance, if you go small, the design will need to be simpler, and have less specific details. Good small tattoos might be outlines, filled-in shapes, or lettering.
Further, smaller tattoos give you more placement options, while larger tattoos will be much more visible.

, There aren’t many locations on your body that are more visible than your neck. This makes neck tattoos a serious commitment. In fact, many artists will be hesitant to tattoo your neck if it’s your first tattoo. If you’re certain that you want to have a neck tattoo and have an artist that is comfortable working with you, you still have to decide where, specifically, on your neck you want it.Popular options include the back of the neck, low on the neck near the collarbone, and high on the neck behind the ear.
Tattoos on your neck will also hurt a good amount, especially in certain spots.
Talk to your artist about any concerns you have about pain, as well as whether a tattoo in a certain location may fade differently than in another area.

, One of the reasons that back-of-the-neck tattoos are especially popular is that they can be hidden by long hair and some clothing styles. Aside from hair and clothes, however, it’s important to think about how a tattoo will mesh with your style more generally.For instance, if you like to wear necklaces, think about how the location of a neck tattoo will look with the types of necklaces you like to wear.
Further, do you commonly wear a collared shirt? You may want to place the tattoo where is will be more often hidden or where it is fully visible.

, Think about why you want to get a tattoo on your neck. Are you trying to make a statement, express your personal style, or both? These sorts of considerations can help you decide some of the specific aspects of the design. Still, your options are almost unlimited. Fortunately, there's inspiration all over the internet.


Aside from online artists' portfolios and tattoo collectors' social media threads, you can also search for illustrations or images of the sort of thing you're envisioning.
For instance, maybe you know you want a knife. Even though you have an initial concept in mind, there are plenty of specifics to determine: Will the blade be curved? What will the handle look like? Are you picturing a folding knife or a fixed blade?

, Whatever the style and content of the tattoo you’re planning, have your artist sketch it up on paper first. After telling them what you’re looking for, this will likely be the first step in their creative process. Once you see the sketch, you can tell them about any changes you’d like for the final tattoo. Once you have a finalized sketch, they can even transfer onto your skin with non permanent ink so you can see what it will look like.Be aware that most shops require a deposit to sketch your tattoo. If you decide not to get the tattoo, you won’t be charged for the tattooing fee, but the artist will keep the deposit.
Don't worry about asking for multiple rounds of adjustments.

, Some neck tattoo ideas can be developed into larger pieces that extend partially onto the neck. For instance, dragon tattoos are particularly popular, but often require a good amount of detail and need to be larger. As such, consider something like a dragon on your shoulder or back with their head reaching up and onto your neck.There are plenty of great options for tattoos that cover multiple body parts. The bigger it is, in fact, the more detailed the piece can be.
Animals or any type look especially good, as the tattoo will move as you move your body.

, If you already have tattoos near your neck and are looking to expand, consider extending the themes or content of other tattoos in close proximity. For instance, if you have a tree on your back, consider adding a sun or a bird to the back of your neck in a similar style.Similarly, add to a theme you've already started. For instance, if your back is covered in sea creatures, you could add a star fish to your Adam's apple, or get two little jellyfish tattooed behind your ears.

, Another great source of inspiration, as well as advice, is someone who already has a neck tattoo. You can ask them questions about how it felt to get the tattoo, and why they chose the location they did, etc. If you already have a concept in mind, ask them what they think about it, just to hear another person’s perspective.


For example, if you see someone with a tattoo you admire, say something like, ""Hey! I noticed your neck tattoo and I think it's great. I've been thinking about getting one myself. Do you have any advice about placement or another factor I should consider?""

Expect discomfort and try to avoid activities that will irritate it.,
Time it right!,
Clean with saline.,
Watch your piercing progress.,
When removing crust, soak, don't pick.,
Don't over-clean.,
Don't play with it.,
Wait until the correct healing time has elapsed before even thinking about changing jewelry, especially lower-grade jewelry.

",How to Care for New Body Piercings," For example, if you play a sport that requires a helmet, don't get a piercing on your outer ear cartilage when you will be doing that in the next couple of weeks.;
, If your piercing requires shoving wet, salty cotton wool up your nose three times a day or putting a cup of saline over your nipples, don't get it when you will have to be at school or work. Make sure you have the free time to keep it clean at least initially - if not a holiday, at least a long weekend.

,


Lots of places sell their own particular variant on salty water as a piercing cleaning agent. This is never going to be much more effective than cheap, plentiful salt water. Soak piercings in warm salt water before cleaning.







, Your piercing will, in most cases, develop a 'crust'. It will in all likelihood also ooze white liquid and occasionally bleed. This is normal.


It is not normal for your piercing to ooze green liquid, smell bad or hurt a lot unless it's very fresh or you've been too rough with it. If this happens, rethink your cleaning and possibly contact your piercer.






Piercings go through two healing stages: the primary healing period, after which the piercing appears healed from the outside and can survive a jewelry change but is still fragile, and the secondary, after which the piercing will have formed a solid tunnel and will not close up (mostly!) after short periods without jewelry.







, It will come off easily once saturated.

, There is such a thing as too much cleaning. Twice a day should suffice for most even at the very beginning; once a day once the primary healing period has passed.

, If your piercer is even halfway decent, they will tell you this when you get it done - don't play with it all the time! Specifically, don't play with it while it's 'crusty'. This could damage the edges of the healing wound, dragging tiny bits of scab through it that will hurt like hell.

Leave the bandage on for 2 to 24 hours.,

Be mindful of changes to the tattooed skin.",How to Care for a Tattoo," Any reputable tattoo artist will cover your tattoo with some form of bandage immediately after finishing it. There are varying opinions about how long this bandage should be left on, though.


Ask the tattoo artist responsible for your new ink for his or her recommendation.
A thick, absorbent, non-stick dressing can usually be left on overnight, or for as long as 24 hours. These bandages are more breathable than other types and do not become saturated by sweat. As such, they protect your wounded skin while providing enough airflow to help the skin heal.Thin gauze and plastic wrap should only be left on for a few hours. The gauze will become too saturated, while the plastic wrap will not let your skin breathe. Leave these bandages on for the first couple of hours to begin the healing process, then remove them to continue the process.;
, Unwrap the bandage carefully to prevent yourself from accidentally ripping or damaging the sensitive skin beneath as it tries to heal.


Wash your hands with antibacterial soap and water before beginning.
The bandage may stick as you remove it, especially if you left it on for more than two hours. If this happens, gently wet it by splashing a little water over the gauze. Moistening the gauze should make it easier to peel it away.
Allow the tattooed skin to breathe for a few minutes before continuing.

, Use cool to warm water and a mild soap to wash the tattooed skin. Rinse the soapy residue away with cool to warm water.


Avoid extreme temperatures. Room-temperature water is ideal, but it can be a little cooler or a little warmer.
Only use mild soap on your tattoo. An unscented soap without dyes or harsh chemicals is ideal.
Do not use a washcloth, loofah, or sponge to wash the tattoo. These materials are too abrasive and may damage the skin.
Make sure that all traces of blood are wiped away. If you allow dried blood to stick to your skin, you will encourage the formation of scabs.
Do not let any soapy residue remain on the tattooed skin after washing it.

, Gently pat the wet skin with a clean, soft paper towel until it feels dry to the touch.


Alternatively, you could allow the skin to air dry for about 10 minutes.
Do not scrub or wipe the skin as you dry it, since this could cause bleeding or irritation.
Do not dry the area with a cloth towel. Cloth towels are more likely to contain bacteria than clean paper towels are.
Avoid abrasive paper towels. Use the softest paper towel possible. You could try a tissue or toilet paper, instead, but be aware that these products may stick to the skin, thereby causing additional problems.

, Wipe a thin layer of ointment over dry tattooed skin using clean fingers or a clean paper towel. Blot away excess with a clean paper towel.


You should only apply enough lotion or ointment to just barely cover the tattoo. The skin should not look greasy or soggy.
Massage the ointment or lotion into your skin until it disappears. Do not leave a coating over the tattoo.
Ointments generally last longer and are better at preventing the skin from drying out, but a lotion will suffice if you do not have an ointment to use.
Do not use products containing aloe vera, alcohol, or cortisone.

, Even if your skin feels raw or sensitive, you should not apply a new bandage or wrapping to your skin. From this point on, the tattooed skin must be exposed to the air in order to heal properly.

, For the first two weeks, at least, you should wash the tattooed skin with warm water and mild soap twice a day.


Wash the tattoo after waking up and before going to bed.
Follow the same steps you followed during the first washing. Make sure that your hands are clean, and gently scrub the area using only your fingers. Pat dry with a clean paper towel.

, You should apply a thin layer of ointment or lotion four to six times each day in order to keep the skin moist and reduce itching.


As with washing, you should follow the same guidelines for moisturizing as you followed for the first day. Only apply a small amount and gently rub it into your skin until it disappears.

, If your tattoo is in a location that would usually be covered by clothing, make sure that any clothes you do wear over the tattooed area are very loose.


Tight clothes can brush against the new tattoo, causing the skin beneath it to become inflamed. This can be painful and can also cause infection.
Clothing that rubs against the tattoo can also cause the fresh ink to fade more.

, Wear clothing or other loose coverings over the tattoo for the first few weeks to prevent the new ink from being exposed to the sun.


The damaged skin may dry out even more, causing excessive scabbing and flaking. The tattoo itself is also more likely to fade when exposed to the sun for more than a few minutes.
Avoid the use of sunscreen during the first few weeks. Sunscreen is helpful later on, but it tends to be too greasy in these early stages and may cause the skin to become too moist or soggy.

, Avoid long baths or showers for the first several weeks. Completely stay away from swimming.


A prolonged soak can cause soft skin tissue to become soggy. The ink may also run or fade.
Keep your showers to 10 minutes or less if possible.
Avoid swimming pools, the ocean, hot tubs, and saunas. Water with chlorine in it is especially bad for your tattoo.

, Your skin will form a protective layer over the tattoo as it heals. As a result, flaking and mild scabbing are both standard and helpful.


A thick, hard scab may form if you do not keep the area moist or make the area too moist. The scab may even crack a little as you move. The ink sits within the scab, though, gradually healing into the skin as a result.
If you keep the skin perfectly moist, a thinner membrane will form over the area. This layer will peel off like a sunburn peels. You may even see a few flakes that are colored by the tattoo.

, No matter how much the skin itches, you must not scratch it while the tattooed area heals.


Picking at scabs can cause them to break open and become infected. You may also peel away some of the ink.
Similarly, scratching at flaking skin can cause you to peel away too much of the color.

, Infections are rare if you manage to care for the area properly, but since the skin is wounded, they can occur. If you suspect that the area is infected, talk to a doctor.


Signs of infection include puss or a strong, unpleasant odor coming from the skin.
Some infections are also accompanied by fevers.

, You should aim to drink an 8-oz (250-ml) glass of water six to eight times a day.


Overall hydration is essential. When your body is hydrated, the skin is more elastic. As a result, the damaged skin around the tattoo can heal faster and more completely.

, Sun will always remain an enemy of your tattoo, but after the first month or so, you can and should apply sunscreen to the area every time you plan to go outside.


Ultraviolet light causes tattoo ink to fade.
The sunscreen you use should offer broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays. It should also be SPF 30 or higher, and have a water-resistant formula.
Apply the sunscreen 20 minutes before you go outside, if possible, so that it has enough time to work its way into the skin.

, Tanning beds and sunlamps also use ultraviolet light to tan the skin, so they should be avoided.


The UV light can fade your tattoo. The high-intensity of light in a tanning bed can also affect the ink and cause a painful reaction.

, This is especially important if you have a job that causes you to sweat or if you work out frequently.Wear clothes designed to wick away moisture.
Change clothes immediately after working up a sweat. If this is not possible, then you should at least periodically wipe the sweat off your tattoo.
Sweat can cause the color to fade faster.

, Rashes can occur even in later stages of a tattoo's lifespan.


Rashes usually occur after prolonged exposure to the sun.
Rashes can also occur if you use a new skin care or skin cosmetic product that contains a chemical, dye, or other element your skin is not accustomed to.
Immediately stop the behavior you suspect might be causing the rash. If this does not cause the rash to go away, consult your doctor.

, A strong ointment may no longer be necessary after the first month or so, but you should continue to keep the skin moisturized with a water-based lotion or cream on a daily basis.


Avoid petroleum-based products. Petroleum jelly can actually cause tattoo ink to fade.

, Allergies and skin cancer can occur in tattooed skin, especially if low-quality ink was used.


Pay close attention to small bumps or a single large bump. You should also have any moles checked out by a dermatologist.

These measures may seem extreme, but if your piercing becomes infected, you will have a much bigger problem on your hands with a much longer healing process. Take precautionary measures to heal your piercing and your body will thank you.

In addition to saliva, any rough play, rubbing, or touching should be avoided as well.

, You will probably feel most comfortable in a fitted sports bra, tank top, or shirt. Cotton is preferable since it is breathable and absorbs sweat, which decreases the ability for germs to harbor and cause infection.


Wash and change your sheets once a week as well.
Sleeping in a fitted sports bra or tank top will also keep you from snagging your piercing on your sheets or comforter.

, While your piercing is healing, you may experience some discoloration and tightness around the jewelry. Your body will also secrete a whitish-yellow fluid, and you will see crust on your jewelry. All of this is normal. You still may have crusties after your piercing heals. The crust should easily wash away with warm water.


Pay attention to the amount of discharge and crust that you have. This will help you gauge what is normal for you.

, If you experience redness, unusual swelling, itching, burning, a rash, or pain that will not go away or subside, you may have an infection. If you do not have an infection, you may be sensitive to the cleaning products you are using or to the jewelry that is in your piercing.Pay attention to your body, if you feel like something is not right, look into it.
If you notice a bad odor,an increase in discharge, or your discharge changes color,you may have an infection as well.

, Contact your piercer or your doctor if you see any signs of infection. If you think your piercing may be infected, do not remove the jewelry. Taking out the jewelry may not clear the infection automatically. Leave the jewelry in and wait for a consultation from a licensed piercer or doctor. Reach out at the first sign of infection. The longer you wait the worse it will get.
You may be advised to remove your piercing, take antibiotics, or have some type of surgical intervention. Most infections can be treated with antibiotics."

Visit your doctor.",How to Care for a New Navel Piercing," Do your research to find a reputable piercing shop with trained, professional piercers. You can ask friends and family about the places they got their piercing done, and ask if they would recommend the place.You never want to skimp on the quality of the establishment or piercer you visit. The more professional the business and certified its employees, the less likely you’ll experience problems or infections with your piercing. An experienced piercer could also offer expert advice on sizing, jewelry, and other questions you might have while getting your piercing done.


Visiting a safe and reputable piercing shop will likely mean that the piercers use quality jewelry for their piercings. Quality piercing jewelry includes jewelry made from implant grade stainless steel, titanium, nickel-free 14-karat (or higher) solid white or yellow gold, and niobium just to name a few.A professional piercer will also use a hollow needle to create your piercing rather than a needle gun. If any piercing shop wants to use a needle gun to create your piercing, you should look elsewhere. Needle guns can damage the skin significantly, and are more likely to cause infections.;
, Wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and water before you touch your piercing with your fingers.Dirt and oils from your fingers can transfer to your piercing (which is an open wound), and potentially cause an infection.


Try to make sure to use your nails to scrape out and remove any dirt from underneath your nails. Dirt from underneath your nails could also transfer to and infect your piercing as you touch it.

, Use a Q-Tip dipped in warm water to wipe and remove any built up crust from around the piercing site. Do this very gently, avoiding moving the jewelry around too much. Then, wash your piercing with antibacterial soap in the shower. Simply add a small amount of soap to your fingertips, and massage and lather the soap onto your piercing for about 20 seconds.Use the shower water to thoroughly rinse off the soap residue. Exit the shower and dry your piercing using a dry paper towel rather than a bath towel.


Your piercing should be washed with soap twice a day. However, you can use a Q-Tip dipped in water or salt water to remove crust as well. Just try not to clean it with a Q-Tip more than 3 times a day. You want to avoid over cleaning the piercing.
You should always shower rather than taking a bath. With a shower, you have a steady stream of clean water, whereas a bath contains standing water mixed with sweat, dirt, and residue from your bathing products.
It's better to dry your piercing using paper towels, since they are clean and disposable.Bath towels, on the other hand, can harbor moisture and bacteria.
Avoid twisting or turning your piercing too much while you clean it in the shower. Any excessive movement can cause irritation and bleeding.

, Mix ¼ teaspoon of sea salt into 8 oz of boiled water. Wait for the water to cool so it’s warm, yet comfortable to the touch. Pour this salt water mixture into a small glass, lean over (so your stomach is relatively perpendicular to the top rim of the glass), securely put the glass on your stomach, and hold it tightly in place as you lay down on your back. Allow this vacuumed glass of salt water to soak on your piercing for 10-15 minutes at least once a day.The saltwater is highly effective in fighting off bacteria, and can help in removing crust from the piercing site.


You could also make a warm compress with salt water and a folded up paper towel, or use a sterile sea-salt spray purchased from your local drug store.

, Some piercing professionals have found that taking vitamins such as Vitamin C, Zinc, or multivitamins are beneficial in stimulating navel piercing healing.Getting vitamin D exposure from the sun may also help promote healing of your navel piercing., Of course it’s appropriate to touch your piercing with clean hands while you wash it, but avoid playing with, twisting, pulling, or fondling your piercing unnecessarily.Any excessive touching (especially with unwashed hands) can make your piercing more susceptible to opening up and bleeding, or becoming infected.

, Your initially piercing jewelry should stay in place for the duration of the healing period (4-10 weeks).Removing your jewelry before your piercing is fully healed can cause your piercing site to close up, which can in turn make reinserting jewelry more difficult and painful.


This added irritation could potentially create more scarring and slow down your body’s natural healing process.

, Ointments or creams prevent your piercing from coming in contact with air, and breathing. They block out air and seal in moisture at the piercing site with potential bacteria.Even though these ointments might be antibacterial, they can extremely hinder the healing process, and yield an infection.


Harsh cleansers like hydrogen peroxide and rubbing alcohol should also be avoided. These disinfectants can kill of the cells that help rebuild the puncture site of the piercing.
Cleaning solutions containing Benzalkonium Chloride (or BZK) should also be avoided, as these can similarly inhibit your piercing from properly healing.Much like these cleansers, any oils, lotions, sunscreens, and makeup should be kept away from your piercing site. These products can all clog your piercing and encourage an infection.

, Tight, constricting clothing can irritate a new piercing because of the friction against the piercing, and its lack of access to fresh air. Try to wear loose-fitting, breathable fabrics like cotton, and stay away from synthetic materials.Also be cautious when changing or undressing. Removing your clothes roughly or quickly, increases your chances of snagging your piercing on your clothes, and causing injury.

, Just like you should avoid taking a bath and instead take a shower, you should also avoid other pools or collections of water. Water areas like swimming pools, hot tubs, and lakes and rivers should be avoided during the first year after your initial piercing.This is because all of these water sources could potentially make prolonged contact with your new piercing, with water that might be harboring infecting contaminants.

, Sleep on your back and sides for the first few weeks after your piercing. This helps to ensure that you don’t apply uncomfortable pressure on your piercing by sleeping on your stomach, while it’s still new and sensitive., If you are experiencing complications with your navel piercing, first assess your symptoms to figure out what issue you might be dealing with. Note any discharges coming from you piercing, the pain level you’re experiencing, any swelling or redness, and any physical changes in the piercing site (like bumps forming, the jewelry changing position, skin opening larger than normal around the metal, etc.). Depending on your symptoms, your piercing may simply be irritated, infected, or you could be having an allergic reaction to the metal.The less severe your symptoms are, the more probable it is that you mildly irritated your piercing. The more severe your symptoms are, the more probable it is that your piercing is infected, or you’re experiencing an allergic reaction.

, If your piercing was healing normally and you accidently pulled or tugged on it, slept on it, irritated it with pool water or cosmetics, and are now experiencing some discomfort, you may have slightly irritated your piercing.Your piercing site might also be irritated if the jewelry is too tight or too loose and is moving around too much or pinching your skin. An irritated piercing is indicated with mild discomfort and irritation symptoms. Things like slight swelling, slight redness, and slight discomfort (without severe pain and discharges) qualify as mild irritation symptoms. Maintain your cleaning routine with a saline solution, and treat your piercing as if it were brand new.Consider applying a cold compress (consisting of cool water and a small cloth or towel) onto your piercing. This may help relieve some discomfort.
Leave the jewelry in your piercing. Removing the jewelry may irritate your piercing site even more.
If you have any questions, consult your piercer, or visit them in person so they can look at your piercing.

, It is normal to have some discomfort, bleeding, and bruising after getting your navel pierced, but you should also look out for signs of a possible infection. When a navel piercing gets infected, there is usually severe swelling and redness around the piercing site.The piercing site may feel warm or give off a feeling of heat, and can also have green, yellow, or gray discharge accompanied by a foul odor. You may also develop of fever with an infected navel piercing.


If you believe that your navel piercing has become infected, see a physician as soon as possible. If you are not sure if your piercing is infected, you can contact your piercer to evaluate if your symptoms are normal, or correlative with an infection.
Do not remove your piercing jewelry if you believe your piercing is infected. Removing your jewelry could irritate the infection and cause your piercing hole to close, preventing your piercing from properly draining.

, An allergic reaction might happen hours or days after your initial piercing. Normally, an allergic reaction is your body’s response to being allergic to the jewelry’s metal. Nickel is a common metal that causes an allergic reaction with piercings. Signs of an allergic reaction include itchiness around the piercing site that turns into a rash, heat radiating from the piercing site, a widened piercing hole, or swelling and inflammation around the piercing site.With an allergic reaction, your skin might also loosen or tighten around the jewelry.


Rejection of the jewelry is a common characteristic with allergic reactions. The skin tries to decrease contact with the jewelry, causing the piercing holes to enlarge and widen.
In this case, contact your piercer immediately so they can change out the jewelry and you can visit your primary doctor and start treating your piercing site. You may need a prescribed round of antibiotics., If your symptoms are initially mild in nature or think you might be in the beginning stages of an infection, consider trying some home remedies to fix the problem before having to consult a doctor. A few soothing home remedies include:



Compresses. As mentioned earlier, both warm and cold compresses can relieve discomfort with irritated piercings. A warm compress dipped and wrung out with a saline solution can clean out the area while promoting blood flow (healing white blood cells) to the irritated area.A cool compress can soothe the hot feeling radiating from the piercing site.

Chamomile tea soaks. Steep a bag of chamomile tea in a cup of boiling water. Wait for the tea to cool (approximately 20 mins) and dip a cotton ball into the tea. Use the cotton ball to soak your irritated piercing for approximately 5 minutes.Repeat this if desired at least once a day.

You could also freeze the tea into ice cubes, and use the tea ice cubes to relieve pain, irritation, and swelling.



Pain relief medications. If your piercing site is achy and painful, consider taking over the counter pain medication to reduce the discomfort. Try to stick to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications., When in doubt, you should always visit your primary care doctor. If you aren’t finding relief with your sustained cleaning routine or implementing home remedies, it may be time to seek professional medical help. You should especially visit your doctor if you are experiencing severe pain, swelling, discharge, and bleeding.If you do have an infection or allergic reaction, your doctor can prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection and speed up recovery.

Brush using small circular motions.,
Brush for at least two minutes.,
Use your toothbrush to clean the jewelry outside your mouth.,
Replace the jewelry.,
Rinse your mouth with salt water before bedtime.This is an effective way to reduce the bacteria in your mouth (in addition to brushing and flossing) without leaving a residual effect like chlorhexidine rinses.,
Use a chlorhexidine mouthwash for the next two weeks.,
See your dentist every six months.,
Know the complications that can be brought by tongue piercings.",How to Brush Your Teeth with a Tongue Piercing," This prevents food particles from sticking to your tongue piercing and lessens the debris you need to get rid off while brushing.


Put the jewelry in a covered container with 10 ml of mouthwash (Listerine, Orahex) diluted in 5 ml of water.
Put it back in your tongue only after you have brushed your teeth.;
, Whenever you are brushing your teeth - in the morning, after eating, before bed - it's a good idea to do it without the jewelry in your tongue, in order to avoid irritating the piercing and to clean the teeth properly.


Brushing your teeth properly is important, as it removes any food particles from between your teeth that could potentially become attached to the jewelry and cause infection.
Therefore, brushing your teeth well will help your tongue piercing to stay healthy and last longer.

, Starting with the back teeth, place the head of you toothbrush at a 45 degree angle with the bristles facing the neck of your teeth.


This is the best angle for cleaning both the teeth and the gums, which is essential for preventing the build up of plaque and bacteria.

, Instead of using a back-and-forth motion to brush the teeth, use small circular motions. This effectively cleans the teeth without damaging the enamel.


After about 15 seconds of brushing, do a rolling or sweeping motion to direct all the debris towards the biting surface of your teeth.

, It's important to clean every tooth surface thoroughly - front and back. It should take you about 2 to 3 minutes to do this properly, so use a timer if necessary. Remember to brush your teeth at least twice, but preferable three times per day.


After brushing, floss all your interdental areas as you normally do. Take extra care while working on the areas close to the hole in your tongue, as knocking your hand against it could be painful.

, Brushing the jewelry with a toothbrush outside your mouth helps to remove food debris, plaque or calculus deposits from the surface of the metal, which helps to prevent your tongue from getting infected.


To clean the jewelry, wash your hands thoroughly, then fill a small bowl with an antibacterial solution made by mixing one tablespoon of chlorhexidine mouth rinse with two tablespoons of water.
Dip your toothbrush in this solution and brush it on to the jewelry, making sure to scrub every surface. Holding it over the bowl is a good idea, in case the jewelry slips out of your hands during cleaning.

, Once you are done with the brushing, flossing and cleaning the jewelry, tighten the ball of the tongue ring to ensure that the ring is held tight and secure in its position.


If the ball remains loose, there's a chance it could get dislodged from the pierced area and fall into the throat, causing an emergency situation like choking.

,


To prepare a salt water rinse, dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water. Take a mouthful and swish it around your mouth for 1 minute before bedtime.

, Use a chlorhexidine-based mouthwash for the two weeks after getting your tongue pierced. The first week, swish the mouthwash at least 5 times a day and then gradually decrease it to 3 times a day in the second week.


When selecting a mouthwash, check to see if it is alcohol-free or not. Alcohol containing mouthwashes will produce a burning sensation around the area of piercing.
Chlorhexidine mouth rinses (when used for more than two weeks) can result in the following: altered taste, burning tongue sensation and tongue discoloration.

, It's extremely important to maintain good oral hygiene at all times, particularly when you have an oral piercing. Although good home care is an essential part of this, it will also be necessary for you to see your dentist and receive professional cleanings and inspections, approximately every six months.

, Mouth piercings are demanding of your time because they needs constant upkeep. Barbell tongue piercings in particular are a potential place for harboring bacteria inside your mouth. The following are the potential risks that a dirty piercing presents to your health.


Tongue infection.
Damage to teeth and fillings.
Damage to gums.
Nerve damage.
However, these issues can largely be avoided with meticulous oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist. For more information on how to care for an oral piercing, see this article.

Let the baby oil sit on the tattoo for a minute.,
Get a washcloth and rub the tattoo vigorously.,
Wash the remaining oil off with warm water and soap.",How to Remove Temporary Tattoos1," Keep in mind that most temporary tattoos are able to stand up to water and soap, so oil is generally the best way to go if you want to scrub a temporary tattoo off.

Figure out what part of your body you want to apply your henna.,
Choose a design.,
Get that body area ready.",How to Use Henna for Skin1," Since henna is temporary, it gives you a lot more options of where you might want to display your art. There are some factors you will need to consider when making your decision:


Will the weather permit me to reveal more parts of my body so it can be shown?
Do I have any formal events to attend in the next couple of days that may call for location discretion?
Questions like these can help narrow down what part of your body you want the henna to be drawn. Popular locations are the hands, arms and feet.;
, Choosing a henna design can be a little bit overwhelming. Henna designs are unlimited, even within the traditional realm.


Picking a design is easy if you have a visual representation of what you want to do; you can also play around with you own design.
Go on the Internet and look up “henna designs” in your search engine. There are many different foundations that you can choose from.
Most people like floral designs; some people like paisley designs, or free hand patterns.

, Depending on where you want to apply the henna, wear clothing that will not get in the way. If your hair might get in the way, tie it aside in the opposite direction of the henna.


Make sure to clean the area with soap and water; you want to apply the henna smoothly.

Go to an experienced piercer.,
Think things through.,
Get proper aftercare.,
Skip making poor choices.,
When in doubt, discuss matters with your piercer.",How to Avoid Body Piercing Mistakes," Many people think that they can bargain shop for body mods, get their friend (who works at a jewelry store) to do it, or even pierce themselves. This is a mistake. Not all piercing shops are created equal, and not all piercers are equally skilled.


Look for someone who knows what they are doing and who runs a clean shop. Be willing to ask about practices; if you are given vague, evasive answers, please look elsewhere!
If you are thinking about avoiding professional studios altogether, stop immediately! Home piercings and jewelry guns are not safe for use on body piercings. They cause greater tissue damage and cannot be properly sterilized. Without the right equipment and a piercer who has been through an apprenticeship, you risk nasty infections and/or rejections with serious scarring.;
, A body piercing should never be a spur of the moment decision. Be willing to spend weeks or even months deciding on the right piercing for you. And think about how you will feel once you have it. Remember that a good piercing is a significant monetary and time investment. If you are not willing to make these investments, do not get pierced! Never get pierced while on drugs or after drinking alcohol.


While it might seem like a good idea to have a drink beforehand to relax, this will actually increase bleeding. Have the piercing first, then get a drink.

, A piercing is a wound and like any other wound, it is subject to infection and complications.


If you do not take care of your body piercing properly, you could end up with very unpleasant side effects. It could scar more than you want, migrate, or even reject, pulling out of your body completely.
Some very unfortunate people have ended up in the hospital from poor care of a piercing-related infection. Do not take the risk! Every piercing should be cared for as much as possible, even if it looks like everything is going just fine.

, Choose the piercing that will work best on your body, not one that you think is the most attractive on someone else. Just as clothes do not look the same on different bodies, anatomy affects a piercing too. Some piercings are not even possible on certain individuals.


Those with a single large vein in the tongue cannot get a central tongue piercing without risking serious bleeding and nerve damage. Other problems include a piercing that will not heal or one that simply looks out of place.

, They may certainly be able to tell you what will look best on you.

Sift your henna using a sifter to rid it of chunks that will clog your fine tip from which the henna comes out.,
Pour the henna powder into a small bowl.,
Mix 1/4 cup (60 ml) lemon juice or water with the henna powder using a whisk until you have a mixture that has the consistency of mashed potatoes.








,
Mix it well..








,
Cover the henna with plastic wrap.,
Scoop out the separated dye with a spoon.,
Place the henna into a plastic henna cone.",How to Use Henna for Skin2," Alternatively, stretch a pair of a nylon cloth over a plastic container and place the henna and some coins on top of the nylon cloth. If you are using fresh henna leaves, use a crusher or mixer and powder it up. Cover the container and shake it to sift the henna through the nylon cloth.








, If you are using henna powder, do as so.








,,,









Allow the henna to rest for 24 hours at room temperature to draw the dye out of the henna.
You will see the dye separate into a layer above the rest of the henna mixture as it matures.

, Add additional lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) at a time, until the consistency of the henna is similar to the consistency of yogurt.








,









Twist the top of the henna cone 1 or 2 times and wrap it tightly with a rubber band.
Roll the rubber band downward until the henna is touching both the tip of the cone and the base of the rubber band. This setup creates a tight seal that will ensure that your henna dispenses properly.

,









Apply gentle pressure with your thumb to the top of the cone, just beneath the rubber band, to dispense the henna through the tip of the cone.
If the henna does not dispense easily, you can clip the tip of the cone with fingernail clippers to enlarge the opening. Just remember to make very small cuts so that you don't overdo it.

, You can create your own original design or look at books or online templates for inspiration.









The hands and feet will stain darker than other parts of the body because the skin on the extremities is thicker.
The neck and face do not tend to stain well because the skin there is naturally thin and oily.

, The henna should not look wet or oily, but it shouldn't be so dry that it starts to crack.








, This gel comes in pump spray bottles and is normally used to style hair. You can purchase spray gel at your local drugstore or supermarket in the health and beauty section.








, Use a hair dryer to accelerate the process.








, When the gel has dried, you can wrap the design with gauze for extra protection.

Cleanse the spot you plan to tattoo.,
Exfoliate the area before the temporary tattoo is applied.Usually the very top layer of your skin is actually dead skin cells that we shed or scrub off.,
Choose an area where the skin won't constantly be moving or flexing or coming into contact with oils and other substances.,
Shave the area before the temporary tattoo is applied.,
Wash the areas around the tattoo, not the tattoo itself.,
Cover your tattoo with petroleum jelly, which can act as a sealant.,
Use baby powder, corn starch, or talcum powder on the tattoo.,
Go over your tattoo with a permanent marker when it begins to fade.,
Take a break from working out.,
Keep the henna paste wet as long as possible.,
Warm your skin while the henna paste is drying.,
Never use ""black henna,"" though it may promise to make your tattoo last longer.,
Avoid water for 24 hours after removing henna.Applying a coat of petroleum jelly can help create a seal over the tattoo and repel water.",How to Make a Temporary Tattoo Last Longer," Lotions, makeup, and the natural oils of your skin can all shorten the life of your tattoo.They can create a barrier between the ink and your skin, so the tattoo won't actually stick or be absorbed, and it will come off when the lotion comes off. Oils break down the inks in decal tattoos (baby oil is often used to wipe the tattoo off your skin), so if oil is already present, it will begin dissolving your tattoo right away.Make sure you dry your skin before applying the tattoo.;
, If you apply the tattoo directly onto this layer of skin, it's more likely to flake off as you shed the dead cells. Exfoliation removes this layer, giving you smooth, live skin to work with.


Exfoliate using a loofah or pumice stone and avoid techniques that will leave your skin oily, like salt or sugar rubs., The skin on your hands and feet are constantly stretching and moving, which can cause your tattoo to crack or fade quickly. Your hands also come in contact with lots of different substances throughout the day, from oily foods to art supplies to plain old soap and water. This constant contact may cause your tattoo to fade prematurely.The exception is with a henna tattoo, which actually works best on your hands and feet, because the skin is thicker. The more layers of skin, the more layers the ink can stain.Avoid areas that quickly become sweaty or oily naturally, like your temples, or your feet when you wear socks and shoes.
Avoid areas that will rub against your clothes., Hair might get in the way of the ink, so if there's a lot of hair in the area where you plan to put your tattoo, shave first.


If you are applying to an area you shave regularly, like your legs or neck, the act of shaving may remove your tattoo faster. Shaving before application may allow you to go longer without shaving once the tattoo is applied.Make sure you use a new, sharp razor if you are going to shave over your tattoo. A dull or nicked razor can cause your tattoo to flake., Many temporary tattoos are advertised as being waterproof, but the addition of soap may affect your tattoo.Plus, if you are scrubbing your skin clean, the friction will start to tear the ink from your skin.


It's ok to swim or shower with a waterproof temporary tattoo, just try not to soak it in a bath or allow it to come into contact with soap, body wash, or oils.

, Though most people consider petroleum jelly a moisturizer, it actually works by sealing the moisture into your skin, almost like a piece of plastic.Clear nail polish will have the same sealing effect as the petroleum jelly, but it won't be as messy, since it will dry on your skin.

, These substances are all highly absorbent, and can soak up the natural oils on your skin that would start to break down the ink in your tattoo.Be careful not to inhale these powders, as they can be harmful to your lungs.

, If the tattoo is simple and a single color, a thin or sharp-tipped permanent marker can be used to give the tattoo new life.


Trace over the tattoo design with a marker of the same color and fill in with ink. It won't last longer than a day or two at most.

, The excessive sweat and movement of your skin can cause the tattoo to fade faster, especially if it is rubbing against your work-out clothes., Spritzing the paste with a solution of lemon juice and sugar (which you can make at home or may be provided by a henna artist) will seal the paste on your skin and also keep it wet. As long as the paste is moist, it will continue to dye your skin and you can get a rich, dark color that will last longer.The henna will continue to work up to 12 hours after application if you keep it wet.Don't oversaturate the paste with spray--you don't want it so wet that the paste begins to slide or spread on your skin, blurring your design.Make your own spray by dissolving 1 1/2 tsp sugar in 3 tsp lemon juice. Gently heat the mixture in a sauce pan if the sugar doesn't dissolve after about a minute of stirring.

, Holding your hand or feet over a heater, stove, or fire will heat your skin and keep the henna paste moist. You can even use a heating pad--just be sure you don't accidentally rub off the design.Keep the area warm, but not hot--sweating too much might cause the paste to smudge., Black henna is not henna, which is derived from plants. Black or blue henna is actually a chemical called PPD, which is only approved for use in hair dye and can be harmful to your skin. It can cause rashes, allergic reactions, swelling, and other complications.Some black hennas may not have any actual henna in them at all and consist only of the harsh PPD., Water can cause the skin to dry out, which will increase the shedding of dead and dry skin."

If you don't want to draw your own design, you can search ""tattoo stencils,"" ""tattoo ideas,"" or ""flash art"" to find plenty of images you can use for inspiration or to copy for your temporary tattoo.


Search for your favorite cartoon characters, symbols, phrases, foods, and more. Any of these can become a cool new temporary tattoo!
Embroidery patterns are perfect models for your temporary tattoo. These designs are often simple, cute, and usually on the smaller side, which will transfer more easily to your body.
Try to avoid designs that are overly complex or detailed. Simple designs with bold lines generally translate well into tattoos. Designs with shading or intricate lines can be difficult to transfer.;
, If you are drawing the tattoo on yourself, make sure you choose a part of body you can easily reach. However, you could always ask an artistic friend to ""ink"" you, which will give you more flexibility when it comes to placement. You might want to avoid tattoos that require in you to be in weird or uncomfortable positions. If you start shaking while the ink is being applied, the design could be ruined!


Places on your body where clothing rubs can decrease the time your temporary tattoo lasts. The friction caused by your clothing rubbing against the tattoo will wear away the tattoo over time. Your forearm or calf are good options to consider for tattoo placement.
Keep in mind that skin that is constantly moving and stretching, and in some places your skin moves more than others, like on the back of the hand. This can cause your tattoo to fade or crack very quickly.

, Liquid eyeliner will give you the boldest lines and will have the most realistic look. An eyeliner pencil can also work, especially for freehand drawn temporary tattoos, though these may appear more like a crayon drawn on your skin. You should consider using liquid liners with felt-tipped applicators for outlining, then you can use pencils for shading.


Waterproof eyeliner is probably the best option for your temporary tattoo. This kind of ink will last longer and is less prone to smudging if you sweat or it gets wet.
When using pencils, you can vary the pressure you use to create shading on your skin. After you apply your liquid liner outline, you can use these to give your temporary tattoo a unique character., This will be the template for your tattoo. Make sure the image is clear so you can trace it easily. It should be the exact size you desire it to be on your skin. If the image you choose isn't symmetrical, you'll have to print or draw it mirrored so it transfers to your skin properly.


If you find drawing the mirror image of your design too difficult freehand, you can use a computer to reverse the image. Copy your tattoo design into an image editing program, like Adobe Photoshop or MS Paint, and flip it along its vertical axis.
If you are more artistically inclined, or have a friend willing to help you who is, you could also draw the outline of your tattoo directly on your skin in waterproof liquid eyeliner or with a eyeliner pencil with a fine point. If you plan on inking yourself in this way, once the outline is finished, you can move on to adding color or shading to your design., To ensure that your traced lines match up with your template, you might want to tape your template design to your tracing paper. This way if you are jostled or the paper sticks to your hand, the template and tracing paper will stay lined up. Wax paper or parchment paper work well as transfer paper. Overlay the wax








Make the outline of your image dark and thick. This will make it easier for you to follow the outline with your eyeliner, which you then transfer to your skin.

, It might be difficult to transfer your image if your sheet of wax/parchment paper is too large. Trim down your paper with a pair of scissors so that only the design and a small margin of wax/parchment paper around the outline remain.


At this point, you might want to check and see how your design will look on the part of your body part you plan to apply your tattoo. Drape your wax/parchment paper outline side down on that body part. You should be able to see through the paper to preview how it will look., You'll have to do this quickly, as the eyeliner dries rapidly. Follow the marker outline of your design with a generous application of liquid eyeliner until you have completely traced it with liquid eye liner.








An eyeliner pencil can also be used to transfer your outline to your skin. Be sure you apply a heavy layer of pencil liner when re-tracing your wax paper outline. The heavier your layer of pencil liner, the better the transfer will be.

, Lay the still wet liquid eyeliner (or heavily drawn pencil liner) on the part of your body you plan to tattoo. Press it into place on your skin, then take a washcloth or rag dampened with warm water and press it firmly to the back of your wax/parchment paper for at least 10 seconds. The heat should help the liquid eyeliner transfer onto your skin.









When you peel the wax/parchment paper free, the outline of your design should be applied to your skin. Allow your skin to air dry., Waterproof liquid eyeliner is best for outlining. This will create a long lasting, realistic looking, smudge resistant design. Work with care, but don't worry if you make a mistake. Any errors can be fixed.









If you don't have liquid eyeliner, make sure your eyeliner pencil is very sharp so you can get clean, smudge-free lines.
If you want to draw thin or fine lines or details, a toothpick can work well as a fine-point applicator. Dip the end of a toothpick into your liquid liner and carefully use it to add details to your temporary tattoo.
If you make a mistake, dip a cotton swab in makeup remover. You'll have to use an oil-based makeup remover for waterproof liners. Squeeze out excess liquid from the swab and then use it to wipe away any mistakes. Allow the area to dry again, then re-draw over the mistake if necessary., You can use colored eyeliner to add a pop of color to your tattoo or a blunt eyeliner pencil for shading. You can the shaded effect by blending it with a small, stiff makeup brush.









If you want an authentic looking solid black tattoo that lasts a long time and doesn't smudge, use waterproof liquid liner to fill in your stencil. It will be very dark and striking.
If you want to add color, try a colored eyeliner or even eyeshadow. Anything with sparkles won't look very natural, but it can glam-up your tattoo., This will set the ink on your skin and give it extra protection from smudging throughout the day. If you don't have translucent makeup powder, you can use a talcum powder or baby powder.







, This will keep moisture from deteriorating your tattoo and further prevent any smudging that might occur. Aerosol sprays are the easiest to apply, but if you only have the liquid bandage that brushes on, you can use that as well.








Your protective layer can sometimes leave your temporary tattoo looking shiny. If this is the case for you, return it to a more natural appearance by dusting the area with another layer of translucent makeup powder, talcum powder, or baby powder.Try to avoid exercising, swimming, or sweating too much. Your tattoo probably won't last longer than a day, but avoiding these activities will keep it looking its best for as long as possible.

, For some eyeliners, soap and water may wash off your design. Others will be more resistant, or leave behind faint traces. Waterproof eyeliner, especially, will likely need a special oil-based makeup remover to be removed cleanly.If you don't have makeup remover, you can try using other common household products. Some effective options include olive oil, coconut oil, or petroleum jelly.When wiping your temporary tattoo off, use paper towel, tissue, or a disposable cotton pad. Otherwise you might end up staining your towels or washcloths.

, There may be some makeup residue even after you apply your removing agent. If this does not wash away easily, you may need to apply more remover to your tattoo. After you rinse, apply some moisturizer to your skin.The ingredients used in makeup can be harsh on your skin, especially if left on your skin for long periods of time. Replenish your skin by using a moisturizer after rinsing., Leaving your makeup on overnight can cause irritation or damage to your skin.Additionally, over the course of the night your temporary tattoo might rub off on and stain your sheets.

Squeeze it gently for application.Take the henna funnel once it's been properly loaded and sealed, and squeeze it gently as you run the nozzle over your skin at a consistent rate.,
Wipe away smears with water quickly.Although henna takes at least 4 hours to dry completely, it does begin to leave a skin stain rather quickly.,
Touch up your henna over time.Henna designs will last from a few days to a couple of weeks.,
Look up designs.",How to Make Henna for Use on Skin," For a basic henna paste, you'll need a few ingredients. Utensils, such as stirring spoons and mixing bowls, should be found somewhere in your home kitchen.


Henna powder. Gazab henna powder is recommended.Be sure to buy body art quality henna, and not henna for hair.
Cloves. Cloves are a type of flower, typically used in spices.Seven or eight cloves are a good match for a standard bag of henna powder. Make sure to use solid cloves rather than their oil. Clove oils are known to be harmful.Grounded coffee beans. Two tablespoons of finely grounded coffee beans are enough to match a standard bag of henna powder.
Lemon juice. Lemon juice bottles can typically be picked up at a food or dollar store. The lemon juice will be added to the powder before you add the heated coffee clover mixture.;
, A perfect henna paste will be consistent. This means taking out the bigger particles that may put up a fight against stirring.









Store the powder in a sealable glass container. This will limit the risk of the powder coming into contact with moisture.

, Stir the ingredients together until they're relatively consistent.









For the time being, the henna powder itself should be kept separate from the rest of your mixture.

, Pour the mixture into a pot and bring a stovetop element to medium-high. Wait until the mixture has reached a rolling boil, then take it off the element.








, You can do this by sifting it, much as you did with the henna powder. Sift through a cheesecloth into another bowl.









Sifting the mixture multiple times will maximize the chances that you got all of the particulate sediment out of it.

, Add one tablespoon of lemon juice per every two tablespoons of ground coffee you're using in the other mixture. Pour it onto the powder, then stir it thoroughly until you think it's consistent.









Using an alternative to lemon juice (like an oil) may drastically change the dye's release time.Do not use lemon juice if you are allergic to citrus. Strong, cold black tea or flat Coke or Pepsi will work in place of the lemon juice. Keep in mind, however, that caffeine is absorbed through skin, so do not use a caffeinated beverage if you are sensitive to it.

, Add the coffee clove mixture into your henna powder bowl by using a tablespoon. Gauge your mixture by stirring consistently after delivering each tablespoon into the mix. You can stop adding mixture to the powder when the powder has a toothpaste-like consistency.








Add the mixture one spoonful at a time. This will make sure you have sufficient control over the consistency.

, Tea Tree, Lavender, and Frankincense are a few of the oils you might use for this. 30ml of essential oil should be enough to add color to your henna mixture. As always, stir it thoroughly once it's been added.








, Applying it before it's been sufficiently released will result in a weak stain. Wrap over the top of the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and tie it over with an elastic band.









Tape over the plastic bag with your fingers as you place it over the bowl. This will force the excess air out of the bowl as you secure it.
Alternatively, the hotter the room or area is, the faster it will be for the henna's dye to release in the mixture.

, Wash your skin with soap and water. This will rub away any excess dirty and help maximize the effectiveness of your henna.








, However, narrow tipped funnels and specialized henna funnels are perfect for henna application. Henna funnels can be purchased from anywhere where regular henna powder is sold.


Henna funnels sometimes come in packs alongside the powder.
Henna funnels can be made at home as well by rolling plastic into a cone and snipping off the end with scissors.

, Use a spoon to gradually fill the funnel up with paste.Take a tablespoonful of the paste and let it drip slowly into the funnel. Done in this way, you'll be able to control the amount that comes into your funnel without risking damage to the funnel itself. Fill the funnel until it is roughly 2








Because the henna paste has such a sticky consistency, you'll have to be patient while the funnel is filled.

, Fold the end of the henna cone and tape it shut with scotch tape.








,









You can untape the cone and reuse it if you run out of henna paste. However, due to the fact that you'll need to allow the henna time to properly dry into your skin, it's a good idea to make more than the amount of henna you think you'll need.

, With this in mind, it's a good idea to keep a wet towel nearby just in case. Wipe away design errors when you first see them.








, However, it doesn't take long before the designs begin to fade from the skin. If this is the case, it's a good idea to touch up the designs by lightly tracing over them with fresh henna.








, The possibilities with Henna are virtually endless. The complexity of the designs you draw will depend entirely on your skill set. However, if you're just starting out, you'll quickly get a better grasp of what to do.









Once you get the proper hang of henna application, you should make your own original designs. Because the best henna art is often very complex, it may be a good idea to draw out some patterns on paper before applying it to your sin.

Create a tattoo with eyeshadow and nail polish.",How to Make a Temporary Tattoo with Nail Polish," Many types of nail polish contain toxins that can be dangerous when left on your skin for a period of time. Some nail polishes are labeled as ""non-toxic,"" but it's found that these labels are occasionally inaccurate. There are also nail polishes that are label free, but do not contain any toxins. Before you apply nail polish to your skin, it's best to check the ingredients for harmful toxins.Some ingredients to avoid in nail polish are dibutyl phthalate, toluene, and formaldehyde. However, short term exposure to these products is relatively safe, because these chemicals are often found in cleaning products, so just take caution in the amount of polish you apply to your skin. If you are pregnant, do not apply tattoos with nail polish.
Nail polish brands that contain none of the above toxins are: Color Madnic Luscious nail lacquer, Zoya professional nail lacquer, OPI Birthday Babe nail lacquer, Cali nail polish thinner, Essie Starter Wife 596 nail lacquer, and Out the Door topcoat. These are safe to use on your skin, even for long exposure.;
, Another thing to keep in mind when making tattoos with nail polish is they won't just fade slowly from your skin. Nail polish on your skin is likely going to chip quickly, because you are constantly loosing skin cells. If you are looking for a tattoo that is a little more temporary you may avoid using nail polish.

, There are some fun, alternative methods to nail polish tattoos that may last longer or be better for your skin. Why not try a cute tattoo from your childhood? You can usually find these in toy vending machines, and it could be a fun blast from the past. Henna is also a great option, as it lasts one to three weeks and is all natural. It will also fade from your skin, which may look better than chipped nail polish.Henna is more expensive, especially if you get it done at a fair, carnival, or another outing. You can buy henna kits online, that over time are worth the money spent on them.
You can also purchase tattoo pens, which are specifically created for tattoos and will create a tattoo that lasts longer., Before you begin creating your tattoo, think about the type of tattoo you want and the location you want it. If you are doing your tattoo yourself you may want a simpler tattoo in an easy place to reach, like your wrist. If you have a friend to help you, you can do a more complicated tattoo in an area that is harder for you to reach.

, This picture is going to serve as a stencil, meaning you will cut the middle of it out and use it as your pattern on your arm. Therefore, you should choose a picture or drawing that will look good without any details inside of it.

, After you have printed out or drawn your image on paper, you will want to cut around the edges, but on the inside of the picture. It could be helpful to color in the picture, and then cut out the colored part. This should leave you with a piece of paper with an image cut out from the middle of it.


If you aren't interested in drawing or printing out your tattoo, or don't trust your art skills, you can usually find stencils at a craft or dollar store.

, Once you have chosen the location for your tattoo, place the stencil you have created on your body and tape it down to hold it in place. You'll want to stretch your skin so that your tattoo doesn't stretch out and become distorted once you are done creating it.If you are doing your tattoo on a part of your skin that doesn't stretch, like the inside of your arm, you should be able to get an accurate tattoo by just taping down the stencil to hold it into place.

, Once you have secured your stencil in place, draw a thin edge inside of the stencil to create the border of your tattoo. Then, remove the stencil and trace over the edges to create a thicker, cleaner border. If you are worried about your drawing skills, you can use nail polish pens that will make it easier to create clean lines.

, After you have created the border for your tattoo, it's time to dress it up and make it exactly as you want it. You can use a solid color nail polish for the whole tattoo, or you can change it up by adding different color nail polishes to your tattoo.

, If you are unhappy with your tattoo, the benefit of using nail polish is it is very easy to remove your tattoo and create another. Simply apply nail polish remover to a cotton ball and wipe away your tattoo. Allow the area to dry before you apply another tattoo.

, You can also use the same methods to create a similar type of tattoo, but instead of using nail polish as the main coloring for your tattoo, you can mix any color eyeshadow with a clear nail polish, and then apply as you would the nail polish tattoo. This will likely create a smoother look than nail polish as eyeshadow tends to have a softer look."

Be confident.,
Practice strong body language to intimidate those around you.,
Stare someone down by not breaking eye contact.,
Show you are in control.,
Be assertive with a confident voice.,
Be alert.,
Stay in a group of friends.",How to Defend Yourself and Make People Afraid of You1," Bullies are much less likely to attack you if they see you are confident. By walking, talking, and carrying yourself with poise, you will show others that you are not one to be messed with., When you stand tall, with your shoulders back and chin up, it shows that you are confident and won't let anyone bother you. Keep your arms loose by your side, uncrossed, and in front of you.Don't fidget with your hands or face because it translates as nervousness to others. Keep your hands and arms calm, and by your side, to look confident and in control.
Do not slouch when you sit or stand.

, When you meet eyes with someone, do not be the first person to look away because it shows weakness. Continue to look into their eyes until they either pass by you, or look away first. This will let people know that you are strong and confident, and it will leave them intimidated.


When meeting eyes with someone, do not smile. Instead, keep a straight face to show you are not trying to be friendly or welcoming.
To exhibit a threatening look, try scowling at someone by squinting your eyes and scrunching your eyebrows.

, Stay calm and do not let anyone tell you what to do. If a bully is trying to make you do something, or get you angry, don't follow order and don't show face. Instead, stay calm and speak up for yourself. This will make the bully feel ineffective and weak because you are excerpting your self-control and confidence., If you are in a potential bullying situation, speak up with a strong voice and be assertive to show that you are going to stand up for yourself. When bullies see you are not going to stand weakly and take any nonsense, they will go search for someone who is weak to mess with.You will eventually gain a reputation that lets people know that you are too strong to be targeted.

, As with anything, prevention is better than a solution. You can prevent a lot of conflict by being aware of your surroundings. Bullies often target people who seem to be unaware of their surrounds. If you walk around looking down, or distracted, a bully will see you as a good target. Always keep your head up, and scan your surroundings.

, It is harder for bullies to threaten or intimidate you when you put yourself in a group. When you are in the halls, or out on the playground, don't stand alone. The less vulnerable you are, the less likely it is somewhere will target you.


If you don't have a group of friends to stand by, stay in an area where there are a lot of people playing or hanging out.

The skills you learn in these classes are not meant for initiating a fight with someone, but purely for defense if you are attacked. The goal is that you will never have to actually use these skills, but if you are pursued in an attack, you will be able to defend yourself.There are many types of martial arts classes such as Judo, Jiu Jitsu, and kick boxing.Do not use self-defense unless you have to. Things will not get better if you answer them with a fist. Always try non-physical methods to solve a problem first.
Use self-defense methods. In a self-defense class, you can learn how to block a punch that is thrown at you. Also, there are techniques that show you how to break free from someone who is restraining you or holding you down., The nose is very sensitive and when hit hard enough, in an upwards motion, it can stun a bully. Nose jabs cause a lot of pain, possibly break the nose, and make the eyes water which will blur vision. This will give you enough time to get away from your bully., Administering a fast and hard stomp to your bully's toes and feet will cause a lot of pain and temporarily halt their attacks. This is good move to help set you up for punches to the gut or knees to the groin.

, One sure fire way to knock the wind out of a bully is to give a powerful blow to the abdomen area. If you do it fast enough, your bully won't see it coming and will not be ready for your punch. This will bring your bully down to the ground and show your ability to defend yourself.

, A strong kick or fast knee raise to the groin will cause a ton of pain and bring a bully to the ground. Just be sure to be quick, and aim accurately for the genital area., Do this with a short jab to their Adam's apple. Make sure you hit with your index and ring finger knuckles. A wrong punch could break your hand. "

Simply soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, and wipe the area where you want the tattoo to go., Try to use a soft pencil, such as 3B, 4B, or even softer.Press hard while you draw, so that you get that shiny layer. This way, more of the graphite will be able to come off onto your skin.


Avoid using a mechanical pencil, as it won't be thick enough.
If you cannot find any tracing paper, you can use parchment paper instead. Regular paper might do in a pinch, but you may not get the best results.
If you are not good at drawing, print a small image out, and trace it., It will be much easier to wrap a small piece of paper around your skin than a large, full sheet of paper. Don't worry about being too precise here; as long as you have the tattoo cut out, you will be fine.

, Smooth the paper, and hold it in place by the edges using your forefinger and thumb.

, Soak a towel in warm water, then squeeze the excess water out. Press the towel against the paper, and hold it there for about 20 seconds.Be careful not to move the towel or ""rub"" it along the paper.

, You should have a faint image of your tattoo by now. You can call it finished at this point and show it off. If you'd like to darken it and make it last longer, continue reading.

Be confident!,

Take the right stance!,
How to fight, One key element to winning a fight quickly, is the element of surprise.,
Know when to stop!",How to Defend Yourself (or a Friend)," You may not be the most confident person, but you can still pretend to be. If this person begins to push you, simply shove them away. Control your voice. Try to make it sound deep and powerful, not wobbly and scrawny.;
, If this person is just shouting things at you, it's not the time to attack them. Wait for them to give you a reason, this will get the bystanders (and law) on your side! If they push you, simply ignore them, or push them back if you think they'll keep going. If they punch you, go nuts.

, Make sure you are a good distance in relation to the mugger. Don't stand too close nor too far away from them. Spread your legs so they're a little wider than your shoulders, with your main foot being the most forward one. Turn your body sideways to the mugger, this will make you a smaller target, and make it harder for them to hit you in the stomach or solar plexus. Bring your hands arm arms up to your face, try to protect your head and neck as much as possible.

, Act like you're not going to hit them, and then suddenly make your move. A quick hit to the throat is effective; it doesn't take much to collapse their trachea, and if you manage to do this, the fight is over! By this time, the attacker should have raised their hands to their throat/face. If you get the feeling they are not done yet, use your fist to pummel their stomach, or give him a quick jab to the solar plexus. If this still didn't do the trick, go ahead and send your knee into their groin or breasts. At this point, the attacker should be doubled over in pain, and most likely not in a good fighting condition. This is where you make your choice, walk away or keep going at them? If they show any sign that they want to keep fighting, improvise. Hit them a couple of times, kick them. From here on, it doesn't take a lot to bring them down!

, If they are huddled up in a ball on the ground, leave them. If however, they are still trying to pushing you around, then do everything you can to stop them. Know when to stop; don't overdo this; you don't want to take their life.

, Are you a single, strong, mentally capable individual? Do you have no room mates and no children? When you consider other people it may be smarter to have a get away plan versus an engagement plan. The terminology is called ""fight or flight"". You will figure out exactly what you want to do in about the first three seconds of any situation, it is a basic human instinct to fight your aggressor or run from him.

, Know what floorboards squeak in your hallway and what mirror will allow you to see down the hallway from the bathroom (examples).

, Once you are familiar with your environment have an escape plan from every location within the confines of the walls. If you have a 3000 sq ft home or a 450 sq ft studio have a plan on how to get out in a moments notice.

, Keep a pair of tennis shoes at the foot of your bed. Make sure the laces are untied (not like the pic) and your feet can slip into the shoes quickly in the event of emergency. If the house catches fire in the middle of the night you will need to escape quickly and may have to walk over broken glass. Keep a loaded firearm within reasonable distance of your bed or any place you spend the greatest amount of time. If the gun is not near you 90% of the time you are home make sure it is locked up. There are a number of easily accessible lockable safes on the market.

, Keep the firearm pointed where your eyes are focused. If you are looking down the hallway point the gun down the hallway not at the floor, that’s a good way to shoot your foot.

, If an attacker fires a shot and it hits the wall the projectile has the potential to graze the wall and run about 1 - 6"" from the wall until it finds a target.

, Your eyes will take about 2-5 minutes to adjust back to normal. If you can don't use a light. If it becomes impossible to defend yourself use a flashlight. Preferably a surefire.

, Don’t hold your weapon and your flashlight with the same hand. Hold the flashlight as far out as your weak hand will allow. (Example- if you are right handed hold the firearm in your right hand and flash light in your left. hold the firearm straight in front of you, do not put it off to the side. Hold the flashlight as far away from you in your left hand as is comfortable. Make sure you hold it away from you because statistically shots are fired at flashlights in low light situations.

, You don’t want to shoot an innocent person.

, If your three year old daughter’s bedroom is directly behind the bad guy you may consider not shooting due to the inherent danger of shooting your daughter.

, Consider this; its nighttime, your eyes are hazy, your adrenaline is pumping, heart racing, nerves are shot. . . do you really need the added pressure of making a 20 feet (6.1 m) shot at a melon sized target? Do everyone the favor and fire at the center of the body. No one said you could only fire one time . . . empty the whole magazine!

, You exert less pressure over a larger area and it helps with your moving stealthily.

, With your pistol aimed slowly come around a corner as to only expose your body to an area you have already identified as clear. Search in YouTube ""cutting the pie,"" and you should find something interesting. With enough practice you can do this around every corner very easily.

, Set up motion sensor lights on your front porch, side yards, back yards etc. The bad guy doesn’t want to be seen. The light also allows you to identify where the bad is or has recently been. A dog would be another good investment.


Locks: a solid dead bolt is not a foolproof lock mechanism, but they are very worth while and helpful.
Doors: Solid core wood doors are a minimum and a very poor one at that. Metal doors with insulated inserts are best for the average home perimeter doors. If I can take a whole saw and cut out the lock on your wooden door in the time it takes Fido to bark and your wife to wake you I am coming in and having my way. Get the picture?
Windows: They break! Windows will be the weakest point on your perimeter. You can invest in better stronger windows that are a little more durable and won’t come out of the track from the outside. Find ones that you cannot manipulate from the outside.
Security Doors: Along with not being cosmetically appealing they are also not full proof. A pry bar near the locking mechanism will allow for easy access to your front door.
Alarm Systems: Again they are nice but not foolproof. A power outage will revert your alarm to battery back up. If the cable from your panel to the service center is cut and the audible function is cut and now you have an alarm that is going off an no one knows.
Private Security: Probably worth the cost when it comes to one house. Now if you and the neighborhood want to go in on this together then it might work. You have to think of the intricacies of a piece of property. Trees, shrubs, rocks, telephone poles, fences, cars etc. are all going to block the line of sight from the rent-a-cop to your bad guy. Besides the point If the bad guy is walking down the street and hasn't committed a crime yet the only thing the security guard can do is call the real police, that being said the rent-a-cop is pretty much not worth having at your home.
Ultimate Security System: Buy a dog, preferably a German Sheppard or another large breed known for being fiercely loyal. Dogs do not fail during power outages, cannot be deactivated by experienced crooks, generally provide advanced warning of thieves, and don't have a 10 minute response time. You'll never regret that particular investment.
Neighborhood Watch: this is probably the best advancement in home security in a long time. A strong bond with your neighbors will have a detrimental affect on burglaries/robberies in your area. Jim and Sandy go out and walk the dog at 830 and everything is fine and on their way home at 900 they notice a van with two adult males in your driveway is a great advantage to you.
Yard Care: Keep your home free from shrubs and trees that block the view of windows. You don’t want to have a broken window that the neighbor or passing police officer can’t see. Keep the shrubbery away from the house by about 2 feet (0.6 m). You want to be able to see the perimeter of your home very clearly. Keep shrubbery under two feet in height and tree limbs above 7 feet (2.1 m). this will allow for a ""window"" of your home to be seen from the street. The same for your back yard only a little different with your fence. A lot of people like shrubbery around the fence. I don’t agree with this. You need to keep shrubbery at a minimum height of 18in off of the ground to allow you to see the fence behind it clearly. Try to keep shrubbery off of the fence the same way as the house.
Housekeeping: Some people are filthy. Don’t be one of them. Keeping your home tidy and clean may prove more useful than not. If you have kid’s toys and shoes and clutter all over your floor and you are trying to move your family to safety in the dark everyone will trip and fall. Eliminate this by keeping the house tidy.
Safe Room: These aren’t just in the movies. You can make your own very easily. Pick a room than has no obstructions like alternate entry exits. Make sure you can fit your family in it. Your master bedroom walk in closet will be more practical than the coat closet in the hallway. Invest the money in a solid core door and a dead bolt. Make sure the light switch is on the inside. Make sure you have furniture such as dressers, bureaus, chests that are made of a hard wood that can shield your family from an attack. Also keep your cell phone near your bed so you can grab it and have it readily available. The safe room in my home is the master bedroom itself. I have a dresser and a chest near the bed that will provide adequate support to any engagement in the home. Your safe room doesn’t have to be like the movie Panic Room. You can have a designated room in the home that your family knows to go to.

, You did a fire drill in elementary school. Do a practice with your family. Involve them and make them aware that they will be safe if they act calmly and get straight to you.

In addition, this position protects your face and your ribs, two places you'll likely want to protect.;
, Both left-to-right and back-to-front, keep your feet diagonal from each other in a kind of martial-arts stance. This will lessen your likelihood of getting knocked or pushed over.


You stand the best chance of winning a fight and getting away if you stay upright. Avoid taking the scuffle to the ground at all costs.

, Look at their hands. If they were about to attack with their hands, they would have their hands out. However, if they are concealing a weapon, they will have them hidden or at their side.


If you're attacked by a person with a knife or a gun, you need to try to avoid confrontation and get away. If it's impossible to avoid a fight, you need to end the confrontation with a high-impact attack as quickly as possible, then run for help.

, Unless your attacker is making it impossible, trying to get away is the only guarantee of your safety. If you can avoid a fight, avoid it and run away.

, If you have to end the fight as quickly as possible by striking first, strike hard, and strike as many times as you can, then run for help. Getting ambushed in an alley by a mugger isn't the time to worry about fighting honorably. Keep yourself safe by making the confrontation as quick as possible.The eyes and nose are the most sensitive soft spots on your attacker's face and are vulnerable to elbows, knees, and your forehead.


With the hardest part of your forehead, right near the hairline, try to smash your assailant's nose by tensing your neck and driving your forehead into the middle of their face. This is the quickest and most unexpected way to end a fight completely. However strong, experienced, or violent your attacker, it's very difficult to quickly recover from a hard head-butt to the nose.

, Bringing a knee sharply into the groin of an attacker or grabbing the groin with your hand and twisting is an instantly effective move that will take your attacker down. Again, this isn't the time to worry about fighting dirty. If your life is in danger, go for the groin.


If this doubles up your opponent, consider smashing your knee into his nose to ensure that he'll be down for the count.

, If your being attacked from the back, chances are the attacker has his/her arms around your upper half. If your wearing heels or shoes such as heavy heel boots, this is especially effective. Move your foot near the attacker's, lift your foot up and bring it down on their foot as hard as you can. If they let you go run, if they don't try the next one.

, If, for example, you are being choked, or your assailant has their hands up in your face, attacking their legs will give you the opportunity to open him up to more attacks, or allow you to escape. This is especially effective on larger attackers and easy to do from your guarded position.


Kick at shins and knees soccer-style, with the instep of your foot. This is a quick and painful kick. In addition, if his/her legs are close enough, lift your knees into their inner leg (femoral nerve), outer leg, knee, or groin. These will break down your attacker and may disable them, as only 12-16 pounds of pressure are needed to break a knee.

, Try to poke or press on the eyes. No one can defend an eye poke, regardless of your attacker's size. Clapping on the ears can stun or, if done perfectly, breaks the eardrums.


In some cases you may also want to attack your attacker's neck. To effectively choke someone, do not do the typical Hollywood ""hands around the entire neck,"" but instead just put your thumb and fingers around the trachea (especially easy to find on men with large Adam's apples). Dig, drive, and sink your fingers into this notch and they will experience intense pain and probably fall down.

, You'll want to avoid taking the fight to the ground at all costs, but if it's unavoidable, use your weight to your advantage. While falling, keep the pointy parts of your body pointy (your knees and your elbows) and aim for your attacker's groin, ribs, and neck.

, If your attacker has a knife, try to stay out of arm's length. If there is a gun, consider running and dodging from left to right.


If you get a chance to leave safely, go for it. Be sure that you're safe from your opponent when you decide to stop defending yourself.
In many cases, you can end the situation immediately by giving the attacker your wallet. This is a logical choice, especially if at knife or gunpoint. Your life is worth much more than the cash and cards you have on you. Toss the wallet away from you and run.

, If an attacker tries to grab you from behind to choke you, press his forearm against your collarbone instead of trying to pull it directly off, which may be difficult if you're fighting with someone stronger than you. Put one hand above his elbow (on the forearm) and one hand below it (so your hands are on both sides of the elbow). Then, in one strong and determined movement, step and swing your entire body around like the arm is the hinge to your body's screen door.


This will get you out of his/her choke and leave his/her head, ribs, and legs wide open to your counterattack. When your attacker is behind you, the shins are right behind your legs and primed for your stomping and raking.

, If the attacker is trying to pick you up from behind, drop your hips quickly and violently as if you were plopping down on a love seat. This will make you harder to pick up and give you an extra moment to attack them and fend them off by stomping on their shins or repositioning for a frontal defense.

, If the attacker is trying to choke you by wrapping his arms around your neck, bring the ball of your foot forward, as if you just kicked a soccer ball, and forcefully slam it into the area of their leg between their ankle and mid-leg, or the groin. This may break their leg or otherwise incapacitate your attacker.

, Preparing for each stage in a confrontation can help you avoid eventually ending up in a physical fight. Avoiding a serious fight should be your main goal, so you need to be bigger and more aware of the situation than your opponent. The stages of conflict include:


The wind up. This is the initial argument before the fight erupts. It might start out relatively harmless but escalate quickly and unexpectedly.
Verbal threats. When the arguing brings in the threat of physical confrontation. ""I'm going to _____.""
Shoving or other prodding behavior. Attempts to get you to escalate a conflict into a full-blown fight usually start not with punches or kicks but with nose-to-nose intimidation tactics and shoves. It's still possible to walk away at this point without getting into a full-blown fight.
The full-blown fight. You've stopped arguing and started throwing punches., Each of the lead-up steps is an opportunity to end the argument. One will inevitably lead to another unless one of you backs down. Back down. Actual physical confrontation should be your last line of defense.


If you're in the middle of an argument, calm in down by lowering your voice. Macho dudes in a bar can escalate stupid things quickly but be ready to hug and buy you a drink by apologizing and distracting them. If you're calm, they'll cool down.
If you're being ambushed by an attacker, you need to get where people can see you and help you. It's less likely that you'll be grievously harmed if you're on a busy street-corner where people are passing by. The confrontation has less of a chance of escalating in public.

, If you've got a long walk home from the bus or train station at night after work, consider meeting a friend near the metro stop and walking together. Staying in groups is the safest way to avoid these kinds of situations.


If you must walk alone, gloom onto another group of walkers and stick close by. You don't have to know them to find safety in numbers.

, Concealed handguns, mace, or pepper spray are all handy defense devices you should consider having at the ready. Knives and guns are dangerous weapons many consider useful, but can also be used against you if you're unprepared to use them yourself. Be very cautious and smart if you choose to carry a weapon and take the proper certification classes to make sure you know how to handle a weapon safely. Never carry one illegally. Most states that respect individuals rights have CCW permits available for law abiding citizens. You can also get a small personal alarm keychain that will emit a high pitch siren like a car alarm when its pin is pulled, similar in design to a grenade.


Consider taking a self-defense class if you live in a dangerous area and are concerned for your well being.

Nemeses are like the opposite version of you. You'll find nemeses at work, at school, and in other situations where you're paired with like-minded similar people. Everything tells you that you should be friends with your nemesis—you've got similar interests, goals, and hobbies—but you just don't get along. Your nemesis is the oil to your water.
Frenemies are friends that you don't like. Well don't ever be friends with your enemy, not even frenemies. But when you're hanging out, she doesn't ever stop bragging. Frenemies are irritating, toxic, and a real downer.
Enemies are tough. From the classroom to the workplace, enemies are serious threats to your ability to get through the day. An enemy is someone who thinks you're taking their popularity, so they hate you and always win at everything.;
, The old adage is true—if you keep your friends close, keep your enemy closer. If you want to vanquish your enemy, you've got to learn how they win at everything. That means talking with your enemy, watching your enemy, and learning everything you can about the way your enemy thinks.


Many bullies, frenemies, and other kinds of enemies operate from a place of jealousy. Often, enemies will pick on things that they have anxiety about in their own life. If you're being picked on about one thing, it might be because your enemy has anxiety about the same thing or they just want to be mean and embarrass you.
Enemies also hate people they view as threats. In the workplace or at competitive schools—any time competition is involved—enemies will seek to eliminate you from winning. That means you're in a bad position.

, Analyzing the way your enemy antagonizes you will help you plan a way of getting back. Who does your enemy associate with? What are your enemy's interests? What does your enemy want? Learn what motivates your enemy and what your enemy is struggling with on a personal level. What is your enemy's home life like? Where does your enemy come from? Do some research and answer these questions., Every enemy has a weakness, no matter how strong they seem when they're putting you on their heels. Finding that weakness will be essential to planning your revenge and getting your enemy humiliated. Some common enemy weaknesses are:


Hubris. Just like in the ancient Greek stories, excessive pride can lead to the downfall of many enemies. If you've got a braggy, boastful enemy, being put in a position of embarrassment will be devastating for this enemy. Good revenge might mean setting your enemy up for some public embarrassment or failure.
Confidence. Many bullies are really just big babies who have no self-confidence or belief in their own abilities. Lots of bullies are really just looking for companionship and friends, because they feel undervalued and unloved. These types of bullies might respond better to a kinder tactic.
Competitiveness. Many enemies are hyper-competitive jerks who've allowed their love of winning to overcome other considerations, like human decency and kindness. Learning to disengage and freeze these enemies out is the best way of handling them and disarming their ability to torment you. If you don't play, they can't win.

, If someone is bothering you and you want them to stop, there's a super simple way of handling it: tell them stuff that you have new. If someone is getting in your face with antagonizing or bullying behavior, put your hand out like a crossing guard in the ""stop"" motion. Take a deep breath. In a calm, even voice, say something like, ""Stop! I need you to stop right now.""


If telling a bully to stop doesn't get them out of your face, continue repeating the phrase. If they fail to get a rise out of you, most bullies won't be entertained enough to keep on with it. After failing enough times to provoke you, most bullies might just leave you alone.
If a bully escalates things after you tell them to stop, it's not inappropriate to tell someone, a teacher, parent, or a superior in the office. Get someone else on your side.

, The best way to defeat any enemy is to get them out of your life completely. Avoid enemies as much as possible to disarm them and steal their ability to offend, torment, and irritate you. If you're struggling with a bully, use your observational skills to steer clear of their haunts and spend time in other places. Don't give them the opportunity to antagonize you.


If you've got to see your enemy on a regular basis, like at work or school, and you're forced to interact with them, your job will be tougher, but not impossible. The best way to avoid these enemies is to avoid listening to them. Put in earbuds when your enemy's spouting off in the school, so you won't have to listen to it, or show up right before the bell rings in class and sit on the opposite side of the classroom. It'll be like they're not even there.

, When your enemy confronts you, the best tactic is to turn into the ice man. Play it cool. Real cool. Don't get upset, or try to argue back when your enemy launches into their irritating, bullying behavior. Just look at them like you would an irritating swarm of ants, or your cat's puke. A minor inconvenience. Emotional reactions are like water for the plants of enemies. Withhold it and they'll die. Even if you do react, make it cool and calm. Never angry.


Practice picturing your enemy doing something ridiculous, like singing opera or wrestling with an octopus, when they're confronting you.
Don't listen to the toxic spew coming from your enemy's mouth. Practice reciting a mantra any time they speak, focusing hard on replacing the words you hear with something positive. Your favorite song lyrics, a poem, or a prayer might be an appropriate little passage to memorize for these occasions.

, The cold-shoulder can be a powerful and effective tool in fighting enemies. Bullies, frenemies, and nemeses all want attention. They want an audience and will pick on people to help lift themselves up and stand out above the crowd. The best way to disarm this? Ignoring them entirely.When your enemy comes around, literally act as if nothing were happening. No sound, no other person present. Give them absolutely no reaction whatsoever. Even if your enemy is standing two feet away from you shouting your name, just ignore them and talk to a friend as if nothing were happening.

, There's an old adage about enemies that's true: the enemy of your enemy is your friend. It's likely that your enemy's alienated more people than just you. Find other people to bond with over your mutual distrust of a common enemy. Then plot revenge!


Bullies will most often pick on individuals who they think is a threat at beating them. If you've got a cadre of good buds to hang out with, though, you can deflect a single bully easily by turning the numbers back on them.

, Under certain circumstances, a proper prank may be the best way to get back your enemy. This is especially true with particularly prideful or egotistical enemies, who might do well to get knocked down a peg or two. Some common enemy-revenging pranks might include:


Hacking into your enemy's email to send compromising list-serv messages that will embarrass your enemy.
Order something embarrassing to have delivered to your enemy at the office. A big box full of old Pro Wrestling magazines, or adult diaper catalogs, or strange and exotic pornography to the workplace. Make sure to have it deliver to the building, not to your office suite, so the delivery person will have to wander around to all the offices and find your tormentor personally.
Go crude. Poop in a paper bag on your enemy's doorstep? Jolly Ranchers in the shower faucet? An upper-decker in the toilet tank? You be the judge of how far is too far.

, The best revenge? Living well. The best way to get a bully out of your life is to move past it and put them in the rear window. Ignore your bully, freeze out your enemy, and get on with your life. If your enemy sees that they were unable to make a significant effect on your life, all the power will be taken out of their immature attempts to get your goat.

, You should never let your enemy provoke you into a physical altercation, but some enemies are set in their ways and force your hand. You'll be able to be much more confident in your ability to move through your day-to-day if you know you'll be able to handle any situation that arises. Don't move around in fear. Get prepared.

, Fights don't work like in the movies, where both people throw a million hard right-hands right to the face until someone hits a KO. Most fights are over very quickly. Learning to properly form and throw a punch will make sure that you don't make a valuable movie mistake if the situation calls for it, so you'll be able to throw a high-probability punch accurately and end the fight sooner rather than later.


Make a fist by wrapping your fingers into your hand firmly, but not so tight you cut off the circulation. Wrap your thumb around the bottom of your knuckles, not around your index finger and not inside your fingers.
Extend the middle knuckle of your middle finger slightly. This is where your fist should make contact, not your big knuckle, where your fingers connect to your hands.
Punch in a straight line, keeping your elbows in and throwing linear punches, not big circular haymakers. There's a lot more power in a straight jab than in a big swing.
Aim for the nose, the neck, or the stomach. Punching someone in the jaw, cheek, or forehead will end up hurting you more. Aim for soft spots and swing hard.

, Keeping a good defensive position is just as important as throwing a solid punch, if not more important. Remember, it's not a Rocky movie: a couple solid punches into your kisser and you're going to be on the ground, which is exactly where you don't want to be.


Hold your fists, loosely formed, up near your face and shift your weight so your shoulder and hip on your dominant side are pointed at your opponent. Don't square up to your opponent, but turn to one side, to make a smaller target.
Keep your hands up near your chin and the side of your head at all times, when you're not swinging.

, As you punch, go straight in toward your opponent, holding your defensive posture, and make it your goal to knock them down. The best way to do this is to look as big as possible and advance, advance, advance. Don't let yourself get pushed backward.


While it may seem unbelievable and will go against your natural instinct, it's much safer and less painful to move into punches instead of backing away from them. Keep moving forward and getting your enemy to retreat, rather than stepping back. If you have to take a hit, meeting it halfway, before it's reached its full power, will hurt less than at the apex of the swing, where you're more likely to get knocked down. Move forward and get your enemy to shift back.

, Stick and move, say the boxers. If you find yourself in a fight, don't just stand there lead-footed, unless you want to get your block knocked off. Stand on the balls of your feet, bouncing slightly and moving your head back and forth, as if you were dodging a pesky bee flying at you through the air. Make your head a moving target and you'll be tough to hit.

, Try not to fall down under any circumstances, or take the fight to the ground. Standing up for yourself with a quick fist-fight is sometimes the best way to deal with a tough situation, if your enemy pushes you into it, but a fight that ends up wrestling around on the ground is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.


If you knock your opponent down, back off. Say, ""This is over,"" and walk away. You'll have proven your point.

, End a fight as quickly as possible by looking for an exit. If you knock your opponent down with a well-timed punch, don't give them the opportunity to get madder and come up swinging. Just say, ""Look, I'm done with this. I don't want to fight you. You started this, and I'm finishing it."" Then make a quick exit and go out on a high note. With any luck, your enemy should be vanquished.


Again, fights should always be the last resort to dealing with your enemy, and should be avoided at all costs.

Take deep breaths as you size each other up to stay relaxed and focused., There are different types of attackers and they are all motivated for many different reasons. The person may be a mugger or a criminal looking for something “fun” to do by harassing you. They could be mentally unstable or under the influence or drugs or alcohol. You may have caught them in the act of some other crime, and now they feel the need to “get rid of you”. Either way, try to figure out what kind of person you’re dealing with., Engaging with the person and talking to them may help. Ask them why they are attacking you, and if there is anything that you can do to prevent the attack.If they are a mugger, they will ask for your valuables. This will be easy enough to deal with: all you have to do is give up your things. While it may be hard to part with some of your valuables, it will be worth your life. Phones and jewelry can be replaced, but your life and health cannot.
If the person is looking to pick a fight, let them know that you have no interest in violence. If they are especially menacing or threatening, talking may not be an option, but try it anyway.
If the person seems mentally unstable or under the influence of a substance, they will be far too unpredictable for you to deal with. These are often the most dangerous kind of attackers because it is very hard to judge what they are going to do next. Try talking to them in a calm, soothing voice while backing away.

, If you're in a public place where others may be able to help you, yell for help. Often, people on a city street or a parking lot may not realize that you're in trouble unless you make it very obvious. Yell: ""Stop!"" or ""Someone help me!"" Use your voice to make it clear that you're in trouble and someone may come to your aid.If you're in a more remote location, like a hiking trail or an empty field, try yelling anyway. While you might not be able to see anyone nearby, people may be close enough that they'll be able to tell that something is wrong. If you hike often and are afraid of being attacked, carry a loud whistle. The sound will carry further than your voice alone., The best way to defend against a knife attack is to run. Even if you know martial arts disarming tricks or you are very strong, a knife is still an unpredictable and deadly weapon. Running may seem cowardly, but it is your best chance of survival., If you're attacked by a person with a knife, you should always try to run before fighting. Often, however, you may seem stuck. You may be cornered or your attacker may be blocking your only exit. You'll need to disable your attacker to create an opening to run away., Going for the throat is one of the best ways to disable an attacker. With a hard strike to the throat, you'll damage the person's trachea, disrupting their breathing. They're very likely to stop attacking you after a hard strike to the throat.Get close enough to strike. If your attacker isn't close enough for you to strike at their throat, move in a bit. You'll want to be an arms-width away.
Use your elbow and forearm. The harder the part of your body that you use to strike, the more effective and painful your attack will be. Your elbow is solid bone, and you'll be able to get a lot of power by striking forward with it.
Push through their throat. Using your elbow as your weapon, strike your attacker's throat. Strike as hard and as fast as you can, using the element of surprise to your advantage.
Run. If you've struck your attacker hard enough, they'll lose their ability to breathe. When they double over, run away.

, If your attacker is male, a kick to the groin may immediately incapacitate them. Use your knee or shin to strike them in the crotch to create an opening to run. This technique can work with a variety of distances between you and your attacker.If you're close to your attacker, use your knee. A shorter distance between you and the person attacking you means that a knee will be sufficient enough to make a connection. Force your knee hard into their groin.
If they are an arm's length away from you, use your foot or shin. Using your shin is better, because there's more surface area to cause more damage. Extend your knee and snap your leg up into their crotch.
Run. Once your attacker is doubled over or on the ground, run away as fast as possible.

, The eyes are an incredibly sensitive part of your body, and any attack focused on the eyes is sure to cause your attacker a lot of pain. Only use this if your attacker is very close, such as in situations where they've grabbed you and have you in a hold. Keep in mind that this technique is extremely dangerous and can be gory, and is only to be used in life or death situations.Extend your fingers to reach their eyes. Most people flinch instantly when they see an attack directed at their eyes, so you'll have to move very quickly. Snap your arm out towards their face in one swift motion.
Press your fingers hard into the eye socket. Simple scratching or light pushing will not be effective. These light attacks will cause pain, but may only further enrage your attacker. You'll need to use your fingers to push hard into the eyes, pressing them into the skull.
Push down. As you push your attackers eyes, press them down towards the base of the skull. Again, this technique is not for the faint of heart, and should only be used in the most dire of circumstances. It can cause blindness and even death.
Run. Once your attacker is incapacitated or unconscious, run away.

, If you can’t run and defending yourself is your only option, you will want to do something unpredictable. Spit in your attacker’s face, or drop suddenly to the ground. If you have a backpack or a purse, throw it at their head. If this gives you an opening to run away, do so. If not, you’ll still have thrown them off and given yourself a chance to fight., Being unarmed against a knife attack is a dangerous position to be in. Look around your surroundings for anything that you might use as defense: a metal pipe, a solid tree branch, a chair or a lamp. Anything that puts some distance between you and your attacker is good., When your attacker lunges for you, they will be off balance. If you found your own weapon, now is the time to ram into them. If not, strike out at them to throw them further off with a kick to the groin or the legs. Just make sure to steer clear of the knife., If you are lucky enough to have a weapon to use, strike at the person’s hand, keeping as much space between you and them as possible. This will weaken and damage their hand to the point that they’ll no longer be able to hold the knife.If you don’t have a weapon, you will need to try to grab their wrist and disarm them instead.

, While any grab near the knife is incredibly dangerous, grabbing your attacker’s wrist may be your only choice. Grabbing their wrist firmly will give you control of the knife’s direction and give you a moment to punch or strike them., You may be able to wrest the knife from their control, but using both hands to try to take the knife leaves them with an opening to headbutt or punch you instead! Keep them on the defensive by continuing to attack them., If you’re able to, continue to hold their wrist and strike at their head and legs until you can get them on the ground. Once they’re on the ground, continue to keep the knife pointed away from you., If and when you get the upper hand, your attacker may begin to beg for their life. Do not be fooled by this! Most likely, they are trying to get you to lower your guard so that they can attack you again.

, Throw it as far away as you can, onto the roof of a building, into the bottom of a dumpster or deep into some woods. This will give you time to get away and prevent your attacker from grabbing the knife easily and coming after you., While online how-tos can give you pointers on how to defend yourself, knife attack are extremely serious and very dangerous. Most flashy moves and practice scenarios are not at all like the real thing, and you’ll need to get serious self defense training before you even think about staying to defend yourself in from a knife attack."
"
Present a profile to your attacker.,
Keep your distance.,
Put your hands up.,
Dodge with feet, shoulder, and head.,
Push aside the punch.,
Push high punches upward.,
Grab the attacker's arm.,
Fight back.,
Take the punch.,
Adopt the helmet guard.,
Avoid common mistakes.",How to Defend a Punch," Turn so one shoulder is pointed at your attacker, instead of facing him straight on. Keep one foot slightly toward him, and the other turned out and slightly behind you. Stay light on your feet so you can move quickly in any direction without losing your balance. Your attacker now has a smaller target, with fewer vulnerable areas.;
, Try to keep a cushion of space between you and the attacker, without getting backed up against a wall. It's much easier to evade a punch that's coming at maximum range.


This is your goal while the other person is approaching, not while he's already launching punches. Keep reading for dodging tactics.

, Bring your hands up in front of your face, with your elbows held close against your sides. Adopt one of these two positions:


An open palm is more effective at deflecting a punch. However, deflection is difficult without training, and you could break your fingers if your hand is struck.
A closed fist, with the thumb on the outside, makes it easier to return a punch. This is often your best chance to wind an attacker and get away, especially if you have not practiced advanced defense.

, The best way to defend against a punch is to avoid it completely. You'll react much faster if you've practiced this in advance, but even a partially successful dodge can turn a brutal blow into a glancing one. Try to see where the punch will land and make three motions to avoid it:


Step out of the way.
Swing your shoulder back to pull your torso away.
Turn your head out of the punch's path, preferably away from the center of the attacker's body.

, As you step aside, sweep one arm outward. Your goal is to strike the attacker's forearm with the outside of your own, deflecting it away. If you succeed and use enough force, this may even knock your opponent off balance.


This is most successful against a big, swinging punch. Deflecting a fast, direct punch will take considerable skill.
Use only one arm. Keep your other hand free to block a punch from the attacker's other fist.
Some martial artists, including karate practitioners, learn to deflect the punch with an open palm instead, or the back of the hand. This can be very effective, but is difficult to do untrained.

, If the punch is aimed at your face, point your wrist outward and throw your arm up against the incoming arm, pushing it upward. Remember to step aside and turn away at the same time if possible.

, If you succeed in deflecting the punch, immediately turn your arm and grab the person's wrist. This is difficult to do, but if you can manage it, you have an opportunity to end the fight, or to buy yourself enough time to get away:


In a serious situation: Bring in your other forearm and strike the back of it hard against the attacker's elbow. This should hyperextend or break the arm, allowing you to run while the attacker is in pain.
In a ""friendly"" fight or practice match: Instead, throw your weight against the attacker's arm as you pull him forward. With luck, she will fall over or at least lose her balance enough for you to strike.

, If the arm-grabbing maneuver does not seem within your ability, fight back with a direct attack to a vulnerable area instead. A hard blow or gouge may disorient the attacker long enough for you to escape. These are the ideal targets:


Eyes
Groin (if attacker is male)
Solar plexus
Temple
Point of the chin

, If you don't have time or room to dodge, try to turn so the punch lands on your shoulder, arm, hip, thigh, or butt. This will still be painful, but you have a much lower chance of serious injury than a blow to the abdomen or face.

, If you are trapped in a corner and don't have room to defend yourself, this position will minimize damage to your head:


Bring your forearm to the ear on the same side, pressing it against the side of your head with your wrist.
Grip the back of your head with your fingers.
Bring your elbow up so your forearm is parallel with the ground.
Pull your arm in flush against the side of your head.
Turn slightly away from the punch without exposing your back.
Clench your teeth and push your tongue against the roof of your mouth.

, However much you plan, a prolonged fight will put you in a situation where you need to improvise. Try to stick to this advice as much as possible, and avoid these mistakes in particular:


Do not lean forward more than necessary to block the punch.
Never move your head toward the punch.
Don't try to run straight back from a punch. Stepping aside and moving in puts you in a position to fight back, which is your best chance to escape.
While ducking is sometimes your best option, don't forget that this puts you within range of the attacker's knee or foot.

Have an emergency plan in place.,
Ask a lawyer for advice.,
Look at your state's laws.,
Take self-defense classes.,
Get pepper spray.,
Buy a taser.,
Purchase a firearm.,
Avoid illegal means of protecting your property.",How to Defend Your Property Against an Intruder1," If something does happen and an intruder gets into your property, you want to make sure you and your family have a plan. If you do not have a professional security system, you might need to call 911 yourself. In addition to calling law enforcement, everyone in your family should have a planned escape route and rendezvous point where everyone can meet after getting out of the home. You should always get out of the home or hide if possible. Never confront the intruder unless absolutely necessary.;
, While other methods of defending your property focus on what you can do to deter intruders, you also need to know what to do if an intruder is already on your property. Before you purchase a gun or protect your property through the use of force, talk to a lawyer about the laws in your state. Each state has different laws regarding what is acceptable for property owners to do in the face of a home invasion. Lawyers will be able to give you the most up-to-date information that can be relied on.


To find a qualified lawyer, visit your state bar association's lawyer referral service website. After answering a few general questions, you will be put in contact with multiple qualified lawyers in your area.

, If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer you can do the research on your own. Start your research by doing a simple internet search. Use Google or another search engine and search for ""home protection laws"" or ""castle doctrine"".


After doing some initial research online, go to your local law library to continue your search. Ask the librarian for help on the subject. They should be able to point you in the direction of statutes and court cases you can read on the subject of protecting your home from intruders.
Read these laws and gain an understanding of what is and what is not allowed.

, If your neighborhood has had recent intruders or if you simply want to know how to protect yourself, visit your local police website and search for offered self-defense classes. Most police stations will offer free classes for individuals concerned for their physical safety. Most classes will teach you how to assess threats, strike vulnerable areas of an intruder's body, and escape from an intruder's grasp.


A lot of classes are meant for females who want to know how to protect themselves from sexual assaults; however, these same skills can be used to protect yourself from intruders, regardless of the intruder's intentions.If you are a male looking to learn how to protect yourself, ask your local law enforcement agency about options in your community. The same people that teach women's self-defense classes will most likely have other classes available for you.

, Pepper spray is a canister that can be kept close to you in your home. If an intruder is present, you can use it to disorient and inflict physical pain on them. Pepper spray is usually available at sporting goods stores, online, and through pharmacies. Each state will have different laws regarding the purchase and use of this tool so make sure you know how to use it legally. For example, in California, canisters can only be a certain size and can only contain a certain level of the active ingredient ""OC."" In New York, you can only purchase pepper spray from a licensed pharmacist.


To use pepper spray, grasp the canister in your hand and use your thumb to press down the trigger. Point the canister in the direction of the intruder and squeeze the trigger when the intruder gets within two arm lengths of you. Aim the stream at the eyes of the intruder. Once the intruder has been hit with the spray, step aside but do not turn your back on the intruder. Continue spraying until there is a safe opportunity to run away.
Make sure you practice using the pepper spray so you feel comfortable with it. This will make using it easier when you are faced with an intrusion.Don't touch your face with the hand used to deploy the pepper spray, as some may get on your hands. Try to hold your breath when you spray so you don't inhale any of the pepper spray.

, If you think you need something stronger than pepper spray, a taser should be your next option. A taser will disrupt the intruder's body communication system. When this happens, the intruder will become immobile for a short period of time.When used properly, a taser should allow you to get away from an intruder safely. Tasers are not allowed to be used in a number of states including Hawaii, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Check with your state laws before you purchase and/or use a taser to protect your property. Other states limit the use of tasers to homes and to people with valid permits.Tasers come in many forms and each one will be used differently; therefore, before using any taser, make sure you receive training and practice with your weapon. The improper use of a taser may cause you to get injured.

, As a last resort, if your safety cannot be secured through the use of other tools, you should consider purchasing a firearm. In most cases, you will have to go through a background check before you buy the gun. In some states (e.g., California), you may even have to wait a number of days before you can purchase the gun. For the purpose of home defense, a pistol or specialized shotgun are your best options. These weapons are easy to use and store safely in close quarters.


Before bringing a firearm into your home, go to gun ranges and practice with different types of firearms. Get an idea of what works best for you and what you feel comfortable with.
It is incredibly important to know how to handle a gun safely so you do not injure yourself or your family. Owning a gun is a serious responsibility.
A firearm should only be used in incredibly limited circumstances when an intruder is seriously threatening your life or the life of your family., Never use more force than needed to protect your property from intruders. If you use excessive force, you may be get in legal trouble. For example, never use booby traps to protect your property. These devices might include trip wires, bear traps, bamboo pits, and snares. Even if your state has not outlawed these things, when you use them you run the risk of innocent bystanders being harmed by them."

Identify if there are alternative routes, or other ways to walk, to avoid a group of teens who may bully or act abusively. This may involve trying to:


Cross the street
Go into a store, or nearby shop
Head to an area where there are more people nearby;
, If you are stuck walking down the same path as the group, don't act like a victim. Groups of teens who heckle like bullies want to assert dominance, and get attention. By being unfazed by them, you'll be able to show your confidence in yourself, and not look like an easy target. Here are some ways to show confidence, without being confrontational:


Always remain calm to avoid confrontation. Pretend to be in your own world but pay close attention.
Don't scurry past with your head down. Walk swiftly without slowing down, and keep your head up.
If you are threatened, a strong, but brief, look of conviction can get you out of an awkward spot. Try to look strong and undeterred.

, Though you may have been taught to keep your head down and avoid eye contact, actually eye contact can be used purposefully as an acknowledgment of respect. Showing respect, but without words, can be helpful to avoid further negative interactions. You should look briefly with purpose, but not with disdain. A nod of respect to the group or individual may allow the group to feel validated that they don't need to assert themselves any further.
Make sure that you don't look down on them (or at least don't let them know that you look down on them), as this will make them feel the need to assert themselves, and they may react with harsher words or threats.
If you don't feel up to engaging in eye contact, a confident sniff or rummaging through your pockets can be an effective way of showing you are not afraid and not a victim.

, Rather than getting tangled up in a war of words, if the group says something funny, it's okay to laugh as you walk by. Sometimes using a few words that make light of the situation, without insulting or putting down the group, can helpful. Humor can redirect attention to something other than yourself, or help to gain respect from others. However, this tactic should be used sparingly, and only if the situation is right.

, While it's unlikely that a stranger will physically harass you (e.g. shoving or butt touching), remember to stay cool under pressure. Don't react violently, and stoop to their level. Try to deescalate the situation if you can, and ignore the need to respond. Stay confident that no reaction is better than having one.

, If you're traveling alone, you're often an easier target than with a group of friends or relatives. Groups of teens often are more inclined to act out when in a group. Their group is their security, and they may want to show-off in front of their peers. Find ways to travel more often with someone you trust, particularly at night or in areas where you know there's been trouble., While this may not come easily, it's important to see that increasing your self-esteem will allow you to act and behavior more assertively. Try to dress and do things that don't draw attention to yourself in a way that may lead to ridicule. Bullies often find ways to make others feel more vulnerable, so blending in may be helpful.

, By participating in a class, the act of taking action will lead to greater self-esteem, and in turn a greater sense of strength. Most martial artists will tell you that the first day you start a martial arts class is ironically the last time you ever fight. With the use of discipline as taught in martial arts, the ability to walk on past a group of bullying teens will seem much less intimidating.

, If there's a group of teens who aren't actively provoking you, but just acting a little suspicious, try breaking the ice. Consider having a brief but positive conversation with them, rather than assuming it will be negative.Sometimes loitering teens just want to have a purpose, particularly if they're hanging out in the same spot regularly. Consider engaging them in a useful way, like being a look-out for other suspicious activity.
Or just simply introduce yourself and make small talk. See if being ""neighborly"" reduces the negativity.

, There may be parents, relatives, teachers, local store owners, neighbors, or others that are familiar with the teens who are bullying, or harassing people on the streets. Ask if they can help by talking to the group in an assertive, non-violent way. , Your family, friends, teachers, or mentors may offer advice that has worked for them, or helped them to be more confident. Engage with others, rather than feeling singled out as a victim. You're not alone.


If you are fearful of running into bullying teens every day, or on a routine basis, it's important to work together as a community, and see what can be done. Seeking help will often reduce your anxiety immensely.
Many neighborhoods have community or church groups that can facilitate change, like the Neighborhood Watch Program. Ask a parent, counselor, friend, or mentor about how you and others can get involved.
Bear in mind that many people have had negative encounters with bullying or abusive teens. Some teens are not emotionally mature, and hide behind insults and ridicule as a way to cope with their own negative experiences. , No one should feel unsafe walking in their own neighborhood. Bullies and thugs of any age should not be allowed to take over the streets.


If the harassment is more than just insults, and leads to physical violence, consider making a report to the local police.
If you are a student, you can also talk with your school counselor about any incidents in your neighborhood, even if those incidents weren't on school property.

, Expect to find a variety of classes with specific focuses. Make a second list based on your needs and preferences. These may include:Age

Style of defense

, Expect a full course to last approximately two to three months.However, don’t shy away from shorter programs. Favor classes that aim to teach basic techniques in a short time. Avoid open-ended programs that actively push you to enroll in more advanced training after your beginner’s course.That isn’t to say that you shouldn’t continue training with more advanced courses if you want to.
Rather, self-defense classes should aim to teach you basic concepts right up front, unlike martial arts classes, which are typically taught as lifelong journeys., Search instead for programs that are specifically labeled as “self-defense.” Although self-defense classes may incorporate techniques from martial arts, don’t confuse them as being the same thing. Remember that:Martial arts classes might teach tactics that could be used for self-defense, but only as a small part of a broader program.
They also won’t teach tactics that aren’t part of their particular martial art.
Martial arts are not guaranteed to work in real-world situations.

, For each one you’re interested in, find out when the next class is in session. Arrive beforehand. Meet the instructor and ask to observe (or even take part in) the class.Since people who have already experienced assault often seek self-defense classes, a respectful instructor should be patient with prospective new students.
If they refuse to let you observe the class, or push you into taking part before you’re ready, consider this a possible red flag., As training begins, watch the techniques that the instructor uses. Also pay attention to the students’ ability to perform them. Ask yourself the following:Is the class practical? Do the techniques seem useful in scenarios you might actually encounter in life?
Are the students able to execute them effectively?
Do the moves seem too complicated for you to execute?

, Observe the class in action. Then speak with other students to find out what they think of it. Make sure that it is the right fit for you, especially if you have experienced real assault in your own life. Don’t waste time in an unsupportive environment that makes you shy away from taking part. Ask questions like:Do other students feel more empowered by this class, or more afraid or certain of being attacked in real life?Are the simulations too reminiscent of actual attacks you may have suffered?
Are the students supportive of each other, or too competitive?

, Depending on your own, decide whether you are comfortable with theirs. If you are impressed with the class overall, but would rather have another instructor, ask if any others teach the same class.If you are a woman, you may prefer another woman as a positive role model. Or you may prefer a man so you can train against them.
If you are a man, you may feel reluctant to fully engage with a woman. You may also consider being attacked by one in real life less likely than being attacked by another man.

, Treat any class that sells itself as “guaranteed” as untrustworthy. Although it may seem counterintuitive, favor programs that admit to uncertainty. Look for instructors who advise techniques that are “likely” to work in the “right” circumstances, rather than those who swear that a tactic will “always” work.There is no way to safely replicate a real-world assault in class.
This means that techniques learned in simulations may not always work in real life.
Instructors should be honest and forthcoming about this important point.

, Expect instructors to also teach self-defense tactics that don’t involve violence or direct confrontation with assailants. If you are observing a class that seems to only touch on these, ask the instructor afterward if that just happens to be today’s lesson, and if other methods are taught. Other areas should include:Awareness of your environment to avoid confrontations.
Verbal techniques to de-escalate situations.

, Remember: you aren’t an athlete training to be a blackbelt, but to defend yourself in real-world scenarios regardless of your physical fitness. Expect the instructor to respect this. Whatever technique is being taught, they should focus on what you are capable of doing right now, rather than force you to achieve a goal beyond your reach. Favor classes that teach simple moves that you can perform easily.If the techniques being taught are too complex or require physical abilities that you do not possess, choose a new class if the instructor continues to insist on them."

Assess the area.",How to Deal With a Threat1," Decide how certain you are that the threatening person will follow through on his or her words. There is a wide margin between a threatening note and a man standing in front of you holding a knife. The way that you react will necessarily depend upon the immediate danger of the situation.;
, If the threat is immediate, then quickly and calmly look around you for potential defense mechanisms and escape routes. If the threat is more abstract, then try to get a clearer picture of what exactly is going on. Make sure that you understand why you're being threatened and what the actual risk is.Why are you being threatened? If you don't know, ask. If you can't ask, then speculate.
Do they want something from you? Consider giving a threatening person what he/she asks for. You never know how desperate someone is, and it is senseless to be killed over the contents of your wallet.
Who is the leader of the group? If it comes down to you against them, then the leader may be your first target.

, Are you familiar with the lay of the land? Are you under CCTV surveillance? Do you have a chance of escape? This will strongly define the actions that you take to deal with the situation.

Research good guard animals.,
Shop around.,
Train your dog.",How to Defend Your Property Against an Intruder2," Dogs can be great family pets as well as great tools for protecting your property from intruders. Some dog breeds are better for property protection than others. With the proper training, quality guard dogs will bark, bite, intimidate, and chase intruders away. In general, the best dog breeds for protection include:Bullmastiffs
Doberman Pinschers
Rottweilers
German Shepherds
Akitas

, Do not simply purchase the first dog you find. Dogs need to match the personality of their owners and you need to make sure you purchase a dog that you can take care of. For example, guard dogs are very active and need to be exercised often. In addition, they can be aggressive towards others if not properly trained; therefore, it is important you shop around until you find the right dog for you.


Additionally, while it is always nice to adopt a dog from a shelter, these dogs often need extra training due to possible emotional and physical problems that arose before you owned them; therefore, it might be a good idea to purchase a puppy from a reputable breeder if you are purchasing a dog for home protection.

, When you find a dog that matches your personality, your lifestyle, and your family, you need to train them properly. If you have the money, consider taking your dog to a professional trainer. Most communities will have dog trainers you can hire. A lot of dog trainers may even specialize in training guard dogs.


Make sure you have the time and dedication necessary to train a dog properly. Simply making your dog aggressive is not safe for you or good for the dog. Keep in mind this is a guard dog, not an attack dog. An attack dog, like dogs used by police, requires a great deal of training and is likely not appropriate to keep in a home.If you do not have the funds to hire a professional trainer, you can certainly work to train the dog yourself. Start by teaching the dog basic obedience (i.e., sit, stay, leave it, and bark). Next, teach your dog impulse control, which means obeying your commands when others are in the house. You also need to teach the dog about their territory, which involves walking the dog around the house and your property daily. Finally, teach the dog to protect your property by going through the process with them. Have someone come up to your house as if they were going to break in. Teach your dog how to react to these situations and repeat the process."

Install quality locks on doors and windows.,
Avoid certain types of doors.,
Have automatic lights.,
Purchase an alarm system.,
Install security cameras.,
Use your smartphone to help secure your home.",How to Defend Your Property Against an Intruder3," As soon as you become concerned about the safety of your family and your property, you should hire a security expert to look over your property and give you recommendations. The type of professional you hire will depend on the actions you want to take and the amount of money you want to spend.


If you have a large home and family, and a lot of valuable property to protect, you might consider hiring a security consultant. These experts will usually offer security risk assessments, training, plans, and services;however, these services can be quite expensive and may be too much security for your needs.
A lot of families will hire a professional security services company to help them defend their property. You could do the same by hiring a company like ADT, Protect America, Protection 1, XFINITIY, or Alarm Force.These companies offer services like alarms and camera systems. These options are usually more affordable.

, Work with the professional you hire to look over your property and find areas that could easily be penetrated by intruders. Common areas of concern usually include doors, windows, and property boundaries. These are areas where intruders look for weaknesses they then try to exploit. When you work with your professional, set up an appointment time when they can visit your property to look over the situation. Make the appointment during a time when someone in your family can be home to show the person around.

, At a glance, you might think that signs and fences do little to protect your property; however, in reality, these features are great deterrents for scaring away would-be intruders. Because intruders look for easy and quick access points, they rarely want to spend time jumping over fences and carrying equipment and stolen goods over them., When you place a security company's sticker or sign in your window or yard, you are telling intruders that your home is professionally protected. Most intruders will not want to risk getting in trouble by breaking into a home that has a security system., Two of the most common places where intruders break into a home are through windows and doors. Intruders will look for doors that are unlocked, do not have a lock, or that have flimsy or old locks; therefore, it is important to update your locking mechanisms in order to protect your property. Study each window and door and look to see if you have working locks. If a door or window has a lock that doesn't work, replace it.


All locks should securely fasten the window or door to the framing of the property. The lock should not be accessible from outside without the use of a key.
On doors, use deadbolt locks in addition to locks on the door handle itself. Deadbolt locks offer an extra layer of security and make it more difficult for an intruder to break in.

, Intruders usually break into homes they consider easy to access. One of the things intruders look for is doors with windows, mail slots, and dog doors. Intruders will use these weaknesses to gain access to your home.


If you have a door with one of these features, consider installing a new one. While the new door may not have all of the aesthetic features you want, it will protect against intruders.
If you really want to protect your property, you can even buy reinforced doors that are made out of extremely durable and tough materials. These doors are difficult to break down.

, Intruders often break into homes they think are not occupied. One of the most common things they look for is the absence of lights; therefore, one of the easiest ways to deter would-be intruders is to have your lights set on a timer. This way, certain lights will automatically turn on at a certain time. You can buy these light timers at any hardware store in your community.


Use these timers for outdoor lights, hallway lights that will light up your entryway, and lights in common rooms with windows facing the front of your home.

, One of the most common defense mechanisms for your property is an alarm system. An alarm system is a series of electronic devices that protect against intruders. Do some research (type ""security system companies"" into an internet search) or ask your professional for help finding a system that is right for you. These systems will vary in cost depending on the company you purchase from and the type of system you buy. You will usually pay for the system itself, an installation fee, and a monthly fee. When you purchase an alarm system, a professional will usually come and install the following:A control panel
Door and window sensors
Motion sensors
Alarms

, In addition to purchasing an alarm system, you can also install security cameras to further deter intruders and protect your property. Security cameras are used to monitor hard to see and distant areas of your property, remote buildings like garages, and entry points like your front and back doors. These cameras will provide security footage to your computer smartphone, or tablet.


Security cameras are most often used when you are out of town to watch for deliveries and other services like landscaping and housesitters.
Cameras can also be used to record security breaches so you have footage of the intruder that can be used by law enforcement., You can download an app on your phone that you can use to lock your doors, turn on lights, and arm your security system. These apps are a great way to secure your home when you are at work, out of town, or when you simply forget to lock the door on your way out.


These features only work in conjunction with specific security systems. Ask your security provider if they have an app you can use.

Talk to the person.,
Deal with blackmail.,
Tell someone.,
Get a restraining order.",How to Deal With a Threat2," If you personally know the person who is threatening you, see if there's a way to resolve the situation without escalating it any further. Strike a deal, if you're being blackmailed or asked for something. Discuss the situation face-to-face and try to come to a mutual agreement.Figure out whether you're being threatened for something valid. Perhaps the person thinks that you did something that you didn't do.
Don't be too proud to apologize. A good apology can defuse some of the tensest situations.

, Blackmail is still a threat, even if it is nonviolent. The way that you respond will depend upon what the person is holding over you and how much you have to lose. Make sure that you don't give in before you've considered other ways out. If you feel confident, take a stand., Make sure that you aren't dealing with this alone. As soon as possible, involve someone that you trust: a teacher, a parent, a friend, a partner, a coworker, an authority figure. Together, you stand a better chance. Show the person any threatening messages, and make sure that he/she knows exactly who is threatening you., If there is no other way to defuse the threat, then consider obtaining a court order for the person to stop bothering you. You'll need to prove the truth and urgency of the threat, and file a report with the local police department. You can ask for an order for the person to stop specific behaviors, or you can ask that the courts restrict the person from coming near you.


Once you have a stay-away order against a person, he or she cannot come within a certain physical range of you – often on the order of 50-100 yards. This may not stop the threat if the person is desperate enough, but it will at least create a legal barrier."
"
Act nonviolently when possible.,
Defend yourself.,
Take down the leader.,
Fight for it.,
Contact the authorities.",How to Deal With a Threat3," Try to handle the threat by giving in, or escaping, or talking your way out of the situation. You may find that people are much more reasonable than you expect.


Make a compromise or a deal. See if there is a way to deescalate the situation so that everyone leaves happy and healthy.
Decide whether you have an escape route. If they are only facing you, then you might run backwards. Run towards other people, there is safety in numbers.
If there is no nonviolent way to escape, then you may need to defend yourself. Be prepared for this, but try not to make it your first reaction.

, Be realistic about your chances. If you are outnumbered or otherwise outmatched, then it might be wise to first explore nonviolent solutions. Remember that violence is never a guaranteed method of dealing with someone. Once you escalate the situation, it may be very difficult to safely cool it back down.If you are under CCTV surveillance and you plan to fight your way out of the situation, then you want the threatening person to make the first move. However, if you are outnumbered, and one or more of them is armed in some visible way, then this may be enough to justify your actions., Try a kick to the groin, an elbow to the ribs, or a well-placed punch. No points for style or fair play – but if you put all your strength into it, he/she should hit the deck fast. Now you need to think again.


Run now, if possible. Move quickly away through the space you just created. If you're lucky, the rest of the group will be momentarily distracted.
If you can't get away, then you need to get something in between you and the rest of the group. One of the group will do nicely. Grab the closest one by the throat or neck—you want to be behind him so he is not in a good position—and make sure that you are hurting him enough that he won't attack you. Try grabbing his ear with your other arm and pulling it as hard as you can.

, Keep the fighting close and dirty. Dart in and out again, and don't let them grab you. You're finished once one or two of them catch hold of you. Run as soon as you get an opening.


Kick the back of your ""shield's"" knees down to the floor in a very powerful stamp. Ideally you want to break something. You then need to deal with the others in a similar way.
Try to go for unexpected targets. The knee is very weak, and can easily be broken with a kick.
Sucker punches to the jaw can lay someone out, but they are so very expected that it's unlikely to come off.

, Tell the police or a security guard about the confrontation. Alternatively, use your cellphone or a payphone and call the emergency services. Do your best to accurately describe the situation: when, where, and what the threatening people looked like."

Enhance your home’s security.,
Use your energy to prepare, not worry.",How to Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home1," This is crucial if there are more than one person under the same room, especially with children. Designate a safe space, a room that can be easily locked and barricaded in the event of a burglary. You can make this your bedroom, or your child’s bedroom if you have children. Then designate a backup safe space, in case the path to your first option is blocked by the burglar.Make sure the safe room has a phone you can easily access. This can be a landline, or simply a cellphone that is kept within, charged.
Establish an escape route in case your safe space is compromised. If your safe space is on the second floor, this could mean an escape ladder by the window.;
, A masterful plan will fail brilliantly without masterful execution. Make sure everyone in your home knows exactly what to do in the event of a break-in. You can establish a safe word which, when shouted, will alert the household to an intruder. Use this word when you practice your plan, and your reaction to it will be instinctual., There are a few things you can do to improve the security of your home. Some require more of a time or monetary investment, while others are simply good practice.


Lock your doors and windows. Even if you’re at home, just locking up your home can deter possible burglars.
Get to know your neighbors. They can keep an eye on your home when you’re away, and will be more willing to help the police in the case of a break-in.
Keep the outside of your home well-lit. This is especially important for your home’s entry points. Motion-activated floodlights will surprise and possibly scare off a would-be burglar.
Keep the blinds closed. This hides valuables from view and it will be harder to tell if you’re home or not.
Keep the lights on, even when out of the house. That way, your home looks less empty and less inviting., It’s important to differentiate being prepared and living in fear. As you follow the above steps, learn to make them a habit, a normal part of life. This will go a long way to keeping you ready in case a burglar decides to enter your home as opposed to flinching at shadows.


If you find yourself constantly anxious and fearing a burglary, consider getting professional help to work through your worries.

Listen closely.,
Try to stay where you are and lock the door.,
Be quiet.,
Use a phone to call 911.,
Wait until emergency services arrive.",How to Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home2," Hearing a strange noise is usually your first clue that there’s an intruder. You’ll also get a general idea of where the burglar is in relation to your position. There’s plenty that simple listening can tell you about your situation. Be ""all-ears"" and listen very closely to what the burglar is doing.


Do you hear footsteps or other noises coming your way?
Does it sound like the burglar is talking to someone else?
Can you hear your property being picked up and packed?

, After locking the door, try to hide as best you can. Use heavy furniture to barricade the door, further impeding the burglar’s attempts to get inside. Don’t unlock the door until you are completely sure the area is safe or the burglar has left.


If the room you’re hiding in has a closet, hide in it as well. Lock it if possible.
If you can’t find a good hiding place or lock the door, you may need to move to a more secure room.

, Don't make a peep. Do not, under any circumstances, yell out to the burglar; all this will do is give away your hideout and the burglar will find you faster. Breathe as quietly as you can. If you’re in the room with anyone else, don’t discuss your plan or argue about what to do., If there’s a landline in your hiding place, use it, otherwise use your cellphone to call the emergency services. Make sure you know your address, because you will have to tell the operator your address so the police can come to your house and clear out the situation.


It’s important to keep your cellphone charged and nearby, so that you can quickly grab it as you hide.
Be prepared to give the operator a quick, concise description of the situation.
Any questions they ask is to determine how much help you need, so it’s important to describe the situation as accurately and urgently as possible., Don’t leave your hiding place until the police arrive. Don’t leave until they can confirm to you that the area is safe. If they haven’t managed to catch the burglar, make sure to let them know about any particularly good hiding places in your home. That way they can check more thoroughly.


Be wary of the burglar pretending to be the police. If you can’t get a good look at their identification (say because you’re still hiding), you can call 911 to check if you’re dealing with a real police officer."

Try to avoid confrontation.,
Arm yourself.,
Aim for the burglar’s most vulnerable spots.,
Escape.",How to Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home3," A burglar is usually looking for an empty home to rob.Most simply want an easy job for easy money, and don’t intend to confront a home’s occupants. Your first priority should be the lives of yourself and anyone else in your home, not your possessions. However, if a burglar threatens your life, or tries to take you somewhere with them, you’ll need to fight back.


If the burglar only wants your possessions, and asks you to do something like opening a safe, comply and cooperate. Your valuables are not worth your life!

, Unless you’re trained in self-defense and/or martial arts, confronting a burglar empty-handed is incredibly dangerous. Not only because you aren’t trained, but because they could be carrying a weapon themselves. Anything that can be used as a club, or thrown, is better than just your hands.


A variety of household items can be used as a weapon, such as sports equipment, keys or glass bottles. A baseball bat or a bottle of whiskey can be swung like a club, whereas keys can be used as a stabbing implement.
Try keeping a weapon near your bed. If you’re worried about burglaries happening at night, you might feel safer keeping a baseball bat or knife near your bed.
Pepper spray, while an efficient deterrent, isn’t legal in all jurisdictions. If it is legal to own, consider acquiring it, and learn how to use it properly.

, Your goal is to incapacitate them enough to facilitate your escape, not to win a prolonged fight.Don’t be afraid to fight dirty: you’re fighting for your life.


Strike at their legs to disable their movement. The knee is a particularly weak joint; a well placed kick or strike can completely destroy it.Strike for the eyes, groin and throat to incapacitate. These spots are incredibly sensitive, and a good strike to one of them is enough to slow an attacker.

, Don’t stay near the burglar any longer than you need to. If you’re able to fight back and create an opportunity to escape, use it! Make as much noise as possible when you do and contact emergency services.

Pick or buy calendula.,
Dry your calendula.,
Pick an oil.,
Gather supplies needed for infusion.,
Place the flowers into the glass container.,
Pour the oil into the glass container.,
Place the container in direct sunlight.,
Leave the mixture for a minimum of two weeks.,
Strain the oil.,
Apply directly to the skin.,
Use oil to make lotion, salve, and lip balms.,
Use calendula oil for other purposes.",How to Make Calendula Oil," While you can buy dried calendula flowers at a herb store or online, many people making calendula oil make it with flowers they grow themselves. Pick the flowers when they bloom, when these blooms are at their peak, but wait until mid day so that the dew has evaporated from the petals.Calendula oil is made with just the flower of the plant. Pick the flowers right under the bloom, below the base of the flower which holds the petals.
You should pick calendula flowers as they bloom, collecting them over the course of a week or two. This will assure that the blooms are picked when they are in the best condition.You can make the oil with a few or a lot of calendula flowers. As long as you have at least a quarter cup, you can infuse them into oil.;
, Calendula flowers need to be dried slowly, at a low temperature. If you have a dehydrator, it will be great for this job. Keep the heat at or below 90 degrees fahrenheit. If you don't have a dehydrator, simply lay the flowers out on a clean kitchen towel, place them in a spot out of direct sunlight, and let them dry for a week or two.Calendula oil can be made with fresh flowers. However, the risk of mold growing as the calendula infuses in oil is greater with fresh flowers because they contain so much moisture. This is why using dried flowers is suggested., Calendula oil can be made with a wide variety of neutral oils. Many people use a very light oil, such as safflower or grapeseed oil, while others prefer olive oil to make their infusion. Jojoba oil can also be added to the infusion, although it is usually used in combination with another less expensive oil.

, Making Calendula oil requires very few supplies. You only need a glass container with a lid and something to stir the mixture, such as a spoon.


The size of your glass container will depend on the amount of calendula flowers you want to use to make oil. Pick a container that fits all of your flowers with room to spare.
A see through glass container works well because the sunlight can get into the container and you can easily keep an eye on the mixture while it steeps.

, The amount of flowers you use varies depending on the size jar you use and how much Calendula oil you want to make. For example, if you are using a pint jar, you will want to use no more than a cup and a half of Calendula flowers so that there is plenty of room for the oil to cover them all completely. This will make between a cup and two cups of Calendula oil, depending on how much oil you add.


You do not want to pack the flowers into the container tightly, as you want the flowers to be totally encased in oil. On the other hand, you don't want just a few flowers and a ton of oil. This will make a very, very weak calendula oil.

, The goal is to completely cover the calendula petals with the oil. Keep pouring oil into the container until the flowers are totally covered, shaking the jar slightly to get rid of large air bubbles. It is a good idea to have at least one inch of oil above the flower petals, so that it is assured that they stay covered.


You can also stir the mixture a little bit to make sure the flowers are covered with oil and that there are no big air bubbles. With your spoon, finish by pushing all flowers into the oil so they are all submerged.
There should not be any pieces popping out. If there are, push them down or add more oil.

, The mixture needs the slow and steady heat of the sun to really infuse. To get the heat it needs, you can put it outside or inside, depending on where you live.


Usually a south facing window is best. This should get a lot of sun during the summer.
If you live in an area where there are animals that might knock it over or mess with it for some reason, put it inside by a window. If you can safely put it outside where no one or no animal will take it, putting it outside would be better.
Ideally, oil making should be done in summer, so when the oil is set in a window it heats up. If you are making the oil at any other time of year, gently heating up the oil and herbs and stewing it for 10 minutes on a very low heat is a good idea. This will approximate the heating that the sun does to the mixture.

, Gently shake the mixture daily for a moment or two to mix it up and make sure all the flowers are submerged. The mixture needs this time to gently combine.


If you leave your mixture in the window for more time, you will get a stronger oil. Once you get some practice at making the oil, you can decide how long is perfect for your desired strength of oil.

, Place the oil mixture into a coffee filter, a piece of muslin, or in cheese cloth over another glass container.Once strained, the macerated oil is now ready for use.


You can use different strainers to get different purities of oil. For example, a cheese cloth will filter the oil less than a coffee filter.

, Calendula oil can be applied straight on the skin is said to heal certain ailments. In Ayurveda practice, an ancient holistic healing practice, calendula oil is used to cure athlete's foot, varicose veins, eczema, and skin infections.To apply to the skin, simply put a small amount of the oil on a cotton ball and wipe it onto your skin. The oil should absorb into your skin relatively quickly, especially if your skin is dry.

, Calendula oil can be used as is on dry, cracked skin or it can be added to other carrier oils, creams, and lotions. However, usually it is made into an ointment.


To make an ointment, also known as a salve, combine 3/4 cup of your calendula oil with 1/4 cup of coconut oil and 1 ounce of beeswax in a pan over a double boiler. Heat the mixture until it is completely melted and thoroughly combined. Then pour it into a container, such as several glass jars, and allow to cool. Once cool, it's ready to use.

, There are a wide variety of uses for calendula oil. For instance, you can use it to calm an ear ache. Simply put a few drops into the affected ear and this will ease moderate inflammation.You can also apply calendula oil to your dog's ears to stop ear mites.Rub a few drops in the visible part of the ear to deter mites.

Determine the type of massage.,
Consider the time and place of the massage.,
Look at personal preferences.,
Ask about allergies.,
Consider the therapeutic intent.",How to Choose a Massage Oil," Heavier oils, such as olive oil, work best for low-friction massages such as Swedish or relaxation. These oils are slipperier and don't absorb as quickly into the skin. Lighter oils, such as grapeseed, and creams work best for high-friction massages, such as sports and deep tissue. These oils absorb more quickly to prevent you from slipping as you apply more pressure but provide enough glide to prevent irritating the skin.;
, Heavier oils that don't absorb as easily may get on your clothing when you get dressed. These oils are best in situations where you have access to a shower so that you have the option to wash off any access oil. These oils also work well for an end-of-day massage in your home, where you don't have to worry about getting oil on your clothes.

, Some people like the aromatherapy benefits of scented massage oils while others may not appreciate walking around smelling like a lavender plant. Other individuals may be sensitive to strong scents, or allergic to fragrances. If you are choosing an oil for professional use, it's better to go unscented and add essential oils on a case-by-case basis. If you are choosing an oil for personal use, find a scent that you and/or partner enjoy.

, In addition to fragrance allergies, some individuals may also be allergic to nuts or certain flower extracts. For example, a person who is allergic to tree nuts should not use almond oil and individuals with ragweed allergies should avoid oils with chamomile. If you are concerned with allergies, look for oils labeled hypoallergenic.

, Some massage oils are medicated with arnica, menthol and other extracts to help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Others may contain emu oil to relieve skin irritations. If you are using massage on a sports injury, a medicated oil would be more effective than a plain oil. However, if the person you are working on has allergies or skin sensitivities, you may wish to use a non-medicated oil and rely on technique alone.

Stop a moment.,
Try to stand your ground.,
Tell the person or persons what you want from them.,
Remain calm.,
Walk towards help.,
Take notes later.",How to Deal With Severe Bullying1," When you are being bullied, it can make you a bit panicky, and you won't be thinking as clearly. Take a couple of deep breaths, and actually look at what's happening to you.It's important to breathe because it can help you calm down.
Trying to observe what's going on can help you name what's happening to you. That will help in the next step.;
, Sometimes, bullies will back down if you just hold your own. Look the person in the eye, and try to make yourself as big as possible. In other words, stand up straight.Try practicing your stance in front of the mirror. Stare yourself down!

, Once you note what's happening, you can decide what you want to happen next. That doesn't mean you can make the person do it, but sometimes saying what you want to happen will actually stop the bullying.For instance, you could say, ""I want you to stop throwing paper at me. I know you think it's funny, but I don't. So stop.""
Alternatively, you could say something like ""I can see you laughing at me. I want you to stop.""

, Your bully wants you to get angry. The person is looking for that type of response, and it will only egg him or her on if you get angry. Try to stay calm by taking deep breaths throughout the whole encounter.It can also help to try to blow off the bully with humor. Responding with humor takes the wind out of his sails.For instance, if someone is throwing paper balls at you throughout class, you could say, ""What, is your aim so bad that you can't hit the trash can?""

, While it's tempting to just run away without thinking, take a moment to think about where you will be safe. If you just run away, the bully can follow. However, if you go somewhere safe, you can stop the bullying.For example, enter a classroom with people in it.Another option is ducking into a room that has an adult in it., Later that day, write down what happened from your point of view. That way, when you talk to an adult, you have something to show them. If it happens more than once, try to mark approximate dates and times.


Because some schools may define bullying as something that occurs multiple times, it can help to have the details."
"
Use technology to your advantage.,
Don't feed the trolls.,
Record evidence.,
Report cyberbullying.,
Stay safe.",How to Deal With Severe Bullying2," Since cyberbullying happens on electronic devices, you can use that same technology to work in your favor. Many phones and websites have ways of blocking people who are being mean to you.For instance, on your phone, you can likely block incoming messages and calls from a particular person.On websites like Facebook, try unfriending and/or blocking the person completely., Sometimes, cyberbullies are referred to as ""trolls,"" and a common internet saying is ""Don't feed the trolls."" In other words, cyberbullies won't get any enjoyment out of bullying someone if the person doesn't respond at all. Try to ignore the people who are bullying you. If someone is bullying you on a particular website, try avoiding that website so you won't have to read the hateful things the person is saying and so that you won't be tempted to respond., Just like in person, it can help to keep evidence of cyberbullying on hand. Keep emails and messages connected to bullying, and you can even take screenshots of times when cyberbullying has happened. Try to record times and dates, as well. The reason you should keep this information is it makes easier for websites and companies to stop cyberbullying when you present this type of information to them., You can report cyberbullying to the website where it is happening, if it is happening on a social media site, for instance. You can also report it to your school if someone from the school is doing the bullying. If it is more severe, such as if someone is posting inappropriate pictures of you, you can even report it to the police. Just make sure you have your evidence with you when you do., Never give out personal information on the internet. Don't post your home address or your phone number, for instance. Bullies and other predators can use that information to find you, so you want to give them as little information as possible to use against you."
"
Tell an adult.,
Ask them to help you develop a plan.,
Stay in groups.,
Make friends.,
Ask about transferring schools.",How to Deal With Severe Bullying3," If you are being bullied, it's important to tell somebody you trust. Talk to a teacher, a coach, or a parent. It's their job to step up and help you deal with a bully, so tell them what you know.It's always good to talk to an adult. However, it's especially important if the bully has already gotten physical with you or you think the person might be violent towards you in the future., The adult should help to stop the bully. However, the adult should also be able to help you make a plan about how to deal with the situation. Ask them to walk you through ways to deal with a bully.For example, an adult may be able to assist you in finding ways to not be alone in the hallways., Bullies often isolate people to bully. If you're often alone, it makes you more of a target. Try to walk to classes with friends, or stay in places where teachers are on guard.Stay away from places you know will be empty. For instance, if you know the gym is usually empty after school, try going to the library instead.

, Making friends can be difficult if you're not very outgoing. It's okay to feel shy when you're trying to make new friends. Having friends, though, can make you less vulnerable to bullying, and it gives you someone to pal around with between classes.Try talking to someone in your classes or in a club you're in. You can use what you're doing to start a conversation. For instance, you could say, ""Hi, I'm Kay. This problem we're doing is really hard, don't you think?""Make a habit of talking to the same people. Over time, you'll get to know that person more. For instance, if you see the person in the cafeteria, ask if you can sit with him or her. You could say, ""Hey, we're in math together. We were talking about that awful problem the other day. Do you mind if I sit with you?""
One way to get to know a person is to get them talking about themselves. The best way to do that is to ask questions. You can ask about what they like or what their family is like. You could ask what their favorite subject is or what they like to do for fun.Don't forget to be nice to the person. Doing nice things for people makes them like you more. For instance, offer your notes if the person misses a class, or help someone understand their homework if they're struggling., If your situation is particularly bad, ask about transferring schools. This step may be difficult if you go to a zoned public school, but it can be done.Ask your parents to appeal to the school board to let you go to another school in the district.Going to a new school can give you a fresh start.
You might also be able to transfer to a charter school, though it may be difficult in the middle of the year. Ask your parents to help you look for options.

"
Speak up.,
Don't be an audience.,
Tell an adult.",How to Deal With Severe Bullying4," If you see someone being bullied, tell the person to stop. It takes courage to step in, but you can be someone's hero by stepping in. Often, it just takes one person standing up to the bully to make him or her stop.For instance, you could say, ""Hey, leave that kid alone. What did he ever do to you?""

, Even if you don't step in, it's important not to encourage bullying. That means, you shouldn't laugh as someone else gets bullied.If you just watch and laugh, you are contributing, as you are providing an audience for the bully.Even just standing and watching without laughing can encourage the bully, as you are giving the person an audience.That doesn't mean you should just walk away. If you're not willing to step in, move on to the next step.

, If you're not willing to step in yourself, tell an adult. Find someone in a nearby classroom, or talk to your school counselor. That way, the adult can step in and handle the situation."

Build self-confidence.,
Develop communication skills.,
Encourage empathy.,
Skip retaliation.",How to Deal With Severe Bullying5," Bullies tend to pick on kids without confidence. If you can build self-confidence, you can help prevent being bullied in the future.Try a power pose. Some research has shown that just acting confident can build confidence. Generally, a power pose involves making yourself larger, more spread out. For instance, putting your hands on your hips and spreading your legs apart is a power pose. Don't forget to hold your head high! Try holding a pose that makes you feel stronger for 2 minutes.Master new skills. Another way to help build your confidence is to take on new skills. As you become better at the skill, it can boost your confidence.Exercise or play sport. Exercising can make you feel strong and confident. You should be getting exercise anyway, so it's a win-win. Martial arts may be a good choice, in case you need to defend yourself., Communication skills are the ways you interact with other kids and teachers. Basically, it's how you present yourself to the world. If you have basic communication skills, people see you as more assertive. Assertive means being self-assured and able to speak up for yourself. The more assertive you are, the less likely you are to get bullied.Being assertive means being able to talk to others to express what you want without being mean. For instance, instead of saying, ""Why do you give me all the bad jobs?"" you could say, ""Would it be possible for me to clean the dry erase boards next week?""Communicating well means you offer leading ideas, ask questions nicely, and offer support when possible. For instance, when a friend does a good job, you say, ""You were awesome! Great job!"", Empathy means you feel what others are feeling. To be empathetic, you have to listen to what others are going through and try to understand their pain. While it can be hard to encourage empathy, bullying is less likely to happen when kids are empathetic to each other.Pay attention. The first step towards being empathetic is to notice other people. Watch other kids' faces to see how they are feeling. You can usually tell if someone is upset if you're looking at them. They may frown, have watery eyes, or turn red in the face.Talk to the other person. If you see someone looking down, ask how he or she is doing. You could say, ""Hey, what's wrong? You don't look so good."" Listen to his or her response.
Even if you don't feel what the other person is feeling, it's important to express sympathy for what the person is going through. That just means you respond to what he or she told you in a nice way. For instance, if the person said, ""I'm having a bad day. My dog is sick."" You could say, ""Oh, that's awful. I'd hate that if it were my dog. You must be really sad."", Being bullied can make you want to lash out. You may be tempted to threaten someone who bullies you. However, that just turns you into a bully, and you're perpetuating the problem.In addition, it can make the bully want to fight back harder, which only hurts you.Also, if you do try to retaliate, you could find yourself taking part of the blame, even though the bully struck first."

Listen to your tattoo artist.,
Leave the covering on for 2-6 hours.,
Carefully remove the bandage.,
Gently wash the tattoo.,
Pat the tattoo dry with a light, soft towel.,
Apply a non-scented, water-based anti-bacterial ointment.,
Continue to wash and moisturize your tattoo, at minimum, twice a day until the scab is gone.",How to Care for a New Tattoo1," If you've done your homework and chosen a good tattoo artist, he or she will provide detailed instructions on how to care for your new tattoo, which you should follow carefully. Every tattoo artist will have a slightly different opinion on the best way to care for a new tattoo, but don't worry, most reputable artists have had years of experience in caring for new tattoos, so their methods have been tried and tested.Think of your tattoo as having a warranty; if you don't follow the artist's instructions, you might void the warranty, and he or she won't give you free touch-ups.
Remember: tattoo artists want your tattoo to heal correctly and look good just as much as you do, so they shouldn't give you any poor advice.
The following instructions may vary slightly from what your tattoo artist tell you, but should serve as a good guideline.;
, Once the tattoo is complete, your tattoo artist will clean the area, apply an anti-bacterial ointment and cover the tattoo with a bandage or some dressing. Once you have left the tattoo parlor, resist the temptation to open the bandage. The bandage is there to protect your tattoo from airborne bacteria, which can penetrate through your broken skin. The bandage should be left on for a minimum of two hours before you remove it.


Thick, absorbent, non-stick ABD wound dressings are the most common type of bandage used by tattoo artists. These are very effective as they allow the tattoo to breathe while also being thick enough to protect the skin from bacteria and bumps. They are also extremely absorbent.There are many tattoo artists out there who are firm believers in wrapping new tattoos in plastic wrap, while there are many more who believe that this is the worst possible thing you could do for your tattoo.
Proponents of plastic wrap believe that it is the best way to wrap a new tattoo as it is easy to apply and remove without sticking to the skin. It also forms an effective shield that blocks any bacteria from getting near the tattoo.
Those who oppose plastic wrap do so because it prevents oxygen from getting to the tattoo, and oxygen is essential for healing. It also seals in moisture and raises the temperature of the skin, creating a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.Whichever type of covering your tattoo artist uses, be sure to follow his/her advice carefully. Both types of bandages have been used successfully before. Just remember that plastic wrap will need to be changed, and the tattoo cleaned much more frequently than with other bandaging, to prevent the build-up of bacteria.

, The jury is still out on how long a bandage should be left on before it is removed. Most artists agree that you should keep your tattoo covered for a minimum of two hours before removing, but the recommended maximum amount of time varies between 4 and 6 hours. Tattoos covered in plastic wrap are the exception; plastic wrap should never be left on a new tattoo for longer than two hours.In reality, the amount of time will vary according to the size and placement of the tattoo, along with the level of tattoo seepage and the type of bandage used. In most cases, it is best to follow the advice of your tattoo artist, but you should also use your judgement and common sense.
To remove the bandage, soak it with warm water to prevent it from sticking to your skin. It should come off easily once wet. Discard the used bandage.

, Most artists recommend lukewarm water and mild, unscented liquid antibacterial or antimicrobial soap. Use your hands to rub the tattoo gently, removing all traces of blood, plasma, or leaked ink. This will help to prevent the tattoo from scabbing too soon. Do not use a washcloth, loofah or any sponge to clean the tattoo, as these may harbor bacteria.Do not hold the tattoo directly under the water. Wash it indirectly by splashing the water over the tattoo with your hands. The stream of water from the faucet may be too harsh on your new tattoo.
If your new tattoo is covering a large area of skin, it may be easiest to wash the tattoo in the shower.

, Once you have thoroughly washed the tattoo, you should gently pat it dry with a little paper towel. Do not rub the tattoo, as this may cause irritation. Once the excess moisture has been removed, you should leave the tattoo uncovered for 20 minutes to an hour. This will allow the tattoo to breathe and any excess moisture to evaporate.


You should allow your tattoo to breathe like this after each time you wash it or get it wet.

, Once your tattoo is fully dry, and the skin begins to feel tight you can apply a little ointment, such as Bacitracin, to the tattoo. Make sure to apply only a very thin layer and rub it in gently until it's absorbed by the skin. It's very important that you don't apply too much ointment, or else you'll suffocate the tattoo and encourage the growth of bacteria.You should continue applying the ointment after each time you wash the tattoo, at least twice a day, for 3 to 5 days or until the tattoo starts to peel. When it does you can switch to a regular, fragrance-free lotion.
Don't use lanolin or petroleum-based products, such as Vaseline, as these are too heavy and may clog the pores, causing breakouts on the tattoo. They also draw the ink from the tattoo to the surface of the skin, causing the tattoo to fade before it's even fully healed.
There are some excellent specialist products on the market that are a little pricey, but work wonders for healing tattoos. Once such product is called ""Tattoo Goo"" which is non-greasy and is made from natural ingredients. Another great product is ""H2Ocean"", which is a foam rather than an ointment, that uses a salt concentration to prevent infection.""After Inked” is also an excellent product as it's non-petroleum based and mainly uses grapeseed oil that is known to have more antioxidant value than vitamin E. This helps the healing process and has great moisturizing properties.

, You should continue to wash your tattoo with anti-bacterial soap and warm water until it is fully healed. This can take anywhere from 3 to 6 six weeks, depending on the size and location of the tattoo. You should wash the tattoo approximately three times a day, though you should wash more often if the tattoo is on your hand, wrist, foot, or any other area that is more exposed to germs.After applying special anti-bacterial ointment for the first 3 to 5 days, you can switch to regular lotion after each wash. Most tattoo artists will recommend that you avoid using lotions that are scented, colored or contain glitter. Remember only to apply a light layer of lotion, as over-moisturizing can negatively affect the tattoo.
The initial healing of the tattoo will take up to two weeks. During this time, you can expect the tattoo to start peeling or flaking, in a similar way to sunburn. Some colored skin may come away as the tattoo peels, but this is entirely normal.
After the skin peels, your tattoo will look glassy and feel tight. It may also have cloudy or white patches of skin that you will be tempted to peel off, but try to resist. This is referred to as ""onion skin"" and will fall off by itself within a couple of weeks.
If you have taken proper care of your new tattoo, you can expect your tattoo to be healed and your skin to have fully regenerated in about four to six weeks."

Do not scratch or pick at your tattoo.,
Avoid soaking the tattoo.,
Do not expose your new tattoo to direct sunlight.,
Avoid tight-fitting clothes.,
Avoid working out.,
Avoid swelling.",How to Care for a New Tattoo2," As it heals, your tattoo will begin to scab. This is normal, and the scabs should be allowed to dry out and fall off by themselves. Do not try to help the process along by picking at the scabs. This may cause the scabs to fall off prematurely, leaving holes or light spots on your tattoo.


If your hands or nails are unclean; you may also cause the tattoo to become infected. You should always wash your hands with anti-bacterial soap before touching your tattoo, and you should never allow anyone else to touch it while it heals.Dry, scabbing or peeling skin can become very itchy, but scratching at your tattoo may also cause scabs to fall off. You can relieve itching by slapping the tattoo with the flat of your hand, or by rubbing in a little lotion.Keep using moisturizing ointment to combat itchiness if it is a problem.

, Until your tattoo is fully healed, you should avoid swimming in a pool, in the sea, or even soaking in the bathtub. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, exposing your tattoo to too much water may draw ink out of your skin and damage the tattoos appearance. Secondly, the water in swimming pools, the sea, and the bathtub may be carrying dirt, bacteria, chemicals and other impurities that could cause your tattoo to become infected.It will be completely safe to resume these activities once your tattoo is healed, but for now you should stick to rinsing your tattoo in the sink or shower.
Keep your showers and baths short, under 5-6 minutes.

, Sunlight is the worst enemy of new tattoos. The harsh rays of the sun may cause your skin to blister and bleach some of the colors from your tattoo. For this reason, it is best to keep your tattoo covered and away from the sun for at least 3 to 4 weeks, until the initial healing is complete.After that, you will still need to protect your tattoo by wearing a minimum of SPF 30. This will prevent your tattoo from fading in the sun, keeping the colors true for longer.

, Avoid wearing tight or restrictive clothing on the area with your new tattoo, especially at first. As your tattoo heals, it will seep plasma and excess ink, which may cause the clothing to stick to the tattoo. The clothing will then be painful to remove and may rip off any freshly formed scabs.If your clothing does stick to your tattoo, do not pull! First wet the area with water, which should loosen the clothing to where it can be removed without damaging your tattoo.
In addition, tight clothing will prevent enough oxygen from getting to your tattoo, and oxygen is essential for the healing process.
Aim to wear clean, loose-fitting clothing, day, and night, while your tattoo is healing.

, Tattoos that cover large surface areas, or are near joints (such as elbows and knees), may take longer to heal if the skin is forced to move around too much during intense workouts or other physical activity. The movement will cause the skin to crack and become irritated, prolonging the tattoos healing process. For this reason, you should avoid unnecessary workouts for at least a few days after getting a new tattoo.If you're involved in a self-defense class like karate or kickboxing, you may want to warn your classmates so they can avoid hitting you in the wrong place.
If you work in a job that involves physical activity, such as construction or dance, you may want to consider having your new tattoo done on a Friday, so it will have the whole weekend to heal before your go back to work.

, Swelling may occur with new tattoos on your feet, ankles or calves, especially if you have been standing for long periods of time. If this happens, you can reduce swelling by taking an Ibuprofen, applying an ice pack to the swollen area, and elevating your feet and legs.

Design the tattoo.,
Pick out eyeliner.,
Draw the design on your skin with the eyeliner pencil.,
Spray the design with hairspray.,
Wash it off.",How to Make a Temporary Tattoo1," To make a great tattoo, put some thought into its design before you apply it to your skin. Use a regular pencil and paper to sketch out some ideas, keeping the following pointers in mind:


Your eyeliner tattoo will look best with bold, simple strokes. Finer lines and more complicated designs could be more likely to smudge and become unrecognizable. Stick with clear shapes.
Decide how large you want it to be. A bigger tattoo may be more likely to appear to be hand drawn, whereas a smaller tattoo may look more ""authentic."" Design your tattoo according to the effect you want to achieve.;
, Go to the drugstore and buy a simple eyeliner pencil, the type that needs to be sharpened. Pick one that isn't meant to be shiny or oily; a pencil that makes smooth, dry marks will make a longer-lasting smudge-free tattoo.


Jet black eyeliner makes for a striking temporary tattoo, but there's no reason not to choose more than one color. Try emerald, purple, and sapphire to create your design or add a small accent.
Avoid liquid eyeliner. It's more difficult to keep this type of eyeliner in place on parts of your body other than your eyelids.
Practice drawing your design with your chosen eyeliner pencils on paper. Get used to the pressure you need to exert to create smooth strokes.

, Take your time and make sure the design is applied exactly how you want it to look. If you don't like it, you can wash it off and start over.

You can draw your tattoo on any part of your body, but areas without a lot of hair might be easier to work with. Make sure the skin is clean and dry when you draw your design.
Use a cotton swab to blend colors and create shading.

, The same chemicals that help hold your hair in place act as a sealant for the tattoo to keep it from coming off for a few hours. There's no need to completely soak it; just give the area a light application. You can also use a clear nail polish/topcoat instead of hairspray. The clear nail polish/topcoat can be matte or glossy; it is up to you.

, This tattoo will last about a day before it begins to smudge. It washes off easily with warm, soapy water. You may want to remove it before going to bed to avoid getting eyeliner on your sheets. If you're using clear nail polish instead of hairspray, you can peel it off or remove it with nail polish remover.

Make a stencil.,
Buy permanent markers.,
Apply the tattoo.,
Remove the tattoo.",How to Make a Temporary Tattoo2," You can create professional-looking temporary tattoos by making a stencil, which helps you control the tattoo design rather than relying on your drawing skills to do the job. Decide what shape you want your tattoo to be, draw it on an index card, and cut out the shape using a cutting knife or a pair of small scissors.
/images/thumb/e/e8/Make-a-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-6-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e8/Make-a-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-6-Version-4.jpg









Simple, bold shapes are the easiest ones to create with this method. Try diamonds, circles, and other geometric shapes.
For a more detailed tattoo, you can create a stencil based on an existing image. Check out How to Make a Graffiti Stencil for more information on this method.

, Choose one or more marker colors to use with your stencil. Black is a classic option, and may be the most likely to help your tattoo pass as a real one. Using another color can be just as fun.


Permanent markers contain chemicals that aren't meant to be used on skin. Look for markers that are labeled as safe for this type of use.
If you'd rather not use permanent markers, washable markers are also fine. The tattoo just won't last quite as long.
Another good ink choice is stamping ink, which comes on wet stamping pads. To use this type of ink for your tattoo, press a cotton ball onto the ink pad and use it to wipe the ink over the stencil and onto your skin.

, Place the stencil against the part of your body where you want the tattoo to be. Use one hand to hold it firmly against the skin, so that the cut out shapes are lying flat. Use the other hand to color in the shapes with the markers you chose. When you're finished, lift the stencil away and allow the marker ink to dry.
/images/thumb/8/8a/Make-a-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-8-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-8-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/8/8a/Make-a-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-8-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-8-Version-4.jpg









Make sure you apply the tattoo to clean, dry skin. Shave the hair in the area for a more even application.
If you have trouble holding the stencil in place, try using tape to affix it to the area. You could also try applying the tattoo to a part of your body with a flatter surface.

, When you're finished sporting your temporary tattoo, it can be washed off with warm, soapy water, or you dab a cotton pad in oil and 'scrub' your tattoo off.

Buy water slide paper.,
Design the tattoo.,
Print the tattoo.,
Apply the tattoo.,
Remove the tattoo.",How to Make a Temporary Tattoo3," Have you ever bought a temporary tattoo from a quarter machine or the toy store? These temporary tattoos are printed onto water slide paper, a special paper lined with adhesive on one side. The tattoo design is printed with ink on the adhesive.


Water slide paper is available online or in craft stores.

, The sky is the limit when you're using water slide paper; any shape, color or pattern will print beautifully onto the paper and show up clearly on your skin. Use Photoshop or a similar computer program meant for creating images to come up with a tattoo design.


Decide whether you want the tattoo to be in black and white or color. If you have a color printer, your design can include as many colors as you want.
Choose colors that will show up well against your skin.
Keep in mind that when you apply the tattoo, the image will be reversed on your skin. That means that if your tattoo includes a word, it needs to be reversed in the design, or it will read backwards once you put it on.

, Feed the water slide paper into the paper handler in your printer. Make sure the paper is placed correctly so that the image will be printed onto the adhesive, not the matte paper. Cut out the tattoo with a pair of scissors when you're finished.

, Place the tattoo ink-side down on your skin. Cover it with a damp cloth or paper towel. Press down on the cloth or paper towel and hold it in place for 30 seconds. Remove the cloth or paper towel and peel back the paper. The dampening process causes the adhesive to ""slide"" from the paper to your skin.

Ask your partner the significance of the tattoo.,
Find out what motivated them to get a tattoo.,
Listen to your partner.,
Accept that they may not have a ""good"" reason.",How to Cope With Your Partner's Tattoo You Dislike1," Many people get tattoos that have some form of significance or symbolic meaning. Ask your partner what their tattoo represents. This may help you understand the tattoo better and come to terms with it.For example, a tattoo of a name, initials, or a date may symbolize the death of a family member or close friend.
Alternatively, the tattoo could symbolize a hobby or passion. For example, of a tree may symbolize a passion for the outdoors.
Some tattoos are also meant as a form of motivation. For instance, they provide something to look at on a bad day to give inspiration.;
, Certain events, such as a major birthday, a new job, the completion of a degree, or the birth of a child, could motivate an individual to get a tattoo. In these cases the tattoo is meant to commemorate or celebrate a certain occasion. You may be more inclined to accept the tattoo despite the fact that you don’t like it, if you realize that a major event motivated your partner to get the tattoo.

, When your partner is explaining the origins of their tattoo, it is important that you actively listen to them. This will demonstrate that you care about what they are saying and are interested in learning about their tattoo. This will also help you and your partner have a constructive conversation about the tattoo, rather than just getting into an argument.Lean in to the conversation, make eye contact, and nod occasionally to demonstrate that you are listening.
Ask follow up questions to show that you are engaged in the conversation.

, Your partner may not have a ""good"" reason (in your opinion) for getting a tattoo, but they may feel as though their reason for getting the tattoo was a good one. Even after they have explained the tattoo, you may continue to disagree with the decision. Try and accept the fact that maybe your partner just wanted a tattoo and likes the concept of body art. It is important to respect your partner’s decisions about how they want their body to look.


Remember that a tattoo may change your partner’s appearance slightly, but it will not change the bond that you share with your partner.

"
"
Avoid making any rash decisions.,
Slow down.,
Consider where you want the tattoo.,
Spend some time refining the design and choosing one that has meaning for you.,
Draw your own representation of the design that you've come up with.,
Find a tattoo artist or designer and ask them to make a custom design for you.,
Try to get a printout of the final design.,
Try a rehearsal run of the tattoo.,
Think before you ink.",How to Choose a Tattoo Design1," The bad body art comes from making spontaneous decisions to go and have a tattoo done on a spur of the moment. If you're getting a tattoo because you're drunk or high, rebellious or your friends are goading you, then you're getting a tattoo for all the wrong reasons and the choice you make is likely to reflect this lack of forethought. Things you will regret include:


Any tattoo that looks like genitalia. Think about that, very carefully but not too long because the answer is simple: Just don't do it.
Anything misspelled (mostly because you were too drunk or high to notice till later).
Anything to do with high school or college (you do realize that it's over soon enough, right?)
Anything that mars your wedding dress, upstages your honeymoon, or gives your children an odd impression of you...
Anything written in a language you're not fluent in. Those Chinese characters might look sexy until a native Chinese speaker tells you what it really means is ""object for sale"", ""I like mold for breakfast"" or ""horny goat""
Anything with the current crush's name on. It might feel like the two of you will last forever but if the tattoo has more chances of success in lasting the distance than the pair of you, this is plain dumb. The number one tattoos that artists are asked to cover up, after homemade tattoos, are names. If the person is not dead, or your child, names are usually not the best idea.
Anything faddish right now. A band, TV show, cartoon or comic book character you love today may not be something you want to carry around forever on your skin. It could date you more than your botoxed skin will ever give away...;
, You have your whole life to look at this tattoo, so some good reflection before getting it makes absolute good sense. Most of all, will you be happy with this design in 5 to 10 years time? Think well forward, too. Is your tattoo going to look good even when you're old and wrinkled? Chances are, a tribal dragon, Disney character or Hello Kitty won't.


Think about how big of an impact the design has on you. If you've fallen in and out of like with other designs like this before, then wait a few years before you decide to get it.
On the other hand, if a design you're thinking about is something that represents or has given you hope in a rough time in your life, perhaps helped you find out who you are, or something along those lines, then it might be the right choice, as that monumental self-change is going to guide much of the who you become for the rest of your life.

, This will have some influence on the design, especially if it's an intimate design. For any parts of your body that you show regularly (and that is a lot of body if you're a bikini or board shorts wearer), then that doesn't leave much space for intimate tattoos that you don't want your grandmother seeing.


Consider how likely it will be that you will need to cover the body area where your tattoo is to go with clothing, or otherwise, at some point. For example, if you're a female, will you feel comfortable wearing evening wear such as backless or strapless dresses if you have a back tattoo?
Think about future career options. Is a tattoo likely to be an issue or even a liability if it's showing with the expected work clothing or uniform? This may well depend on what industry you intend to work in but remember that with increased fluidity, people are changing careers constantly, so you may not ever be able to be sure what you'll do down the track. Keep this in mind when choosing placement of a tattoo.

, Do some research first. Head over to the library or a reputable tattoo parlor and look through tattoo design books. What sorts of designs are current, what seem to be timeless and what ones would you ever get in a million years? Some things to bear in mind include:


Stay away from the art (known as ""flash"") shown in the studios, except as inspiration. It is better to go with a unique and original design than a mass market design - ""flash"" is designed by excellent artists then sold to tattoo artists around the country and around the world.
Are there any particular artists whose style really impresses you? What about their work has such resonance for you and is likely to be classic over the years to come?
Writing, in any form or language, should be thought over twice as long. Check and recheck the meanings of any words or ideograms of a language you aren't fluent in. Choose quotes carefully. If using writing, also be sure to search for a font you like, or create your own.

, Even if you cannot draw, a little practice and patience can get you a good outline, at least. Or, you can use drawing tools on your computer and some Photoshop magic to help out. Don't be overly bothered about your lack of drawing skills, as most tattoo artists will help you redraw and redesign a tattoo to a desired standard. This is a prompt and a guidance tool, to get your tattoo artist on the same wavelength as you.

, Many tattoo artists are also conventional artists, or can at least reproduce a traditional drawing, sketch or painting onto your skin.


Most artists will do what you want, but also excel in certain ""looks."" Check their specific portfolios, and compare the different styles: old school, new school, naturalistic, Asian, black and white, etc. If you don't know what style it is you're looking at, ask. Better to know with a giggle, than to be laughed at later with a design that won't come off.

, Doing this will help you to see how the design will fit against your skin. Look at it against the mirror during daylight and night lights, so that you can get an impression of how it might vary during different times of the day.


Pin the design up on your mirror and look at it daily for a few days. Is it growing on you or do you have a nagging feeling that it's either not the right design or that it's close but not quite there yet? Follow your instincts; there is still plenty of time before it's tattooed into place.

, Use henna to get a temporary version of the design. You won't be able to see different colors, or certain looks, but you will be able to judge the feeling of a tattoo. Henna lasts a week to a month. During this time, use the opportunity to see how it looks with your usual clothing and how you feel about it as you go about your usual, daily activities.


If even a henna tattoo is out of your price range, try the Sharpie option. Crude but still effective for knowing how it makes you feel to have a bold design inked onto a part of your body.

, Think about it a lot. When you are certain, wait some more just to make sure. Ultimately, a well chosen tattoo design can be a thing of beauty and a confidence enhancement. A poorly chosen one done on a whim can leave you unhappy for all time. Which outcome will you choose?

Explain your apprehension before they get a tattoo.,
Share your feelings after the fact.,
Use a calm and gentle tone.,
Ask your partner to include you next time.",How to Cope With Your Partner's Tattoo You Dislike2," If your partner has been thinking about getting a tattoo for a while, you should explain why you don't like tattoos before they actually get one. For instance, maybe tattoos are a trigger for you and bring back unpleasant memories and experiences. Or maybe you find tattoos unprofessional and unattractive. Once you explain why you don't like tattoos, your partner may decide not to get one.Remember that your partner has the right to control the appearance of their own body. Avoid using your apprehension about tattoos as a way to manipulate your partner into not getting a tattoo. You can share your apprehension, but try to be respectful of your partner’s wishes.

, If your partner comes home with a surprise tattoo without any warning, you should still vocalize your feelings. However, be sure to be respectful and keep in mind that your partner has the right to do what they want to do with their body. For example, you could say ""I wish you would have told me you wanted to get a tattoo; that way we could have talked about it in advance and come to a compromise."" This will allow you to get your feelings off your chest and you and your partner can come to an understanding.If your partner got a surprise tattoo of your name or image, it was likely intended as a nice gesture. You should not be overly critical because they are trying to demonstrate their commitment and feelings towards your relationship.

, When you are talking with your partner about their new tattoo, do not shout or use an aggressive tone. Instead, you should approach the conversation in a calm and gentle manner. This way you are not attacking your partner, but instead trying to come to an understanding. Take a deep breath before speaking.You could also try taking some time to cool down before approaching your partner about their new tattoo.

, Perhaps you are upset because your partner did not tell you about the tattoo in advance. As a result, you feel as though your partner does not value your opinion. Explain to your partner that you feel overlooked and disrespected. If your partner understands that your negative response is coming from a place of hurt, they may be able to understand your position better and will include you the next time they decide to make a major change to their appearance."
"
Realize this is not your decision.,
Determine if the tattoo is a deal breaker for you.,
Look for something positive about the tattoo.",How to Cope With Your Partner's Tattoo You Dislike3," Once you and your partner have talked openly and honestly about the tattoo, you need to respect that this is not your body and therefore not your decision. You may not like the tattoo, but if you want to remain in a relationship with your partner, then it is a good idea to accept the fact that you have no control over what your partner puts on their body.You can always offer your opinion, but the ultimate decision is up to your partner about whether or not to get a tattoo.

, You may decide that you dislike tattoos so much that you can no longer be in a relationship with your partner. In some instances, the best way for you to cope is to leave the relationship. For example, if your partner got a tattoo that you found offensive, you may decide that you cannot be in a relationship with that person anymore. Try asking yourself some questions to determine your feelings for this person:


“What was it that initially attracted me to my partner? Is that attraction still there, or has it changed now because of the tattoo? Why?”
“What is the true root cause of my concerns with the tattoo?”
“What emotions am I feeling that are associated with the tattoo? Why am I feeling these emotions? Are the emotions actually attached to the tattoo, or the fact that my partner made the decision without talking to me?”
“Is the root cause of my emotions/concerns something that I can control or manage through healthy coping skills? Is it something that may need to be address with a counseling professional? Or is this something I am able to resolve on my own?”

, You may be able to cope best with the tattoo if you are able to find something you like about it. For instance, maybe it is small and not that noticeable so you can learn to live with it. Or maybe the tattoo is in a non-visible location and is predominantly hidden by clothes. Try and find something positive about the tattoo to help you cope.


As time goes on you will likely get used to the tattoo.

Tribal tattoos originated in areas such as Hawaii and Samoa. Their characteristics include heavy black lines and shading of geometric designs. The great thing about tribal tattoos is the variety of creativity that a tattoo artist can use. In fact, any basic design can easily be given a tribal touch by a skilled tattoo artist by working freehand alone. With the flexibility of this design, anyone can easily come up with a unique tribal tattoo design.

, Celtic designs are an incredibly popular choice today for those looking to get tattooed. A general rule of thumb is: the shape of the design often determines the ""meaning"" of a knotwork design. Circles represent unity or eternity, spirals reincarnation or cycles of life and rebirth, triangles and trefoils the threefold dominion of earth, sea, and sky. Squares or four-fold shapes are shield knots, symbols of protection from spirits or evil influences. Interlaced animals and men usually represent relationships, or emphasize the interdependence of mankind and nature.


There are actually very few records of the Celts themselves, and most symbols are interpreted by archaeologists and other scholars who have studied the symbols in context. Some ancient Celtic symbols have changed in meaning over time, having been influenced by the introduction of the Church and the influence of other cultures. Be sure to seek advice from the tattoo artist when deciding on which design would best suit your personality.

, Cross designs are one of the oldest types of designs, and are still an incredibly popular choice for those who are looking to get tattooed. There are 4 basic cross designs that are very popular.


Celtic Cross
Iron Cross
Gothic Cross
Christian Cross
There are some people that just love a well done cross tattoo just for the sake of how beautiful it is. If it is done well, and the ridges and curves are very smooth and detailed, it will have an amazing result. It can almost have a three dimensional effect when you look at it from the sides.

, Butterfly tattoos are still an incredibly popular choice for those looking to get tattooed. They can be done in many ways. They can be done in a big way, with bold colors and details, or they can be done with a more subtle approach. They can be done to match the actual realistic look of a butterfly, or you can be very creative with your rendition. You can also combine them with other designs and themes. Before you have a huge butterfly tattooed on your body, please consider the following. The basic symbolism of the butterfly involves grace, beauty, spirituality, transition, so be sure to have your tattoo made delicately and carefully.

, Dragon tattoos are one of the most sought after tattoo designs today! In Japan, dragons are an important part of the Japanese mythology. In Japan, they are water gods; therefore, that is why they are generally portrayed with clouds. Japanese dragon tattoos symbolize power, protection of home and family and longevity. In China, the dragon has a stronger, more masculine depiction of the Dragon. There, they represent strength, intelligence, luck, health, and harmony. They commonly protect life, fortune, and fertility. They generally have a snake-like appearance, and scales all over their body. They are also said to possess supernatural powers. The Tribal variation of the Dragon tattoo is also impressive. They are dragons that are designed with the strengths of the Tribal Tattoo style, such as the bold, black colors. The meaning of the Tribal Tattoo will depend more on how you decide to combine it with Tribal styles.

, Angel tattoos are another type of tattoo with multiple types and meanings. Generally, when women get an angel tattoo, this symbolizes calmness and serenity. When men get them, it usually symbolizes more of a connection to their spirituality and inner self. Some angel designs are designed to make the wearer safe and protected. Of course, there are some darker designs that can also represent a person's darker side. There are Cherub designs, which symbolize hope and optimism, relating to love. Generally speaking, the symbol of an angel represents a representative from God, and the spiritual and emotional support he gives us.

, Arm tattoos are also very common, and can be done in many ways. This is probably the most common place on the body to tattoo. They are common in both Eastern and Western cultures. This spot on the body is very visible, so you want to ensure that you get a design that is important to you. There are just so many choices in this area, upper arm tattoo, forearm tattoo, shoulder tattoo, sleeve tattoos, wrist tattoos, the list can go on and on. Full sleeve tattoos are probably the boldest choice. Tattoo sleeves seem to be preferred by men although many women also seem to be getting them. It should be noted that full sleeve tattoos take a very long time to complete and usually require more than one session. Now that being said, it also takes great deal of commitment and money to create quality sleeve tattoos.

, Skull tats have been a huge choice for many decades, and are still extremely popular. From fun and jovial, to scary and creepy, this tattoo can be expressed in hundreds or ways. The symbol of the skull is known all over the world as a sign of death. People generally assume that the Skull Tat is a representation of death or other negative images. It also symbolizes power, strength, and the ability to overcome a difficult time in life, and the ability to avoid death. Historically, the skull has also been seen as a triumph over an enemy.


You can see many different styles of skulls based on the creative imagination of the person creating them. They can be seen in many places, video games, comic strips, books, and of course tattoos.

The mehendi is now ready to be filled in a cone or bottle., Cut your chosen material (see Things You'll Need below) into a rectangular shape.

Mylar wrap and cellophane wrap make beautiful cones. If you are using Mylar tissue, keep your hands well moisturized, as you cannot roll tissue Mylar if the humidity is low and your hands are dry, as too much static electricity makes the tissue unmanageable.

,,,,, Do not fill it up to the very top., Now the mehndi or henna cone is ready., A cone is one of the best tools for the professional henna artist. Cones allow you to make fine lines. You can hold a cone by nestling it between your thumb, palm and first finger.

Moroccan and Yemeni hennas are know for their stringiness. Many people say African henna is warm red, Persian henna is deeper red, and Indian henna is brownish red. These slight color variations are not set in stone, and are usually not even noticeable. Usually color variations depend on the body's chemistry not on the kind of henna used.

, India exports the most henna, with a variety of brands from different regions in India. Other countries, like Oman, don't export at all. If you travel, or have a globe trotting friend, get some henna sent back to your home.

Parts of your body like your thighs, arm, hand, or feet may be easier to freehand on.
You can also use henna to create a longer lasting temporary tattoo.
There are also pens created specifically to make temporary tattoos., Also called a tattoo stencil, tattoo transfer paper is what professional tattoo artists use to create the image on a person's skin before permanently dying it with their tattoo gun. Print out your image on thermographic transfer paper that you can buy online. Apply a stick deodorant and a little water to the location where you're going to stick the tattoo before applying the transfer paper to the area and pressing down. Hold the transfer paper for 1 to 2 minutes before peeling it back to reveal your temporary tattoo./images/thumb/d/db/Draw-Your-Own-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-13.jpg/v4-550px-Draw-Your-Own-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-13.jpg

Do not shift the paper while you are holding it down or you may need to start over.

, Whether you use transfer paper or draw the tattoo directly on your skin, you can apply a liquid bandage over the image to make it last longer. Use the brush that's provided with the bandage and apply a healthy layer over your tattoo. Let the bandage dry for two to five minutes before touching your tattoo. This will seal the ink of the tattoo and make it resistant to water./images/thumb/5/5c/Draw-Your-Own-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-14.jpg/v4-550px-Draw-Your-Own-Temporary-Tattoo-Step-14.jpg

You can purchase liquid bandages in the bandage section of your pharmacy or grocery store.
Remove your liquid bandage by scrubbing the site with soap and water. If it's still not coming off, scrub the area with baby oil, acetone, or castor oil."

Don't touch the design directly after it's applied.,
Leave the henna paste on your skin for as long as possible.,
Use sugar and lemon juice.,
Try to keep your skin warm and moist.,
Wrap up the design.,
Wash off any dry henna flakes.,
Scrape off the dry henna paste after 6-24 hours.,
Keep the henna area away from soap and water for 24 hours.,
Watch the color deepen.,
Expect your henna design to last for 1-3 weeks.,
Moisturize.,
Try not to rub off the design.,
Clean your skin with a gentle soap.",How to Care for a Henna Design," Henna paste is moist when applied. After application, you need to keep that body part away from any obstructions—clothing, hair, environmental factors—so that it doesn't smear the design. The paste usually dries within 5-10 minutes, but err on the side of caution. It will take approximately half an hour before the henna paste is dry enough that you don't have to worry about smudging it., The longer the paste stays on the skin, the darker the stain will be. Let the paste dry on your skin for at least 6 hours, and consider leaving it on overnight. Don't wash it off; don't rub it off; don't accidentally brush it against anything. , Once the henna paste starts to dry, coat it with a mixture of sugar and lemon juice. Leave it to soak in for a few hours, or even overnight. This will keep the paste moist for longer, making the resulting stain even darker. Fill a small bowl with lemon juice, then mix with sugar until the solution is sticky and syrupy. Use a cotton ball to blot the sugar-lemon-juice onto the dry henna.The lemon sugar helps moisturize the henna. It also serves to seal the henna and protect the design. The acidity of the lemon can also help highlight the color of the henna.
Be careful not to oversaturate the henna; you just want it very slightly damp. If you use too much moisture, the dye may smear and drip – especially at first.
If you leave the sugar-and-lemon-juice solution on your skin overnight, it's important to wrap or otherwise protect your skin from rubbing and smearing.

, The warmer the body temperature, the faster the henna will stain. If you are cold, try drinking something hot before you start. Gently steaming the paste-coated area also helps impart warmth and moisture.

, The henna paste will flake and crumble as it dries, so consider covering up the inked area to keep the crumbs from spilling everywhere. Wrapping also helps make the stain darker by conserving heat and moisture. You can wrap the area with an elastic bandage, paper medical tape or toilet paper. Try covering the wrap with a sock to make it more secure.


Try laying a piece of toilet paper over the design, then wrapping the area with an elastic bandage. If you want to use plastic wrap, be sure to wrap with toilet paper first to soak up any perspiration and to prevent smudges.
Know that henna stains textiles like clothing, sheets, and towels. If you leave the paste on overnight, wrapping may protect your sheets.
Some claim that wrapping is the only way to care for a henna design, but others say that you only need to wrap your ink if you've gotten extensive work done.

, Use room-temperature water and mild soap. Dab the stain with a gentle cloth. If you rub the design at this early stage, it might begin to fade more quickly.

, Use any clean, dull scraping tool: a toothpick, a fingernail, a file, or the blunt side of a knife. Rinse your skin with room-temperature water once you've cleared most of the henna paste. Avoid using soap on the fresh henna.When your skin is clean, pat it dry. Then, gently moisturize the design with oil or lotion.

, Try not to get the area wet for at least 6-12 hours after paste removal, although the effect will be even stronger if you wait a full 24 hours. Water can interrupt the oxidization and darkening processes of your henna stain., Once you've exposed your skin and cleaned off the dried henna paste, you'll be able to watch the ink mature into its fullest form. Your design should begin in a shade of orange ranging from bright neon to the color of a pumpkin. Over the next 48 hours, the stain will deepen into a rich, red-brown color. The markings will end up somewhere between orange-brown, maroon, and chocolate brown. Your design will be at its darkest within a day or two of its application.The final color hinges on your skin type and your body chemistry. The ink usually looks darker on hands and feet.

, The duration is highly dependent upon how well you care for your skin. If you keep the stain moisturized and keep it from rubbing off on things, it may last three weeks or even longer. If you don't care for the henna at all, it may begin to fade or peel within the first week.The longevity of the henna stain also depends where the design is located on your body. The ink tends to show up darker on your hands and feet, but those areas also tend to exchange the most friction as you interact with your environment.

, Apply a coat of a natural oil, butter, or lotion after the paste is removed. While the henna is on your skin, moisturize regularly to protect the design and prevent exfoliation. Many store-bought moisturizers contain chemicals that can prematurely lighten the stain, so it's best to use something natural.


Do not use moisturizers that contain bleaching agents and/or fruit acids (Alpha-Hydroxy Acid). These chemicals tend to strip your skin of moisture and nutrients, and they can make the henna fade prematurely.Spread a coat of essential oils over the design. Oils will keep your skin moist, which may prevent the henna from fading or flaking prematurely. Try using wax lip balm, coconut oil, or olive oil. Look for specialized henna-care oils.

, Exfoliation can fade the henna. Rough washing and friction from clothes can also lead the stain to disappear more quickly. The less you touch the area, the better. If you have a henna design on your hand, consider wearing gloves when you wash dishes.

, Apply with your hand or a soft towel. If possible, rub soap around the edge of the henna design, but not into the stain itself. Avoid using acetone (found in nail-polish remover) and hand sanitizers. These relatively powerful chemicals strip your skin and make the henna stains fade more quickly.

Find a sticker the shape of the tattoo you want.,
Clean and thoroughly dry the spot where you're putting the sticker.,
Place the sticker on your skin.,
Leave the sticker on as long as possible when you're in the sun or in a tanning bed.,
Remove the sticker.",How to Get a Tan Tattoo1," Look for die cut stickers because they have a unique shape. This is important because you want your tattoo to take the shape of the sticker. Some common tan tattoo stickers include a heart, star, cross, a pair of lips and anything distinct enough to leave a recognizable shape.


You also can make your own die cut stickers. Buy some sticker paper. Draw the shape you want on the paper, or use a stencil if you can’t draw. Then cut it out.If you have an at-home die cut machine like a Cricket, you can use that to make your own stickers as well. Follow the instructions for the machine.;
, You want the area where you’re putting the sticker to be clean and dry so that the sticker adheres to the skin and lays flat. Remember that the sticker has to remain on the skin long enough for you to tan, so you want it to adhere to the skin well because it may be there for a while. You don’t want it falling off., Peel the backing off the back of the sticker. Orientate the sticker the way you want it. Whichever way you apply the sticker is how the tattoo will appear on your skin. Once you have it the way you want it, place the sticker on the skin with the sticky side down. Then, rub your finger over it, pressing firmly to smooth out bubbles.

, The sun will darken all of your exposed skin except the area underneath the sticker. All of the other areas around it will get darker. So,this how your tattoo will form. The tattoo will be your naked skin beneath the sticker.


A safer alternative is to use self tanner since you get to avoid UV rays, which can lead to skin cancer and pre-mature wrinkling. Simply apply it over and around the sticker, making sure to cover any skin that isn't covered by the sticker., After the sticker has been on long enough for you to get a tan or darken the area around the sticker, you can remove it. If you are using the natural sunlight to get a tan, then you’ll need to stay in the sun long enough to darken your skin. Everyone tans a little differently, so the length of time will vary for everyone.


If you have a darker skin tone, it may take a little longer since your darker skin provides more protection from the skin.If you’re using self tanner, follow the application instructions on the bottle to determine how long to let the formula sit. You may need to leave the sticker on for a while after washing off the self tanner, but it will depend on the brand of self tanner that you’re using. Once you have removed the sticker, your natural skin tone will appear in the shape of the sticker you applied."
"
Start with clean, dry skin.,
Pick out your tattoo.,
Peel off the clear backing.,
Place the image face side down on your skin.,
Press a damp cloth or sponge over the tattoo paper.,
Hold for at least 60 seconds.,
Gently peel off the paper.,
Wait for the tattoo to dry.,
Dab on a bit of water-based lotion.",How to Apply a Temporary Tattoo1," Temporary tattoos are made with water-based ink, which means that they’re repelled by skin’s natural oils. Carefully clean the area you want to decorate with soap and water, and pat it dry with a paper towel.If you’re very sweaty, rubbing alcohol can help cut the grease. Pour a little onto a cotton ball, and then wipe it on the area. Don’t do this every day, though--you could dry out your skin.;
, Some temporary tattoos come individually packaged, which is easy. However, if the temporary tattoo you want to wear came on a sheet with several others, you’ll need to separate it. Cut around it with sharp scissors, being careful not to clip the design itself, until you’ve separated it from the “flash sheet.”, At this point, your tattoo is protected by a thin layer of clear plastic. Carefully pick this off. You should be able to see the brightly-colored, mirror-image version of the tattoo you’re planning to apply to your skin.








From now on, the side with the ink, that was protected by clear plastic, will be called the face side.

, Confirm that you want to apply the tattoo to the spot you just cleaned, then place the face side against your skin. Don’t wiggle it around. Just hold it firmly in place while you move on to the next step., Take a piece of fabric or a sponge that is neither bone dry nor soaking wet, and push it firmly against the backing of your tattoo. Hold it in place, and don’t let it slip around, even if it wants to.







, To get the most complete image, you’ll need a bit of patience. Don’t even think about removing the cloth or the paper backing from your arm until a full minute has passed. While you’re sitting, try to move as little as possible., Start by lifting a single corner of the backing in order to peek at the tattoo. If the image looks weird, or isn't sticking to your skin, put the cloth or sponge back on and wait for another 30 seconds. If it does look good, then continue to slowly peel off the paper.







, Keep being patient for around ten minutes. Resist the urge to poke your temporary tattoo. It’s best to sit reasonably still and not flex too much, to avoid wrinkling or smearing the tattoo, as well., To make your tattoo last even longer, hydrate your skin by gently patting a bit of thin cream or lotion on top. Avoid thick, oil-based moisturizers, like petroleum jelly, which may smear the tattoo. If you want, you can dust baby powder over the top of the tattoo as well, to make it look more matte (and thus more realistic.)

Choose a shape or design for your tattoo.,
Apply the sunblock on your skin in the shape that you want.,
Leave the area undisturbed.,
Reapply as often and as accurately as possible.",How to Get a Tan Tattoo2," Make sure that it is a design you can make with a cream substance such as sunblock. You can either draw the design directly on the skin or use a stencil. If you don’t have a stencil of the shape that you like, you can always make one. Simply draw it on a sheet of paper and then use an X-acto knife or another kind of blade to cut out the inside of the shape., Do this before going out in the sun or lying in a tanning bed because you want it to be as pale as possible so it shows up well. If you’re feeling crafty, you can use a brush to apply the sunblock, but your fingers should work just fine. Whichever method you choose, make sure that the application of sunblock is fairly thick like a paste so that the sun can’t shine through it.You’ll probably want to apply a sunblock with a high spf of 30 or above if it takes you a while to tan. You won't have to reapply it as often., Then, go out in the sun or lay in the tanning bed for however long is necessary for you to tan. Remember not to smear the sunblock. If the sunblock gets smeared, your tattoo might be ruined because the shape might change. Don't stress if it does smear. Just work quickly to fix it.

, Since your skin is like a sponge, it will slowly start to absorb the sunblock, and over time the sunblock will probably shift around. So, you’ll need to reapply it or touch it up until you are tan.


Be careful to reapply neatly so you don’t mess up your design. Once you’ve set out in the sun long enough to tan, remove the sunblock."

Cut the negative of a black and white film that you like.,
Tape the film negative to your skin with clear tape.Try not to cover the photo section of the negative.,
Sit out in the sun to tan as you normally would.",How to Get a Tan Tattoo3," Only cut out the darkened section where the image appears. After you do that, you should have a rectangle. This will be your template or stencil for your tattoo. You’ll use it in a similar way to how you use the sticker in the”sticker method,” but instead of having a shape as your tattoo, you will have an image., You don’t want to cover that section of the negative because the image might not transfer properly. The properties of the film is what makes the image transfer.If you cover it with tape, it may not work as well or at all. Put just enough clear tape on the edges of the negative to hold it on your skin.

, Make sure you sit in a sunny spot so that the sun hits the negative. Let the UV rays penetrate through the negative. When you pull it off, you'll have the photograph imprinted on your skin."
"
Wash and dry the area where the tattoo will go.,
Paint a design onto the skin with nail polish.,
Let the nail polish dry before heading out into the sunshine.,
Go tan in the sun.",How to Get a Tan Tattoo4," This method is similar to the “sticker method” in that the tattoo application area should be clean. They are similar in that you need the skin to be clean and dry to get the sticker and the polish to adhere to the skin. Dry the area well before moving on to the next step.

, You can use a stencil if you need to, or you can make one with a sheet of paper as mentioned above in the “sticker method.” Make sure your design is neat when you apply it. Remember your tattoo will take the exact shape of the nail polish, so be exact.


Don’t use a clear polish because the light will still shine through, but beware of using a polish so dark that it stains your skin. Try using an opaque shade that doesn’t stain your nails. Hopefully, it won’t stain your skin either., You don’t want the sunlight shining through the polish and tanning the area designated for your tan tattoo. Hang out inside for a bit while the polish dries.

, While you are waiting for your tan tattoo to appear, go relax in the sun. Read a magazine. Sit by the pool, or sleep for 20 minutes. Don’t touch the nail polish in case it is tacky; it will smear and mess up your design. Peel the nail polish off after tanning, and your simple tattoo design will appear. "

Gather your materials.,
Cut off a piece of wire using your pliers.,
Add beads.,
Use the pliers to bend the ends of the wire backwards.",How to Make a Fake Septum Piercing1," Wires are commonly used to make fake septum piercings.

, You'll trim it down later but to start with go for wire that's 2 to 3 inches in length. Fold your wire around a pencil. This will create the curve you need for a septum piercing. Then, take the pliers and trim down the wire until both sides are roughly the same length. Make a swift, strong cuts with your pliers. You need to make a clean cut for the septum to be safe for use.







, Many septum piercings are decorated with beads. If you want yours to look more elaborate or realistic, consider adding small beads to your fake piercing.








You can buy tiny beads at most craft stores. Pick a color and design you like.
If you want to add beads, pause before creating small loops on either side of your fake piercing. Slide the beads in place and then use your pliers to curve both ends of the piercing.

, You want to sharp edges of the wire to fold out away from the curve. Create two small loops on either side of your fake piercing. This assures that your piercing will not poke or irritate your inner nose when you put it in place.









Then, use your fingers to bend and fold the wire as needed to create a smooth semi-circle that fits your nose. It may take quite a bit of manipulation with your fingers before the wire forms an even semi-circle, so don't get discouraged if it's taking you awhile."

Start with clean skin.,
Select a stencil.,
Paint over the stencil with body-safe glue.,
Apply glitter with a fresh paintbrush.,
Peel off the stencil.,
Dust off extra glitter.",How to Apply a Temporary Tattoo2," The process for applying glitter tattoos is a bit different than transfer or paper-backed tattoos, but they still need clean skin to adhere to. Wash down the area you want to tattoo with warm, soapy water, then pat it dry with a paper towel., Not just any stencil will do! It’s best to get a stencil specially intended for glitter tattoos. These have an adhesive back that won’t hurt your skin too much as you peel it off. They can be found in glitter tattoo kits, or sold separately at party, big-box, or beauty supply stores.Apply the stencil of your choice wherever you want the glitter tattoo to be.


Make sure not to stick the stencil to a hairy place, or it’ll hurt to peel off.

, If you’ve purchased a glitter tattoo kit, it should come with a special body adhesive intended for skin; if not, you can purchase this separately. Apply a thin layer of the adhesive with a paintbrush so that it covers the skin left bare by the stencil. Then, wait for it to dry until it’s almost clear.







, Now comes the fun part--getting the glitter on there! Dip a paintbrush in body-safe glitter (any cosmetic-grade glitter is fine) and dab it onto the skin inside the stencil. Have fun and experiment by blending and mixing glitters.







, Once you’re comfortable with the amount of glitter you’ve used, take a corner of the stencil and peel it off the skin. Go slowly, so that you don’t disturb your fresh glitter tattoo too much.







, Once you’ve peeled off the stencil, you might notice a bit of fallout from the glitter. If that’s the case, use a large fluffy brush (a blush brush is perfect) to banish any wayward glitter flecks. It’s probably best to do this in an open area, so you don’t have to pick specks out of the carpet."

Cut the nose ring to the right size.,
Finish the ends of your nose ring.,
Put on your nose ring.",How to Make a Fake Nose Piercing1," Whereas making a stud relies on glue, making a hoop requires a bit more effort. You'll need a pair of pliers, a pen or pencil, a file, and either some wire or a headpin.









Use wire or a head pin depending on how you want your nose ring to look. For example, do you want your hoop to be thick (head pin) or thin (wire), gold or silver. Florists wire works well if you're interested in a thin hoop.
These supplies can be purchased at any craft store.
It may take a few tries to get your nose ring just right, but once you become comfortable working with these materials, you'll be rocking a unique hoop in no time.;
, Place your materials on a flat surface, ideally near a mirror. If you're uncomfortable working with any of these materials, ask a family member or friend to help you.








, You'll create the round shape of your hoop by bending your wire/pin around a pen/pencil.









Grab your wire/pin and pen/pencil and bend it around your pen/pencil to form a circle. Then slide it off the end of the pen/pencil.

, Take your pliers, and cut the ends of your wire/pin so that the ends meet. At this stage, your hoop should look like a circle. Don't worry about the ends meeting perfectly.








, You will use pliers to bend back the end of your wire/pin. Do not bend back more than 1/4 in. Once the wire/pin is properly bent, you should see a tiny ""O"" or closed ""U"" shape at the end of your wire. This round end will make your piercing safe and prevent it from scratching your nose. The ""O"" end will go on the inside of your nose.









File the other end of the pin/wire. Using a file on the other end of your wire/pin will prevent it from scratching the outside of your nose. , Slide your new nose ring in place, and squeeze it to secure. You should be able to bend your hoop fairly easily, and your nose ring should stay in place until you take it off.

, Go through the sheets, and choose an image that appeals to you. Cut the image out with a pair of scissors. You can cut out more than one tattoo, but you will need to apply them one at a time.








, Make sure that you are only peeling the sheet off of the tattoo you just cut out. Leave the sheet over the rest of the tattoos. This will keep them clean, dust-free, and prevent them from sticking.








, The easiest way to do this would be to straighten your hair, but you can also add some loose curls or waves towards the bottom. Make sure that the area that you'll be putting the tattoo in is relatively straight, however. This will make it easier to apply the tattoo and help it look nicer in the end.

, Dampen a towel with water first, then squeeze the excess water out. Press the towel against the back of the tattoo. Hold the towel steady for 20 to 30 seconds. Be careful not to move it around too much.








If you don't have a damp towel, you can spritz the tattoo with water instead. Gently hold your fingers over the tattoo for 20 to 30 seconds.Do not drench the tattoo. You want it to be wet, but not soaking.

, Gently rub your finger over the backing a few times to make sure that the tattoo sticks.








, The paper backing should come away, and the tattoo should be stuck to your hair. The tattoo will be stiff, like a sticker. Do not pull it apart.








, This will help seal the tattoo in, and help it last longer.







, Your tattoo is now ready to go! If you kept your hair loose, you could tuck a strand of hair behind your ear, or clip it off to the side with a bobby pin.








, The tattoo should last several days. Over time, it may rip or crack, and spread apart. When you are tired of it, remove it in one of the following ways listed below.

, Start at the bottom of the tattoo and work your way to the top. Use short, quick, gentle strokes. As you comb, the tattoo will get stuck to the bristles.







, The tattoo will flake off or dissolve in the water.

, Since the tattoo is like a sticker, it is possible to peel it away. Loosen an edge near the top of the tattoo. Get a good grip on it, then gently peel it away, pulling it downward. If you have any residue, come it out with a fine-toothed comb.

Barbell piercings usually come with rounded silver studs. But, you can choose from different colors and shapes.
Decide whether you want a straight or curved barbell. This may be dependent on where you want to place the fake piercing on your face.

, Barbell piercings are usually used for eyebrow, bridge, and septum piercings on the face. The middle bar pierces through the skin and the two studs or “bells” at either end are visible outside of the skin. Sometimes the actual bar can be visible as well, depending on whether it is straight or curved.


Bridge barbell piercings are located at the top of your nose, between your eyes.
Eyebrow barbell piercings can be both vertical and horizontal.

, With an actual barbell piercing, the bar would be going through your skin. Since this is a fake piercing, you need to cut the barbell into three parts.

The size of the rhinestone is up to you, but your fake piercing will look more realistic if the jewel is smaller than the bead you chose.

, If you're using a stick-on piece, you don't need to add adhesive. If you made your own piece of jewelry, use spirit gum, nail glue, eyelash glue or body glue so the jewel adheres to your skin.








, Since the back of the bead won't be visible, you can get a little creative with your adhesive. Try to place the bead in the upper part of your belly button, so that it looks like it's attached to the jewelry above.








, Don't jostle or move the pieces for a few minutes while the adhesive dries. It helps to lie down while the glue dries.

Attach the earring to the top side of your navel.,
Place a rhinestone sticker above the earring.,
Allow the adhesive to dry.",How to Make a Fake Belly Button Piercing2," A small hoop or a lightweight chain are good options. You can even create your own belly-button jewelry designs using simple materials such as straight pins, beads, wire cutters and pliers.

, If the earring has a hook, either snip it with wire cutters or use needle-nosed pliers to open that link or loop attached to the hook and pull it apart from the rest of the earring., Using a straight pin with a beaded head, slide small beads onto the pin in a custom pattern.Slide the beads over the pin in whatever arrangement you like. Remember, the pin head will be the bottom of the jewelry, so the beads should be small enough they don't slide over it. Don't make the pin arrangement longer than what you'd like dangling from your navel.
Using needle-nosed pliers, bend the remainder of the pin so it forms a 90-degree angle. Clip the sharp end of the pin so that only about 1 centimeter of bare wire remains.
Bend the remaining wire into a small loop using needle-nosed pliers. The loop will be the top of the belly-button ring.

, The best adhesives to use are spirit gum, nail glue, eyelash glue or body glue.You will find it helpful to add glue to both the jewelry and your skin, then stick them together.

, To give the fake belly-button piercing a more realistic appearance, add a jewel about an inch above your navel. If you don't have a sticker, you can use wire cutters to snip off the post from a rhinestone earring (as long as it has a flat back) and glue the jewel to your skin.


While the size of the rhinestone is based on your personal preference, choosing a jewel the same size or smaller than the pin head you chose will look most realistic.

, Be sure you don't move around or touch the pieces for several minutes. It's also helpful to lay down flat while the glue dries.

Never use your other arm as a ""shield."",
Never throw your knife.",How to Become Good at Knife Fighting," In most places, it's legal to carry most kinds of knives, both in the open and concealed, but if you want to start carrying a knife for self-defense it's important that you make sure to know the law of the land to protect yourself, legally and physically. In the United States, you can read about the laws from state to state by clicking here.


In most places, Bowie knives, foldable knives, and other hunting-style knives are almost universally legal to own and to carry.
Switchblades, dirks, stilettos, balisongs, cane knives and other ""misleading"" styles of knife are treated variously. In some areas, it's legal to own these types of knife, but not legal to carry them.;
, Generally, knife fighting and knife defense is performed with fixed blade knives, typically with blades 5-7 inches (12.7-17.78 cm) long, but it's important to size your defense knife to your hand and your fighting style. The techniques, however, will apply to almost any variety of knife, whether it be a fixed blade tactical knife, a foldable hunting knife, or other styles of knife.


Grip a ruler to measure your grip from the second knuckle of your pointer finger to the second knuckle of your pinkie finger.You want the grip of a good defense knife to match that size grip as closely as possible.
Crocodile Dundee's words of wisdom do ring somewhat true in knife defense. A bigger, more intimidating knife can do more to keep you safe than the Swiss Army variety. Still, you can learn to defend yourself, regardless of what blade you carry.

, A dull knife is a more dangerous knife, and it's important to keep all your knives–tactical, hunting, or kitchen–sharp, clean, and well-maintained. Learn to hone and sharpen your knives yourself, to keep them in good working order.


Folding knives need to be oiled regularly to keep the action as smooth as possible.

, If you introduce a knife into an altercation and don't know how to defend yourself, it's more likely that you're going to end up the one getting stuck. If you don't know how to defend yourself, you should not carry a knife for defense purposes. Take a general personal self defense class to learn to control your environment and stay calm in physical altercations.


Knife and stick fighting courses are widely available in metro areas. Check out what's available and get detailed, one-on-one training to learn how to wield a knife properly and safely.
Generally, you should look on a knife as an everyday tool that can be used for self defense, should someone provoke an altercation, and not as a weapon that solely for fighting. You should only draw your knife if your opponent also brandishes a knife. Furthermore, draw your knife only if you intend to use it. To use a weapon for intimidation will likely put the opponent into a fight or flight type response, and the momentum can change quickly in their favor. Draw and take action, or choose another course. Intimidation attempts (while potentially successful) give the opponent the opportunity to react and control the altercation.
In most places, brandishing or drawing your knife in a threatening manner is a crime, punishable by fines and possibly jail time.

, When you're first getting started learning about knife fighting, try a little experiment. Have someone much weaker than you: a smaller sparring partner, little brother, or even your daughter, and give them a permanent marker with the cap off. Take off your shirt and tell them to try to mark you as many times as possible while you try to stop them. Then count up the marker lines at the end. Now imagine that marker was a knife.Even if you're experienced in self-defense, or even MMA, or karate, you're going to quickly come up against a hard truth: it's pretty easy for someone to get a blade on you in close quarters, and a knife makes for a deadly attacker, if you don't know what you're doing.
This is an excellent way of practicing your knife fighting skills in perfect safety. Never attempt to practice knife fighting with a sharpened blade. Use markers or practice knives.

, If you're going to carry a knife, you have to be sure you don't introduce it into the fight. Knives should only be drawn if you fear for your life in a physical altercation, because your opponent has also drawn a knife, gun, or other weapon in a threatening manner. Always use your knife first to attempt to avoid the altercation, then to defend yourself if necessary.


Don't draw knives on unarmed attackers. Learn to defend yourself without the use of a weapon, and avoid physical fights at all costs.
If someone comes up to you in a threatening manner, look at their hands and at their pockets. If you see a weapon, draw your knife.

, When drawing a fixed-blade knife, make sure the blade points away from your body at all times. Maintain a firm grip on the handle, and extend the knife firmly up, out, and away from you to assume a defensive posture. Usually, most people carry the knife on the opposite side of the body as the dominant hand, for this purpose.


Foldable knives can also be carried in on your pocket, though this can make drawing somewhat slow and cumbersome. Try getting a foldable knife with a quick-flip thumb stud to open it as quickly as possible, after drawing.
There's no one way to carry and draw. A lot of this depends on personal preference. Experiment with different knives to get a feel for what's most comfortable for you.

, There are a variety of different grips used for self-defense knife fighting, depending on preference. Practice drawing and holding your knife in the most comfortable and secure ways of possible, given your fighting style, strength, and the weight of your blade. The most basic and the easiest way to learn is probably the forward hammer grip.



Forward grips involve holding the knife by the grip, your fingers wrapped completely around, and the blade facing out from you, pointing straight up at the sky. Variations on this grip mostly depend on where you put your thumb to reinforce, but the most basic is the hammer grip, in which you wrap your thumb around the grip, to secure the knife in your hand.

Reverse grips are typically held in the exact same way, but with the blade pointing down toward the ground. It is possible to do a reverse grip with the blade edge pointing back at you, but this isn't recommended for beginners.

, It's of the utmost importance that you use your knife as a defensive tool, protecting your face, neck, and torso against an attacker, at all costs.Make your body as small as possible, by bringing your shoulders in and ducking your head, extending your knife-holding arm in front of you, flexed at a 45 degree angle.


Don't extend your knife arm all the way, which will leave it vulnerable to attack.
Use your other arm to guard your chest, neck, and stomach as you hide behind your knife. You don't want to offer your unarmed hand as some kind of shield or guard. Put your knife forward, always., If you both draw knives, take a big step backward, but remain facing your opponent at all times, your knife between your body and your opponent. Imagine there was a magnet pointing your knife at your opponent's knife.


In general, you can move one of four directions: forward, backward, and circling right or left. You should always be moving in some direction to protect yourself and make it more difficult to be struck. Never stand flat-footed.

, Most attackers won't be interested in actually attacking you, especially if you just pulled a knife that you look like you know how to use. Nobody wants to actually get into a knife fight. If someone has pulled a knife on you and you've pulled a knife in return, that should hopefully be the end of it. Ideally, pulling your knife and distracting your opponent should be the end of the fight.Draw your knife and issue a warning, something like: ""This is a buck knife given to me by my tactical knife instructor, who works for Blackwater. I sharpen it every night. Trust me, you don't want to come anywhere closer. Let's just call it a night.""
Keith Richards, a famous knife enthusiast, liked to say that the only purpose of pulling a knife was to get someone to look at the knife as a distraction, before you ended the fighting by kicking them between the legs. Not the worst idea.

, Knife-fighting doesn't much resemble sword fighting. You won't bang blades or do much parrying in a knife fight, but it's still important to deflect what could be a devastating blow by sidestepping blows, turning 90 degrees to the outside of your opponent's striking arm, then using your other hand to grip your opponent's elbow and attempt to disarm them.


It's always preferable to use your knife to strike or block at your opponent's arm, rather than attempting to grab at them.
If there's no other option, you do need to block with your other arm to protect your vital organs. A cut, even a severe one, on your arm is preferable to a stab wound in your solar plexus.
Read the next section for more information about defensive striking to disarm your opponent.

, Pulling and using your knife should be an absolute last resort, only taken if your life is being threatened. If you can avoid the confrontation entirely, or run, do this instead and avoid a potentially lethal situation.


If you receive a bad cut or stab wound, put pressure on the wound immediately to attempt to stop the bleeding and seek medical attention. Maintain consistent pressure on the wound until you can get professional care.

, Knife fight isn't about getting in close, it's about staying out of the way. Most of the fight will be you ducking and dodging, waiting for your moments to strike with quick little disarming strikes that will end the fight for good. If it looks like you're going to actually be attacked by someone with a knife, take a full step backward.


Take a minute to evaluate your surroundings and move to open space. You need to be able to move backward with ease. If you're in cramped surroundings, it's going to be difficult to defend yourself.

, Most inexperienced goons will take a wild slash somewhere close to your face, which should give you the first opportunity to stop the fight quickly when they make this mistake. When your opponent strikes, your counter-strike should be swift, accurate, and should end the fight immediately.


If they slash low, toward your stomach, move with them, taking a big step back and to the side. As their arm is extended, bring your knife over their forearm, point down, and slash down with your blade at the wrist, attempting to get them to drop the knife.
If they slash high, move with them, taking a big step back and to the side, then slash with your blade pointing up at the underside of their forearm. Aim for the forearm and wrist area, attempting to get them to drop the knife.

, It's a common misconception that you want to block with your other arm, getting your opponent's knife out of the way, and then move in close for a strike. It seems to make sense, but one or two slashes at your ""blocking"" arm with an attacker's knife will have you losing blood and close to being incapacitated very quickly, making your ""moving in"" an unlikely proposition. Instead, you need to learn to use your knife to block and strike in single maneuvers.


If you see an opportunity to grab your opponent's wrist with your opposite hand, that's another story, and you may want to take it.
Obviously, if there's a situation that's extremely dire, you may need to offer up a sacrifice arm to protect your head and throat, but as your marker exercises suggest, it's going to get ugly really quickly. You need to be fast with your disarming strikes, and not get into something with more contact.

, The absolute last thing you want to do in a one-on-one knife fight is lose your knife. Defending yourself against an attacker with a knife when you don't have one is extremely difficult, as your marker exercise should have suggested. Actually striking someone with a thrown knife is extremely unlikely, and you're most likely to just lose your knife and end up in trouble. Keep your knife in your hand at all times."

Try on your fake lip ring.,
Creatively customize your new lip ring.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Fake Lip Ring1," Try your local craft store first (think beading stores), as they will likely have the best selection in terms of size and color. Large retail stores such as Walmart will also carry a selection of craft wire.


Use wire in the 14-18 gauge range for fake lips rings. 18 gauge wire is thinner than 14 gauge and is easier to work with. It may be too thin for the look you are after, but the thicker the wire the more difficult it is to work with.
Packets of craft wire usually include 12 wires or so each about a foot in length.;
, This will make sure you are working with sterile material at the start.








, About two inches should do it. Snip off several pieces of slightly different lengths with the wire cutter. You probably will have to experiment with the length to find the right fit for your mouth. If the length is too short, the ring will be too tight; if it is too long, the ring will be too lose.








, The snipped ends will be sharp, and you don’t want them to scratch either the inside or the outside of your mouth. With a piece of 60 grit sandpaper, or coarser, sand away the sharp edges.








, If the wire is thin and malleable enough, you can bend it around your finger. But for a perfect, continuous curvature, bend it around something harder such as a plastic or metal rod that has the thickness of a finger.








, The circular shape can be changed into an oval or some other variation on a circle with standard pliers (or channel locks). Simply place the circular ring in the jaws of the pliers and gently apply pressure.








, The gap is the open area of the ring that allows you to slip it over your lip, and the flat is the area that nobody sees inside your mouth that can come into contact with your lower jaw and/or gum line. If you don’t create the flat, the lip ring will have a bulge that could irritate your gums.









To create the gap gently pry open the ring with your finger or the needle-nosed pliers.
To create the flat, straighten the wire at one of the ends by flattening it with the needle-nosed pliers. The flat area should be about 1/3 the length of the entire ring.

, After sliding the ring over your lip and into place, squeeze it only enough to keep it from sliding off on its own. You probably will need to make small adjustments to achieve the desired feel and look.









Make sure the gap is just big enough. If it is too small, the fit will be too tight and you could end up with a hole on either the front or the inside of your mouth. If the gap is too big, the fit will be too lose.
Depending on the fullness of your lips, you might have to adjust the overall shape of the ring. Some people like a tight fit that depresses the flesh of the lip. Other people prefer a looser feel and look.

, Although many people will be satisfied with the wire ring only, there are number of creative things you can do to make your ring more interesting and attractive.









Use the tiny metal ringlets from broken or obsolete jewelry to spice up your lip ring. Place the ringlets on the wire so they are visible only on the outside part of the ring. They will create a more complicated look, however, you don’t want these tiny bits of metal to end up on the inside of your mouth.
Create three or more rings and join them together with craft wire to form a lip ring cluster.
Use your lip rings in concert with snake bites or other body decoration around the mouth.

Stand with a wide leg stance.,
Bend your open palm backward.,
Strike upward and into the attacker's face.,
Look for other opportunities.,
Use an improvised weapon to defend yourself.,
Take your chance to flee.,
Combine another strike with your upward palm blow.,
Use an open hand hook to the attacker's head.,
Follow up with a double palm heel strike to the chest.,
Try an instep stomp.,
Attack back only as a last resort.,
Call emergency services as soon as possible.,
Leave the situation as soon as possible.",How to Break an Attacker's Nose," If possible, stand with your legs at least shoulder distance apart. Bend your knees slightly. You’ll need your legs to deliver the energy behind your strike, so standing with a strong leg stance is vital., Separate your fingers so they’re not clenched and touching each other. Bend your wrist backward to deliver the strike with the heel of your palm. If you don’t have much martial arts or self defense experience, you’re much less likely to successfully fend off your attacker without injuring your hand if you use the heel of your palm., The nose is a triangular shape that’s designed to take direct, straight impacts, so striking directly into the face isn’t your best strategy.Instead, put all your weight into your arm as you extend it upward into your attacker’s nose. Aim to strike just under the nostrils and continue the movement up into the attacker’s head., If your position relative to your attacker doesn’t allow for an upward strike, it is also possible to break the nose with a strike from the side. Use the heel of your palm to strike the side of the nose’s bridge. Even if you don’t achieve a break, a strong strike will likely cause bleeding or the eyes to tear up, which should give you a chance to escape., If you're wearing a belt and have the opportunity to take it off, you can wrap it around your hand and swing or punch the buckle into your attacker's face.A cane or walking stick, heavy purse, solid umbrella shaft, and other items can also be used as improvised weapons.


If you have a pen, you can close your fist around it with the sharp end exposed. Go for your attacker's eyes, throat, and neck. You can also use the same strategy with your set of keys., Once you’ve delivered the strike, quickly try to escape instead of taking the time to see if you successfully broke the attacker’s nose. Even if you did not succeed in breaking the nose, you likely caused pain, bleeding, or flooded the attacker's eyes with tears. Act fast and use this opportunity to get away.

, You can also use a quick, one-two combination to further disable your attacker. If you elect to use a combination, you should follow up your upward palm blow with another strike immediately.Don't deliver your first strike then wait a few seconds for the second one, or you'll waste valuable time that you could have used to escape.


Your priority is to get away, but a quick combination strike can help ensure that you've stunned your attacker and are able to flee.

, You can use a quick combination by following your upward strike with a head strike to further disable your attacker. Immediately after striking your attacker with the upward blow, use the other heel of your hand to strike hard in the temple area of the head.Think of the brain sitting the skull like pickles in a jar. A hard strike to the head can shake the brain, causing a concussive effect that will temporarily disable your attacker., After striking your attacker in the nose, a hard blow to the chest will knock them down and away from you, allowing you to escape. Keep your legs in a wide stance with your knees slightly bent to power your strike. Strike your attacker in the chest with both palm heels at the same time to push them away from you, then run in the opposite direction of their fall., Stomp as hard as you can on your attacker’s foot to stun them and help prevent them from chasing you. You can use an instep stomp before or after an upward strike to the nose. If an attacker has grabbed you, use an instep stomp then follow up with a nose, head, or chest strike. You could also use a nose strike first then follow up with the instep stomp to help guarantee your escape., Your priorities should be to always stay aware of your surroundings, safely escape a threatening situation, and to yell for help. Fighting back is a dangerous final option. If you must defend yourself, your goal is to disable or distract your attacker in order to escape.If you’re being mugged, for example, you should cooperate and give up your wallet or purse promptly instead of trying to execute a strike in self defense. Prepare a fake “mugging wallet” with only a few bills and personal effects inside just in case.
On the other hand, if you’re being coerced to go to a second location, you should make every effort to defend yourself and escape.

, When possible, dial an emergency number. If you can discreetly dial before engaging your attacker, place your phone in a pocket with the line open on speaker.


If you have an emergency line open, work in the attacker's physical characteristics in verbal warnings. For example, say something like, ""I will defend myself tall guy. Back away, or I’ll scratch out those brown eyes, knock off that blue baseball cap, and rip out that brown hair.""

, If your attacker falls back or drops to the ground, leave the area immediately. Continuing your attack risks injury to yourself, and could open you up to a lawsuit or arrest depending on regional laws.For example, you have a right to defend yourself if you believe there’s an imminent risk of bodily injury. However, if you start kicking your attacker while they’re down or unconscious, you might risk causing serious injury or even killing your attacker, which could eventually result in a long prison sentence.
The attacker could also regain composure and overpower you if you stick around to try to land more blows. Just strike once or with quick combination and run away.

Unless there's truly no other option, try to defuse or avoid physical violence at all costs. Do your best to make peace or simply walk away, if you can. There is no shame in running from a fight, especially if you don't know how it will turn out. Your opponent may be carrying a concealed weapon, or have friends lying in wait to gang up on you. Your primary goal should be getting yourself out of harm's way.Getting away from a violent situation before it erupts should be considered a victory.
If a fight becomes unavoidable, stay relaxed. When you panic, your ability to gauge your surroundings and employ effective strategies shuts down.;
, Keep your hands up to defend your head at all times. Your forearms should be held vertical and parallel, with palms turned inward toward your cheeks. Squeeze your fists together lightly until you’re ready to throw a counterpunch. Hunch slightly to bring your elbows down closer to your midsection to protect your ribs and abdomen from body blows.Don’t allow your guard to fall or get lax, even when you’re tired. Dropping your guard leaves you wide open for that one good shot which could mean the end of the fight.
Make sure you assume a guard from which you can quickly and comfortably deliver punches or elbow strikes.

, An aggressor who is bigger than you is also likely to be stronger, so it’s not recommended that you try to stop his attacks directly. Instead, stay mobile to swiftly escape from his punching range. Making him chase you will exhaust him, and with every missed attack he’ll lose a little more steam. If there’s no chance of getting a safe distance away, slide your head to the outside of the punch so that it passes by harmlessly, then immediately rush in and hit back.Evading is always preferable to blocking because it doesn’t require you to absorb force with any part of the body.
Dodging a punch using only head movement is known in boxing as a “slip.” Slipping punches is an excellent way to avoid being hit while expending minimal energy., The bigger, stronger person always has the edge in a grappling match. Don’t put yourself in unnecessary danger by allowing your opponent to take hold of you. Keep just outside his reach until the time comes to counter, then capitalize and pull away again. If the fight goes to the ground, you’re looking at a scenario where you have even less control, as your speed, evasiveness and precision will go right out the window.If one of you takes the other down, or you happen to trip, get back to your feet as quickly as you can. You have a much better chance of outclassing a large opponent in a stand-up encounter., It’s unlikely that you’ll walk away from a fight with a larger opponent unscathed. You may have to eat a few punches if you get caught off guard or while you’re trying to find a way to slip inside. Keep this in mind and ready yourself mentally. Getting hit is no fun, but it could end up being much worse if you let it take you by surprise.If you do have to take a hit, try to do it on the shoulder or forehead, which is a harder, less vulnerable surface than the jaw or the rest of the face. Let your body sway in the direction of the punch to lessen its impact.During a physical altercation, your body will be flushed with adrenaline, which can keep you from feeling as much pain.

, Move constantly to keep the larger opponent from grabbing you or landing strikes. Stay light and poised on the balls of your feet so that you can change directions quickly and keep him guessing. Since his reach is longer than yours, stay safely outside of it until you’re ready to move in and counter with a strike or takedown of your own.One method you could employ is to “dance,” or move in a circular motion around your opponent while staying outside of his striking range. When you sense a punch coming, duck, dodge make sure you’re too far away for it to connect.Since the legs are longer than the arms, becoming proficient at kicking can help overcome your opponent's reach advantage.
Whatever you do, don’t let a larger opponent get their hands on you. One wrong move could end the fight in their favor.

, When your opponent is least prepared, close the distance between you and move in close. This will neutralize his superior size and reach and put him in the right range to land some hard shots of your own. Finding the right timing and approach for getting in close is paramount for emerging victorious—you cannot win a fight with a bigger attacker by playing into his strengths.When negotiating range with a bigger opponent, the most important thing to remember is to stay out of the “danger zone.” This is the range at which he can hit you but you can’t hit him back due to his added reach.
Move in suddenly after dodging a blow or feinting one of your own, or follow your opponent’s punching arm back as he retracts it.

, One of the downsides of being taller and heavier is that it takes more effort to move, and as a result you run out of energy faster. Use this to your advantage. Keep slipping, dodging and moving constantly until your opponent begins to slow down. At that point, you can use your speed to slip into close range and unleash some punishing offense of your own.Working out to improve your cardiovascular conditioning can prepare you in the event that you need to be able to outlast an opponent’s onslaught during a fight.
The strategy of allowing an adversary to tire themselves out before finishing them off has become known as the “rope-a-dope” principle. Muhammad Ali used this gameplan to win a championship bout with the larger George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974., If you suspect things are about to take a nasty turn, be the one to make the first move. End a tense standoff with a sudden, well-placed blow to the jaw or solar plexus (the soft, fleshy outer edge of the diaphragm beneath the sternum). Put everything you’ve got into the strike—try to put a stop to the fight in a single maneuver. If you’re successful, your opponent will be incapacitated and the altercation will be over. If not, you’ll at least already be ready for the ensuing brawl.Assess the situation as best you can before resorting to a surprise attack. In many cases, the aggressor might simply be worked up and won’t have any intention of actually getting into a physical dispute. Be certain that you’ve exhausted all other options first.
Be careful when going for a sucker punch. If it misses or doesn’t do the trick, there will be no way to avoid a full-on fight.

, It’s worth repeating that you shouldn’t try to stand and duke it out with a bigger guy. His reach and power will just be too much to handle. Take your time staying away from his strikes, waiting for an opening and then closing the gap and landing a hard shot. By alternating between defensive posturing and quick offensive bursts, you’ll eventually be able to wear him down.Don’t get impatient. You’ll start making mistakes, which could end up costing you dearly.
Attack the body when you don't have a clear shot at your opponent's head. The solar plexus is a sensitive target that when hit just right can drive all the air out of an opponent's lungs and leave them gasping for breath. The ribs are also quite fragile, and can be broken with only a few pounds of force per square inch.

, Unlike a boxing match, which has regulations about where you’re allowed to hit an opponent, all bets are off in a real fight. Target the most delicate areas of your attacker’s body to make every strike count. One well-placed blow is all you'll need to put your towering opponent out of commission. Most people won’t be expecting these types of attacks, so they’ll be left without a ready defense.Everybody has the same anatomical weakness, despite size differences.
Strikes that target an opponent’s sensory organs will leave them temporarily stunned, enabling you to get away or follow up with a hard hit.
An open hand slap to the ear is just as good as a left hook for shattering an opponent’s equilibrium, if not better. Hitting the nose can blind them momentarily by causing their eyes to well up with tears, which gives you an opportunity to throw a fight-ending punch. A kick to the groin will compromise their mobility and instantly take the will to fight out of them.

, Let’s say you get taken down with your opponent on top of you, and you’re unable to climb to your feet. In this situation, scramble for a submission technique, a hold or lock that incapacitates an attacker by neutralizing a single part of the body. By applying a joint lock, armbar or choke, you may be able to do enough damage to put an end to the scuffle. No matter how big or tough someone is, they won’t be able to hurt you if they’re unconscious or have a broken arm.Apply a rear naked choke or triangle choke, depending on your positioning. Chokes disrupt an opponent's circulation or ability to breathe, causing unconsciousness. It only takes a firm hold and a few moments to put an opponent to sleep.Armbars are holds that apply pressure to the elbow joint or shoulder. They are effective against attackers who leave their arms extended momentarily after throwing a punch. As a bonus, disabling an arm means they can’t hit you anymore., Forget about honor or fairness: there are no rules on the street. You don’t know how badly you might be injured if you come out on the losing end of a fight, so you shouldn’t be discouraged from being vicious. Bite, gouge eyes, pull hair, chop the throat, bend fingers back, knee the groin and do anything else you have to do to survive.Turn objects around you, such as bottles, chairs, rocks, pens or even your cell phone into improvised weapons. In the best case scenario, the sight of you holding a weapon may be enough to make your attacker back down.To avoid escalating the violence further, make a run for it as soon as you have your opponent reeling.

Prepare your torso.,
Block with your head.,
Heed his feet.,
Cover and direct the punch.,
Answer the phone.",How to Block a Punch1," A blow to the stomach can be devastating if you're not prepared. In the event that a blow comes too quickly, or you are unprepared for violence, your best course of action may be to tighten your stomach muscles and shift slightly so the blow lands off to the side of your body.By shifting, you diminish the force of the blow by not meeting it head on, but also allow your obliques (the muscles on the sides of your torso), to absorb the force as well.;
, This technique can be used if you are taken by surprise or or don't have a chance to block with your extremities. Blocking with your forehead can even lead to damaging your opponent's hand due to its hardness and resilience, leaving you unharmed. Tighten your neck muscles, clench your jaw, and lean into the oncoming blow so that you absorb it on your forehead.Exercise caution with this block; poor timing or placement could lead to a debilitating blow.

, When you feel like you might be in danger of violence, you should focus your awareness on the posture of your aggressor. This is very important because it can serve as an early warning to you. If your opponent has his right foot back, it's likely he will punch with that hand, and vice versa. Knowing this will allow you to prepare for the blow., Trying to block the punch head on is a recipe for disaster. As the majority of the force of the punch will be coming forward, you stand a better chance moving the blow to the side rather than opposing it directly. Bring your hand up to the inside of the oncoming punch to ""cover"" it with your own hand. Complete the move by guiding the strike to the outside., Similar to covering and directing the punch, bringing your hand up to cover the strike as it's oncoming, continue the motion until your hand is close to the side of your head/crook of your neck and your elbow is raised in line with your assailant's forearm.Keep your stance tight, your neck muscles tensed, and your hand as close to your head as possible. Deflecting the blow in this way can still cause a transfer of force that may knock your own hand into your head, leaving you dazed and poorly protected.

Know your aim.,
Watch his posture.,
Commit to a target.,
Practice with a friend.,
Swat away blows and evade.",How to Block a Punch2," A parry is a counter blow that is intended to disarm or deflect a strike coming your way.Parrying requires quick reflexes, but when executed well, it can take the fight out of your opponent more quickly than a simple block.


A parry can take the form of a jab, hook, or a close quarters strike. The parry you employ will be decided by circumstance and reflex, though most will be short distance strikes to a vulnerable part of your opponent's attacking extremity, making use his oncoming force to do damage.

, The stance of your opponent will telegraph important information to you, allowing you to respond co-occurringly with the blow as your assailant strikes. When you feel in danger of violence, take note of:


Which foot is leading and following, as a punch is usually thrown from the same side as the back foot.
The rotation of the body, as it has a tendency of rotating in the direction from which the attack is coming.
Any tensing, especially clenching of the fists, as this will be a good indicator that a blow is soon to come., If you aren't an experienced fighter, you will likely be unaware of what kind of strike will be launched by your aggressor. Chances are, it will be a simple punch directed at your head, though this is not a guarantee. For an effective parry, you will need to commit to a counter-strike in the space where the blow is most likely to pass through.An excellent, and debilitating target, is the bicep muscle. Too often in combat, opponents regard the head as the main target, but the limbs are very susceptible to damage, and a strike to the bicep can leave your assailant's arm crippled for the rest of the fight.
The inside of the elbow joint will also be vulnerable when your aggressor extends his arm to try and land his blow.

, Especially if you are inexperienced, you should always exercise caution when practicing self-defense, but to most effectively train parrying, you'll need a partner. Have your partner make strikes at you in slow motion following in as natural a way as possible. As his blow approaches, strike his extremity in such a way as to stop or deflect the blow.


Once you have the motions and your strike targets well practiced, you can speed up this drill, but be sure to do so with restraint. Neither you, nor your partner, should come into contact in such a way that you harm each other.
To improve reflex time, try training on a speed bag or double end bag, pick up a reflex oriented ball sport, like racquetball, and train with a reflex ball., Though this might not be the most elegant approach, it is highly effective. It takes a great deal of energy to throw a strong punch, and by slapping away your aggressor's fist to either side of your body, you will tire him out while keeping yourself safe."

Understand the rules.,
Learn the basics.,
Prepare yourself for the jab.,
Avoid the cross.,
Give the blow the slip.,
Duck the blow.,
Bob and weave.,
Engage in a battle of attrition.",How to Block a Punch3," It is important to distinguish the differences between sport fighting and a life or death struggle. When sport fighting, like in boxing, there are rules in place to protect the contenders and ensure a ""fair fight.""In a brawl situation, adherence to these rules can result in you getting hurt. In the real world, you can't always trust your opponent to follow the rules., The basic boxing punches are: the jab, the cross, the hook and the uppercut. Knowing how each of these is executed is the first step in understanding how you can stop the blow., This is a fighter's most frequently used punch. The most effective way to block this shot is to deflect it with your palm, thereby deflecting the punch above your other shoulder., Blocking in boxing isn't just about using your gloves; you'll also need to be comfortable defending with your shoulders as well. A cross is a straight power punch thrown by your opponent. There will likely be too much power behind it to block with your hand, so you should instead try to take the blow on your shoulder.After you take the punch on your arm, you can shift your weight to your back foot, rotate your body hard and execute a counter punch.

, By turning hips slightly in time with the oncoming punch, your opponent won't have time to alter the course of his punch and it will ""slip"" right by you. Swaying requires you to lean straight back from your hips giving you time to move your head out of the way of an oncoming punch in a swaying motion.Though not technically a block, by evading the blow, you achieve the same purpose and, in some cases, leave yourself in a more fortunate situation/condition. Some opponents will be much stronger or larger; in this case, blocking the punch could be dangerous.

, There are two main benefits to this technique, one is avoiding a blow, the other is to give yourself an opening at some easy body shots. Duck your adversary's mitt by dropping down in an erect position. This move may cause the glove to graze your head or miss you completely., You can escape an impending punch by ""bobbing"" your head while sliding underneath or to the side of your opponent's glove. As the mitt advances, bend your legs and move laterally in either direction. Once you have evaded the punch, ""weave"" into a standing position to either side of his outstretched arm., Also known as the rope-a-dope technique, this defensive move requires fighters to lean against the ropes of the ring while shielding themselves with their mitts and their body. The goal is to weather the assault, exhaust your opponent, and conserve energy. Successfully performing the rope-a-dope will leave your foe weakened and unable to throw any punches you have to worry about.

Attack his throat with strikes and chokes.,
Kick him in the groin.,
Gouge or poke his eyes.,
Attack his joints to remove his mobility.,
Use a weapon to neutralize your opponent.",How to Beat a Strong Man1," The throat is a weak point in a person's body. When defending yourself, attack his throat by punching or hitting it. If you’re able to get your arm completely around his neck, you can apply pressure to his Carotid artery to induce unconsciousness. This artery can be found on both sides of the neck and only requires 11 pounds of pressure to close.Pinching off the Carotid artery stops air from going to the brain and could cause brain damage if held for too long.
You can use your hands, elbows, feet, or forearms to attack the strong man’s throat.If you are behind him, using a rear naked choke can cause unconsciousness quickly. Read Do-a-Sleeper-Choke-Hold to learn how to do this.;
, Kicking a man in his groin is a great strategy when defending yourself. Make sure you are close enough to him to make clean contact, and don’t hesitate.Doing a soccer kick in-between his legs is the best way to strike his groin.
Mix in attacks to the groin with strikes to other parts of his body so it catches him off guard.

, Eye gouges and pokes can hinder the ability for a person to see, and more severe eye gouges can cause permanent blindness or death. If you are struggling against an attacker, press your thumbs hard against the surface of his eyeballs.Only perform this attack if you are in a dire situation. You could potentially kill someone by performing an eye gouge.

, Places like the elbow, ankles, and knees are vulnerable parts of the body.Each joint has a range of mobility, and will break or sprain if pulled or pushed in the opposite direction.


Attack the soft part behind his kneecap, or do a push kick with the bottom of your foot onto his kneecap to incapacitate him.

, Try to find things around you that you could swing at your attacker, like a broom, a brick, or a bottle. Any object in your vicinity that's hard enough to break skin can be used.


Using a weapon can carry heavier jail times if you are convicted of assault.
Be careful when reaching for a weapon. It may escalate the situation and your opponent may also grab a weapon in retaliation, or take your weapon away from you.

If you're right-handed, turn your left hip toward your opponent. Don't turn completely perpendicular with your torso, just lead with your non-dominant leg and hip. This makes you into a more slithery target and gives you more power in your punches.


Keep a steady center of gravity. Keep your weight on your back leg (your right leg, if you're right handed). If you stand facing your opponent square, you can be knocked over easily. Keep your weight back by spreading your legs perpendicular to your opponent and stay in the fight.
Bring your hands up to your head, your non-dominant hand up near your eye and your dominant striking hand near your chin. Keep your hands in loose fists so that you can quickly strike or play defense.





;
, Wrap your thumb around the bottom of your fingers, not inside your fist and not on the side of your fingers, as if you were holding a bug you didn't want to escape. Don't clench your hand so tightly that you start to lose circulation, but keep it firm when you're throwing a punch and loose but formed when you're playing defense.


When people injure their fist while throwing a punch, it's typically because they're hitting with the wrong part of the hand. The knuckles that should strike your target are the middle knuckles on your hand, between your index and middle finger.

, Beginners throw wild, loose, uncontrolled hay-makers that have no power behind them. You want to throw a linear punch, straight between you to your opponent, not a ""round"" punch. You're not playing Street Fighter II and you're not going to knock somebody out with a lame duck shot to the other guy's ear. A powerful jab is your friend.Good punches come from your lower body as much as from your arm strength. Stepping into your punches will make them much more powerful. On a heavy bag, practice throwing punches that strike straight out from your body, rather than around, and push forward into the bag with your back foot as you rotate and punch with your striking hand.

, If you try to smash your knuckles into your opponent's jaw or cheek, you're going to do more damage to yourself. The center of the attacker's face--the nose, specifically--is the softest and most painful place to hit, but punching his nose might just make him angry. Body shots to the floating ribs to the side of your opponent will force them to lose their wind, making it very difficult for them to continue. When they double over to defend, their face is opened up for more attack.


Punches to the throat, groin, and kicks to the knees are also effective if you're in a fight for your life. If you're boxing with friends, don't fight dirty, but don't neglect these devastating blows if the fight is serious.

, Don't over-swing wildly like Rocky does, but pick your spots and make quick, sharp jabs that land on their target. The winner of a fight isn't necessarily the fighter who throws the most punches, but the fighter who lands the most punches with the most power.


Make sure to follow through. Imagine you're striking at something that's actually about two inches behind your target, and that you want to punch through it.

, Martial artists make a lot of noises when they compete, and the reason they do this is because it gets adrenaline pumping, intimidates your opponent, and awakens an animalistic part of yourself you may often keep buried. It's time for the Hulk to emerge, so get yelling.

, Head-butts are the most underrated fighting technique. Putting the most rigid part of your body--the hard plate of your upper forehead--into the softest part of your opponent's face--the nose--will end the fight quickly.


In formal sport fighting, like boxing or MMA, head-butts are illegal, but if you're defending yourself against someone you're fighting with, don't waste time playing by the rules of a sport.

, If you're going to throw punches, you've got to learn to get punched, too. Rolling punches and learning to absorb blows will make you stand in there and hold your ground much better, opening up spots where you can get your offense in.


If you get punched in the face, tense your neck muscles, close your jaw, and move into the punch. Moving into the punch takes away the power of it by cutting it off early, and if you start moving backward, you'll probably fall backward. This is difficult to get the hang of, because your natural tendency is to want to back away from the fist, but imagine that the fist is a soccer ball and you want to give it a header. If your opponent punches your forehead, it's going to hurt him a lot more than it will you.
Tighten your stomach muscles and try to take the blows straight on, into your abdominals, rather than in your soft spots. You want to protect your liver as much as possible, which is under your floating ribs on your side.

, This is the most important part of defense. Backing up invites your opponent to cross into your yard and gives you the kind of backward momentum that's going to end with your falling down and losing the fight. Step forward, where your opponent's punches will have less power and where you're unlikely to fall down.


This will open up your sides to body punches, so be aware and get in your own licks. Don't let your guard down.

, You'll want to always keep your hands up around your face when you're not actively throwing a punch to deflect as many of the blows as possible, but you'll also want to keep in constant motion, bobbing and weaving all around, to make your head as difficult to hit as possible. The more you move, the more difficult it will be to hit you flush on the face, or in the neck.


Keep your feet moving as if you were on hot coals and imagine that the ceiling is right over your head, and that you've got to keep ducking and dodging to avoid hitting your head on the top.

, Fights don't generally last very long, but if they do you'll want to be the one who can go for several minutes without getting winded. If you're doughy and soft, it's hard to win a fight.


Do some aerobic exercise. 30 minutes of aerobic exercise 3 or 4 times a week should keep you in good shape to do pretty much anything.
Do sit-ups and push-ups regularly. George Foreman won the heavyweight championship of the world without ever setting foot in a gym. He did sit-ups, push-ups, and learned to take a punch. You don't have to be a body-builder to be in ready fighting shape.

, The best samurai lets the sword rust in its scabbard. If you're wondering whether or not you should fight, the answer is almost always no. Avoid physical fights at all costs and only fight to defend yourself as a last resort.


Try to deescalate the situation before it comes to blows. Speak calmly and quietly to the person you're fighting with and avoid threatening or cocky language.

, Your typical assailant will be two things: angry and right-handed. Both of these can work to your advantage if you stay focused, anticipate his right-handed wild punches, and look to end the fight early with a high-probabilty, hard-impact blow to the throat or to the nose. Also pay attention to feet and predict an attack. Most people will step with the opposite foot of the hand they plan to use example: if they step with a left they will swing with the right.

, If you do happen to get into a fist fight, fear is the number one factor between winning and getting pummeled. Don't be afraid to get hit. Your adrenaline will be pumping so hard you'll hardly even feel anything until later, even if you get smashed. If you're thinking about how much a hard punch to the nose is going to hurt then it's going to hurt even worse, so don't dwell on those things in a fist fight. Just fight.

, If you're fighting smart, you'll have likely peppered your opponent with lots of smart high-impact blows, and your opponent will become frustrated and might try to tackle you in a desperate attempt. You never want to end up on the bottom of a grapple, so your opponent use the ground as a weapon.


Always keep your center of balance and shift sideways, away from the grapple if your opponent does Try to tackle you. If he's got you on the ground, shield your face and consider pulling hair, going for the eyes, or other quick methods of getting him off you and breaking the grapple.

Use the tactics of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.,
Use his momentum and size against him.,
Wear out his cardio by staying elusive.",How to Beat a Strong Man2," Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art that was developed by the Gracie family in Brazil. It incorporates aspects of Japanese Jiu Jitsu and Judo. It is a grappling martial art that concentrates on choke holds and joint locks. It was first developed as a method for smaller fighters to defeat larger opponents, and can help you in beating someone that's stronger than you.Brazilian Jiu Jitsu also reduces stress.
In addition to being a self-defense tactic, Brazillian Jiu Jitsu increases your mobility, agility, and flexibility.Helio Gracie developed Brazillian Jiu Jitsu as a way to defeat his older, larger brothers on the mat., The art of Judo uses your opponents momentum and size against them in the form of throws. Even though your opponent may be bigger, it doesn’t mean they are immune to being thrown. Think of ways to use his size to your advantage. For example, instead of meeting him face on, try tripping his feet while he charges forward at you.


Judo uses balance and leverage rather than brute strength to throw the opponent on the ground.You can incapacitate a strong man with a single throw. In competition this is known as an ippon., The endurance and mobility of a strong man may be adversely affected by his muscle mass.Because of this, you can stay mobile and elusive as he gets tired. Once he is, you can take advantage of him.


Feinting or faking punches may cause your opponent to react. Keep moving around him laterally and try to stay out of the way of his strikes. Make him swing and miss as much as possible.
Do not get into a brawl with someone stronger than you. A single punch can knock you unconscious, so make sure to keep peppering shots with jabs and never try to stand punch for punch with him.

Go to the gym and get in good physical shape.,
Do calisthenic exercise on your spare time.,
Remain physically active or join a sports team.,
Consult a personal trainer.",How to Beat a Strong Man3," While superior technique may give you the ability to beat a larger opponent, having good physical fitness is also critical. Make sure to weight train to build up your muscle. Work on your cardio and endurance by doing drills, running, swimming, or biking. If you are in a prolonged fight, it’s important that you have the endurance to overcome your opponent.


Building muscle and building strength are two different things. Concentrate on building strength by doing a greater amount of reps with smaller weight.
10-15 reps per set is a good starting point for those trying to build strength.Read how to Bench-Press, Do-Bicep-Curls, and Do-a-Squat to learn the most common strength building exercises.

, Calisthenic exercise is exercise that’s performed without any gym equipment and uses your own body-weight as resistance. This is a great alternative for those who can’t get to the gym, or want to get stronger while they are at home. Try to drill and chain your calisthenic exercise together in order to simultaneously work out your cardio and endurance.


Calisthenic exercise increases your lean muscle and improves mobility, flexibility and strength.Some of the most common exercises include pull ups, squats, push ups, lunges, and crunches., Staying physically active or joining a sports team will ensure that you maintain good health, thereby equipping you with the tools to defeat a strong man. Doing this in conjunction with working out will allow you to be physically fit enough to beat a strong man.


Doing a physical activity or participating on a sports team can boast a variety of other health benefits like an improved cardiovascular system and can prevent chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, and hypertension.Being on a team may motivate you further than if you were working out alone.
Some physical activities include rock climbing, dance, or hiking.
You can join a community baseball or flag football team to stay active.

, If you’re totally new to working out, a personal trainer may be able to assist you in developing a meaningful training program. Many personal trainers have trained for years themselves, and have knowledge over a variety of different types of workouts.A physical trainer may also be able to give you a better eating regimen so you can build strength and increase how much energy you have when you’re working out.

Train in a striking martial arts discipline.,
Learn how to grapple if the fight goes to the ground.,
Watch instructional videos on how to defend yourself.",How to Beat a Strong Man4," Striking is the art of punching and kicking your opponent. In order to compete with the strong man face to face, you’ll need to develop striking skills. Find a local gym and talk to the trainer about taking classes.


The most popular and effective striking arts include American boxing, Muay Thai Kickboxing, and Karate.
When fighting a strong man, use your speed to your advantage. Try to dodge his punches without getting hit.
Don’t think you can become efficient at striking or at any martial art, without going to an official gym. Muay Thai for example, has been developed for several hundred years and requires an immense amount of skill., Many fights end up on the ground, or in a wrestling or grappling situation. This can pose an obvious disadvantage if you are competing against someone that's strong. If you’re able to learn how to grapple however, you will have the advantage against someone who is untrained in any grappling arts.


Popular grappling arts include wrestling, Greco Roman wrestling, Judo, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.Going to the ground may even be a better situation if you can get top control or your opponent is efficient at striking.
”Rolling” or grappling practice is the best way for you to get experience. Take every opportunity to grapple with someone bigger and better than you when you attend your class.
Once you have trained and refined your technique, sparring will give you a real experience if you get into a fight.

, While they could never substitute real training and sparring, instructional videos can give you a glimpse into different ways you can protect yourself from a strong man. If you can’t afford a class, or there isn’t one in your area, this could be an alternative.


Do not rely on instructional videos before trying to beat a strong man.
Make sure to check the ratings on the instructional video before you purchase it, so you know that others have found it effective.

Make the first move.,
Go for the eyes.,
Lash out at the nose or shins when attacked from behind.,
Focus your blows on other pressure points.,
Protect your own vulnerable areas.,
Keep moving.,
Use any available object as a weapon.,
Pull on long hair.,
Get away when you get the opportunity.","How to Beat a ""Tough"" Person in a Fight1"," Don't ever wait for someone to attack first. If you sense an impending attack, hit first and hit hard. This will surprise your attacker and help to level the playing field.Consider the legal consequences of your actions. You must be absolutely sure you are in danger and there is no way of escaping before you strike a would-be attacker. Otherwise, you cannot justify your actions as self defense, and the other person may win a civil suit against you.;
, Try to jab at your attacker's eyes with your fingers. Not only is this painful, but the reflex to cover the eyes is often incredibly strong. This may give you an opening to land a serious blow or possibly cause your attacker to drop a weapon.


The best technique is to grab your opponent by his or her ear and press your thumb across the entire nearby eye. Push down forcefully. This move is much more painful than a simple poke to the eye and may buy you enough time to get away., Attackers often jump their victims from behind to surprise them. Turn this disadvantage around and use it to forcefully attack your opponent's weakest areas. These techniques are especially helpful for getting out of an attacker's grip:


Throw your head back to bash the nose with a head butt. Your skull is a lot denser than the cartilage of your attacker's nose and can do a surprising amount of damage. Aim for the bridge, as a blow to it will be the most painful.
Rake your foot forcefully along your attacker's shin bone. This is an especially good option if you are wearing high heels. Alternatively, you can simply try to kick backwards against his or her shins. While less painful than a hit to the nose, a shin kick is much easier to land., Strike out at the especially vulnerable parts of your opponent, which include the eyes, ears, temple, nose, chin, throat, neck, and groin.If you can land a solid hit, there are a few ways of incapacitating an opponent:


An uppercut to the jaw under the chin will twist the head quickly, potentially causing a loss of consciousness.A jab to the temple is the most surefire way to knock someone out. This spot is very vulnerable and can easily cause internal bleeding. Keep in mind that this type of blow can seriously injure or even kill the other person., Remember that your opponent can also target your own pressure points. Pay close attention and don't let your attacker's hands get anywhere near your face and neck., Above all, you shouldn't let your attacker touch you. Don't stand still. Move from side to side as erratically as possible to confuse your opponent. Avoiding the attacker's blows should take priority over getting in your own. Every time your attacker missteps or fails to land a punch is a potential opportunity for you to run., If you carry pepper spray, a knife, or a palm stick, strike with those. If you don't, do your best to improvise. Anything hard and/or sharp can work, from a car key to a nearby rock.


High heels are an especially good choice for an improvised weapon. If you can, pull them off your feet to give yourself more maneuverability.If the fight is taking place on sand, soil, or gravel, grab a handful and throw it at your attacker's face. If you manage to get grit in your attacker's eye, it will temporarily blind him or her. You will have time to get away while your attacker attempts to clear his or her vision.
A sturdy flashlight makes for a great improvised weapon at night. Shine it directly into your opponent's eyes to blind and distract, giving you an edge. If that isn't enough to get away, turn the flashlight around and hit with it., If your attacker has long hair, try to yank it as hard as you can. This can cause pain by itself, but it also allows you to move your attacker into a better position to land a knockout blow. If your attacker wears his or her hair in a ponytail or large braid, it will be easier to grab and hold on to.

, No matter what, you should always leave the area as soon as the fight is over. If your attacker flees, he or she may come back with a deadly weapon or a few friends in tow.You also need to keep in mind that self defense is only legally justified when using reasonable force in the face of inescapable immediate danger. If your opponent is on the ground, you are no longer in danger and should have the opportunity to run. If you strike an incapacitated foe, you open yourself up to a civil suit even if that person attacked you."

Prioritize evasion.,
Use tai sabaki.,
Lean back when kicked.,
Neutralize your opponent's reach advantage.","How to Beat a ""Tough"" Person in a Fight2"," Under most circumstances, avoiding strikes is a fundamental aspect of fighting. Evasion becomes even more important when facing a bigger or stronger opponent in a clean fight. A tough fighter will have the advantage of power and may hit you hard enough to end the fight quickly. Make sure to be quick on your feet and move away from incoming blows.

, Tai sabaki are a set of movements found in Japanese martial arts. Fighters use tai sabaki to avoid incoming strikes while putting themselves in the best position to launch a counter attack. When fighting a bigger opponent, counters are your best option to gain the upper hand. Two basic tai sabaki movements are:



Nagashi – This simple move is best used to counter an unexpected frontal attack. From a forward-facing stance, use your left leg as a pivot and slide your left behind you in an arc. Your body should swing like an opening door. As you put your foot into position, raise your arm to strike.

Hiraki – This step is best for an unexpected attack from a short distance. From a forward-facing stance, slide your foot furthest from your opponent towards the same direction. Slide your other foot closer to the first, then turn your second foot towards your opponent. As you move your feet, turn your hips towards your opponent and raise your arms to strike.

, If you're fighting with a style involving kicks, such as muay thai, the most effective technique you can use against a taller fighter is to lean back to evade their higher kicks. When your opponent's kick flies over your head, you will be in a good position to strike back as he or she is momentarily thrown off balance., Another advantage a taller fighter has is a longer reach. There will be a zone between the two of you where your opponent will be able to land hits while you can't. It's important to stay out of this area. Spend as much time as possible either far enough away that your opponent can't hit or close enough that you can, too. When moving between these two zones, be sure to keep your defenses up."
"
Establish a clear set of rules before you begin.,
Make a fist correctly.,
Prevent your opponent from landing hits.,
Minimize the damage of blows you can't avoid.,
Avoid dirty tricks and potentially lethal techniques.","How to Beat a ""Tough"" Person in a Fight3"," If your opponent uses dirty tricks, there's no reason why you should hold back. When in a planned fight, you and your opponent should come to a mutual agreement of what is and isn't allowed in the fight. You can also get an impartial third party to help lay down the rules and act as a kind of referee for the fight.

, Before you even think about throwing your first punch, you need to have a perfect fist. Curl your fingers inward onto your palm and make sure your thumb is on the outside, folded across the bottom knuckles of your first few fingers.If your thumb is on the inside of your fist, you are likely to break it.

, Unlike a street fight, letting your foe make the first move is a reasonable strategy. Make sure to avoid every strike you can and spring back with a counterattack. It's important that you keep your body in motion, making punches difficult to land. A proper fighting stance will also make you harder to hit by creating a smaller target. Instead of facing your opponent head-on with your shoulders in parallel, stand to the side with your dominant half forward.

, You won't be able to dodge every punch. For the hits you have to take, absorb the shock as best as you can to make them less effective.


When taking a body blow, brace for impact by tightening your abdominal muscles. Shift your torso so that your opponent's fist lands at your abdominal muscles to the side rather than at the center near internal organs.
For blows to the head, flex your neck and jaw muscles and lean into the punch. Make sure the hit lands on your forehead, which is incredibly tough. Above all, never let a strike land at your temple, jaw, or nose., Although it's not generally acknowledged, there is an unspoken rule between men that strikes to the groin aren't acceptable in fair fights. It's considered to be a dirty trick along with other actions like eye gouging and hair pulling. If you come out on top with these methods, your friends are unlikely to consider it a legitimate win.


Weapons should also be off-limits unless they are agreed upon beforehand.
While blows to the face, head, and neck are legitimate in fair fights, it's best to avoid using them outside of officially-sanctioned matches. An uppercut to the jaw or a jab to the temple can win you a fight quickly, but these strikes can also cause permanent brain damage. Without medical personnel ready to assist a downed fighter, you should reconsider using such techniques.

"
Don't fall for their charm.,
Look for warning signs.,
Observe their actions, be aware of their movements.,
Take action if you suspect you are dealing with a predator:


Tell someone you trust.,
Be prepared if he or she gets any of your contact or personal information, to change it.,
Confront or avoid him/her altogether.",How to Avoid Predators," 'Predators' can be very nice, friendly people, especially to children. If someone is continually trying to get you alone, or to isolate you from your friends or family, there is something wrong there. Just politely decline and carry on. If they continue asking you, then you should call the police. These people often make light or make ""games"" of inappropriate touching:;
, A stereotypical preparatory behaviour is someone who touches a young girl around the breast area or any child around the crotch. They might then laugh or giggle, saying, ""Oops! Did I get you?"" If it's innocent, that would be the end of it. If it's more sinister, then it would happen again, probably very quickly, and could be something like: ""Oops - did it again! Did I get you there?"" accompanied by a touch in a sensitive place. He or she may even brazenly ask if you ""liked that."" Your Red Alert should be going off by then, but sometimes you tell yourself, ""Oh, it was an accident,"" or ""He's just playing a game."" He's not - at least not any game you should be playing.

The predator might pat you first, and then if you laughed or said it was okay after they said they were sorry, they might either pat you again, or try stroking a private part, or even putting their hand there and leaving it until you push it away - and the next thing you know, there's a hand in your crotch, or trying to make its way down your pants or up your blouse.
A predator may even be quite brazen. One case had a young girl sitting on the bench seat of a pickup truck between her father (driving) and her father's friend (in the passenger seat). The friend slung his arm around the girl, and though it seemed friendly, he was fitting his hand in between her arm and her breast. He never made an overt move, but she felt his fingers feeling around there on the side of her breast for long minutes. She never made a sound or alerted her dad, who was sitting right next to her. She believed that her dad would get mad at his friend and it would be her fault.
Repeat: A predator counts on you to keep your mouth shut. When this girl told her dad about it years later, her dad confessed that he felt something was wrong, but couldn't put his finger on it - he would have stopped the car, put the so-called friend out on the road, and driven straight to the police station to file a report against him. Again, continued attempts to touch you, hold you on his or her lap, or to try to get you away from others should trigger your concern. By the way: this predator continued molesting his adopted daughter for many years and was not discovered until he had molested several other girls as well.

, If this person appears to constantly be following/stalking you, it should be reported. It's a very short step from stalking to escalating to other, more harmful behaviors, such as a sexual attack.

, This step is importance and urgency cannot be overstated - predators depend on your silence. They count on you to keep your suspicions to yourself because you don't want to embarrass anyone, including yourself. If you aren't sure, but are suspicious, tell a trusted adult family member, friend, or teacher, even if it's just to alert them to keep an eye on this person, too.
Each time he or she seems suspicious in any way, and the behavior exhibited alarms you, mention it to a trusted adult or an authority. They might help protect you or report it.
If this isn't the case or if it doesn't work, then avoid the predator whenever possible. Get to know their schedule, favorite places, and how they usually get there. Find alternatives to these locations/routes for you to follow and refrain from telling him or her about them and where you're going.

, Examples: Change your email address, change your number, etc. If he finds something more serious such as your address, then be sure to keep windows shut/latched, and doors locked. Turn off lights and close blinds/curtains at night. If you remain nervous, consider moving - no forwarding address. Give the address only to your trusted friends and family, and make sure they know they are not to share it without your express permission because you are attempting to evade someone who has been stalking you.

, If you continue to feel suspicious or uneasy, but the behavior does not escalate, and you can find no proof to bear out your concerns, talk to this person if you feel brave. Tell him or her, ""You know, you have this thing you do that makes me feel kind of creepy. What's that about?"" There may be a reasonable explanation. If the explanation sets you easier about it, perhaps it will help settle the matter. If you are not interested in explanations, take steps to actively avoid running into this person in the future.

Join a reputable dojo for your style of interest.,
Have honor and pride in your heart every time you fight.,
An excellent example of this is the Shaolin monks.,
Eat right!,
Train at home.,
Find a local venue!,
Never give up.",How to Be a Good Fighter,"


There is a big difference between Traditional styles of fighting which focus on Katas (Forms) and preserving the history of the art form with some minor point system sparring, these are beautiful and artful styles rich in benefits to your health and mental well-being which are to be respected, but not used in a real fight, or to be a real fighter and any honest teacher will tell you the same.
Functional styles of fighting which are meant to defend yourself in life or death situations, or to take control of a given situation when necessary where you will train rigorously and to the point of physical and mental exhaustion against other people of various builds, with little to no rules other than that you respect your partner and do not injure anyone.
Don't let this scare you away, the people that attend these dojos are 99.9% the nicest people you will ever meet, people like you who want to be a good fighter. You will get hurt, whoever hurt you will apologize profusely, you will recover and you will be stronger for it.
If your dojo is not like this, find another dojo. The best fighters do not talk smack or disrespect one another.;
,


If you defeat someone in the street, you should have respect for them. Make sure they are OK and do not be sarcastic or offensive. Offer to buy them a drink or get some food, tell them about your dojo and the positive effect it has on you, suggest that they join so you can have more matches together (even if they were a pushover).
As a fighter, it is important to spread respect and a positive attitude to people around you, especially your enemies and especially if you just knocked them out.
Winning a fight on the street and then being a jerk about winning, will only bring you and the people you love misfortune. If you succumb to their antics, you have lost as the person you strive to be.
Make them play your game, you are the stronger individual. Who knows you may save a life, or make a best friend. A fighter does not know someone until he has fought with them. So that jerk you just knocked out at the bar, might turn out to be your best friend, having a bad night.
Traditional styles, if taught by a proper instructor, are very useful and can be deadly to an untrained opponent.
Whatever you do, DO NOT take the fight to the ground. Styles such as JiuJitsu are only useful against one opponent in a secure area. In the street, his friends will beat down on you if you are doing some fancy choke hold.
Striking arts such as Taekwondo and Karate (along with many others) are the most useful against multiple opponents or against someone with a knife. These are styles focused around conditioning your body to receive and deliver blows. This is why an average person simply cannot fight someone who trains to fight.

,


Shaolin monks who showcase their amazing features of superhuman strength. The fact is, as any of them will tell you it is very simplistic rigorous conditioning done over a period of years on a schedule. Leading to things like, breaking a baseball bat with your shin kick. Breaking cement blocks with your head. Punching through a lot of wood.
Any of these features will normally shatter bones, cause horrible compound fractures and trips to the hospital. Worked up to very slowly and diligently over the course of years and it is an eventuality. Keep in mind that unless you train 10-14 hours a day, you will never be as good as hardened as a Shaolin monk, who lives to preserve their teachings. DO NOT shin kick a baseball bat.
Your average person on the street is on one end of the spectrum, and a Shaolin monk who spends his entire life conditioning his body to be as hard as iron is on the other end. You at your best as a fighter will fall somewhere in the middle.

,


If you are training to fight on top of your everyday responsibilities you will need to consume 2 to 3 times your normal values of calories. Professional fighters consume around 6000 calories a day!
If you cannot afford to eat good solid meals with lots of protein and vegetables, be very careful about the intensity of your training. Do not over-exert yourself! Try eating 4 or 5 small meals a day, instead of 3 big meals. Buy wholesale (bulk) protein/vitamin bars and drink lots of water.

,


Run over in your head throughout the day things to improve on, where you made mistakes in your sparring or in fights you have lost outright. Think of ways to improve each angle and scenario.
Shadowboxing is essential to any style and is not boxing it can be whatever your style, work on perfecting your moves. Do not be embarrassed, good shadowboxing translates to good form and style in a fight. Try to use a wall or bag you can tap (lightly) to keep an idea of your range relative to the position of your stance.
Train for every possible encounter in and out of the ring. While walking around outside, consider what could be used as a weapon, what materials are around you that could aid/hinder your ability to defend yourself. Never get backed into a corner. Do not form habits of walking near ledges, curbs, or anything that could send you off balance should you be surprised.

,


Have you been training for a few months, are now in great shape and have a good understanding of how to fight properly. It may be time to test your skills against other fighters at a local venue. Most communities have them, you will be surprised.
Test your skills and learn to improve where it counts. When you lose, do not be disappointed, be happy that you found some things to work on. A good fighter would be bored if he won every match easily.

,


You will experience hard times and nasty injuries in your training. Through it all though you will wake up one day to find that you are a great fighter.
Never use the power you gain to control people, it is a demon you will have to fight as you become stronger than most people. You will want to be in charge and you will fail to understand why people of authority, have authority over you.
Do not let people push you around, but do not go around looking for a fight either. If you succumb to this, you have failed yourself and everyone who has trained you. Be strong mentally as well as physically.

Mitigate the risk.,
Start with the outward appearances of your home.,
Know what your weak spots are.,
Be sure you have the right type of firearms.,
Have the right type of ammo.,
Know your house and know how to clear it the right way.,
Be aware of potential hiding spots.,
Don't be a hero.",How to Be Safe at Home Through the Use of Firearms," Asking what firearm is the best for home defense is not where anyone should begin. There are three words you need to implant into memory for any and all situations in this life: Mitigate The Risk.;
, Shrubbery, close proximity fencing, and other general blind zones will make you a target. Big shiny toys in your yard you use to make your neighbors jealous are also big draws. While an intruder knows he can't hook up to the Bayliner and tow it down the road, it's a pretty good indication that the marriage gods have been appeased with sacrifices of jewelry kept inside. If you're in a war with your neighbor to outdo one another, let him win. You'll end up ahead in the long run.

, It may have 10 locks on it, but it will inevitably be in a blind zone and nothing short of installing cameras or cutting your neighbor's tree down so he can see it will fix the situation. Here an intruder can spend all day testing and perfecting his entry if he so chooses. The best solution here is to give a friendly heads up as to what waits inside whether it be an XXXL dog crate or a pan of policed brass. The threat of personal injury is just as effective implied as it is spoken.

, We've avoided confrontation as much as possible and have done our best to Mitigate The Risk. The first and foremost weapon of choice for home defense is the 12ga pump shotgun. The versatility, availability, and low user learning curve make this the ultimate choice. You can even get pepper spray rounds for it. The icing on the cake however is the intimidation factor. Few things available to the public will elicit as strong a reaction from an intruder as the sound of a shell being chambered in a pump action shotgun.

, Most people will tell you that 00 buckshot is the cure all. While it is devastating, there are a few flaws with this philosophy. First we're dealing with indoors and common walls that in places are nothing but two sheets of sheetrock. Inside a house full of family, 00 just runs too huge a risk.


Target loads are perfect for this. Far less penetration and can still send a message. They are insanely cheap, can be bought in bulk by the 100's, and loading up target -> buckshot sets up a protocol. If you make it to the buckshot before the situation is resolved, then you know you did everything you could. For this, there are an assortment of home defense rounds with low powder charges to help reduce wall penetration.

, This is more important than almost everything else. This only applies should an intruder be between you and a safe exit. Removing yourself from the situation entirely should always be the first course of action. Again, Mitigate The Risk.


Knowing the layout and terrain in a tactical sense improves your odds exponentially. Staying low and hugging walls will give you extra milliseconds should you be noticed. An intruder's first movement to a noise or peripheral glimpse is going to be to where he expects you to be. If you can make sure to not be in that place, should the intruder be armed he will have to search, recognize, and adjust his aim.
Pick a path where everything your eyes look at for the first time is directly in front of you and narrow a field of vision as possible.

, Stairwells if you find yourself at the top of one are by far the best places to hide in wait. Many battles in history have been won by holding the high ground alone. Avoid going from the bottom of stairs to the top at all cost. If you must do this, stay low and out of sight until you can put your back against the wall and stand straight up quickly aiming and searching the landing for targets.

, As soon as you know everyone in your family has made it out, leave immediately and get everyone to a safe location.

Bullies typically have friends following them or rely on bystanders (people who do not tell the bully to stop). Place yourself around friends who care about you and support you. If necessary, ask them to protect you. If you ever feel unsafe you should tell a responsible adult about it.;
, If you are not near the bully, you will not become a victim. Many bullies rely on setting up their victims for embarrassment. Be mindful of what you are doing when near a bully so the behavior does not repeat itself. If a bully seeks you out, you should tell a responsible adult like parents or teachers about it.

, Eye contact is more powerful than any speech or stance. Don't shift your gaze down or look around as if afraid. (Looking away is like an invitation to get hit.) Look straight at a bully or—if it's too difficult—focus on their eyebrows. Make the bully see you as an equal by communicating to the soul of the bully what is happening is not fun, not good, not acceptable. It is natural to feel fear or have tears. Most bullies respect the real courage that comes with eye contact.

, Don't be timid or whiny. Speak assertively or with assurance. Practice this skill in the mirror. Sometimes it helps to be loud and firm. Use assertive body language, looking them in the eyes. If you can't shake the bully, you might be able to convince the people watching not to be bystanders.

, Discharge and redirect the tension that's feeding a potential fight by changing the subject to something else. You might crack a non-threatening joke. The best thing is to ask a question. Try to keep it relevant to your interactions; you don’t want your tactic to appear too obvious. Afterwards, tell a responsible adult what happened.

, Some bullies can be talked down from a fight. Say something that might make them think that you're not worth the effort, like “Why are you picking on me?” You might appeal to their ego to avoid fisticuffs: “Everyone knows you’ll beat me easily if we fight.” If all else fails ask ""What do you want?"" and finish with ""I don't want to fight you."" Remember to be assertive and make lots of eye contact. If they don't seem to listen, you need to walk away. (Be prepared to defend yourself if necessary.) Make sure to tell a responsible adult about it.

, Walk away from the situation with as much calm as you can muster. Most bullies are playing to an audience and it is in your best interests to get them to sympathize for you. If the bully pushes or corners you in an attempt to provoke you to fight, then make escape your top priority. Sometimes it helps to back away so you are always facing the bully. Don’t let a crowd keep you confined; tell them assertively (the louder the better) to let you leave. Be sure to tell a responsible adult about the situation.

, After ANY experience with a bully you should tell a trustworthy adult like a parent or teacher. It is their job to make sure you are safe. Most of the time it will be your role to stand up for yourself, and responsible adults will give you good advice or help you strategize about your problem. It is important that you establish early on what is happening in case it escalates into something serious.


A bully has to answer to someone in authority over them. You'll come to know how different teachers or other people in authority react to bullying situations. Their attitudes vary, so don't look to just one in particular, especially if they seem too busy. Of course, make sure your situation is genuine. It is natural for people in authority to be fair and impartial at first. If after two serious events (such as a fight, real threat, or severe humiliation) they do nothing to prevent or reconcile the bullying, explain everything to another responsible adult.

, When a fight seems imminent, body language is your best weapon! Don’t overact the role and appear silly. Tell the bully you are not joking or playing. If you appear serious in defending yourself, the bully will think twice about fighting or physically harassing you. More importantly, at this point bystanders should be watching and hopefully realize the bully is being mean. Look the bully in the face. Focus on how the bully moves and adjust your position confidently. You are essentially committing yourself to fighting so be prepared to give one! Even if you don’t exchange blows, tell a responsible adult afterwards.

, Exaggerating how strong or fast or tough you are is an invitation to fight for any bully. Stand your ground, face the bully, and let them make the first move. Sometimes the unknown is just enough to shake a bully's confidence. Maybe just enough.

, Act like you are going to enjoy what is about to happen, though more than likely it will be the opposite. Usually, if you look at a bully and smile, s/he will think something is up. It is an easy way to start to psyche him/her out and may be that little extra nudge to dissuade. And if the bully asks why you are smiling don't say anything; keep smiling and just relish in the thought that the bully is now a little scared.

, If you are forced into a confrontation and feel that a fight is going to happen, as a last resort there are several things you can do to protect yourself:


Put your hands up by your face, like a boxer. This will protect you, especially the nose and eyes. Good sight is important in a fight, obviously. Always return to this “ready” position.
Tighten your stomach in case the bully tries to punch you there.
Turn a little sideways so your body is not as big a target.

, Your life is not set in a movie. Fighting will undoubtedly get you into trouble with parents or the authorities. You should also think about how the bully’s friends will react to you afterwards. Fighting people in real life has consequences. Don't get involved in something you aren't ready to justify adequately. You might be expected to apologize later to the jerk.

, If fighting is imminent with a bully, act and fight like you've got nothing to lose! You do this only to prevent future bullying, not for revenge. A few fast and hard punches to the stomach or the face should be plenty to stop a bully. Sometimes all you have to do is knock a bully down to the ground. Be sure to do it in a public place with witnesses. Even if you get embarrassed or beat up, in the end you’ll have proof you need for the bully to eventually get punished and your problem solved. Don’t dare to forget to tell your parents you were in a fight.

Avoid listening to music.,
Don’t play with your smart phone.,
Look around.,
Travel on well-lit streets.,
Ask people about the part of town you’re walking in.,
Review a map or ask for directions before you start your walk.,
Travel with a group.,
Walk with a local.,
Seek help if you are being followed.,
Stay in well-populated areas.,
Dress like a local.,
Avoid displaying signs of wealth.,
Walk with purpose.,
Don't walk around late at night.",How to Avoid Being Mugged," When walking in public, you should avoid listening to music on a cell phone or other personal listening device. The music could distract you from various dangers, and someone could take advantage of you as you’re listening to your music., While it may seem like a normal thing to do, playing with or checking texts on your smart phone could distract you. A mugger may see this and identify you as a potential victim.


In addition to your phone being a distraction, it might also be something a mugger wants to steal., As you walk, make sure to look around. Walk with your head up and look from side to side occasionally. Ultimately, the more you are aware of your surroundings, the easier it'll be able to avoid being mugged.If you see someone suspicious or threatening, walk away from them.
Be careful turning corners. Try to make a long turn so you can see what’s around a corner before you turn it. After all, there could be a mugger waiting on the other side of the corner.

, The more light on a street, the less likely a person will try to mug you without fear. As a result, stick to streets that have lots of light. In addition, avoid dark streets and dark areas of town.


If you’re going into a dark area, bring a flashlight.
Avoid shortcuts that are dark. Saving a couple of minutes isn’t worth jeopardizing your safety., If you’re unfamiliar with a certain area, you should ask locals about it before you walk around. This way, you’ll have an idea of whether an area is dangerous or not before you hit the street., Before you set off on a walk around town, have a good idea of where you’re going and how you’re going to get there. You can do this by asking directions or by consulting a map before you start on the walk. This way, you won’t have to stop and ask strangers for directions or look to the map app on your phone – things that make you look vulnerable., If you think you’re in a high-risk location, you can lower your chances of being mugged by walking with a group. Muggers are much less likely to approach a group of people when they can simply target an individual.


If you’re leaving a bar at night, walk to your car or home with a group of people. In addition, consider having one person drive everyone else to their cars or homes – if their cars or homes require a long walk., If you’re in an area you’re not familiar with, you’ll be much safer if you walk with a local. Locals will not only know what areas of town are dangerous, but they’ll likely fit in more and may not be targeted by a mugger.

, If for any reason you suspect you are in danger or are actively being followed, you should seek help immediately. You can do this by approaching a nearby police officer or by walking into a bar, restaurant, or store.


If you walk into a public establishment, make sure to wait enough time until you are sure the person following you has left. If you’re not sure, contact the authorities.
If there aren't police or safe establishments around, continue to walk confidently and briskly to an area you know is safe., Muggers are much less likely to strike in places where there are a lot of people around. As a result, try to walk in areas where there are a lot of people.If presented with two routes to your destination, pick the one with more people.

, If you’re visiting an area you’re not from, try to dress as much as you can like someone who lives there. This is because muggers and other criminals often target people who are tourists or visitors.


If you have any, wear domestically made clothes instead of designer imports.
Avoid wearing t-shirts that show you’re a tourist. For instance, if you bought a shirt at a local tourist attraction, wait until you are home to wear it.

, If you're in an impoverished or unfamiliar area, don’t wear expensive watches, jewelry, sunglasses, shoes, or display electronics. In addition, keep as little money in your wallet as possible and don’t display a lot of money if/when you purchase something.If you have to transport jewelry or expensive items, conceal them.

, Move along a street or sidewalk as if you know where you’re going and know what you’re doing. If you walk in a timid and unsure manner, a mugger could spot you as a vulnerable person.Avoid looking around nervously as if you are unsure of where you are or what you’re doing.
Avoid taking pictures of every little thing on the street. While something might make a great photo op, your interest may signal that you’re a tourist.
Take self-defense classes so you can defend yourself. While this won't prevent you from being mugged, it will bolster your confidence.

, Since there are very few people walking at night, you'll draw attention to yourself by being on the street very late. Even if you're with a group, you'll increase your chances of getting mugged. Instead of walking:


Take a cab.
Call a friend.
Return home early.

,, What can he/she see? What are the lighting and obstacles that he/she is looking at from his angle? Understanding your target is essential. By putting yourself in their shoes, you can tell what they can and can't see.

, Take care not to make it too obvious. Take time researching as much as possible about your target location to decide if it is the best for hiding purposes.

, The smaller you are, the less there is to be seen.

, Remember that being seen is more than just visual; if someone hears you, then he/she will look directly at the sound, which will give you away.

, Even if you tell a well-trusted friend, he/she may spill the beans about where you are. Control of information is critical to secrecy. Find out where everyone else is, and keep your own information secret.

, Be like others and no one will recognize you. If you are in a large crowd, sometimes anonymity is better than secrecy. In that case, know the crowd, and act/look/sound like everyone else.

, Once you've looked someone in the eye, they'll be attracted to examine you further.

,How to Avoid Getting Hurt1,
"
Stay relaxed and calm.,
Turn your body and tuck.",How to Avoid Getting Hurt2," Relax and prepare to break your fall.

, Slowly but swiftly, turn your body in a motion that will prevent you from falling on your neck or back. Tuck your chin into your chest and keep your arms close to your body. Bend your knees. Landing on your back is actually a fairly safe way to fall, as it's rare to break your back if you fall on it flat, but it hurts and will knock the wind out of you, making it hard to breathe for a few minutes.

"
"
Prepare to feel some pain.,
Bend your knees.,
Use your knees and hips as shock absorbers.",How to Avoid Getting Hurt3," This is probably going to hurt, but try hard to put the balls of your feet toward the ground and stay very flexible.

, Once you know you can land on your feet, slightly bend your knees.

, Tuck into a ball at first contact with the ground. When you land, land on the balls of your feet and roll. This will lessen the impact by a great deal.

"
"
Stay calm and focus away from any pain you may be feeling.,
Use any body part available to tilt or top the object to where you can roll it off you.",How to Avoid Getting Hurt4," Try to not think about the pain. Think of something else that will calm you down.

, Getting any part of the object's weight off your body will make it easier to get the rest off. Once the object is slightly off of you, pull yourself out as quick as possible. If your chest is under the object do whatever you can to get it off your chest so that you can breathe freely. A good ability to draw a full breath will make you stronger than if you're trying to move something heavy without being able to draw a deep breath.

"
"
Stay still.,
Ice it.",How to Avoid Getting Hurt5," After you land, don't move. Make sure your peers know that you believe you are fine, but that you're in pain. You'll have an urge to move around but don't - wait for EMTs to check you out thoroughly and release you. It would be supremely stupid to survive a fall on your head or neck without having serious spine injury only to start moving around and turn a tiny hairline fracture into a lifetime in a wheelchair. Be sure a doctor signs off on you before you decide to take your life in your hands.

, Lay down and put ice on whatever hurts or is turning into a bruise. Heat later - ice first.

Players pretend to catch feelings quickly.,
Players love to give nicknames.,
Players love to ask you about your sex life.,
Players love to spoil you with compliments.,
Players will start to talk about their lives.,
Players love to pull the line, ""I would treat you better than that - I would never do you wrong."",
Players will not want to be seen in public or have a public relationship.",How to Avoid Being Played," They will call every night, text all day, and perhaps even fall asleep on the phone with you at night. As flattered as you might be, know that it is all a trap! His goal is for you to get used to it. By doing the above, he is getting that routine stored into your brain, so that the next week when he stops talking to you, you're already head-over-heels for him. If you want to keep a player around you, you need to take your time. When he tries to fall asleep on the phone while still talking to you and events similar to that, do not let it happen. One way to make this work is to avoid allowing the phone conversation to last over an hour.


How does it work? It was a routine of yours - you are so used to talking to him all night, but he suddenly isn't talking to you. As a result, you'll begin to miss him. That's when you hit him up, and then he knows he has you wrapped around his finger.;
, Most of the time, he will give you a nickname to make situations cute and along those lines. However, he is giving you a nickname to make you feel more of a connection to them. Some guys are quick to call you ""babe"", ""honey bunches"", or ""cutie pie"". If you catch that in the player you've got, watch out and be warned: players can be sweet talkers and smooth with their words.

, Although guys may be naturally curious about it, the number of guys you've slept with isn't essential to building a good, genuine relationship.

, ""Babe, you are so beautiful"" may be one of them. Even if you felt so ugly that day, there will always be this one guy saying, ""Oh, you look beautiful"" or ""You look great"" for no reason. As flattered as you may feel, remember that they are complimenting you to make you feel good about yourself. When a girl feels good about herself, their confidence level goes up, and she'll be willing to do anything to get that confidence even higher. Also, guys are aware that girls love compliments.

, They might say something similar to ""I've been hurt in the past."" They are opening up and making you feel that you have a closer connection to them. It is all for sympathy points! They will burst out with emotions and will talk about how they have been played before, how they have been hurt really badly before, and that they know how you feel. Chances are they have been heartbroken before, but that heartbreak is what lead them to become a player. A lot of the times players pull the line, “I’m a changed man, I have had my share of playing games. But those days are done; I just want to meet someone that can keep me on track.” Girls start feeling sympathy for them, and they want to be there for them. Naturally, when a girl sees a guy is heartbroken, girls like to comfort them and give them a shoulder to lean on. The more they want to be there for the players, the more girls get to know them. However, the more they get attached, the harder it is for them to pull out.

, A lot of the times, girls are vulnerable. When girls see that a guy is understanding, they begin to think that this guy will be the one and that they will not break their hearts. Just because the guy claims that he will treat her better doesn't necessarily mean he will keep that promise in the future.

, One example is on Facebook. Players will not want to be seen in public with you - not because they are shy, or they are scared, or their friends will make fun of them - but because he might run into one of his other girls he is talking to when your back is turned. The player will not want to change his relationship status on Facebook or talk about you on Facebook. A lot of the times, they claim they are not ready, or they just do not want to be seen in public with you. The truth is they do not want to make it seem like they have anything to do with you because that shuts down their market of getting other girls. There is a 50 percent chance that he really is not ready for a relationship, but there is a 50 percent chance that he just does not want to be tied down. If any guy really likes you, he would want to have that tie with you so that no one else can claim you.

Stay safe at all times.,
Damage the soft spots on your opponent.,
Attack their legs.,
Attack your opponent from behind.,
Head butt your opponent fast and hard.,
Learn to grapple.",How to Win a Street Fight1," Though you may not get to choose where a fight breaks out, there are things that you can do to increase your safety in a self-defense scenario. Avoid fighting in the middle of the street or on hard sidewalks, concrete, or places with sharp or hard edges like concrete steps.


If your aggressor pulls out a weapon like a knife or a pipe, you should just try to run away from them.If someone is trying to rob you at gunpoint, you should give them whatever they want instead of risking serious injury or death.
Sometimes self-defense and self-preservation means submitting to force to stay alive.;
, Attacking areas like the face, temples, throat, kidneys, solar plexus, may eventually incapacitate your opponent.Scratching, biting, clawing, spitting, pulling hair and attacking eyes can also be used. You are defending yourself from a violent aggressor, not fighting in a ring with rules. Use anything you can to ensure your safety. Use eye gouges and attack their throat with strikes.


Hitting the nose blurs the eyes and causes pain, and it just might leave your opponent dazed long enough to get away.

, Low kicks should be aimed towards shins, ankles, the insides or back of calves or thighs and kneecaps (if their legs are straight). Do not aim higher than knee or waist height because they will grab your leg. If you have an object like a bat or pipe, you can also aim for their legs. If your opponent is unable to walk or pursue you, you can get away safely without continuing the fight.

, Attacks from behind are difficult to see and avoid, and in a real fight, it is not cowardly to strike from behind. Watch your back, and attack that of your opponent(s). Use lateral movement to move side to side and circle your opponent. Attacking your opponents legs or getting control of his arms from behind may allow you to hold them down long enough for help to arrive.

, Bring the top your forehead down to their nose and face. A headbutt can easily knock someone out or break bones in a person's face. Make sure to tuck in your chin and strike with the top of your head. Aim for the area containing their eyes, nose, and mouth., A successful grapple can put you in control, even if the attacker is much stronger or faster than you. Popular grappling styles include Brazillian jiu-jitsu, sambo, and wrestling. Learn how to submit, slam, or choke your opponent if you want to end the fight early. Getting positional control when the fight goes to the ground is also incredibly important."

Trust your instincts.,
Make safety a priority.,
Set boundaries.,
Use your voice.,
Manage your emotions.,
Take charge of your life.",How to Avoid a Fight at School2," It's important to learn to defuse a bad situation. But it is equally important to take steps to avoid tough situations altogether. Spend time thinking about changes you can make to stay away from potential fights.Go with your gut feeling. If you are walking home and see a group of kids standing on the corner, you might feel like there would be a problem if you walked by them.
Avoid the situation by taking a different route home. It might cost you a few extra minutes to change directions, but it could also help you avoid a fight.
The same is true for when you are actually in school. If you see a group of kids that look suspicious, don't engage with them. Use a different route to get to class.

, You could get hurt if you get in a fight. That is why it is important to always be conscious of your safety. It's a good idea to be aware of your surroundings.Try to travel with friends. If possible, walk with others in between class.
A bully will be less likely to approach you for a fight if you are with other kids. You should also try to sit with friends at lunch.
If you are worried about your safety, try to stick close to adults. In the cafeteria, sit at a table close to a lunch room monitor.

, You can make it clear that other kids need to respect your personal space. Setting boundaries is a great way to avoid getting in a fight. Establish clear lines that should not be crossed.If someone bumps into you try saying, ""I would appreciate it if you could stay further away from me."" Speak firmly and politely.
Maybe you need to leave the room and someone is blocking your path. You can say, ""I would like you to get out of my way, please.""
By setting boundaries, you are making it clear that you wish to avoid fighting. This is a better choice to make than shoving someone out of your way.

, Your words are your most powerful weapon. You can use your voice to help avoid potentially dangerous situations. For example, if you see other kids fighting, you can use words to defuse the situation.Try using logic. Instead of getting physically involved, you can say ""You are going to get in trouble if you keep fighting. I know neither of you wants to get suspended from the basketball team.""
You can also use your words to get help. Tell an adult if there is a fight starting. This is a choice that can help you to stay out of danger.
Always try to speak clearly and confidently. You want others to know that you mean what you say.
Be respectful. Do not use your words to instigate problems.Instead of mocking someone, try saying, ""I know you're better than this. I don't think you really want to fight.""

, One of the main reasons that people fight is because they allow emotions to get the best of them. Fights are usually caused by anger, stress, or fear. Learning to control your emotions can help you stay out of fights.There are several things you can do to manage stress. For example, you can concentrate on the positive things in your life.
Maybe you are stressed because someone in your family is sick. Instead of focusing on that at school, take a moment to be glad that you get to spend some time with your friends.
There are also effective ways to control your anger. For example, you can practice deep breathing techniques. Count to five while you slowly inhale, then count to five as you slowly exhale.
Talk about your feelings. If you are coping with some difficult emotions, speak to a friend, parent, or teacher.

, All of us have bad days. Sometimes you might feel like snapping at someone, or you might feel like you have an especially short temper. Just remember, you can choose how you handle those days.It's normal to have bad days. But you can try to minimize those occasions by focusing on the positive things in your life.
If you find yourself about to say something mean, find something else to think about. Try saying to yourself, ""Ok, I'm annoyed now, but I'm really looking forward to playing video games later.""
Maybe someone said something hurtful to you at school. You can use the same coping tactics for dealing with someone who wants to physically fight you.
Take care of yourself physically. Make sure to get enough rest and physical exercise. These will help stabilize your mood and help you avoid the urge to fight.

Talk to your parents.,
Ask a teacher for advice.,
Spend time with your true friends.,
Use online resources.",How to Avoid a Fight at School3," Maybe other students try to pick fights with you. Or maybe you feel the urge to fight with someone else. Either way, dealing with potential aggression can be a very emotional experience. Look for people who can help support you.Your parents can help you deal with this tough situation. Ask them if you can talk.
Be specific in your request. Say, ""Mom, can I talk to you about a tough problem I'm dealing with?""
Be open and honest. Tell your parents exactly what the issue is. Work together to try to find a solution.

, Teachers are another very helpful resource. If you have a teacher that you are close to, consider asking that person to offer you some tips. You can ask to keep your conversation confidential.Tell your teacher your concerns. For example, you can say, ""I have been arguing a lot with Jason lately. I'm worried that we might get in an actual fight.""
You can also try talking to the school guidance counselor. Counselors are trained to help students deal with difficult situations.
Consider talking to a coach or an adviser of one of your after school activities. Any adult who knows you will likely be able to help you think of some ways to avoid fights.

, You're likely busy with school, activities, and chores. But don't forget to make time to hang out with your friends. Friends are an important resource, too.Your friends can make you laugh. When you are more relaxed, you will be less likely to be tempted to fight.
Spend time with people who are genuine. You and your friends should be kind to one another. You should also be honest with each other.
If you're having an issue with a classmate, tell your friend about it. Say, ""I'm worried I might get in a fight. Can you sit with me at lunch next week?""

, Junior high and high school can cause stress. It is difficult to find a positive way to deal with changes as you get older. Just remember, there is always someone who can listen.Use the internet. There are lots of discussion forums and chat rooms devoted to helping teens.
Look for a site that offers advice for fighting bullying. You can learn to avoid bullies, and to avoid becoming one.
Consider going to a site such as Teenline.org. You can choose to chat, text, e-mail, or talk on the phone to someone who understands what you're dealing with."

Be aware of your environment.,
Stand at a safe distance.,
Obtain a weapon.,
Close the distance when you're ready to attack.,
Stay as relaxed as you can, and breathe deeply.,
Establish your balance so that you can stay on your feet.",How to Win a Street Fight2," Aside from various objects that can be used as weapons and traps, knowing where to run is very important – especially when you're outnumbered. Use all of your senses. Don't just look around aimlessly, stay focused on what you might have to do.

, You should stand safely away from your opponent unless you are ready to strike. The attacker needs to close distance to strike you, so staying just out of their reach means they cannot hit you. Try to stay on the side of the opponent, rather than face them head on. Remember that they can be an obstacle to themselves. Keep your guard up. You can cross your arms, which will allow you to bring them up and protect your face if they lunge at you.

, According to the rules of ""reasonable force,"" it is your right to use as much force as necessary to ensure your own safety. If you pull a knife (or another weapon) on a guy and he continues the confrontation, then he pushed you to defend yourself. Living is your priority – damaging or intimidating your opponent enough to let you get away is your method.


Look for anything that you can use for a weapon like a broom handle, a bat, or garbage can cover.

, Most people find it uncomfortable and unexpected for someone they attack to be right up in their space. Another advantage of staying in close is that your attacker won't be able to fully extend their arm, and it will reduce the power of their punching.Try to wrestle the person to the ground and get control over their body. If they are laying on their back, they won't be able to punch as hard as if they were standing up.

, The more relaxed you are, the harder you will strike and the less susceptible to injury you will be. Regulate your breathing by breathing in deeply through your nose and exhaling out of your mouth. Short shallow breaths will tire you out quicker and could tip the fight in your opponent's favor.The more excited or stressed you are, the quicker you will fatigue in a fight.

, Spread your legs to shoulder width and bend your knees. Going to the ground is very dangerous to the untrained fighter, especially if the opponent has weapons, back-up, or ground-fighting experience. If you find yourself tangled up with them, break away any way you can."
"
Walk away from the fight.,
Know when and how to run.,
Be as loud as possible.,
Escape as soon as your opponent(s) are incapacitated.,
Apologize for your actions.,
Understand the seriousness of fighting.",How to Win a Street Fight3," Although obvious, the best way to win a street fight is to refrain from fighting in the first place. In the majority of street fights, there will be a warning before actual physical aggression occurs. Try to resolve the fight before it breaks down into fighting. In verbal disputes, stay calm and take a firm but take an apologetic approach. Remain neutral and non-confrontational. You can try to apologize to the person and explain that you didn't mean to do whatever angered them in the first place.


Signs that someone wants to fight you include clenched fists, an aggressive posture, and yelling or cursing.You can say something like, ""Hey, I'm sorry that you took it that way, but I didn't really mean anything by it. Sorry for the misunderstanding.""
If they keep approaching you, remember to keep your hands up or arms crossed just in case they attack. You can say something like ""Hey man back up!"" or ""I'm not trying to have a fight right now, please give me some space.""

, If you are outmatched, outnumbered, or just not willing to fight, then you should run at the first opportunity towards a public, well-lit area with other people. When escaping in the middle of a confrontation, try to impede your opponents as much as possible by blocking them with obstacles.


If you can put a trashcan, car, bus, or another barrier between you and the attacker, all the better.
Run between narrow paths, such as between cars, a narrow stairwell or a narrow hallway. This will prevent the opponents from ganging up on you.
If you know you won't outrun them, don't try. If you are caught (especially with multiple attackers), you are more likely lose the fight due to a simple lack of energy. If you find yourself in this situation, turn around and get ready to defend yourself.

, Don't be afraid to scream or yell out for help. Look for any authority figures like the police or security guards. Being loud and shouting brings unwanted attention that your attacker would rather not have. It also distracts them and could make them panic, making them less conscientious fighters. If other people see the potential fight, your attackers may be less inclined to use physical violence.


You can yell something like, ""Help, this guy is attacking me and trying to hurt me!"" or ""I need help, someone call the police!""
When you ask for help, identify a person and look them in the eyes before you begin to yell at them.
If you make a scene your aggressor may just walk away.

, Phone the police or alert some other authority as soon as you can. Let them know where you are, where the attack occurred, and describe your attackers. Don't try to stand your ground and beat up everyone if you have to fight multiple people. Find your first opportunity to leave and take it.

, If you've done something to anger someone to the point where they want to physically assault you, there's a chance you may have done something to provoke them. Think about your actions and apologize and walk away from the person. Try to understand things from their perspective, and make sure that your apology is genuine. Even if you don't understand why they got mad, try to feel empathy towards their anger and diffuse the situation instead of escalating it.


For instance, if someone is yelling in your face and getting aggressive, you can say something like, ""Hey, I'm sorry I spilled your drink man. It was really crowded, and I got bumped into you. I really didn't mean to mess up your shirt. Are we cool?""
If you said something to offend someone you can apologize by saying, ""I didn't mean to offend you with my comment. I thought about it and I realized I was being ignorant. I really am sorry. Can we drop it and move on?""

, Assault charges can range from a misdemeanor to a felony. If you provoke a fight and seriously injure the other person, you can be charged by your state and serve prison time. The penalties for a serious assault charge can range from a year of probation up to life in prison in some states.Fighting also risks your own health, well-being, and life. You should really avoid fighting at all costs when on the streets.


If you want to get out your aggression or you enjoy fighting, consider joining a gym that trains in mixed martial arts.
Other types of gyms that you can join to get fighting practice include Muay Thai and American boxing gyms.

Keep your wits about you.,
Create physical distance.,
Assess whether or not it'll work to talk.,
Ignore the insults or negative comments your opponent is flinging your way.,
Avoid escalating an argument.,
When trying to avoid a fight, keep eye contact and try to keep an eye on the hands.,
When all else fails, turn away and leave.,
Be careful when you try to walk away.",How to Walk Away from a Fight," Anger, panic, fear, and frustration are all emotions guaranteed to cause you to fall apart and see red rather than think clearly about what is happening. This is all the more reasons walking away is the best option often, to create the distance needed to cool down.


It's highly recommended that you learn to avoid getting yourself into situations that threaten fights as an inevitable outcome. Keep an eye out for danger signs, like the building up of high tension, the presence of alcohol, a too-late night, or somebody who is upset over something/somebody else already, and stay away. Attempt to defuse the situation as soon as it arises.;
, The other person is likely as riled and angry or afraid as you are and this makes things volatile. By stepping back or standing away, you make the first call to not engage any further in fighting. Keep your distance––if the other person comes closer, move away again.

, In many cases, the emotions are just too heightened for a discussion. However, if it seems that talking might work, throw some hooks as an invitation to talk instead of fight. For example: Say something like: ""Hey buddy. I don't want this. You don't want this. Let's be reasonable and talk it out.""


This may not be the right time to work out the deepest, darkest motives of the other person. But it is a good opportunity to acknowledge his or her anger or frustration in ways that show you are paying full attention to their grievance.
Avoid slinging shots, such as saying things like ""this is all your fault"", ""you're gutless"" or ""you think with your fist, not your brain"". These sorts of comments will just further inflame things.

, This is to be expected and you should be ready for it. You might hear yourself being called a coward, weak and all manner of angry and taunting things. These are the last offenses of the angry opponent who sees a chance for a fight deflating, the last ditch efforts to rile you into returning to the fight. Recognize them for what they are and don't personalize them.


You may hear taunts related to members of your family or other people you care about. Again, let it roll like water off the duck's back. Your opponent is trying all sorts of tactics and nobody's dignity is being maligned simply because this person says ridiculous things. Don't look on it as an issue of pride––look on it as an issue of an idiot straining to provoke you.

, There may be principles you want to stand on, points you wish to ram home and views that you think are irrevocably right. You may think that your opponent is all wrong. But none of these beliefs are either wholly accurate or helpful to you. The important thing is avoiding a fight, not arguing petty points about the disagreement you two have.


Don't insult your opponent or become angry with him or her. Just stay calm and do your best to convince him or her that a fight is a bad idea.
If necessary, acknowledge the other person has a valid argument for whatever it is that's instigating the fight, even if you're seemingly in the right. The rights and wrongs of the matter can be untangled later, when everyone has cooled down.

, Discuss the problem and apologize for anything you have caused, even if you're right. While attempting to defuse the situation, it is important to keep your hands in a defensible yet non-aggressive position. Moreover, prepare to defend yourself mentally just in case, as follows:


Be ready to block sucker punches to your face/body, but not in a ""fighting stance"".

Use the ""prayer position"" with both palms pressed together, which looks non-threatening, but keeps your hands up near your face.
Use the ""stay back"" position, hands facing your aggressor palms outward.
Use the ""I'm thinking"" position, with a hand on your chin/head. Remember; try to seem natural while you do this. Keep protected at all times.



, Remember there is no shame in running away––you did your best. Walking away from a fight doesn't determine that you're a coward (no matter how much the other person screams this); it determines that you're mature and thinking responsibly, about not just yourself but about the other person too, and families and friends who will be affected by the repercussions. Above all, remind yourself the alternatives could be much worse: You could die, get crippled, or end in jail. Remember what's important to you and how a fight could impact your life.

, If the other person is very angry, they may simply attack you from behind. When walking away, face the person who is causing your trouble, to prevent them from attacking you from behind, sight unseen. Back away, keep an eye on the person and only turn to actually leave when it is safe to do so, such as in the doorway or getting into your car, etc.


Glance back now and then while seeking to defuse the situation, to check for potential escape routes. Do not turn your head as you look back.

Leave the area if you can.,
Find cover.,
Leave your belongings.,
Stay quiet.,
Don't move.,
Barricade yourself.,
Wait for help to arrive.",How to Avoid Being Shot1," If you are in a situation where other people are shooting each other or someone is shooting at people that aren't you, your main goal should be to get as far away as possible. If you see that you can reasonably get away, do that as soon as you hear shots. If you don't know where the shots are coming from but you know there is a secure room very near by, go there., If you do not see a way to leave, then you will want to find cover. Get behind something that can stop bullets, preferably, like a car or other very solid object. Thin walls or a door is not enough, though it can keep a shooter from realizing you're there. Stay behind the cover, and if it is large enough get on the ground. Lying on the ground significantly reduces the likelihood of your getting shot., Do not stop to gather your belongings before fleeing an area. This can significantly impact the amount of time you have to get away and make a big difference in your ability to get away before the shooter realizes you're there. Just go. You're more important than your wallet.

, While taking cover or fleeing, be as quiet as possible. Breathe slowly and avoid crying. Alerting the shooter to your presence can put you in danger. Don't talk with people nearby or make phone calls. If you can, turn a phone on silent. Text if you want to get someone's help or attention.

, Once you are in cover, stay in cover. Do not move from one cover to another unless you absolutely have to. Staying put will also reduce the amount of noise you make and draw less attention to your presence.

, If you can take cover in a single, secure room, be sure to barricade the entrances. Lock doors, move heavy pieces of furniture to block the doors, cover windows if you can, and turn off lights and anything which makes sounds. Stay quiet and move as little as possible.

, Once you are in a relatively safe place, either barricaded or at least under cover, simply wait for help. This is the only thing you can do. Most shootings last less than three minutes, so while it may seem to last forever, you are unlikely to have to wait for help for very long.

"
"
Assess the situation.,
Escape if you can.,
Take cover if you can.,
Try to find a weapon or distraction.,
Talk to the shooter.,
Get out of the way if they appear to be preparing to shoot.",How to Avoid Being Shot2," If someone is trying to shoot you specifically, you will first want to evaluate the situation. If you are being mugged, comply with everything the person is asking, following many of the instructions in the first section. If you are in a fight, your options are more limited.

, If you are being pursued, do what you can to get away. If you have been caught but see an opportunity to escape or distract the attacker, do that but only if your chances of getting away are fairly good. Turning your back on an attacker makes you easier to hit.

If you are a fast runner or have bad knees, run in a straight line away from the attacker towards cover. The faster you can get away, the fewer shots they will be able to fire.
If you are a slower runner and do not have knee trouble, a zig-zag run may be a better option. You may still be hit in this case, but the chances of being hit in a vital area may be reduced.
If you can, create visual distractions for the attacker, such as spraying a fire extinguisher.







, You may not be able to buy yourself enough time to get away completely, but getting yourself to cover can at least be helpful. Also, if you see that they are about to shoot, dive for cover if you can.

, During your confrontation, look for an object that can be used as a weapon. Heavy objects, especially ones with sharp corners, make good weapons, but if you have access to something a bit more potent, that is best.

, If you have nowhere to go, nowhere to hide and no other options, your best bet will be to talk to the shooter. Do not beg for your life or try to get him to feel sorry for you. Instead, sympathize with him and try to ask him what he wants. Offer to help him and ask him why he's doing what he's doing. This could buy you time until help arrives.

, If they appear to want to shoot anyway, the best you can do is try to get out of the way. Moving at least increases the chances that you will be hit in a less important area, since it is very difficult to shoot accurately while moving.

Remove sunglasses or hats if you have not been seen.,
Make your hands very visible.,
Move as little as possible.,
Be very calm.,
Talk slowly and don't shout.,
Do whatever you are asked.,
Tell the officer what you are doing.",How to Avoid Being Shot3," If you are stopped by police while you're in your car or otherwise have time before they get too close to you (such as before you go into an area known to be frequented by cops), take a second to remove your hat and sunglasses if you are wearing them. If the police are able to see your eyes, they will be much less nervous. However, if the police are already looking at you or next to you, this is inadvisable as the movement will make them nervous.


Again, you should only do this if you have not been seen. If you do this and the cop sees you, they may think you are going for a gun.

, Whether you're in a car or on the street, you need to make your hands very visible to the officer. If you're in a car, put them up on the windowsill. If you're on the street, hold them slightly up and out from your body. This will also reduce the officer's tension.

, Do not reach for anything or move around any more than you absolutely have to. Certainly do not make any sudden movements, as this can be taken as a sign of reaching for a weapon.

, Do not try to argue with the officer and don't let yourself be visibly angry. Even if you feel your rights are being violated, which they very well could be, don't take that up with them. Lawyer up when the confrontation is over and sue them, but absolutely do not get into a fight with them there.

, Speak with officers slowly, calmly, and with an even tone (don't yell at them). This will help show that you are not hostile and will help keep them from panicking. Yes, the burden should be on them to keep their cool, but thinking about what you should've done isn't going to keep you from getting shot.

, If they tell you to stop, stop. If they tell you to get out of the car, get out of the car. If they tell you to put your hands on the wall, put your hands on the wall. Like we said, the time for standing up for your rights is later, not now. All it takes is one overly stressed cop and you're dead.

, Every time you do need to move, tell the officer what you're doing. Let them know why you're moving, where you're moving to, and make those movements slowly. Say these things to them calmly. This will, again, keep them from thinking you are reaching for a weapon.

Stay in safe parts of town.,
Travel quickly through unsafe areas.,
Avoid going out at night.,
Dress to avoid attention.,
Avoid drugs, gangs, and crime.,
Don't start trouble.",How to Avoid Being Shot4," Avoid areas that are high in crime and gun violence. Sometimes these areas are unavoidable, but stay inside as much as you can if you need to be in these areas.

, If you must go outside in areas that are unsafe, go through those areas quickly, rather than hanging out on the street with friends or on your own. Avoid walking to places that you need to go to and instead take the bus or a car (a friend's car or your own).

, Crime rates go up at night, so avoid unsafe and even relatively safe areas once it gets dark. Really, nothing good ever happens at 2am. Just get inside and spend your evening safely.

, Certain types of clothing will attract the notice of cops and suspicious neighbors. While you should be able to wear whatever you want, this doesn't do anything to change the reality. You'll also want to avoid wearing gang colors if you know you'll be going through gang territory. Dressing gangsta and wearing red in certain parts of LA, for example: not very smart.

, Don't get in to drugs, don't get involved with gangs, and don't start a life of crime. In fact, don't even go anywhere near gangs if it can be helped, it's a myth that you need to murder a random person to become part of a gang, but that doesn't mean that it is a good idea to join one. Putting yourself in these dangerous situations will significantly increase the chances of you getting shot at.

, A wise man once said, ""Don't start none, ain't gonna be none"". This means if you don't start trouble, you'll go a long way towards avoiding trouble. Stealing some guys stereo or sleeping with his girlfriend is just not a smart move. Avoid crazy dudes by just avoiding trouble.

Be attentive (rather than drowning yourself out with headphones). Make it a habit to spot an escape route every time you enter a new environment. Avoid dark alley ways and parking lots, and/or get an escort. Don't face the wall when eating out. Lock your windows and doors at night. Carry a cell phone and some safety devices (such as a loud whistle on your key chain). If you are traveling abroad, carry a local paper or magazine in the local language. Read travel precautions online.



Follow your intuition or gut instinct If you get a sketchy vibe from someone, listen to your gut feeling no matter how irrational. Ducking into a store, changing your route and staying in the presence of others are all good strategies to avoid kidnapping by heeding your instincts.
Vary your routes and times make it difficult for would-be attackers to anticipate your plans. Learn multiple ways to go between your home and office or any frequent destinations.;
, The would-be abductor initially gains the upper hand on his victim because he has the element of surprise in his favor. You can prepare yourself by assessing your situation before an abduction occurs. What kind of abduction are you most likely to encounter? What will you do if someone attempts to kidnap you? Rehearse possible scenarios in your mind and you’ll be ready to act instantly should you actually be attacked.

, Holding a key between your fingers (as a stabbing weapon) can seriously damage the tendons in your own hand; however, it can also do considerable damage to them.


If there are multiple armed attackers seeking ransom who attempt to abduct you in an isolated or hostile place where there is realistically little to no chance of escape, you should be cooperative from the get-go. This is frequently the case in parts of South America, for example, where well-organized kidnappers abduct businessmen for profit. About 95% of people abducted in this manner are released alive and the chance of being killed is highest in the first few minutes of the abduction, when something goes wrong — usually when the victim tries to escape or fight.
If the would-be abductor is unarmed, if the attempt is sexually motivated and if you are in the vicinity of other people and can quickly get help, you should fight or do anything you possibly can to escape the attacker. This is the case in most abduction attacks in the U.S. and other developed countries and it's also usually the case if the intended victim is a woman or child.

, If you've made the quick decision to get away, try to get to a safe public place and continue to scream for help. Don't look back and don't stop until you've reached safety. What qualifies as safety depends on the circumstances. The presence of police officers is almost always sufficient, as is being in a crowd of people (though these situations are only safe if you make sure the police or people in the crowd know what's happening). If you're a foreign national in a hostile country, however, you may not actually be safe until you reach a friendly military patrol or embassy.

, You may not be able to outrun your attacker, but if you can put something — a busy street, a group of people, or even a car (which you can run around as he tries to pursue you) — between you and them, you may be able to delay them enough to get away or to cause the attacker to give up.

, Yell to get help. Do not scream. Screaming emboldens an attacker and makes you look and act more like prey. Direct commands first at the assailant to stop, then at bystanders to call the police. Direct commands are often obeyed, whereas screams are often ignored. You want help, not just witnesses. This technique is especially successful in or near public places, where the abductor hopes to remain inconspicuous lest others intervene or call police. For children, who are relatively less able to fight or flee a would-be abductor, involving others is sometimes the only chance of escape. Do not simply scream in terror or yell ""help,"" as people are apt to ignore this plea. You should yell out the circumstances and a description of the attacker if at all possible: ""A man with a knife is chasing me! He's wearing a blue sweatshirt and torn jeans!"" (Children should be taught to yell ""I'm being kidnapped! I don't know this person!"" or ""Help! That's not my mom/dad!"" to other people or ""I don't know you! Leave me alone!"" at the attacker). This should have the effect of deterring your attacker, or convincing bystanders that your plight is real and not a joke/game/quarrel, or at the very least, leaving behind a reliable description for the police to work from if you are unable to evade capture.

, Sadly, people are often hesitant to intervene in an abduction. Get someone's attention and make them intervene by grabbing him or her and holding on while yelling commands (never scream) and explaining the situation. The bystander is now involved in the fight against the abductor, which shifts the odds in your favor considerably, especially if you're a woman or child. If there are no people around to grab, hold on to a large object, such as a lamp post, parking meter, or your bicycle. If you can't get away from an abductor, you at least want to prevent him or her from taking you away against your will.

, Fight tooth and nail to prevent the abductor from getting you under his control. While everyone should take a self-defense course, you don't usually need specialized knowledge to ward off an attack. Nor do you need to ""win"" a fight with your attacker: fighting should usually be used just to get out of the grip of an attacker or to enable you to get a head start running away. If your attacker is a sexual predator and you think your chances of escaping are slim, still put up a fight the entire time. Rapists look for easy targets, not someone who is going to struggle and flail. If you fight hard enough, they may decide you are not a good target and give up. The majority of assaults are stopped at the first sign of resistance. First verbal, then physical. Weapons dramatically reduce the chance of an assault succeeding.


Fight dirty. Do whatever you need to get away: this isn't a boxing match. Pick up and wield any heavy object that is close at hand. If you have mace, pepper spray or a stun gun, use it. (If you own these weapons, practice with them. A weapon forgotten in a purse is useless. This takes practice. Don't just feel safe because you have it on you. Not knowing how to use your weapon merely gives the attacker another tool to use against you.) If an abductor grabs hold of you, don't be afraid or ashamed to make use of your teeth. The seconds you need to escape can be achieved by stunning him with an extreme action like biting off part of an ear, finger, or nose.
Aim for sensitive spots. Poke the abductor in the eyes; hit or kick the groin, nose, throat, or kidneys; scrape your foot hard against his shin; stomp on the top of his foot with your heel, or stomp out sideways into his knee. Your elbows, knees and the palm of your hand are good striking weapons. Your closed fist can be effectively used like a hammer but don't throw punches - without training, you're more likely to break your hand than hurt your attacker. Make your strikes count and do not stop until there is no chance that the attacker will have the ability to continue his attack. One good blow is not enough, it may stun them and make them angry. The idea is to stop the assault, and that requires a critical amount of damage to be inflicted on the opponent. Your aim is never to kill the opponent, just to stop the attack. Death may simply be a side effect of the effort needed to stop the attack. Whatever you do, once you have started the offensive, do not stop until there is no doubt that you can get away safely. They are angry now and probably run faster than you. Hit with elbows and knees until the assailant is no longer capable of pursing the attack. Then go get the police.
Do not flail. Flailing and using your nails wildly will only cause what the police call ""defensive marks"" on the attacker and usually only provides forensic evidence on your dead body. Biting can work to get out of most grips. Or, get your fingers into their eye sockets, the windpipe on the throat, or the groin. If you bite a small area with the front of your teeth in a ""pinch"" as this causes far more pain and damage than a full mouth bit. Once you are out of the hold, hit the assailant as many times as possible with an elbow or knees until you are sure you can get away safely.

, If you have a cell phone, dial the emergency dispatch number for your country. If you can put some distance between you and your attacker, or if you can delay them (by locking yourself in a room, for example), police may reach you in time to capture or at least deter the assailant. If, however, you are immediately subdued, try to conceal your cell phone and then call police when your captor isn’t looking. If you don’t have a cell phone, use any phone available. If you can use a payphone, you may be able to hold onto it. If the would-be abductor cannot quickly remove you from the scene, they may flee, knowing that police are on the way. If you've escaped the attacker, run to a nearby house or business, let them know what happened and have them call the police; this 1) puts you in a safe place, 2) summons police and 3) creates witnesses., You should do anything to make the attacker think they're as unsafe as possible. This means lying about advantages you don't have.


""My dad is the chief of police. You don't want to do this.""
""I have anhydrous diabetic chronic pneumonia . I have to take my medication every three hours or I'll die. If you take me, you're looking at murder charges, no matter what.""
""There's a police station two blocks away. Why are you doing this here?""
Look for anything that seems official and assert that it has cameras: ""There's an ATM right there. You know they all have hidden cameras, right?"" Or if you see anything that remotely looks like a camera, ""You know that's a security camera, right?""
It is best to call the police but if for some reason you cannot (lost cellphone, etc.), you should always tell an attacker that police are on the way. ""I dialed the panic button from my cellphone, police are on the way. Just run now, and you'll be safe.""
If you are in your neighborhood lie and say that a neighbor or the neighborhood itself has cameras and/ neighborhood watch where they report any suspicious behavior. Anyway if you are on a neighborhood street there would be at least 5 people in their homes so they would hear you.
Another thing to do if in a neighborhood or near a house pretend as if you live there and you just going home. Do not show that it's not your house. Either knock or pretend to knock on the door and say your mom/dad/brother/sister/friend's name to act like you're waiting for them to open the door.

, If your efforts to thwart the abduction are unsuccessful, there are a number of things you can do to help you survive your ordeal.

"
Don't get involved.,
Have the right frame of mind.,
Keep things simple.,
Fuel your body to maintain energy.,
Avoid conflicts over parking spaces.,
Move around carefully.,
Use your manners.,
If shopping is something that bores you, find something to occupy yourself.,
Use time out.,
Enjoy yourself.",How to Survive Black Friday with Basic Self Defense," Principle number one of any self defense is to avoid the situation in the first place. Do you really need to buy more stuff for yourself and the others in your life? Why not consider giving them experiences instead, finding ways to help them add memories rather than stuff to their lives? Tell them you're taking them somewhere amazing for the holidays this year or you're going to reclaim the space in your house by throwing out the existing clutter so that everyone can have a better home atmosphere, with less mess holding every household member back from a more fulfilling home life.


Another avoidance technique is to use the online option. Many stores have moved online for the deals on Black Friday. Keep out of the fray with a few mouse clicks instead. Be sure to get in early as the stocks will move fast. However, you can get up early (or stay up late) and then roll right back into bed after the purchasing!;
, Before even setting out, putting yourself in the right frame of mind is vital to your reactions to annoying and even aggressive things happening once you're shopping. Frame of mind is an important element of effective self defense, so make it your number one priority too. Make a pact with yourself that you won't get upset if the items you would like are sold out, in someone else's hands already or only obtainable after waiting in a very long queue. Keep your sense of humor and perspective at the ready throughout the entire shopping experience.


Remind yourself that it's awfully easy to think we're in the right in the heat of the moment. However, we're only ""right"" because we decide that it's so and unfortunately, we're often very wrong when our anger or irritation drive us foremost. Prepare yourself to think rationally during the shopping expedition by asking yourself one single question each time you feel hot under the collar: ""Am I thinking this through rationally?""
Understand that you will encounter unreasonable people. There will be other shoppers who will yell and compete over the items on the shelves. They will not give up, and will likely resort to any measure, no matter how low, to get what they want. You may not be able to get everything on your shopping list, and you may have to live with that. Even if you can't get someone what they really want, you can find an alternative. If your nephew Tim really wanted that new video game, but he's also an avid skateboarder, buy him a shiny new helmet or something that he'll appreciate and enjoy.

, The more things on your list, the more things you allow yourself to be enticed by and the more things you expect from the Black Friday shopping expedition, the more complicated your experience becomes and the greater likelihood that you'll bust a fuse and lose your sense of perspective and purpose. This is just a shopping outing, not a war, not a fight, not a reason to harm others. Some things to help keep the shop simple include:


Have a short, meaningful list. Thinking under pressure will result in poor purchases that you'll regret and a list helps steer you more in the direction of what you know you want rather than being swayed by buying things that just happen to be in front of you while queuing.
Avoid going to Black Friday without a clue what you want, just hoping you'll grab yourself a bargain. If you don't know what it is you want, you definitely don't need it. Stay home and enjoy a day of playing games, reading or chatting with family and friends instead.
Avoid being swayed by promises of ""add-ons"". This complicates your shopping experience––unless you've already researched such add-ons prior to the shop, avoid them as you can't be sure they're useful or needed in the busyness of a Black Friday shop. You can always come back later.

, Eat a healthy, hearty breakfast and take along energy bars. Stop for lunch if you're still around at lunch. Do not deprive yourself of nutritious foods; you need them to keep you calm, centered and thoughtful.


Breakfast should contain both carbohydrates and protein to give you longer lasting energy.

, There is no need to start an argument or a fight with another person because you both want to park right in front of the store. Keep things simple and be prepared to walk some to get to the store; it won't kill you and it'll probably do you some good to get more exercise after Turkey Day.


See the positive side of parking far away––you're closer to a quick exit.
If you do buy something large, ask the store if it has a loading dock you can drive to or if someone from the store can help you. You might even ask them to store the item until the next day, so that you can return and collect it when less people are around.

, In aisles crowded with people and merchandise, it is all too easy to bump into a tense shopper who will start an argument with you just because they're frazzled, tired and overwhelmed by crowds and bright lights. Be considerate but assertive, remembering that ""excuse me"" is a great tool. Everyone is stressed out, and being polite will make everybody's day easier.


Being assertive won't always get you what you want but it is the backbone of a good self defense approach. Conflict tends to occur or escalate when assertiveness is not used, all because the attacker often senses that you're either prone to responding aggressively or timidly. Neither response is appropriate; instead, simply be ready to apologize using manners and avoid allowing yourself to turn it into an opportunity to vent your own frustrations on some unsuspecting, equally overwhelmed person.
If someone attempts to start an argument with you, don't be drawn into it. Say something simple as ""You may be right, I'm sorry"" or simply agree to disagree. Remind yourself that you don't know this person, so you have nothing to prove to them by way of point scoring and that there are no relationship agendas involved!

, Self defense involves manners because manners are a way of deflecting conflict. Say thank you when someone holds a door open for you or picks up something you've dropped. Say please when you want something from another shopper or a retail assistant. And before leaning over to grab that bargain, explain yourself with an excuse me and a brief explanation of what you're about to do. The use of manners will go a long way to defusing anger and avoiding conflict and you set an example for others who might not know better or who have forgotten their own manners for the day.

, While your Aunt Pattie looks at handbags or your spouse looks at Wi-Fi antennas, think of a place in the store that you would like to browse, whether it's the electronics section or the designer coat aisle. Ask whoever you're with to find you there after they find what they need, and head over to where you want to be.


Again, in this case you might like to resort to the avoidance technique outlined above. Either convince this person to leave you at home, or if you do wish to go along for your own reasons, do your brief shopping and then ask them to find you later in a cafe or bookstore.

, If it's all getting to be too much, time out is an honored and effective method within anger management. Anger and frustration can lead to irrationality and abnormal behavior. Not only is that likely to leave you shame-faced but you could harm either yourself or someone else if you act on angry feelings––and all over silly products! If you do feel hot under the collar, pull yourself out of the crazy environment and go somewhere quiet to chill. It might be a cafe, a bookstore, outside, going back home, whatever. Just do whatever it needs to restore your sense of sanity and normalcy.

, This may sound trite and unachievable but if you approach the Black Friday shopping experience with a Zen mindset, a willingness to be polite and assertive and a readiness to drop the chase should it prove futile, you can use this experience to people watch and set a good example through your own good example. Use this as a learning tool and maybe to assert your willpower over not buying things. Count up all the things you wanted but did not buy and congratulate yourself for overcoming consumer cravings and neediness for goods at the end of the trip.

It is important to do this as soon as possible after the assault so that it is easier to track down the witnesses and so that the incident is fresh in their memories.;
, To press charges against your assailant, you will need to visit your local police department, particularly in those situations in which police officers were not called or did not arrive at the scene of the crime.Before visiting the police department, write down the details of how the assault occurred and the name and any other information you have about your assailant. The police will ask you for this information, and it will be easier to recall this information if you have it written down.

, Once you have written down the information necessary to press charges against your assailant, visit your local police department to report the assault.Take the information you wrote down about the assault with you to the police station.

, It may be the case that you are unable to visit your local police department. This may be, for example, because you are afraid of running into your assailant. If so, call the police, explain the incident, and tell them why you are unable to visit the police station yourself. The police should then send an officer to your home who will help you file an assault report.

, When you visit your local police department, the police officer in charge of your case will file an assault report. To file this report, the officer will require from you information about the assault and the assailant.This information includes:


Your name and address;
Your assailant’s name and address (if known);
The place where the assault took place;
The date and time of the assault;
How the assault occurred., It may be the case that you do not recall all of the necessary information required by the police to identify your assailant. If this is the case, the police officer in charge of your case will likely ask you to describe your assailant in as much detail as possible., Once the police officer in charge of your case obtains all of the information needed to file a report, you will be issued a copy of the assault report. Keep this report in a safe place., After the police file an assault report, that report will then be sent to the prosecutor’s office. The prosecutor will, at that point, look at the report and determine if there is sufficient evidence to prosecute the assailant. If there is sufficient evidence to prosecute, a judge will issue an arrest warrant for the assailant.You must wait for further communication during this time.

You may be contacted by the police for further questioning. Cooperate with the police and try to provide as much further information to the police as possible., If you are worried about filing assault charges for fear of retribution from your assailant, know that you can also request an order of protection from the court after filing an assault charge. An order of protection, commonly referred to as a restraining order, prevents your assailant from coming within a specified distance of you. If your assailant violates the restraining order, he can immediately be arrested., To apply for an order of protection, you can visit your local district or county attorney’s office, or through a legal aid service program. The order must be filed in the county in which either you or your assailant lives.Rules on orders of protection vary by state, so you should visit this website to determine what the particular rules are in your state regarding civil orders of protection in the case of stalking or harassment.

, If you have successfully sought an order of protection and your assailant violates that order, immediately call the police. Remember that a protective order is a piece of paper and cannot offer you complete protection. As soon as you find that your assailant has violated the order, immediately call law enforcement for help by dialing 911."
"
Have confidence.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Develop a good attitude.,
Stop viewing yourself as a victim.,
Feel good about yourself physically.",How to Stand up for Yourself1," Developing a strong sense of self-confidence is the first step towards standing up for yourself. If you don't have any confidence or belief in yourself, how can you expect other people to?


It's easy for others to spot when someone is down on their luck and lacking in self-confidence -- which makes them an easy target. If you're confident, people will be less likely to tease you or identify you as weak.
Confidence has to come from within, so do whatever it takes to make you feel better about yourself. Learn a new skill, lose some weight, repeat positive affirmations daily -- nothing will change overnight, but your confidence will grow in time.;
, Goals give you a sense of purpose and control over your own destiny, and they help you realize what you truly want. This is an essential part of standing up for yourself and preventing others from walking all over you.


Motivate yourself by setting an ambitious but achievable goal over the next few weeks, months or years of your life. It could be anything -- a promotion at work, a top grade in your next college paper, or running a half-marathon -- as long as it's something that gives you a sense of self-worth.
When you finally achieve your goals, remember to take a moment to look back on how far you've come and appreciate how much you have achieved. Make a vow that you will never let yourself regress into the unfulfilled person you once were.

, Your attitude is everything -- it impacts how other people perceive you and even how you see yourself. Your attitude sets the tone of your voice, the quality of your thoughts, and is reflected in your facial expressions and body language.Remember that attitude is infectious. If you're bubbly, happy, and bright about things, you'll encourage those around you to feel good about themselves and the world around them. If you're morose, pessimistic, and down about everything, you'll soon infect others with the same negativity.
We naturally prefer to be hanging around the person who makes us feel good about ourselves, and we're more inclined to listen and respond positively to someone who has a good attitude.
By the same token, we're more likely to dismiss a person who tries to play the shrinking violet, the victim, or the permanently oppressed. Make the choice to feel and have a positive attitude and you're on your way to standing up for yourself.

, When you behave as a victim, you do the very opposite of standing up for yourself. Instead, you tend to shrink away from the responsibility of a situation and blame your problems on someone else.


For many people, an inability to stand up for oneself is rooted in the fear of being rejected or laughed at, as a result of similar negative experiences in the past. By choosing to take these negative experiences personally and retreating into your shell, you stop standing up for yourself and start playing the victim.
If you've had negative experiences in the past, the best thing to do is to try to talk through these experiences with someone you trust. This will help you to figure out the root cause behind your victim mentality and allow you to work past it, rather than hiding behind it.

, While you don't need to look like iron man or iron woman, your appearance does matter and looking fit, strong and healthy will give you greater confidence and help you to stand up for yourself.


Choose an activity that you enjoy doing -- whether it's weight training, running, dancing or rock climbing -- and throw yourself into it. Not only will you look and feel better physically, you'll also have lots of fun and become a more interesting, fulfilled person in the process!
You should also consider starting a martial arts or self-defense class. The inner discipline taught will improve your confidence a great deal and the moves you'll learn to defend yourself will double your confidence and allow you to stand up for yourself should you ever find yourself in a physical fight.

Be assertive.,
Learn how to say no.,
Use body language.,
Practice standing up for yourself.,
Stay away from negative people.",How to Stand up for Yourself2," Assertiveness is the key to standing up for yourself. It isn't just a cliché, it's a bona fide means for improving your chances of getting what you want and for being heard properly.


Being assertive enables you to express your wants, needs, and preferences in a way that shows you're prepared to stand up for yourself while still respecting the other person. It involves being open and honest about your thoughts and feelings, while trying to work towards a mutually satisfying solution.
When asserting your feelings and opinions, it's recommended that you use ""I"" statements, rather than ""you"" statements, as this is less accusatory and will prevent the other person from going on the defensive. For example, instead of saying ""you never ask for my opinion"", say something like ""I feel ignored when you make decisions without me"". Assertiveness is, for the main part, a learned skill, so don't feel bad if it doesn't come naturally. There are many excellent books and courses on assertiveness training available. You might like to start by reading the classic When I Say No, I Feel Guilty, by Manuel J Smith, and Your perfect right: A Guide to Assertive Living, by Robert E. Alberti. See also How to be assertive and Communicate in an Assertive Manner.

, Learning how to say no is one of the hardest but most important ways of standing up for yourself. If you tend to be a ""yes"" person who never wants to let anyone down, you risk becoming a door-mat who everyone walks all over and takes advantage of.


For example, if your boss keeps asking you to work late when your co-worker has no problem skipping out the door at 6pm, it can be very difficult to say no. But if this extra workload is putting your personal life and relationships under pressure, you need to put your foot down. Don't put someone else's needs above your own -- learn to say no when necessary.
Learning to say no will help you to stand up for yourself with friends as well as people who intimidate you. Think about that friend who keeps borrowing money but never pays it back; assertiveness will enable you to ask for that money back and to say no next time, all while maintaining your friendship.
People may be taken aback at first, but they will learn to accept your new-found determination and may even come to respect it.

, The manner in which you stand, walk, and sit makes a big impression on people. Positive body language can be used to garner respect, agreement, and trust, while negative body language (slouching, trying to shrink away) is practically an invitation to being pushed about.


Using open body language shows people that you are self-assured, confident and not to be messed with. Open body language includes leaning forward, making eye contact, standing with your hands on your hips and feet apart, using slow and deliberate gestures, facing your heart to people when you meet them and uncrossing your arms or legs.
Closed body language, on the other hand, sends negative signals and could leave you open to attack. Closed body language includes crossing your arms, clenching your hands, using fast and evasive gestures, fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, and turning your body sideways., For many shy people, standing up for themselves is not something that comes naturally, but that's okay. All you need to do is practice -- soon you'll become more confident and more assertive about making your voice heard.


Sometimes you may fail to stand up for yourself simply because you cannot articulate what needs to be said at the right moment. Take the time to write out good responses to difficult situations and practice them with a friend using a timer.
Have your friend pretend to be a difficult or intimidating person who showers you with put-downs. Put on the timer for about 2 minutes and respond away! Keep doing this until you get the hang of it.
You can also practice standing up for yourself in small, everyday situations. For example, rather than quietly accepting the wrong coffee when the barista gets your order wrong, learn to say ""excuse me, I asked for non-fat milk. Could you please make me another?"" Soon you'll have the confidence to tackle bigger, more important issues!

, Another aspect of standing up for yourself is trusting your instincts about other people and learning to act on them. For example:


If another person is bringing you down with their negativity, don't hang around them; start to politely but firmly distance yourself. You don't owe difficult people any explanation as to why you're spending less time around them.
Avoid bullies, negative Nellies, and sarcastic Sams. You don't gain anything from being in their presence and you're not doing them any favors by putting up with their nonsense or rewarding them for bad behavior.
Remember -- keeping away from sources of discomfort and trouble is not running away; it is an important part of learning to stand up for yourself, because it demonstrates that you won't let nonsense and nastiness impact your life.

"
"
Defend yourself in a calm and reasonable manner.,
Don't be aggressive.,
Avoid being passive aggressive.,
Try to turn negatives into positives.,
Don't give up.",How to Stand up for Yourself3," Defend yourself verbally when attacked, provoked, or sidelined and take care of yourself when someone tries to put you down, box you in, or even hurt you physically.


Don't just stand there smoldering; it's far better to speak your mind. Even if the end result doesn't change, you've demonstrated to yourself and others that you won't stand for disrespect.
More often than not, a polite but firm clarification of the disrespectful comment or behavior will be enough to draw attention to the need for it to change, especially where there is an audience. For example: ""Excuse me but I was next in line and I'm in just as much of a hurry as the person who pushed in.""
Avoid whispering, mumbling, or speaking too quickly. The tone of your voice and the speed of your delivery are an important part of clarifying what you want and how confident you're feeling.
Naturally, the manner in which you defend yourself will depend on the situation and if someone is volatile, always put your safety first.

, You should never resort to outright aggression in the process of standing up for yourself. Being aggressive, or even violent, is counter-productive and will not win you any friends.


Acting aggressively -- verbally or otherwise -- is like acting out your pain in full technicolor. It's not a constructive way to get what you want and will simply turn people against you.
You are far more likely to achieve a positive result if you approach any issues as calmly and objectively as possible. You can still stand your ground and be firm and assertive without having to raise your voice or get angry. , Be wary of taking passive aggressive responses toward people and situations.


Passive aggressive responses are ones in which you begrudgingly do things against your will and end up filled with resentment and anger, hating people who ""make"" you feel this way, feeling depressed and helpless.
This negatively affects your relationships and can take a huge toll on your physical and emotional health. Most of all, a passive aggressive approach to life will never enable you to stand up for yourself.

, Another way of standing up for yourself is to take the negatives thrown at you and transform them into good things. In the process of turning attacks inside out to find the good, you'll often find that feelings of jealousy or insecurity are at the root of the attack. For example:


If someone claims you're bossy, rather than letting it cause you to shrink some more, take this as evidence that you're a natural leader, able to manage people and projects well, and a proactive change agent.
If someone claims you're shy, take it as a compliment that means you're not ready to jump on the latest bandwagon but like to reflect over the consequences first and then make up your mind.
If someone says you're too sensitive or emotional, let this be a sign that you've got a big heart and aren't afraid to let everyone see it.
Or maybe someone suggested you're not career-minded enough – for you, that confirms you're living a stress-free life that will help you to live longer.

, No matter how hard you try to increase your confidence, there will be days when you feel that you're backsliding.


Rather than seeing this as a defeat in your attempt to learn to stand up for yourself, see it for what it is – a day or so where things went temporarily off-track before you feel better and bounce back. Some tricks to help the bounce-back process include:
Fake it till you make it. Even if you don't feel confident, act as if you do.
Be consistent in your approach. People will grow to expect that the person you are now is a person who stands up for himself.
Expect some people to find your more assertive stance challenging. It can take time to reshape the patterns you've formerly established with people who used to walk all over you. In some cases, you'll find you no longer want to be a part of their lives; take it as it comes.

Watch for symptoms of injury after the fight.",How to Take a Punch," If you're boxing or participating in a similar sport, wear a helmet and mouth guard. Your head is one of your most vulnerable areas, so don't pass on safeguards.


Even while wearing a helmet, you should still protect your face as described below.;
, Curl your fingertips right up against your palm and place your thumb against the outside of your knuckles. These techniques ""buttress"" your fist, creating a shape that's four times as stable as an open hand.This stability will help you block blows, and land a punch yourself if necessary.

, Bring your fists up directly in front of your cheeks, protecting as much of your face as possible. A blow to the face has a significant chance of causing a concussion, where your brain collides with the back of your skull.

, This reduces the amount of your face that's exposed, and limits access to your neck. Keep it tucked against your chest with your fists up, but don't bend your head so low that you can't see the assailant.

, The organs in your abdomen are some of the most dangerous places you can get punched. Keep your elbows directly in front of your torso to protect these areas, loose enough that you can move quickly in response to blows. Here are the areas most important to protect:


Your liver, just below the right side of your rib cage. Getting punched here can cause you to collapse due to the drop in blood pressure.Your spleen, on the upper left side of your torso. The rib cage does protect this already, but it's still best to keep one arm in front of it. Damage here can cause major internal bleeding.Your kidneys, on the left and right side just above your waist level. Trauma here can lead to kidney failure.

, Stand with your knees bent and your legs firmly underneath you. This lowers your center of gravity, helping you stay balanced. It also makes you a more difficult target to hit, since you'll be poised to move and dodge if you need to.


Turn your body slightly away from the oncoming attack to protect your center line, including your groin, solar plexus, and throat.
Position your dominant foot slightly forward and keep a little more weight on your back foot, so you'll be poised to strike back if necessary.

, Shoulder movement is usually your first clue that a punch is coming. You may even notice roughly where they're aiming, by watching how high or low their shoulder moves.


Eye contact is the second best option, but a skilled fighter can fool you by glancing the wrong way or keeping their eyes fixed.
Avoid tunnel vision. When confronted with a threat, it's very easy to make that the center of your universe. Avoid this natural tendency and try to maintain peripheral vision and awareness of your surroundings, especially other assailants.

, Your fight or flight instinct will kick in, but you have to stay focused and maintain the ability to make good decisions. Strange as it sounds, worrying about the punch will make it hurt more. It may help to know that the body recovers surprisingly quickly after a hard punch. Focus on holding your protective stance and watching your assailant, and your odds will go up.

, Your defensive position already presents your shoulder and hip to your attacker. He'll have to reach past them to hit your abdomen, which gives you more time to react. Try to shift so the blow lands on your shoulders, pectorals, arms, fists, thighs, or butt. All of these areas can take strong hits with relatively minor damage.

, If you can't avoid getting hit, move your body in the direction the blow is moving. This is especially effective if you pull your shoulder back or step back with one foot, turning a direct hit into a glancing blow. Even a direct hit to the stomach will hurt less if you let yourself fall back as it connects.

, If you have strong abdominal muscles, tensing them can absorb the blow and help protect your organs. However, attempting this with weaker muscles may be less effective than rolling back as described above.

, Try not to get hit while breathing in or holding your breath. This will only result in you ""getting winded"" or ""getting the wind knocked out of you."" When the body is shocked like this, it's unable to respond for several moments, giving the assailant time to land another punch.


Shooting a short burst of air from your mouth or nose will also flex your abs, which may help if they're strong enough to absorb a blow.

, Your legs will feel weak or shaky after you get punched. Remember to keep your legs apart and your knees bent despite this feeling. If you step off-center or straighten your knees, your opponent will have an easy time knocking you to the ground.

, If you have fast reflexes, you can move within arm's reach so the punch doesn't reach full force.This can backfire if you get your timing wrong, so it's best used in desperate situations only, such as the following:


If your back is literally against a wall, this may be your only option to avoid a serious blow.
If you are trying to escape, a rush forward in the middle of a punch may send your opponent off-balance or even knock him down.

, If your jaw is open when you get punched, it could lead to a broken jaw or teeth. Keep your tongue well inside your mouth so it doesn't end up injured or severed.

, You probably don't need to be told this, but it's so important that it bears repeating: a blow to your face is dangerous and disorienting. Protect it as a top priority.

, You should always roll with a punch if it is directed at your head. Move with the flow of the punch, rather than against it.


Do not move toward a punch aimed at your face, since this could bring about serious injury and head whipping.

, If you can't block a punch aimed at your nose or eye, duck so it hits your forehead instead. While all blows to the head are dangerous, blows to the nose or eye are more likely to cause broken bones or interfere with vision or chewing.Don't make the mistake of bending toward the fist. Duck straight down, or even lean back slightly as you duck.

, It is natural to want to close your eyes when you see a punch coming. Try not to close your eyes for long. You need to be able to predict what the opponent will do next, and decide whether it's time to throw a punch of your own.

, A brain injury can take a few hours or days to show symptoms. Have a friend keep an eye on you after the fight. Scheduling a doctor's appointment is recommended after any blow to the head, but especially if you see the following symptoms:Schedule an appointment within the next 24 hours if you feel confused, sleepy, or nauseous; lose memories; vomit; have a mild or moderate headache; or see flashing lights.

Seek emergency services immediately if you have trouble thinking or moving; have a severe headache or stiff neck; feel extremely sleepy or lose consciousness; vomit more than once; or develop unusual eye movements or pupils of unequal sizes.

Likewise, if your search history has been cleared out, and you did not do it, someone else may have done so. In these cases, someone has spied on you by directly accessing your computer.


Remember to turn your machine off when you aren't using it, or have a strong password with letters, numbers, and symbols to lock out unwanted users.;
, These programs, sometimes called virtual network computing (VNC) software, allow someone to access your computer from a remote location as long as it is on. Many people use programs like LogMeIn or GoToMyPC to do work remotely. If you have such a program, and someone else obtained your log in information, they could access your machine from an outside location., If you notice a lag in speed, it may be the result of someone using the internet to track your activity. A tracking app will take up valuable memory, and cause other processes on your computer to slow down. Look at the apps your device is running, and notice any unfamiliar ones.


Most major commercial antivirus programs, like Symantec, McAfee, and Norton, are good at tracking apps like this on your computer.

, If someone has access to your devices, they probably have access to other information about you, and may be using that to steal your identity. In addition, spying apps on your phone will use the GPS to send tracking data, and so will likely drive up your data charges., If you are downloading something from a website, use your computer's security system to check whether that site is trusted or secure. If you have been downloading files from an insecure website, outsiders may be able to access it."

Know your company's important information and who has access to it.,
Know the difference between legal and illegal activity.,
Look for unfamiliar faces.,
Keep an eye out for unusual activity.,
Be on the lookout for social engineering.",How to Spot a Spy2," Think about types of information that a competitor would have interest in. This can be sensitive research and corporate strategy, or even something like balance sheets. If someone is accessing this information who shouldn't be, they may be a corporate spy., Most corporate espionage involves researching information that is readily available to anyone. This can include a list of employees, upcoming events or sales, or recent changes in structure. A person finding information through legal methods can be a threat to your business, but they are not criminal offenses. Fraud, breaking and entering, theft, and other illegal activities are the only avenues for prosecuting corporate espionage.Employees can sometimes be careless in posting information to personal social media accounts, including office activity or changes in job status. This information can be very useful to corporate spies, and is entirely legal for them to acquire.

, Are there people in your building or office that you don't recognize? Many workplaces aren't totally familiar with their workforce, and sometimes people are able to just tailgate, or follow in an actual employee.


Remember this is only to help spot someone who isn't supposed to be there. Your company should have clear policies for reporting a security breach of this type. Follow those protocols for reporting and taking further action.

, Tracking employee activity can reveal patterns of unusual actions. If someone is accessing more files than usual, or from unusual places like their own home, they may be getting information for someone else.Dumpster-diving, or otherwise rooting through trash, is a simple way to gain information on a company. If you see someone rooting through your company's garbage (and it's not an employee looking for something they accidentally threw away), that might be a corporate spy.

, Most corporate espionage is done simply by talking to people, and asking leading questions. Spies may call posing as employees, claiming to have forgotten their user name or password. Be aware of odd questions, or attempts to intimidate someone into giving up information.This can include so-called ""phishing"" schemes, where outsiders will ask for passwords and other information, claiming to be from IT or other reputable parts of your company.
Employees can be trained to look for certain leading questions, or particular social cues that suggest espionage. Your company should have clear processes for revealing sensitive information, and if those processes aren't followed, that will raise a red flag for you or your employees.

Pay attention to your surroundings.,
Check for cars following you.,
Look for hidden cameras.,
Check for listening devices.,
Look for unusual Wi-Fi networks.",How to Spot a Spy3," Avoid walking around staring at your cell phone or listening to music. If someone is following you, it will be much easier if you aren't paying attention to what is going on around you., Look for non-descript or plain vehicles; spies don't usually go around in flashy cars. Alternatively, check for vehicles you know, that is belong to people you know who might have a reason to follow you.If you are driving, slow down a little, and see if the car you think is following you does so as well. If you are on a highway, change lanes, and see if they follow.
If someone is following you, it won't be in a flashy sports car. It will likely involve something non-descript, that can easily blend in without catching your attention. If you think you are being followed, take notice of distinguishing features like a license plate., There are many small cameras out there that are easy to miss. They can be hidden in tight spaces or in other objects, allowing someone to record you and your actions. Most cameras are small, so you'll want to be on the look out for smaller items that appear out of place, or loose wires that don't seem to run to anything.You can use a smartphone to discover cameras. Turn off all the lights in the room you are in, then put your phone in camera mode. Look at the room through the camera. Night vision cameras will emit a bright red light (which is how they see in the dark), which will appear on your screen. If you see that, you may have found a hidden camera.
There are a number of hidden camera detectors available for purchase. They are small devices that produce a high-frequency red light, which you can use to sweep the room. The light will reflect off of any lenses, chips, or infrared lights., If you notice odd sounds on your phone, even after you've hung up, someone might be listening in to your conversations. Listening devices may also cause interference on electronic devices like televisions and radios., Hidden devices like cameras and recorders can use Wi-Fi networks to transmit what they find. If your phone or laptop detects a strong signal in your home that isn't your network, someone may be using that nearby network."

Be aware of your surroundings at all times.,
Recognize when a confrontational situation is imminent.,
Exit the situation as soon as you can prior to physical contact.,

Find ways to throw off any pursuing attacker.,
Look for ways to increase distance.,
Do not assume that your pursuers have stopped chasing you.,
Be realistic.,
If possible, throw anything at the attacker or anything that can get in his way.",How to Outrun an Attacker," Whoever you are and wherever you go, it is important to remain alert to your surroundings at all times and to take great care not to end up in an area where trouble in the form of fights, confrontation, and aggression is a high likelihood. For example, keep out of known bad neighborhoods if at all possible; when traveling, ask the locals where the safe parts of the city, town, or country are and stay in those.;
, Obviously, if someone is about to punch you as you reach them, you're more than aware that you're in a confrontational situation. However, recognizing earlier signs can make it easier for you to know when to do something about it and to get away faster. In fact, psychologists have shown that not only do we tend to sense trouble as it's looming toward us but that in 99 percent of cases, people give off signs and warnings as to what they're about to do.It is at the moment of spotting these signs that you still have a chance to get away. Look for such signs as:


Aggressive stances of the potential attacker and any other people standing around

Aggressive, abusive, and unfriendly language being shouted out

Threats being made to you and others
The brandishing of weapons, whether obviously a weapon, or a makeshift weapon such as pieces of wood, cut glass, broken items that have been sharpened etc.
Menacing gestures and attitudes
Your inner gut feeling tells you that you're getting into a bad situation; sense it and listen to your senses.

, If you can quickly turn off down a street or double back swiftly before you even reach the aggressor, do so. You may not need to run or you may consider that running might attract undue attention at this stage; you'll need to assess that according to the situation. Judge it swiftly and simply get out of there. At this stage, you may not be pursued, so count yourself lucky if so and learn a lesson from the situation.


Avoid making eye contact with any aggressor. Doing so can be enough to provoke an attack. Equally, say nothing at all to the aggressor; give the aggressor the space needed to chill on focusing on you as a target. By leaving before a confrontation even ensues, you may ""outrun"" your attacker by deflating their opportunity and not have to run that far at all; just around the corner and out of sight.
Be aware that many of us are media-primed to think we need to ""stand and fight"". That is not only a baseless assumption (after all, movie fight scenes take months to choreograph, film and edit!) but doing so will potentially endanger your life. Peculiar notions of bravery and nobility can blind you to danger.

, While this may sound self-evident when reading it, when in the midst of a confrontation, it might not be as obvious. For instance, are you wearing clothes you can run in comfortably, or are you in high heels and a pencil skirt? You might have to toss the shoes, rip the skirt, and run barefoot in the latter case! In addition, know your fitness limitations. If you're in generally good shape, a brief run should be fine but it'll start hurting the longer you run. If you're in very poor shape physically, even the brief run will possibly be too strenuous and you may fall over, collapse, or simply not be able to run at all. Obviously, it's too late to wish you'd kept in good shape when the incident happens, but since you're reading this, do consider staying in shape as one good way of keeping yourself safe.If you are not able to run at all, you're going to have to use other self-defense mechanisms to escape, such as walking away fast, not provoking the situation, hiding as soon as possible, or deflecting blows and protecting your vulnerable organs if the worst happens.

, Expend much of your energies looking for any single moment that will allow you to get away from your attacker or aggressor and give you the space to begin running.


Don't wait to see how the situation will evolve. It is probably going to evolve in a direction that won't be beneficial for you, so presume the worse and get running as soon as you can.

, Whether or not your attacker pursues you is not the point initially; simply presume that you need to put as much distance between you and the attacker as your best safety tactic. While an opportunistic mugger or a territorial fight picker might not have the slightest desire to pursue you after you've left the scene, other reasons such as an angry ex-lover, drugs, gang reputation, hate crime or sheer vindictiveness may spur the person to pursue you; don't presume their motives, just presume you need to escape. As you're running, bear the following in mind:



Run fast initially to place distance between you and the attacker. However, after an initial burst, you need to both assess the commitment of the pursuer (are they following or not?) and then to pace yourself and run without exerting yourself. If this person is insistent on pursuing you and you have no energy at all left should they catch you, you won't be able to protect yourself. Pacing yourself is especially important if there is a long way to safety or if you have to throw your attacker off the scent should they pursue you.
Aim to run where it is easy to do so and where you won't meet dead ends, high drops, or find yourself cornered. If you don't know the terrain that way, keep a good eye ahead on where you're going.
If you can see your attacker beginning to lag, give your running a good burst of speed to seal the distance between you, then return to your pace. By this stage you may be able to lose them through their own lack of endurance.
Keep a clear head. You will need to keep thinking and not just let your legs be the solution to your problem. Eventually they are going to get tired and your adrenalin will run down and leave you very tired. Try to keep your wits about you, thinking ahead to how you can throw off a pursuer if need be.
Ignore any cries of ""Coward!"" or ""Come back here!"". You are doing the right thing by leaving as fast as you're able.

, As well as running, it is important to back up your distance-creation with other tactics to keep yourself safe. The following are all good options, and probably the more you can put into the action, the better:


Make noise. Try to attract attention by yelling out ""Help me!"" and other phrases designed to draw the attention of others to your plight. A great option is to yell, ""FIRE!"" People who don't want to get involved in a personal situation may turn their backs on ""HELP"" but most will be curious and come to see where the fire is located. More people mean more help.
If you are in an urban environment, look for a safe place, for example, busy business premises, a police or fire station, hospital, etc.
If you are in the woods, run downhill or downstream. If there is a hiding space such as a rock under-hanging, or a cave, you might consider using these to recover and to use your cell phone if you have it with you. However, be conscious that if you can find a hiding place while running, so can your pursuer if they've been watching your flight and haven't lost sight of you; also be aware that they may know the terrain better than you.
Look for ways to make following you difficult. Run into a group of people, create obstacles for your pursuers, such as running into a group of people or a building with multiple floors, dashing through traffic (dangerous!) or through a market with lots of stalls, etc. Any time you're around people, scream your head off for help and to scare off the pursuers.
Run to bright areas. An attacker is a lot less likely to follow you into well-lit areas where they'll be easier to see and recognized by not only you but by others as well.

, For example, if you see a fence with a small opening, go through it and continue running. This may slow down your pursuers enough for them to lose sight of you. Losing sight of you is the crucial element to a successful running away. Once you've disappeared, you can find a hiding spot and remain extremely quiet there for some time until you are sure that they have given up both chasing and hunting around for you.

, If your pursuers are intent on catching you, they may wait for you. Call the police and make a report, even if you manage to make it home and think it's all over with.

, There may be a case where you have a persistent pursuer who is gaining on you and you're going to have to stand and defend yourself instead of continuing to run. While running should always be your first line of defense, exhausting yourself won't help you. And one last but very important note: every situation is different and while this article has tried to cover a range of possibilities, the situation you find yourself will be unique and you'll need to judge it quickly according to what you see and drawing on your experience and inner strength.

Position yourself to avoid being tied tightly.,
Tense all of your muscles while you are being tied up.,
Wriggle out of the ropes around your hands.,
Try to cut the ropes around your wrists.,
Kick off your shoes before you free your feet and legs.,
Plan your moment of escape carefully.",How to Escape from Being Tied Up1," The more loosely you’re bound, the easier it will be for you to escape. Resist letting your captors tie you as tightly as possible. For example, if your wrists are being tied in front of you, hold your knuckles from both hands together, and pull your hands in towards your chest. Although it looks like you’re cooperating, this gesture will create a gap between your wrists.Alternatively, you can present your hands to be tied with both hands in front of you, crossed at the wrist. Rotate your lower wrist about 45 degrees while you’re being tied, so that, once the ropes are tight, you can straighten out your wrist and loosen the rope.Make a lot of noise. Most people deep down do not want to inflict more discomfort or suffering than necessary. Cry out in pain--even if you are not. Complain. Let the tears flow. Talk to them and try to manipulate them. Make it mentally more difficult to tighten those bonds tighter.
Make the task difficult. Most people are not experts in rope tying, knots, and techniques. Usually the average person without formal training (such as a person proficient in working with cattle) does not do an adequate job. If you are thrashing around, resisting, and generally being a physical challenge the task is all that much more difficult.;
, If more than just your wrists or ankles are being bound, this will help you escape. When your muscles are tensed, they expand and take up more room than when they’re relaxed. This will make your body larger, while your captors are tying you tightly. Consequently, when you relax your muscles, your body will shrink slightly and the ropes will be loser, giving your more room to move and eventually escape.


This is a technique used by most escape artists and allows the ropes to be slightly looser when you relax you muscles.
If captors are tying a rope around your chest, take a deep breath and expand your lungs as much as possible.If you can make a loose spot big enough to do so, slip out of it.

, Once your captors have turned their backs or left the room you’re in, rotate your wrists back and forth to loosen them. You can also use your teeth to pull on one strand of the rope to make it looser.As the ropes continue to loosen, you may be able to wriggle out of them.


If your hands are tied to your torso or sides, wriggle your hands until they’re at a narrower part of your body (such as directly in front of you). The ropes will be looser here, and you’ll be able to slip out.If your arms are pinned to your stomach, chest or torso, bend one arm upwards and try lifting the bonds. If the rope is at all lose, you may be able to slip it off over your head.

, You need your hands to untie any other ropes, so always begin by freeing your hands. Ropes (and also phone and electrical cords) can be cut through with friction, so you’ll need to find a hard object to rub the binding ropes against.Look for surfaces like an exposed corner of a cement wall, a table edge, or a granite countertop.


If you’re alone in a room, look around for a sharp object, such as a knife, scissor blade, etc. If you use one of these objects to cut the rope while your hands are tied, take care not to cut or injure yourself.
If you have a key or small knife in your pocket, try to get it out without anyone noticing. If you can cut the ropes quickly, you’ll be well on your way to escaping.

, If your hands are impossible to free, you may need to free your feet first. First kick of your shoes, as it will be easier to slip the ropes if you are just wearing socks. First see if the rope is loose enough to wriggle out of—if it’s not, bend over and try untying the knot with your teeth.


Once your feet are free, use your tied hands to pull the leg bonds down until they have gone off over your feet.

, Don’t plan to run out the door as soon as you’re free; you’ll need to make a tactical exit. You should bide your time and pick the best possible moment to escape. When your captors have turned their backs or left the room, make your break.Get far away as quickly as you can.


If you expect to be pursued by your captors, try to blend in or hide in your environment, and arm yourself (for example, with a piece of rebar) if needed.
Also, you can gather information about your captors that could help the police track them down. Pay attention to their looks and physical appearance, any tattoos and scars, and the sound of their voices.

Break the locking mechanism on the zip ties.,
Cut through the zip ties with friction.,
Slip out from the zip ties.",How to Escape from Being Tied Up2," This is the weakest point on the zip tie, and will be the easiest to break. To break the ties, form your hands into fists with the knuckles pressed together Raise your bound hands above your head, then bring them down sharply. At the same time, pull your elbows apart and press your wrists hard into your abdomen.This should exert enough pressure to snap the lock mechanism on the zip ties.


If your hands are bound in front of you, tighten the zip tie as much as possible, as it will be more fragile when fully taut. A looser zip tie will be harder to break free from.

, If you can maneuver yourself to a hard surface, rub the band of the zip ties over the surface repeatedly to build up friction and, eventually, cut through the zip ties.Paracord or Kevlar string are heat resistant and can be used to create enough friction to cut through zip ties or rope. If you’re concerned you may be tied up, or traveling in a dangerous area, consider replacing your shoelaces with paracord or Kevlar string.To escape, tie your shoelaces from both feet together, with the knot between your bound wrists. Then use a “bicycle” motion to create friction and cut your zip ties off.

, When you’re being tied, clench your fists tightly to expand the muscles in your wrists. This will make your wrists larger, and make your bonds looser once you’ve relaxed your hands.If you do this correctly, you should be able to wriggle your hands out of the zip ties, without injuring yourself.


If you’ve been tied tightly, rotate your hands and move your wrists back and forth against each other. This may loosen the plastic zip cords, and create enough room for you to slip your hands free.This may take time, so make sure your captors don’t observe you trying to escape.

Break the tape in front of you.,
Chew through the duct tape.,
Get the duct tape wet in order to loosen it.",How to Escape from Being Tied Up3," Although duct tape is incredibly adhesive, it is still vulnerable to tears and breaks. If your hands are bound in front of you, raise them above your head, and then bring them down quickly against your abdomen, pulling your elbows apart at the same time.Unlike zip ties, breaking duct tape in this method is unlikely to cut your wrists.

, Since duct tape is not quite as sturdy as rope, it can be bent and torn more easily. Use this to your advantage. You may be able to chew through it, or use your teeth to tear the tape, and then pry the tape apart.If you can’t break the tape with your teeth, try to peel it away from your skin with your teeth or mouth. This will give your more space to wriggle out of the tape.

, Like any other type of tape, duct tape loses nearly all of its adhesive quality when it is wet. If you are near water bottles or a natural water source (even if there’s water on the floor or in a sink of the room where you’re tied), get to the water and moisten the tape.After a period of time, the tape will loosen and you’ll be able to pull your hands or feet out.


If you can lick or spit on the duct tape, even saliva from your mouth will help loosen the adhesion.

Clench your fists with the thumb on the outside, not the inside.;
, Your arms and shoulders should be relaxed for easy movement, with your elbows kept down to protect your torso.








, Keeping your chin down makes your face a smaller target and protects your neck. Don't tuck it so far down you have trouble watching your opponent.








, Turn slightly sideways with one leg (usually the right leg for right-handed people) further back than the other so your torso isn't facing the opponent.








Your legs should be at roughly shoulder width or a little wider.
Keep your knees bent so you can stay balanced and mobile.
Don't turn too far sideways; if you are standing at right angles to your opponent you can be knocked to the side.

, Your eyes detect movement faster from the side of your vision than from the front, so an unfixed gaze will serve you better than a close stare at your opponent's hands.








Be aware of your opponent's shoulders, eyes, and foot movement as well as their hands. If a particular opponent always steps forward before punching, you can use that information to react more quickly.
The more practice you have, the faster your movements will be.

, If you successfully dodge with this method, you will end up on the outside of your opponent's punch, ready to move further away or throw your own long distance punch.








Remember to keep your fists up during the dodge to keep your guard in place.

, Rotate your hips and body clockwise (if your left leg is in front) and shift a little weight onto your rear leg.









Optionally, you can take a step backwards with your rear leg as part of this movement.

, Keep your knees bent and your torso above your hips for maximum balance.








, You can lean back with your neck a little as well, but the main motion should be the sideways rotation of your feet and torso.









Minimize bending from the waist, as this can make you severely off balance.

, You only need to move a short distance to avoid a punch. Smaller movements keep you more balanced and give you more time to make your next move (whether that's a counterpunch or knocking your opponent over and running).








, Tilt your chin further down so the blow lands on a hard part of your skull rather than your nose or jaw.









Simultaneously move back or rotate your head in the same direction the punch is traveling to minimize the force of impact.

, The goal of this dodge is to end up on the inside of your opponent's punch (next to his body), ready for a strong counterpunch. If your opponent is aiming for your body, you might end up moving your face right into a fist.









This dodge works best against a straight, strong right-handed jab.
The bigger the punch, the better it is to dodge since your opponent will be off balance and spend more time recovering. You may want to block shorter jabs or feints or dodge them by moving further away instead of closer.

, Rotate your hips and body anticlockwise (if your left leg is in front) and shift more weight onto your forward leg.









The main motion should come from your hips, not your waist.

, Keeping your whole body in line with your hips keeps you balanced and mobile.








, Move your shoulder rapidly downward and inward at a 45º angle across your chest to get your head out of the path of the punch.Bend slightly with your knees as well.









Don't overdo this movement. You only need to move your head about six inches (15 cm) to dodge a straight jab.
Don't lean too far forward, as this makes it hard to balance and to watch your opponent. You should be using your knees and shoulder much more than your back.If you're as tall or taller than your opponent, you may be able to dodge the punch by raising your head instead, so the fist passes below your chin as you rotate to the side.

, Be prepared to use it to block or deflect a follow up punch from the other hand.







, If you need to, use your leading foot to take a short step toward the opponent. This is useful for constraining their movement for the next punch, but mainly for setting up a counterpunch.








, Once the punch is dodged, you can take advantage of your close position to retaliate with a punch of your own.








, As you return to your original position, weave in a ""U"" shape around the punch. If you simply move straight back up you may walk right into another punch.








, This protects your internal organs from injury.








, A short, quick burst of air will automatically cause your abs to flex and further protect yourself.








, Try to push your opponent's arm away with your hand to deflect the punch, or at least receive the punch on your knuckles rather than directly on your torso.








, Step back or rotate your body in the direction of the blow. If the point of impact is moving in the same direction of the punch the force will be greatly reduced.

Don’t flee from police.,
Avoid any sudden movements.,
Keep your hands visible.,
Do not touch, hit, or otherwise assault a police officer.,
Do what you're told, and do it slowly.,
Let yourself be handcuffed.",How to Avoid Getting Shot by a Police Officer1," If the police approach you and speak to you, do not run or even walk away. This applies whether you believe you are innocent of wrongdoing or not. Regardless of your rights, running arouses suspicion and greatly increases the chance of a fatal misunderstanding.A common belief amongst police officers is that suspects do not run unless they have a reason to.Do not play into this belief by fleeing. The police are very likely to perceive you as a threat and chase you.
Fleeing in a high-crime or suspicious area does not in itself create a “reasonable suspicion” for police officers to stop you. However, police often use characteristics and known histories of an area when making a decision about pursuing a suspect, and this is supported by US law.It is an unfortunate fact that in some cases, race plays a factor in police shootings. Joint analysis by the Washington Post and Bowling Green State University revealed that over three-quarters of the officers charged with fatal shootings in the United States since 2005 were white, while two-thirds of their victims were minorities and all but two of that number were Black.If you are an ethnic minority, you may be in greater danger of police shooting if you flee.
If you are guilty of something illegal, running from the police can be charged as a crime, such as evading arrest or obstruction of justice. In many US states, these crimes are felonies. Running from the police if you are guilty will only make your situation worse.;
, No matter what you're doing when contacted by the police, stop and remain still. At this point, any movement you make that is unexpected is one step closer to getting shot. Do not move toward the officer, either.If you're in a car, don't reach for anything. Officers are trained to notice when drivers are reaching for something, and they might assume you're reaching for a weapon or hiding drugs. For more details, see How to Act when the Police Pull You Over., Do not make any sudden movements with your hands. Keep them plainly visible.If the officer makes a request that requires you to move your hands, such as asking to see identification, verbally confirm that you are complying with his or her request before making any movements.
For example, you could tell the officer “I am going to reach into my left back pocket to get my wallet so I can show you my ID.” Do not make any movements unless you have to in order to comply with a police request.

, This will almost certainly result in physical force used against you. Police officers are authorized to use deadly force to defend themselves or others from serious harm or threat. As one LAPD officer puts it, “initiating a physical confrontation is a sure recipe for getting hurt.”Assaulting or battering a police officer is a very serious crime., The officer will tell you exactly what he or she wants you to do. That typically includes putting your hands on the back of your head, walking backwards toward the sound of their voice, or lying down on the ground. Obey their orders, but do it at a slow enough pace that you don't alarm them.


Police have the right to stop and frisk or pat down suspects if they have “reasonable suspicion” that they are involved in illegal activity.Reasonable suspicion is very broadly defined. Racial and social biases may come into play, and it is very difficult to prove these.For example, over 90 percent of stop-and-frisk incidents in New York City between 2002-2011 were with Black or Latino individuals.If you are an ethnic minority, you may be more likely to be stopped and ordered to submit to frisking, even if you are not behaving suspiciously.
Do not assume that you will not be frisked simply because you have done nothing wrong. In New York City, for example, 9 out of 10 people who are stopped and frisked are innocent.It is safer for you not to resist.Police officers are legally required to avoid “excessive force.” Thus, if you submit and do not resist, the officer must stop using force against you. While in reality this does not always happen, complying with an officer rather than resisting will improve your chances of remaining uninjured., While that may be uncomfortable, struggling against the cuffs or trying to resist in any way is only going to result in further trouble. In many places, it is police protocol to place handcuffs on even the most cooperative of suspects.


If you have an injury (such as a stiff or ""frozen"" shoulder or a recently broken shoulder), let the officer know before he or she tries to cuff you and ask politely if your hands can be cuffed in another way rather than behind your back.
It may seem unfair to allow this if you do not believe you have done anything wrong. Remain calm, submit to the cuffing, and ask for an attorney. You are far more likely to survive your police encounter this way.

"
"
Know the neighborhood.,
Dress to blend in.,
Act like nothing's a big deal.,
Avoid contact.,
If you make eye contact with someone, don't look away suddenly; look away slowly and casually.,
If someone says something friendly, Be Polite but brief.,
If someone confronts you, stay calm and try not to be or look afraid.",How to Be Street Smart," Nothing places a bullseye on your head in a bad neighborhood like looking lost and confused. If you have the chance, research a neighborhood before you enter it. Look at maps and pictures. Know where you're going, and know the streets well enough so that if you get lost, you know how to find your way out without having to look at a map or ask for directions. For instance, in many urban neighborhoods, the streets are arranged in a grid. Knowing something as simple as, ""If I keep heading north on Burlington Road, I'll hit Highway 201,"" may be enough. Even if you are lost, pretend you know where you're going.


A person who isn't street smart might say ""Ugh! This is too paranoid. I can just find a gas station or store and ask for directions."" Rest assured, there are neighborhoods where you might not find a ""safe haven"" or you might find some shady characters inside, who've taken a keen interest in your wallet.






Don't go into an unfamiliar neighborhood without a full tank of gas. In fact, if there's even a chance of getting lost or running into traffic delays, never let your gas tank go below half full.






Learn everything you can about the public transportation system, if there is one. You might need to use it. Understand how the routes and fares work. Be sure you know the places and hours that attendants or guards are available, the safest places to wait for your ride and how to summon help if you need it. A train, subway, ferry or bus station can be a dangerous place late at night, and not knowing what you're doing will make the situation more dangerous.





;
, Even if you look different, keeping your clothing understated can go a very long way. This is not the time to look glamorous or unique. See what people your age usually wear in the region and copy them. Don't wear flashy jewelry or bright colors. In some places, certain colors like excessive red or blue are associated with gangs. And, if you're a woman, the most practical advice is don't look pretty. Yes, it's a shame that you should have to suppress your individuality, but let's face it, individuality draws attention, and that's not something you want in a dangerous neighborhood.

, You have to be paranoid enough to be alert to dangerous situations and interactions, but you have to pretend to be nonchalant. For instance, if you're in a grocery store and a very intoxicated person bursts in, yelling and waving a fist, what do you do? If you're street smart, you notice and you casually go about your business, making your way out of the store without drawing attention to yourself. Someone who's not street smart might stare, might rush out of the store, or might even try to help the person (which is a ""Good Samaritan"" thing to do, but not a street smart thing to do—sometimes the two are mutually exclusive).


Don't look up. Your attention might be drawn to tall buildings or trains running overhead, but it's one of those things that people living in a city don't notice.
Be quiet. Don't laugh, don't giggle, don't raise your voice to get the attention of someone across the street.

, This is tricky. If you're walking towards a person or a group of people who are checking you (or your companion) out, try to walk in a different direction to avoid them altogether. Don't make it obvious, though—if you cross the street, for example, go into a store on that side so it seems that's why you crossed. Remember, you want to avoid dangerous situations, but you don't want to come off as paranoid or scared. At the very least, be alert so you can spot a potential confrontation early enough to cross the street without making it clear to them that you're intimidated.


If you do have to cross paths with shady characters, however, don't quicken your pace (you might do it subconsciously). Pretend to be on a call or send a text message as you walk by, unless you have a really nice phone.
If you're walking with someone, don't let your conversation get quiet right when you walk by—that can increase tension. Keep the conversation flowing, and avoid topics that might indicate where you're going, where you're from, or what kind of stuff you have.

, Think about how you make eye contact in a neighborhood where you feel safe. You don't shift your eye contact away in a big rush, do you? At the same time, you don't want to hold eye contact for too long, or else you might invite a confrontation. Or an advance. Don't stare, and if you make and hold eye contact, a friendly smile and nod of acknowledgment may reduce the tension of any perceived challenge.

, If you walk by someone who asks, ""How's your day going, man?"", reply, ""It's going well. Thanks."" Nod in their direction when you say ""thanks,"" but keep walking. Don't say anything that invites further conversation, such as, ""Good. What about yours?"" Some people are genuinely being friendly, but other people have bad intentions; this is not the place to learn the difference. If you're a woman and the person being friendly is a man, you might want to be even more terse. Say, ""Fine, thanks,"" and don't smile.

, Observe your surroundings, and start looking for possible help (other pedestrians that look friendly, a place of business that is open, maybe even a police car approaching). If no such help is available, be prepared to defend yourself. Start by memorizing their face, ethnicity, height (compare it to your own), age and any odd marks or tattoos. They may try to take you somewhere less public. Do not follow them into a secluded area even if they have a gun. You have a better chance to survive if you stay put. If they try to take you by force, scream, kick, punch, bite. If they have a gun and all they want is your wallet or valuables, give it to them. Don't try to be a hero, it's not worth your life. Call the cops as soon as you're able to and explain the ""who, what, where, when and how"".

"
"
Avoid talking more than necessary.,
Avoid using humor about the situation.,
Remain calm.,
Be respectful.,
Refrain from making threats.,
Ask if you are being detained.",How to Avoid Getting Shot by a Police Officer2," At this point, you've either already broken the law and don't need to make it worse on yourself, or you are the victim of a misunderstanding and need to cooperate to prevent an unfortunate accident. Be cooperative, but do not volunteer any information you are not explicitly asked for. If you are asked a direct question by police, you usually have the right not to answer. However, you should be aware that not answering could be perceived as hostile behavior.In the US and many other countries, you have a right to protect yourself from self-incrimination.You should never volunteer information, even if you do not believe yourself guilty of any wrongdoing. Doing so without an attorney present could conceivably cause you problems.
If you are foreign to the country and are not sure of your rights, answer questions politely and give only the barest details. If you do not speak the local language fluently, do not attempt to defend yourself verbally. You may accidentally say something that, when translated, incriminates you in some way.
An exception to this rule may be if the officer tells you to do something that involves moving. It's good to tell him what you are doing, even if it seems obvious. It will keep the officer feeling safe and less likely to use a weapon. For example:

Officer: ""Let me see your I.D."" You: ""It's in my glove box/back seat/stocking/etc. I'm going to reach down/over and get it for you, OK?"" Then move slowly.
Officer: ""Lie down on the ground!"" You: ""I'm going to lie down on the ground, but I have a bad hip/back/knee, so I need to hold on to this pole/fence/wall to get on the ground.""



, Humor is very subjective, and there’s a chance that what you think is a joke could be interpreted as a serious threat by the police.


Don't make sarcastic or ironic remarks. The police will likely take anything you say at face value. Even ""joking"" remarks can be used against you in a criminal court.

, It can be terrifying to be stopped by the police, but it’s vital that you remain calm and in control of yourself. If you must speak, do so in a level, clear voice.Do not yell, curse, scream, or use aggressive language. Do not call the officer names. Police officers perceive this as threatening behavior and may respond with force., Police officers represent the law. Always use respectful, polite language when interacting with an officer. Call a police officer “sir,” “ma’am,” or “officer” when speaking to him or her. Even if the police officer is aggressive, maintain a level head and stay polite.Do not speak defensively or with hostility. For example, do not say things such as “What are you doing?” or “What’s your problem?” If you want to clarify your situation, ask a polite question, such as “How can I help you, officer?” or “What is the reason, officer?”, For example, do not threaten to sue, take the officer’s badge, or retaliate. This will only make things worse for you., You should use that exact language: “Am I being detained?” Police must tell you whether they are detaining you. If the officer tells you that you are not being detained, ask “Am I free to leave, officer?” Do not simply walk away. This could convince police that you have something to hide.If the officer says you cannot leave, you are being detained. You should ask for an attorney. You are entitled to an attorney whenever you are being detained by police.If the officer does say you can leave, you should confirm that you will be leaving before doing so. For example, confirm your “intent to depart” by saying something like “If there is nothing else, I will be leaving now.” Then walk slowly away."
"
Walk or run away and hide, if possible.,
Know how to defend yourself.,
Try to talk the assailant out of fighting.








,
Try to stay calm.,
Remember that the idea that size has absolutely no connection with strength is a myth.",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight1," Not having to engage the assailant is your best defense.






;
, In the event that you can't get away and you to have to respond to protect yourself, knowing self-defense is crucial. Be aware that the rules of martial arts techniques might not help you, as sometimes even Black Belt Martial Artists can get severely injured on a tough street fight with no rules.








,, The calmer you are, the better you will be able to find the gaps to escape through and to know to seize the moment to get away.

, Size does actually matter. Don't fool yourself into thinking that you can beat someone twice your size just because you have some martial arts skills.

"
"
As with the advice for a single attacker, try to walk or run away, and stay calm.








,
Try your best not to anger the group of assailants even more; yelling fighting words might egg them on to attack you.

,
If possible, try to find out why they are trying to abuse you.,
If you're not a good fighter, put your back to a wall as it will keep you from being surrounded, and you will be able to go left or right to fight your way out through one attacker rather than a surrounding group of attackers.








",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight2,",, But beware: talking too much or asking questions may anger them to attack you harder.

,"
"
Be aware of some of the basic techniques that can be of help.,
If your attacker(s) attempts to choke you and take you to the wall, (still choking you), do the following.",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight3," The following techniques can be used in self-defense:









Try your best to hit the attacker on the ribs. Contrary to popular belief, it really can hurt.
The best place to strike is the solar plexus. Or, strike the area under the nose. Never aim for the eye-sockets, it is a very strong part of the face, and could possibly break your fingers. Hitting the solar plexus can give you a lot of time to get away (as well as winding the attacker, giving you a chance to hit back), while hitting the nose can knock the attacker out. Either will work.
When the attacker punches you, turn to the side to dodge it, then grab their arm, and strike their elbow joint.

, First, take your left hand, and hold one of their arms with it. Then, use your right hand to strike their elbow joint hard. After this, strike their neck hard (but not too hard), then push them to the wall, and run like the wind. If you want, you can put one of their arms behind their back too.








"
"
Use the following techniques to help to give you better odds, but recognize that sometimes you may still need more.,
Twist the attacker's arm backwards (not enough to dislocate it), and hold it there.,
Perform a headlock.,
Some people that take karate classes have learned that to break out of a headlock, you need to step on their foot, giving them pain.",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight4," Use these advanced tactics as a last resort.








, It will hurt the attacker a lot and disable them long enough for you to get away.


If you're training in martial arts, then use the techniques you've been taught, as this is a commonplace martial arts move (Judo, Jiu Jitsu, wrestling, etc)., Try to move around the attacker initially. Try to go behind the attacker. When you get a chance, wrap your left or right arm around the mid-point (about near the nose) of the head.









Hold on for a while, and then release them. Be mindful that they could still attack you once you break the headlock.

, If someone tries to do this to you, jump slightly backwards while still having them in a headlock. Knowing how to do this successfully though takes some practice.

"
"
Know what to do.,
Find an escape method.",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight5," The key to stop this event from taking place is to block incoming strikes. If you still end up in the mounted position, an attack approach would be to kick the mounting attacker as hard as you can with both legs to the front of the hips. Then, run for your life.


Don't just try to launch an attack immediately. That will just make you more vulnerable, as if being on the ground wasn't bad enough!

, Attacking might not work, so escape strategies are your best option once pinned down. Here are some suggestions:


Use the ""back door escape"". Move or wriggle from under your attacker.
Use bridging.Thrust your hips upwards and to the side.
Use the elbow escape.Use your hands or your elbows to create space between you and the attacker, so that you can pull out one or both legs from under the attacker.
Rotate your body so that your face points downward.In doing this, your attacker is now performing a ""back mount"", which is a lot less favorable to the attacker, and in turning, you may find you adequately loosen the attacker's grip over you and you can get away, by standing up and shaking off the attacker or using the ""back door "" escape.

"
"
Learn ways to break out of a headlock, as this is a common street fighting tactic.Some suggested methods are listed here but your very best defense is to stay alert and not get into a headlock in the first place.,
In the very initial moment where the headlock is being applied, try ducking and blocking the attacker's arms.This may be enough to get you out of the attempted headlock.,
Protect yourself.,
Stay low.,
Use your free arms to protect your face from punches.

,
Try some of the other following methods when seeking to get out of a headlock:


Step on the attacker's foot.",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight6," Being aware that someone is approaching you can enable you to turn around and prevent it from happening.

, Note that the longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove yourself from the headlock.

, A headlock can result in cutting off your air or blood supply. So the very first thing to do is to protect yourself:Tuck your chin in.
Turn your face toward their chest to protect your face from fists.
Grab their hands (held together as they perform the lock) and pull their hands downward. This will lessen the pressure immediately.

, Keep your legs bent and relatively wide.The aim is to maintain your stability, so that the moment you get a chance to counter-attack or free yourself, you're in a good position to do so.

,, Do it quickly and get it right first time. If executed correctly, you will cause them pain, which could be enough to make them loosen their grip, allowing you to get away.
Punch the upper inner thigh or groin.Then pull their head up (by hair, eye sockets, whatever), and push them away from you... and run.Pinch your attacker. This method can make the attacker's face hurt, and give you enough precious moments to break out of the headlock.
Move your head up and down, fast. The aim in doing this is to confuse them; once you've done so, make a sudden forward movement. This will also cause the attacker holding you in a headlock to fall.
Grab the attacker's arms, and push your head under them, and break out. This requires finding a key moment when their hold is less or their focus has been distracted temporarily. An effective strike to the ribs or genitals may cause enough distraction.
Use two hands against one of theirs (2v1). Focus both of your hands on one of their wrists and pull it away. It is VERY difficult to apply a good headlock or choke with just one arm so once you've removed one of their arms from the clench you should feel instance relief from the pressure.
Or rather than choosing one hand, pick a finger. With one hand take hold of a finger and bend as hard as possible. This technique will break an aggressors finger with relative ease.

Understand that ""Personal Security"" is a professional service, so keep your expectations realistic.,
As, unlike the United Kingdom, there are no national civilian training standards for this profession in the US or Canada, there are several titles a Practitioner may use: Executive Protection, Protective Services, Personal Protection or Personal Security.

,
Like the Secret Service, the best individuals are proactive, clean cut, intelligent, articulate, educated professionals that are trained to PREVENT a threat to your welfare.,
Look on the Internet for your state’s private security company regulations.,
Ensure your candidates are graduates of a Government Protective Services course from the;


United States Secret Service (Special Agent versus Uniformed Division))
US State Department's Diplomatic Security Service

Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC)
US Army Military Police School's Protective Services Training Course

US Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID)
US Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS)
US Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI)
or graduates from one of the few, internationally recognized and respected, civilian executive protection schools in the US like;

Executive Security International(ESI)in Colorado

Executive Protection Institute in Virginia

R.L.,
Just because someone has been in the military, law enforcement or has worked overseas on a Protective Services Detail (PSD) DOES NOT mean they have the right mind-set, training or skill-sets to perform Personal Security within the United States.,
Get a photocopy of the applicant’s driver’s license, Social Security card and copies of any professional certificates.

,
Conduct a background check on the web and pay for a simple criminal history check.

,
Have every candidate sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (available for free on the Internet) before discussing your needs or personal information.

,
Look for specific experience, and ask for examples of how the candidate has demonstrated proficiency in skills including, but not limited to:


Choreography (knowing how to stand, walk and get in and out of a car with a Protectee)
Conducting advance work to prepare for trips and events ahead of time
Effective countermeasures to deal with an attack or security threat if one materializes
Knowledge of physical security and access control systems
Formal training in specialized driving skills, and
Extensive Firearms and Defensive Tactics or martial arts training

,
Ask the candidate about ""big name"" people s/he has protected.,
Specialized driving skills are generally considered a sub-specialty within Personal Security and are commonly known as Evasive and/or Counter-ambush Driving, that few Personal Security practitioners have formal, in-depth training in.",How to Hire a Bodyguard," As the core component of PROTECTIVE SERVICES, Personal Security is divided among several specialties focused on the type of person being protected. Individuals trained to handle corporate executives, politicians, dignitaries and high net-value families fall under ""Executive Protection"" or ""EP"" in contrast with those trained to handle Celebrities, Actors, Musicians, Professional Athletes and other high-profile, public individuals are commonly referred to as ""Talent Security"". All qualified Practitioners are driven to be visibly low profile and are capable of adapting to and remaining as unobtrusive to your lifestyle as possible.;
,, Contrast these specialists with the stereotypical 400-pound thugs working for Britney Spears or Madonna. These ""bodyguards"" are only able to REACT to a threat and are usually working as bouncers or bounty hunters and ""sidelining"" as a Bodyguard and generally lack the specialized training.

, Learn the name of the required license for “Bodyguard” or “Personal Protection Officer” or something closely related. The candidates will need this license in order to work for you. That said, do not assume that a ""Bodyguard"" license from any state is in and of itself a good indicator of their abilities. The majority of states have no requirements other than a Concealed Handgun License, a few have very stringent training requirements and the rest have appallingly low training requirements that meet no professionally recognized minimum training standards. These licenses have names like Personal Protection Officer (PPO) or Personal Protection Specialist (PPS) and are probably required for the individual to work for you but most are acquired with very little training that anyone can get if they have a ""Security Guard"" license and $100 to pay for a ""Bodyguard"" course.

Executive Protection International in Massachusetts.
There is also a University that specializes in Personal Protection Management and offers Bachelors, Master's and Doctorate level Degrees (see Henley-Putnam University)
If a candidate attended a school not listed above, ensure that the instructors openly identify themselves, have extensive experience (10+ years) in Government Protective Services or a civilian equivalent and that the course was a MINIMUM of 100 hours of formal personal security training.
As a second choice, consider “Executive Protection/Protective Services/Corporate Security” personnel from Fortune 500 corporations like Microsoft, Dell, Boeing, IBM, etc., with direct (not limited or collateral) experience.

,


If a candidate claims to have been a member of a US military Special Operations Force, like Army Special Forces ""Green Beret"", US Army Ranger, Navy SEAL, Air Force Combat Controller, Marine Corps Special Operations (MARSOC), etc., ask them to provide you an ORIGINAL copy of their DD214. This document is issued to all former military service members and will give you the names of schools they graduated from and their professional character while in the service. If they claim their background is ""Classified"", they are lying to you. The only thing actually classified about their military background would be missions they took part in.

,,,,, If s/he gives you a list of names, those names would likely be okay and can most often be verified by contacting the company, government office or a celebrity's agent or representative. However if a candidate starts revealing personal information it is possible that they are violating non-disclosure and confidentiality statements they agreed to. At the same time, do not accept the response, ""I can't tell you for reasons of privacy."" Good bodyguards are very careful about divulging information about former clients or protects, and will find a way for you to verify their claims without violating confidentiality agreements.

, Again, there are very few recognized and respected schools in the US that teach these skills;


Scotti School of Defensive Driving (SSDD)
Bill Scott Raceways (BSR)
Vehicle Dynamics Institute
Bob Bondurant School of Performance Driving

If they are going for a straight arm lock, bend your arm.,
Prevent the armlock from occurring by holding onto your belt, pants, skirt top, etc.,
Once in the armlock, try some of the following strategies:


Feign a punch toward them to cause the attacker to loosen their grip.,
Try to pull your hand back as fast as you can.,
Be extra careful when trying to release yourself from an armlock, as the attempt could also lead to breakage of your arm.

",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight7," If they are going for an arm lock that involves a bent arm, straighten your arm.

, before the lock is executed. Doing this will prevent the attacker from leveraging your arm and wrist backward.Of course, this requires both that you are alert to what's about to happen, and that you recognize the intended armlock.

, Use that moment to remove yourself from the armlock.
Really punch or kick the attacker and use the moment when their grip loosens to get out.

, This may make them let go sometimes as a reaction, and give you a chance to escape.

,"
"
Learn to identify a punch coming.,
Move.,
Move your hands in the same direction of the punch.,
Try blocking with your arms instead of with your palms, as it can cause your attacker's punching range to decrease and not impact the originally intended target.

",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight8," As with many attack moves, recognizing the move that's about to happen is a big part of defensive strategy. Signs to look for include:Formation of a fist
Gritting teeth, angry jaw movements
Shallow, forced breathing
Once foot suddenly shifted in front
Chin drops (to protect the throat)
Shoulder drops (this is where the power of the punch starts)
Body turns to side, away from you.

, By the time a person has made a decision to punch, they've already decided where that punch is going to land and have done with their strategizing. You, on the other hand, have a split second to change where that punch lands. So if it's coming for your head, move your head just a fraction and the punch may well miss or at least have much less force than originally intended., Here it helps to make an educated guess as to your opponent's next moves. This is not about making a wild guess, but requires that you make a plausible and educated guess.

,"
"
Remember that blocking a kick is the hardest technique in fighting.,
When blocking a kick, use your palms, instead of the area in your arms which have muscle.,
Evade the kicks.,
Keep in mind that dodging kicks will be more effective when you're jumping, moving side to side, dodging, etc., than just relying on ducking all the time.

,
Be unpredictable in how and when you duck and dodge.",How to Defend Yourself in an Extreme Street Fight9," Yet, if you successfully grab someone's leg while they attempt to kick you, you can make them fall to the ground.

, You could get severely injured if the attacker's kick lands on your muscles.

, ""Using evasion"" is simply a fancy way of saying that you should rely on using an array of the following techniques to evade the kicks:


Dodge out of the way
Duck quickly
Jump backwards
Move to the side.

,, Don't set a pattern.

"
Tell someone where you are going and how long you plan to stay.,
Make sure your car is in good shape if you're driving.,
Park your car in a safe location.,
Walk down a well-lit path when you're on foot.,
Learn how to defend yourself.",How to Be Confident and Safe when Going Out Alone1," This doesn't mean that you're cramping your own style. You're being smart by letting a family member or friend know where - and when - to start looking for you and worrying, if it comes to that. You don't need to provide a GPS tracker, but it's smart to leave a MapQuest or Google map of your planned route for your friend or parent so they know where to look for you if you don't show up. Knowing you have taken these simple precautions can boost your confidence significantly.


Before you leave to meet your friends, call or text them to let them know you're on your way so they'll know something is up if you're not there.
When you get there, tell your friend or parent that you've made it safely.;
, If you're driving somewhere by yourself, you need to make sure that you have a spare tire in case you get a flat tire and that nothing on your dashboard is lit up before you go. You should also have a AAA or other roadside emergency service card with you as well as a charged cell phone. Fill your car up with gas before you leave.


Just checking to make sure everything is cool before you get going is a great step to give you peace of mind before you head out.

, Before you get out of your car, think about where you have parked. Is it well-lit, easy to see from the street? This is the best place to park if alone. Avoid parking in dark alleys or very far away from the door of your destination. Remember where you parked - this is very important. Mentally map your path to the door of the place you're going, take note of anyone on the street, and gather your things quickly.


Upon leaving your car, check carefully that it is locked and you have left nothing enticing (like a laptop bag or an iPad) in plain view. Walk purposefully - do not meander - directly to the door and enter immediately.
Lingering on the street is not a good idea, it allows potential attackers to see that you are alone. Keep anyone you noticed out on the street in your mind, and in the corner of your eye, if possible.

, Even if you're in a relatively safe neighborhood -- and especially if you're not -- you should find the most popular, well-lit street. If you're walking down a dark alley, or find yourself in the middle of a dim residential street, you're more likely to get robbed if there's no one around. A well-lit path will make it easier for you to see where you're going and it will keep criminals from coming your way. Here are some other things to do if you're on foot:


Don't listen to your head phones or keep checking your text messages. Stay alert.
Walk in the opposite direction of the flow of traffic so an abductor is less likely to put you in his car.
Know exactly where you're going to leave the house. If you check your phone's map app every few minutes, you'll be making yourself an easy target.
If you're out alone in the dark, it's not a good time to stop at an ATM.

, It's important to remember that you do not have to suddenly earn a black belt in karate or carry a knife around with you - but if you're generally confident when you go out alone, knowing that you can take care of yourself can reassure you greatly. Train your senses so you will feel like you can look after yourself - be more observant, so that you will know if something is about to happen.


If you travel or live in risky or dangerous areas, learn how to block punches, or think of how to avoid harmful incidents.
Developing a more street smart attitude may seem silly, or pointless, but the simple knowledge that you can protect yourself will increase your confidence.

"
Don't share too much personal information with a new acquaintance.,
Be careful -- but not paranoid.,
Let people see you having a good time.",How to Be Confident and Safe when Going Out Alone2," Though making new friends is part of the fun of going out, you should avoid giving too much personal information to someone you just met, unless that person has been vouched for -- like if she's the best friend of one of your best friends. But even then, be on the look out. Do not mention that you came alone. Say you are waiting for friends to arrive or someone is picking you up soon.


If you meet someone you like, make plans to meet in a coffee shop, at a restaurant, or at an amusement park, rather than giving out your home address or place of work.
Don't mention exactly where you live, even in passing.
Giving out your cell phone number is okay if you want to. The main idea is that you take time to really know this person and get a feel for the real guy or girl, not just that first impression.

, Remember that good people are like sunny days - there are lots of them. Just because you're being careful doesn't mean you need to be afraid that everyone is out there thinking about how to get one over on you. Be prepared - not paranoid. Remembering that there are more sunny days than days when lightning strikes is useful. Lightning is dangerous, maybe deadly - but rare.

, If you want to stay safe and not make yourself a target, have a blast, whether you're with girlfriends or by yourself. People will be less likely to take advantage of you if you look like the life of the party instead of hanging out by yourself in the corner. And remember to relax once you're in a safe environment -- you won't have a good time if you don't. Once you've reached your destination, settle in and resolve to have a good time, no matter what.

Take a taxi home if you're drunk.,
Quickly walk back to your car if you can drive home safely.",How to Be Confident and Safe when Going Out Alone3," Remember that there is no designated driver - you're it. Be aware of what you are drinking. Do not leave your drink unattended for any reason. If someone buys you a drink, make sure you watch the bartender pour it. If you suspect your drink has been compromised, do NOT drink it. Don't get drunk! If you do get drunk, don't plan on going home without calling a taxi or relative to collect you.


Just a reminder: if you're out completely alone, it's not not a good idea to get too drunk or someone will take advantage of you. But if you're walking out to meet friends, that's okay.

, Take a close read of the street and then go straight to your car, then home. Alone. If the guard or bouncer, or a group of other women you have met, offer to walk you to your car, take them up on it. At the very least, let someone know that you're going home now, and ask them to watch you till you get in your car.


Take a look around - know who is on the street with you, and if you see an alley between you and your car, walk in the middle of the street if necessary to give yourself plenty of room to move if you need to.
Walk purposefully and confidently to your car, and when you get there, have your keys ready and unlock the car as you are taking your last steps toward it. As you approach the car do a quick visual check that nobody is inside of it. Get in, lock the doors immediately, buckle up, start your car and drive away. Don't sit in your car fixing your make-up or fiddling with your iPad or texting someone - get going.

Expect your piercer to use hypoallergenic jewelry.",How to Treat an Infected Ear Piercing," While it's normal to have some pain and redness around the piercing site for up to two days, any more than that should be cause for concern. Keep your eye out for the following symptoms:


Red, inflamed streaks or marks on the skin that radiate out from the piercing site.
Increased pain, redness, swelling, heat, or tenderness around the piercing site.
A thick yellow-green pus-like discharge coming from the piercing site. It's normal to see a bit of oozing or bleeding from the piercing which is a sign of healing, but be alert for pus combined with swelling and redness.
Swollen or tender lymph glands above or below the piercing. With an ear piercing, you may feel sore and swollen glands in your neck around your jawline.
Fever. If you're otherwise healthy (no cold or flu), and you develop a fever, this is cause for concern.;
, If the above symptoms occur, make a doctor’s appointment as quickly as possible, and avoid possibly serious complications.


Note that while most problems happen around the time of piercing, they can become infected months or even years after the initial pierce.Signs of an allergic reaction versus an infection include burning sensation on the skin, an expanding wound, and a clear yellow discharge.

, They will provide specific advice on how to treat your particular infection. While not everybody will get the same treatment, doctors often recommend following these steps while treating an infected piercing:


Do not remove your jewelry unless instructed by your doctor. Keeping the jewelry in ensures proper drainage and helps to prevent an abscess from forming.

If you are having an allergic reaction to the metal, the doctor will have you remove the jewelry.


Use an antibiotic cream or antibiotic tablets. You will have to either apply the cream topically or take pills as prescribed, usually for ten to fourteen days. Most infections of this nature are caused by Staphylococcus, so be sure to follow the prescribed course of antibiotics so that you completely eradicate the staph bacteria.

, Follow the instructions of your piercing studio regarding cleaning a new ear piercing.

,


Remove any developed crust with a cotton swab that has been moistened with antibacterial soap, saline solution or the solution you were given when your ears were pierced.
Avoid topical treatments such as alcohol or peroxide, which can dry your skin, or ointments, which can prevent fresh air from getting to the piercing.

, Boil a cup of water and let it cool down. Add a few spoons of sea salt. Clean the infected/inflamed area for one week, plus.

, This will increase blood flow to the earlobe and will help to prevent infection.

, Only touch the ear if you’re cleaning the piercing, and keep clothing away from the site: it can cause excessive friction or rubbing, which can irritate the skin.

, Avoid pools, rivers, lakes, hot tubs, and other places that may harbor infectious bacteria.

, A professional piercer who follows local health department guidelines is the best way to prevent infection. A professional will also use procedures to prevent against the transmission of blood-borne diseases, like tetanus or HIV.

, Your state, county or city health department will have information on licensing requirements for piercing studios.


Avoid performing the piercing yourself or having an untrained friend perform the piercing. while the process itself is not difficult, having sterile tools and antiseptic procedures are required to minimize the chances of infection.

, Piercers should wash their hands between piercings and wear a fresh pair of protective gloves for each piercing. Ear-piercing guns should never be used as they cannot be sterilized properly (unless they use a disposable piercing gun) and the jewelry is relatively blunt which causes unnecessary damage to the piercing. An actual professional piercer (with years of apprenticeship and experience) will never use a piercing-gun., An autoclave is a machine that piercers often use to sterilize equipment. For equipment that will not fit into the autoclave, such as drawer handles, tables and sinks, piercers should sterilize the equipment with a commercial disinfectant or bleach solution after each use.

, Surgical steel, titanium, niobium or 14 or 18-carat gold are appropriate for a new piercing. Avoid nickel, which commonly causes allergic reactions.

Stay alert at all times.,
Determine whether you are precisely being followed.,
Use positive self talk.,
Quickly assess the situation to see if it's possible to get yourself out of harm's way.,
If the previous step isn't going to prove possible, you'll need to find other fast solutions.,
Take action.,
Continue yelling.,
Run or get away.,
If you have a cell phone, call the police at the same time as continuing to walk to somewhere safe.,
Take your keys out of your purse or pocket.,
If you've done everything and the person is still following you, it probably means that the person plans on harming you.,
Don't go straight home.",How to Avoid an Attack if You Think You're Being Followed," Whenever and wherever you're out walking, jogging, taking the dog for a walk, etc. and you're by yourself, keep your wits about you the whole time and stay observant. Your first defense against anyone who might try to attack you is to be aware of their presence.


Take the time to glance around you and behind you now and then. Try to do it every 30-60 seconds. Is anything out of place or is there anything of possible concern? In much the same way you intuit that someone is ""checking you out"", it's also very usual to be able to pick up on someone--or something--not being right, including being ""checked out"" for all the wrong reasons.;
, If your intuition/instinct/reason informs you that you are likely being followed, then it makes sense to test your guess. A few ways to do this include:


Cross the street, pretending that you actually need to cross the street, and see if the person does the same.
Speed up slowly and see if the person does the same.
Don't assume that just because the person hasn't quickly copied you that they're not speeding up to keep up––bring your instinct into play as well. If you consider that this person has been following you for several minutes or you feel rather unsafe, then it's time to act. Never ignore your feelings.

, This is not the time to panic––you need to think clearly so that you can put yourself out of harm's way. Tell yourself: ""Okay, calm down and don't panic. I can deal with this right now."" If someone continues to follow you, do not panic. If you panic, you could miss details that may save you. Have a look around you to check your surroundings and keep looking where you're going.

, If there is a group of people you can slip into and stay very publicly observed, this is a good first option. Look for people at a cafe, in a gallery, waiting in a queue, shoppers in a store, etc.––anywhere that a group of people is situated and where a potential attacker wouldn't be able to make a move without being seen. Also, don't try to be too obvious that you want to get away from the stalker. Just start speeding up a little bit from time to time, like it says before. Then, start jogging. At least you are somewhat getting further away from the stalker. If you run, you could get yourself in a big trap with the stalker. If there is a police or fire station, ambulance building or similar place with authority figures at work, run in there for safety.


If it's nighttime, and you really feel scared, stop at a well-lit public place, such as a restaurant or hotel. Call the police or family and friends and ask them to escort you to your home, or stay with them (either police or family and friends) for a while.
Never head for a dark alley, through fields or woods, or anywhere that could be a dead end. Always head for open public spaces, well-lit if night, and wherever there are the most people around.

, Never be embarrassed about turning around and looking to see if the person is getting closer. By confronting the situation head on, you immediately alert the potential attacker that you're fully aware that he or she is on your tail––for many a follower, this can be enough to cause the person to stop. However, don't hang around too long doing this––you can't stare down an attacker in most cases.

, Consider stopping dead in your tracks and throwing your hands in the air. Avoid dropping any possessions that you might be tempted to retrieve, as this could place you in a vulnerable position. It could also lose you potentially good defensive weapons, such as your keys. Then, scream loudly! For example, yell something like: ""Stop following me! I don't want anything to do with you! Go away!"" If you can't think of anything else, yell ""Fire!"" really loudly. The odds are that the the person following you, whether or not they mean to do harm, will leave you alone, also if you yell ""fire!"" really loud someone could think there is a real fire and go see what going on, so yelling fire is a good choice.


If you have a personal alarm or a whistle, use it to make as much noise as possible.

, Draw as much attention to yourself as possible when around any other person than the follower. Make people look at you to see what is going on. Your attacker does not want to be seen, let alone get caught.

, If you're fit, start running. Putting distance between yourself and the potential attacker is the best thing you can do. As stated above, run to where you know there will be people.

, Announce that you're calling the police. While you're calling, remember to watch where you're going and continue to draw attention to yourself. Follow the directions of the operator.
, Hold on to them tightly if you don't have a cell phone, and the person is still following you. Keys can make an excellent weapon if you're forced into having to defend yourself. Also, any registered weapons should be taken out if you have them. Then drop your purse and keep walking––it may be all the person following is after, some money and valuables. If this feels like a terrible thing to do, consider whether hanging onto it is worth your life?

, But chances are if you do all of this, a person won't still be following you. Most followers run away after someone screams and draws attention to themselves, afraid of being caught and recognized. If you are actually attacked, use your keys, fists, fingers, or anything else you have as a weapon and yell loudly as much as you can. Poke the attacker's eyes, kick their genital region, scratch and bite. Do anything to get away from their grasp, all the while screaming if you can.


If you know self-defense, use it. However, don't try to do martial arts poses when you haven't a clue about them. You're much better off attacking with your wits and drive to survive than your imagination.

, This will show the person where you live and is especially dangerous if you live alone. Try to go to a neighbor's house, a friend's house or another family member's house, where you know there will be other people to answer the door and take care of you.

Dry with a clean towel.If you're changing your tragus jewelry out for a new piece, make sure to sterilize the new jewelry. Wash it in soap and water, and then dunk it in rubbing alcohol for a minute or two.;
, Your hair will get in the way as you try to change your jewelry. It's best to pin it back out of the way to make the process easier on yourself. Of course, if you have short hair, it won't be a problem for you., When you take your jewelry out of the tragus, it helps to pull the skin away so you can get to the piercing. Place your finger directly in front of the tragus, and gently pull the skin forward. That should show more of the jewelry, giving you room to work., Unscrew the ball from the back of the stud. Be careful not to drop the ball, as it can be difficult to find. After you unscrew it, you can pull the stud out of your ear., Press your finger up against the back of the ear, so that the stud is pushed forward. Unscrew the ball in the front. Once it's unscrewed, push it gently towards the back, and pull the flat back stud out from the other side.If you're having trouble, use rubber gloves or even tweezers to hold onto the post in the back., A segment ring is a ring with a piece that opens up and then snaps back into place. To take it out, find the notch where it unsnaps and open up the hoop. Pull it out through the back of your ear.Be careful when unsnapping the ring, as the skin is sensitive in this area.

, With this type of earring, a small bar fits inside the stud that goes through your ear. Push the bar forward from the back. Pull the front stud out of the tube. Lightly push the stud backwards, and pull the stud out of the back of your ear., You should never change any piercing out if it's not healed. Drainage and crustiness indicate it hasn't healed. In addition, it will still be painful if it hasn't healed. Don't rush the process, as it could lead to an infected piercing.Healing can take several months with the tragus.
Infected piercings, which may have redness, swelling, and extreme drainage (thick pus), should be checked out by doctor. Don't take out your piercing if you suspect an infection., This piercing is particularly susceptible to healing over. To keep it from closing, do not leave it open too long.

Wash your hands.,
Remove the earring(s) and clean the infected piercing(s).,
Clean the earring post and reinsert the earring.,
Repeat this cleaning process three times each day.,
Use over-the counter pain medications properly.,
Don't hesitate to see a doctor if the infection worsens.",How to Take Care of Infection in Newly Pierced Ears1," Most ear piercing infections are uncomfortable, but, provided action is taken, are never a serious problem. While newly-pierced ears can have a lingering tender feeling for days or weeks, an actual infection usually comes with redness, swelling, and irritation. If your piercing is exhibiting these symptoms, you probably have a minor infection. Not to worry - most piercing infections go away with a few days of treatment at home.;
, Most piercing infections are the result of bacteria being introduced into the piercing. This can be from a variety of sources, though dirty piercing equipment, dirty earrings, and dirty hands are among the most common. The next few steps will require you to touch your ears and earrings with your hands, so, before beginning, be sure to carefully wash with an antibacterial soap them to make them as clean and sterile as possible.


If you're extra-worried about the germs on your hands, you may even wear a pair of sterile gloves as you work.

, When your hands are cleaned, carefully remove the earring from the infected piercing. Use a clean cotton swab or Q-tip to apply an anti-bacterial cleaning solution to both sides of the piercing.


In terms of cleaning solutions, you may have several options. Some earrings come with a solutions specifically-designed for this purpose. If yours did not, most commercial antiseptic solutions (especially ones containing benzalkonium chloride) intended for similar uses will work well.

Some medical sources recommend rubbing alcohol,while others recommend against it.



, Next, clean your earring's post (the part that sits in the piercing) with the same antiseptic solution you cleaned your ear with. After doing this, apply a thin coating of antibiotic ointment or cream to the post. This will help to kill bacteria inside the piercing when the earring is re-inserted. Finally, put the earring back in.

, Perform this routine - removing the earring, cleaning the outside of the piercing, cleaning and applying antibiotic ointment to the post, and re-inserting the earring - three times per day. Maintain this routine for two days after the symptoms of the infection disappear.


This last point is important. When fighting bacterial infections, it's crucial to ensure that the infection has been completely wiped out before stopping treatment. If a small amount of bacteria remain, the infection may return.

, While you're waiting for your infection to disappear, you can treat the pain and inflammation resulting from it by taking most commercially-available painkillers. Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Naproxen Sodium, and most other cheap, common medicines will work fine.


Even when dealing with these relatively weak drugs, never take more than the recommended dosage or mix drugs carelessly. This is especially true with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), a class of drugs including Ibuprofen and Aspirin, which have been linked to a variety of serious side effects at high doses., Though most infections caused by ear piercings are superficial and temporary, some can develop into serious issues. Left untreated, these infections can cause lasting discomfort, permanent damage to the ear, or even worse outcomes. If your infection leads to any of the following symptoms, it's a wise idea to see a doctor as soon as possible to gain access to antibiotics or other forms of treatment:Swelling and redness that worsen or do not improve after two days of treatment
Fluid draining from the site of the infection
Swelling that becomes so pronounced that it is difficult to see either side of the earring
Fever over 100.4°F (38.0°C)

Know when to stop.",How to Stretch an Ear Lobe Piercing," If you don't have it already, get your earlobes pierced. Gun piercings aren't that great, especially if you get them done by an unprofessional at the mall. Go to a piercer and get your lobes pierced with a needle. You should wait at least five months before beginning a stretch, to let your ear fully heal.


Getting a piercing at a professional body piercer with a needle is the safest way, and they can pierce your ear at a bigger size than if you got it done with a gun.;
, Most standard piercings start at 16g or 14g, but can be done bigger by request. Years of wearing long, dangly earrings and tugging on your piercings may make your piercings bigger! Professional body piercers can measure your ears to see what size they are.

, From personal experience, it's hard to decide on a stopping point. Stretching is addicting, and you may decide on a larger size later on. But for now, get a rough idea of where you want to stop. This way, you can go to the store and buy just what you need.


In order, these are the sizes for stretched piercings. The smallest is a 20 gauge, and they increase in size as the chart continues.






20 gauge- .8mm
18 gauge- 1mm
16 gauge- 1.2mm
14 gauge- 1.6 mm
12 gauge- 2mm
10 gauge- 2.5mm
8 gauge- 3.2mm
6 gauge- 4mm
4 gauge- 5mm
2 gauge- 6mm
1 gauge - 7mm
0 gauge- 8mm
9mm
00 gauge- 10mm

7⁄16 inch (1.1 cm)- 11mm
½ inch- 12.7mm

9⁄16 inch (1.4 cm)- 14mm

5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm)- 16mm

11⁄16 inch (1.7 cm)- 18mm
¾ inch- 19mm

7⁄8 inch (2.2 cm)- 22mm

15⁄16 inch (2.4 cm)- 24mm
1 inch (2.5 cm)- 25mm
1 and 1/16 inch- 28mm
1 and 1/8 inch- 30mm
1 and ¼ inch- 32mm
1 and 3/8 inch- 35mm
1 and ½ inch- 38mm
1 and 5/8 inch- 41mm
1 and ¾ inch- 44mm
1 and 7/8 inch- 47mm
2 inch (5.1 cm)- 50mm
Sizes can get bigger after 2 inches (5.1 cm), but it is most commonly the biggest size.

, A taper is a long stick used to stretch your ear from a small size to a bigger one, but for the first few stretches (before a 10 or 8 gauge, depending on your elasticity), you might be able just to put in the earring. Tapers are not jewelry, however, and should only be used as tools to stretch to the next size, and follow up with your tunnel/plug. There are other methods of stretching such as ""dead stretching"" and ""taping"". Dead stretching involves just waiting until your piercing naturally is loose enough to move to the next size without using a taper. Taping is where PTFE tape is wrapped around your current earrings then oiled and put back in the ear, a few wraps of tape every 3-4 days will move the piercing up to the next size fairly rapidly.

When you first stretch a piercing, hoops and horseshoe earrings are much easier to wear than plugs because they allow for movement and swelling. Treat a stretched piercing as a new piercing.
Lubricants also make a stretch easier. While you're out getting a new taper, get some Jojoba Oil, Emu Oil, Vitamin E or another lube. Neosporin and Vaseline are not good lubes. If you read the back, it says not to use on a cut or open wound (like freshly stretched ears).

, Find a time when you have the bathroom to yourself and push the taper in. When it finally gets in, let your ear rest and put the earring in. Don't forget to lube the taper and both sides of your ear. Some people say a hot shower beforehand helps to make your ear a bit stretchy and massage it to get the blood flowing.


When stretching, one stretch should start by pushing the taper in from the front, then the next stretch you should push the taper in from the back, then front, then back, and so on. This helps to keep scar tissue from forming and keeps stretching easier.

, Do sea salt soaks (1/8 teaspoon of sea salt dissolved into a cup of warm water) twice daily for the first week or so. Use ear care solution from the piercer for cleaning away crusties, or little bits of sand-like tissue that comes out of your ears. This is when it's easier to use a hoop earring.

, Here is a chart to determine how long you should wait in between stretches:

16g to 14g - 1 month
14g to 12g - 1 month
12g to 10g - 1.5 months
10g to 8g - 2 months
8g to 6g - 3 months
6g to 4g - 3 month
4g to 2g - 3 months
2g to 0g - 4 months
0g to 00g - 4 months

,, If you stretch improperly and get a blowout or thin lobes, downsize, and do daily oil massages to thicken lobes. With blowouts, downsize and put a single flared plug in from the opposite side to ""roll"" it back in.

Avoid touching your earrings, especially with dirty hands.,
Clean your earrings and earlobes before inserting your earrings.,
Wear your earrings with a loose clasp.,
Remove the earrings before bed once the piercing has become permanent.,
Use earrings made from a non-irritating material.",How to Take Care of Infection in Newly Pierced Ears2," As noted above, one common cause of infection following an ear piercing is the introduction of bacteria into the piercing via the wearer's hands. Though it's easy to absent-mindedly fool with your earrings while you're bored or daydreaming, try to avoid this type of behavior, especially if your hands haven't been recently washed. Doing so lessens the likelihood that you'll accidentally re-infect your piercing.

, If you're prone to piercing infections, you may want continue performing the cleaning routine above, albeit less frequently. When you're able to, clean the posts of your earrings and the area around each piercing with an antiseptic fluid before inserting your earrings to kill any bacteria that may be introduced into the piercing.

, Believe it or not, one of the causes of ear piercing infection is earrings worn too tightly! If the earring's clasp is applied too tightly, it can cut off the flow of air to the piercing, which, over time, can increase the risk of infection. To prevent this, simply wear your earrings loosely so that air can reach both sides of the piercing.

, For the same reason as above, you'll want to periodically give your piercings a chance to ""rest"" from wearing your earrings. Once the piercings have healed (for piercings in the lobe, this is usually about six weeks), take your earrings out every night before you sleep. Doing so ensures that air is able to reach your piercing, reducing the risk of infection.

, Certain types of metal used for earrings can irritate the skin or cause an allergic reaction in the skin. These problems can develop into full-blown infections if not addressed. For most people, irritation can be avoided by wearing earrings with posts made from neutral metals like 14-karat gold and stainless steel, which are unlikely to cause problems.


Avoid earrings made from nickel, which are notorious for causing allergic reactions.

Take the needle and pop it quickly through the first hole.,
If you used a hollow needle then place the earring in and pull it through.,
Do the same thing with the other hole; this will hurt more now that the blood rushed to your ear.,
Salt soak for a few minutes and pat dry with a napkin or paper towel (never use a cloth or towel because they hold bacteria).

,
Clean your ear at least twice a day with an ear cleaner or salt soak until the piercing is fully healed.,
You can change the piercing usually by three months but everyone heals differently, it takes about six months to a year for it to fully heal.

",How to Self Pierce an Industrial," Clean the needle with alcohol, peroxide or boil it for half an hour. Clean your ear where you will be piercing, and make sure you do this in a clean environment.;
, Make dots where the holes will go.

,, You should hear three pops skin, cartilage, and skin. Make sure you have a steady hand and that you go through at the right angle, or the earring will be uncomfortable.

, If you used a safety pin then you will have to pull the pin out and put the earring in, do it in one swift motion, it would probably hurt more than if you use a hollow needle.

, The piercing might bleed.

,, Turn your earring twice a day to keep the skin from growing on it.

Only remove your earrings after the amount of time recommended by your piercer, usually at least six weeks. If you take the earrings out too early, the holes could close or become infected.If you have long hair, tie it back so you can easily get to your ears.;
, Take a cotton ball and dip it in rubbing alcohol or the cleansing solution you may have been given. Gently wipe around the earring so that you wipe the ear free of dirt and skin cell buildup.








You can also use a cotton swab if you're worried that a cotton ball might snag on your earring.
You should clean your ear like this every day until you're ready to take the earrings out.

, Use the thumb and index finger on one hand to grasp the front of your earring. With the thumb and index finger of your other hand, hold the back of the earring post.Keep a firm grip on the earring so that it doesn't fall when you remove the earring back and pull it out. Be especially careful if you're standing over a sink.

, Use your fingers to gently wiggle the earring back so that it moves back and forth, loosening and removing it from the post. The other hand should still be holding the front of the earring in place. You could also try peeling the back away from the post if you can't wiggle it free.








Avoid spinning your earrings when initially wearing them or removing them. Spinning or twisting can rebruise the healed part of your ear. Constantly touching and spinning the earrings can also cause infection., Once the back of the earring is off, you can slowly pull the post out of your ear, keeping a firm grip on the jewelry or stud. Repeat the process with the other earring.








Never push the post through your ear to pull it out of the back, even if the jewelry or stud is small.

, Disinfect your hands and let them air dry. You should also disinfect the new pair of earrings. Since your ears are still getting used to earrings, choose earrings made of gold, surgical steel, or hypo-allergenic material. Avoid wearing hoops, dangling, or fish-hook styles as your second earrings. These may be heavier and could pull down on your ear lobes or get caught in your hair. Let your holes heal for a few more weeks or months before wearing these types.








If you'd rather let your holes close up, keep the earrings in for the recommended 6 weeks so that the ears heal. Then, remove the earrings and wash the ears every day until the holes close up., Your ear shouldn't bleed when you take out your earrings. But, if you notice bleeding when you try to remove your earrings, you may torn some skin because your holes were not completely healed. Put pressure on the ears to stop the bleeding. You can use gauze or a clean towel to push against the ear lobe for 10 minutes.


If the bleeding continues after 10 minutes, call a doctor.

, If you notice any redness, swelling, or discharge, you may have an infection. You should also put some antibiotic cream on the ear. If the symptoms don't improve after a day, or you also develop a fever or the redness spreads, get medical attention immediately.Make sure you keep your earrings in and clean your ears with an antiseptic solution. If you remove the earrings, the infection could spread., If you notice your ears smell bad or the earrings smell bad after you remove them, you need to be more thorough when cleaning. Once your ears have completely healed, take the earrings out and wash your ears with clear glycerin soap and warm water. You should also wash your earrings with clear glycerin soap and warm water. Wash on a regular basis (every few days) to eliminate the smell.A buildup of skin cells, oil, and bacteria can make your ears and earrings smell bad.

, If your ears hurt when you try to remove the earrings, you may want to let them heal a little longer. Make sure that you're doing a good job of cleaning your eyes too, since skin buildup could start to cover the hole. You should also check to see if your earrings are made of gold, surgical steel or hypo-allergenic material. If not, your ears may be reacting to nickel or another material.


If you continue to feel pain after changing earrings and cleaning your ears, contact your doctor.

, If you still can't get the earrings out, ask a friend to help you remove them. You may just be having trouble seeing what you're doing and another set of hands can help you take the earrings out. If you and a friend are still having trouble, go back to the place where you had your ears pierced.


The person who pierced your ears should have a tool that can remove your earrings.

Apply an ice cube wrapped in a paper towel to reduce swelling and redness.,
Find a space with good lighting and a mirror.

,
Put your earring in the other way.,
Put the earring through the front hole and twist it continually until you find the back hole and the earring goes through.,
Wash your ear in cold water or apply an ice cube again if the ear is still swollen.

,
Apply antibiotic cream or the solution you got when your ears were pierced, especially if your ears bled or your piercing was closed up.

",How to Put Your Earring Back when It Won't Go in," Sometimes, the reason you may not be able to get your earring back in is simply due to inflammation that shrinks or closes off the piercing hole.;
,, In other words, put it through from the back piercing/hole to the front. Don't worry if you can't get it all the way through.

, Although this isn't recommended, if your piercing has slightly closed up at the back, you can try to poke it through - this will hurt a bit, but shouldn't be a problem.

Deal with infections immediately.",How to Safely Pierce Your Own Ear," If the piercing needle doesn't come in sterile packaging, or you're using a safety pin or needle, you will need to sterilize them thoroughly before use. Take a match or lighter and hold the piercing end of the needle over the open flame for about ten seconds. Allow the needle to cool slightly, then wipe it down with the rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. Leave it on a piece of tissue to dry and make sure not to touch the piercing end after this point.









You will also need to sterilize the earrings by submerging them in the rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide if they do not come in sterilized packaging. Let them sit in the sterilization fluid for a minute or two, before removing and setting on a clean piece of tissue to dry.
Make sure to separate the front and backs of the earrings. This will make them easier to insert when the time comes.
Understand that this method will not sterilize the earrings or needle 100%, there will still be a certain amount of bacteria left. The only way to guarantee complete sterilization is to buy the products pre-sterilized, or use an autoclave (sterilization device).;
, The next thing you need to do is thoroughly clean the ear to remove any bacteria from the surface of the skin. You can do this by dipping a cotton ball into the rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and using it to wipe the front and back of the earlobe. Allow the ear to dry completely before proceeding with the piercing.









It is also possible to buy antibacterial gel (such as Bactine) designed especially for use with piercings. This is available for purchase at most tattoo and piercing parlors, or online.

, If you like, you can use a felt tip marker to indicate the spot where you want the piercing to go. This will help you to center the needle on the earlobe and prevent a crooked piercing. However some people prefer not to mark the spot, as they don't like the idea of getting ink in their fresh piercing. Whether you decide to mark the spot or not is up to you, it's a matter of personal preference.








, At this point, some people choose to numb their ear. This can be done by holding an ice cube or ice pack against the ear for a minute or two before piercing. This will effectively numb the ear, but the cold will also cause the skin on the ear to tighten, making it tougher and harder to pierce. For this reason, many people choose to skip this step.


Alternatively, you can rub a little numbing gel onto the earlobe using a q-tip. Wait for it to dry before proceeding.

, Before going any further, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap. After sterilizing your tools, earrings and ears so carefully, you don't want to have dirty hands! If you like, you can also wear latex gloves while you pierce, though this may feel a little awkward.

, Hold it firmly in place with one hand, while you pick up the needle with another. Alternatively, have a (non-squeamish) friend help you out by holding the cork in place while you do the piercing.

, Pick up the piercing needle (or safety pin or needle) and position it against your ear, centered at a 90 degree angle from the earlobe. If you have marked the spot, place it directly above the ink dot.

, In one smooth, fluid movement, push the needle through the earlobe and into the cork on the other side. You will feel a sharp pinch, and your ear may feel hot and flushed, but it will not be painful. Hold the needle in the ear for about 30 seconds and wiggle it around slightly. This will help to widen the hole.








, If you have used a piercing needle, inserting the earring will be easy. Simply slide the pin into the hollow center of the needle, then pull the needle out, leaving the earring in the ear. Wipe away any blood with a cotton ball, then secure the back.


If you have used a safety pin or a regular needle, you will need to work quickly, as it can be difficult to get the earring through a fresh piercing.
Remove the needle from the ear and, holding the earlobe slightly taut, push the pin of the earring through the hole as fast as you can.

, If you are piercing both ears, go through the whole preparation procedure again (including sterilizing the needle) and repeat on the other side. Now grab a mirror and admire your handiwork!








, A sterile piercing needle is the best instrument to use when piercing your ears. This is because it has a hollow center which will allow you to easily insert the earring once the ear has been pierced. Sterile piercing needles are available at beauty supply stores and from online vendors. You should never borrow or share a needle with anyone else, as this can easily lead to infection.


Some people use regular needles or large safety pins to pierce their ears. Between these two options, the safety pin is the better choice as it provides better grip, whereas the needle can easily slip through your fingers.
If using a needle or safety pin, it is imperative that you completely sterilize them before using, otherwise they can cause an infection.
The last option is to buy a set of self-piercing earrings, which come pre-sterilized in a loaded spring puncher, at a beauty supply store. If you choose this option, follow the directions on the packaging.

, The next thing you'll need is a set of starter earrings. These are specially designed for newly pierced ears, with a pointed tip and a wider gauge. This makes them easier to insert and also allows them to stretch out the holes, so that they heal to the right size.


If possible, opt for medical grade titanium or surgical steel earrings -- these contain the least amount of nickel, which is a common allergen. Pure gold or silver earrings are also good options.
Avoid cheap earrings, as these usually contain high quantities of nickel and can cause allergic reactions and infections.

, These substances are necessary to sterilize the ear and the piercing tools before use. It is essential to sterilize everything thoroughly, in order to avoid infections, which are painful, look unpleasant and may force you to remove the piercing.

, This will be necessary to hold behind your ear so that the needle has something to push against as it pierces your ear. If there was nothing behind your ear, the needle would tug your skin and you would find it much harder to get the needle through.


A piece of cork or a dry bar of soap are the best options, though a piece of cut apple will also do the trick.
Some people recommend using bits of potato or an eraser, but these can be dirty or harbor bacteria, so it is better to stick with one of the other options if possible.

, The cotton balls will be necessary to clean the ear and to wipe away any blood after piercing, while the tissues will provide a clean place for the sterilized needle and earrings to rest until you are ready to use them.

, Although having your ear pierced is not very painful (it just feels like a firm pinch) some people prefer to numb their ear before going through with it. This can be done with an ice cube, an ice pack, or some tooth numbing gel.

, You should aim to leave the starter earring in for 4 to 6 weeks after the piercing. This will give the piercing adequate time to heal. If you change your earrings before the piercing has fully healed, you run the risk of introducing bacteria to the ear and causing an infection.

, A freshly pierced ear is essentially like an open wound, so it is important that you clean it every day to avoid infection. You can clean the piercings using a special antiseptic cleanser designed specifically for new piercings, or you can simply use a solution of sea salt dissolved in hot water. Whichever you're using, dip a q-tip in the solution and clean around the piercing gently, but thoroughly. Make sure to clean around the front and the back of the earring and remember to use a fresh q-tip for each ear.

, Although conventional ear piercing advice recommended twisting the studs daily to prevent them from becoming embedded in the ears, this is no longer advised. Twist the hearing everyday otherwise it will be stuck in your ear forever and get infected and rip out. In addition, constantly handling the earrings significantly increases the risk of infection. As for the risk of embedding; as long as you use good quality earrings which are skin friendly, you don't need to worry about it., If you do develop an infection (which is much more likely with home piercing) it is essential that you take care of it immediately, to prevent it from becoming worse, or spreading. Leave the earring in and apply a warm compress to the ear four times a day, for three minutes each time. After each compress, clean the ear with an antiseptic cleanser, then apply a topical antibiotic cream. If you don't see an improvement within 24 hours, you should visit your doctor."

Poorly performed piercings can lead to infection, bleeding, and nerve damage. You need to understand the risks if you want to continue.
If you have any doubt, wait and see a professional for your piercing.;
, Do not use a sewing needle or pin -- piercing needles are cheap online and are made for piercings. There are a surprising number of suitable needles, but there are only a couple of considerations for piercing your tragus. Your needle should be:


Hollow
One size, or gauge, bigger than your earring (ex. a 12 gauge needle for an 11 gauge earring)
Curved (Optional). Most professionals use curved needles because they mimic the curve of your tragus. However, they are hard to maneuver and are not strictly necessary., You can never be too cautious with sanitation when piercing your own body. Remember, you are forming an open wound on your body and leaving it open for several weeks as it heals. This is the perfect place for germs to grow if you are not careful. Be sure to have:


Gloves
Cork
Cotton Swags
Gauze
Disinfectant.
Antiseptic fluid, bleach, rubbing alcohol, and an open flame for sterilization.

, You can use soap and water or an over the counter antiseptic solution. If you use soap, choose antibacterial soap. Remember-- it is essential that your hands and equipment are as clean as possible.

, The importance of this step cannot be stressed enough. Use antibacterial wipes on every surface and sterilize the needle, earring and cork. Be sure to wash everything first with soap and water to remove any dirt or grime. There are two accepted ways to sterilize equipment:


Sterile a needle by holding it over an open flame for 10-15 seconds. Do no touch the needle to the flame.
Sterilize equipment by mixing equal parts water and bleach in shallow bowl. Submerge your equipment and leave it there for at least one minute. Rinse with clean water.

Anytime that your hands or equipment becomes dirty or contaminated, repeat this process completely.

, While the tragus is not a complicated piercing, you need to be prepared if you slip, faint, or pierce incorrectly. Have a friend nearby who can call emergency services if need be.

, This allows you to hold your tragus steady and stops the needle from continuing after it has pierced your tragus. Plug the cork in your ear so that it rests comfortably against the back of your tragus.


You may need to cut the cork in half to fit it in your ear, but make sure it is at least 1/2 inch thick.

, Make sure the needle rests in the middle of the tragus and is not crooked or angled. You can buy piercing markers as well to make a note where you want the earring if it helps. Never use regular markers, however, as the ink can enter your wound.

, Use quick, even force to push the needle through your ear and into the cork. Do not push at an angle or try to jerk the needle in. Keep calm and push the needle through with a fast but methodical motion.


To relax your body before piercing, inhale deeply and then push as you begin to exhale.
Do not stop halfway, as this will only prolong the pain.

, While it is there, use your cotton swab and some rubbing alcohol or antiseptic to disinfect the wound.


Gently twist and pull the needle to partially remove it. Leave a small amount of the needle in your ear -- this will help you put in the new earring easily.

, Use the hollow point of the needle to guide the earring into your ear. Holding the earring in place, remove the rest of the needle so that only the earring remains. Clasp the earring shut., You can dip the gauze in antiseptic or rubbing alcohol help sterilize the wound. Dispose of all materials

, This allows the skin to heal around the earring, leaving a small hole. If you take the earring out early the hole may close up, forcing you to repeat your piercing., For the next two weeks, keep you ear clean with soap and water to prevent an infection from building up. If you notice any of the following symptoms, leave the earring in and see a doctor immediately:


Red or swollen skin
Pain
Green or yellow discharge
Fever"

Wash your hands.,

Clean the new piercing with saline nightly.",How to Pierce Your Ears at Home," Before starting the piercing process, scrub your hands with antibacterial soap. Be sure to clean under your nails, and lather your hands for at least 60 seconds with the soap to remove any harmful bacteria or dirt.If you like, you can also wear disposable medical gloves to perform the piercing. You can buy these at your local drug store.;
, Wet a cotton ball or Q-tip with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution and clean the front and back of your earlobe. Be sure to clean the area completely, including where the lobe meets your neck. If you perform vigorous exercise during the day, it may make sense to undertake your piercing project after a shower, so the skin is relatively clean from excess sweat., Use rubbing alcohol or vodka to sterilize a sewing needle. Alcohol with a concentration weaker than vodka (40%) is not advised. Pour alcohol into a small vessel, such as a shot glass, and submerge the needle completely in the solution. Let it sit entirely submerged in the alcohol for at least one minute., It is best to use stud earrings in surgical-grade stainless steel, as this is less likely to cause skin irritation than gold or silver. You can buy these earrings at a local mall or online. Pour rubbing alcohol or vodka into a small vessel, such as a shot glass, and submerge the earrings and their backs completely in the solution., If desired, you can mark your ears ahead of time to perfect the position of your piercings. Buy a surgical marker, which is sterile and intended for piercings, online. Then, looking in a mirror, place a dot on each of your ears where you’d like the piercing to be. Examine your dots in the mirror to ensure the piercing locations are even on each earlobe and pleasing to you.Traditional ear piercings are through the center of the earlobe with a margin of at least ¼ in or ½ cm between the piercing and the edge of the ear. That said, everyone’s ear is a different size and shape. Use your personal taste to determine where you’d like your piercing.
Ear piercings through the cartilage are more complex with longer healing times. These are best performed by a trained professional for optimal results.

, If desired, you can numb your earlobe with some ice before piercing to decrease any discomfort. Handling ice can be messy, so put some in a clean surgical glove and tie a knot in the end. Place against the earlobe for up to 5 minutes., In front of a mirror so you can see what you’re doing, press the sterilizing sewing needle through your ear, until the first half of the needle exits the back of the earlobe. Leave the needle in place (so half of the needle will be on each side of the lobe) while you reach for a sterilized earring., Grab the sharp portion of the needle at the backside of your ear and begin to pull it through. As you draw the needle through the ear, follow the needle’s path by pressing your stud earring’s post into the hole at the front of your ear. This will ensure you don’t lose the new hole you’ve created. Close the new piercing by putting the back of your earring on.


Repeat this method on the other side.

, If your new piercings bleed a little immediately following the piercing, dip the tip of a clean Q-tip into some rubbing alcohol and clean any crusted blood away by wiping gently around the perimeter of the stud. Do not loosen or remove your new earring while doing this., In order for your piercing to heal properly, you should not remove or change out the jewelry from your new piercings for the first six weeks.Even if your piercings become infected, your jewelry allows drainage from the area. Removing jewelry of a piercing that is infected could cause bacteria to become effectively sealed inside the piercing without a way to drain.If you suspect your piercing is infected—it will leak green puss and will be hot to the touch—you should see a doctor right away for an assessment.

, Each night use a Q-tip dipped in saline, which you can purchase at a local drug store, to clean around the edges of the piercing. Use the tip to wipe around the stud in a circular motion, twisting your piercings gently through one 360-degree rotation. This will remove any natural crusting that occurs as the piercing heals.Do not apply an antibacterial ointment, such as Neosporin, to the area, as these ointments are not intended for puncture wounds.

Piercing your ears at home results in a higher chance of infection. Please think about your choice carefully before you do it. If you do decide to pierce your ear at home, follow the steps listed below.;
, Piercing needles have a hollow center so you can easily slip your earring through your ear once you make a hole with the needle. Do not share needles with other people as this could lead to infection. Piercing needles can be cheaply obtained at many online vendors, as well at many piercing studios.Make sure to use a needle that is one gauge bigger than the earring that you plan to wear. 16 gauge barbell studs combined with 15 gauge needles work well.
You can also choose to buy a piercing package, which comes with two sterilized piercing earrings that have been loaded into a spring puncher. You can purchase these at beauty supply stores. Make sure to follow the directions on the package exactly as they are written.

, The best thing for newly pierced ears, whether it's through lobes or cartilage, are studs. 16 gauge and about 10mm long (3/8"") is a good size; the length allows for swelling, which can easily double the thickness of your ear.


Some jewelry stores sell piercing earrings--these are earrings with a very sharp tip similar to a needle. These are good to use because they will re-pierce your ear as you slide it into the hole made by your needle.
If you can, purchase earrings of a higher quality metal such as silver or titanium. Metals of higher quality are less likely to infect your ear or cause an allergic reaction. Be aware that some people are allergic to lower quality metals like gold-plated metal.

, Do not reuse someone else's needles; your needle should come in a sterile package. Hold it there until the tip becomes red hot. You should wear sterile latex gloves while doing this so as to make sure that any bacteria on your hands does not get on the needle. Be sure to remove any soot or detritus. Wipe the needle clean with 10%+ rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. Be forewarned, this will only be a partial sterilization and will not kill all the potential microbes that may be on the needle. The only way to completely sterilize piercing utensils is by using an autoclave.You could also sterilize the needle by boiling water. Once the water is boiling, place the needle in the boiling water and let it stay there for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove it with tongs and only hold it with sterile latex gloves. Wipe the needle down with hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol., This will decrease any chance of bacteria of spreading. Put on sterile latex gloves after you have washed your hands., Your hair might get stuck in between your ear and the earring, or it could get pushed through the hole you make with the needle. If possible, tie your hair up and away from your ear.

, You must do this so that your ear is completely wiped clean of any bacteria that may have gotten into your piercing. Wait until the ear is dry to pierce it.You can also use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol to sterilize your ear.

, It is important to plan ahead for where you would like the piercing to go; otherwise your piercing might end up crooked, too high, or too low. If you are piercing both of your ears, look in the mirror and make sure that the marks you have made on your ears are even.


If you have other piercings and are doing your second or third piercing, make sure that you leave enough space in between piercings so that you can wear studs in both holes without the earrings overlapping. Likewise, don’t make your holes too far apart or they may look odd.

, You need to have something against your ear so that you can push the needle through your ear without accidentally piercing your neck too. A cold, clean bar of soap or a cork are both good choices. Avoid apples or potatoes, even though that’s generally what’s used in the movies. Apples, potatoes, or any other food may have bacteria on it that could infect your piercing.If possible, have a friend (or friends) help you with the piercing. Either have them hold the cork against the back of your ear or, if you trust them immensely, have them do the actual piercing. This whole process is much easier to do when you have someone there to help you.

, The needle should be perpendicular to your earlobe. This means that it should make a roughly 90-degree angle with the mark that you made on your ear. Positioning the needle this way will allow it to slide more effectively through your ear.

, Make sure it goes through the spot you have marked. You may hear a popping noise when the needle goes through--don’t freak out! Wiggle the needle, then keep it bent at an angle. If you are using a hollow piercing needle, thread the jewelry through the center of the needle., After you've pierced your ear, and while the needle is sticking through the ear, place the shaft of the earring into the hollow tube of the needle and then push it all the way through the ear. This will leave the earring sitting comfortably in the new hole.

, Slowly remove the needle from your ear, making sure that the earring stays in place. Be aware that this will most likely be painful, but try not to rush it, as you don’t want the earring to fall out or else you will have to go through the piercing process again.


Be aware that the hole you have made could close up in minutes if left without an earring in it. If your earring falls out, resterilize it as quickly as possible and try to fit it back through the hole. If it does not go through, you may have to pierce your ear again.

, You should not take your earring out at any point. After the six weeks have passed, you can switch the earring out, but replace it with another earring immediately. It often takes six months to a whole year for the hole to fully take shape and not close up when you leave it without an earring for any duration of time., Wash your ear with a warm salt water solution. Use sea salt or Epsom salt rather than normal table salt. The salt cleans out the piercing and keeps the hole from getting infected. Clean the piercing until it is fully healed (up to approximately six weeks). Don't use rubbing alcohol once the ear is pierced.An easy way to clean your ear is to find a small cup about the same size as your ear and put the salt water solution into that. Put a towel under the cup (to catch any overflow) and then lay on the couch and lower you ear slowly into the warm, salty water. 5 minutes of that and your ear will be feeling as good as new! ""1 cup/250ml"" measuring cups work well for this.
You can also dip a cotton swab in the warm salt water solution and rub it around and against the piercing.
There are also antiseptic solutions specifically made for newly pierced ears. You can buy them at beauty supply stores. Again, dip a cotton swab in the solution and then rub it in and around the piercing once a day.

, Hold onto the stud part of the earring (the part in the front of your ear) and twist it so that it rotates in the hole. This will open up the hole you have made in your ear and will keep the hole from closing too tightly around the earring., Do this only after six weeks have passed. Put the new earrings immediately after taking the original earring out and cleaning the hole.


It is best if your earrings are made of 100% surgical steel, titanium, or niobium, as these materials are not as prone to causing infection as cheaper materials.

Earrings made from copper, nickel, and white gold commonly cause allergic reactions and infections in wearers. So long as you got your ears pierced at a reputable location, you were probably given a set of gold or stainless steel earrings. However, when you are able to remove your first pair and swap them out for others, be sure only to purchase and wear high quality metal earrings that won’t irritate your skin.;
, While your piercing is still in the healing process, it is important to wear only post style earrings - earrings with a short metal needle and a ‘butterfly’ back to keep them in place. This style of earring is easiest to keep in your ear and doesn’t contain any heavy beading or decorative details. After 6-months of post earrings, you can begin wearing other styles such as the fish-hook or the clasp style earring back., Although there is some debate as to whether spinning your earring is beneficial or detrimental, doctors tend to lean towards the latter. Spinning your earring was done in the past to prevent the piercing from healing around it, therefore making it ‘stuck’. However, the earring is what prevents the skin from healing over, therefore making it very unlikely that your earring will somehow become grafted into your skin. Further, spinning the earring can irritate the skin, possibly causing infection. In general, avoid moving your earrings around too much.

, For the same reason that you shouldn’t spin your earrings after being pierced, you shouldn’t remove your earrings either. Taking your earring out exposes the piercing to possible infection, and increases the likelihood that the piercing will heal over, preventing you from re-inserting the earring later on. As a result, you need to wait until your ear has completely healed and become accustomed to having the earring in all the time. You may be able to remove your posts early if your ear healed quickly, but you’ll need to speak to your piercing specialist to confirm this.

, When your piercing has healed completed (after about 6-weeks, as aforementioned), you’ll want to take out your earrings every night before bed. This opens up the piercing to air circulation, which is important for preventing infection. Replace your earrings every morning though, so that the piercing does not heal over.

, Getting earrings caught on things can be easy to do, especially during the weeks after getting a new ear piercing. Clothing, hair, scarves, and hats are the primary culprits, although anything near your face or head could potentially get caught. Always put on and remove articles of clothing slowly, and avoid pulling long hair away from your face very quickly. Getting something caught on your earring could possibly rip it out, causing not only significant pain but also a ruined piercing.

, Cleaning your piercing on a regular basis will help stimulate healing and prevent an infection. As a result, you should use a saline solution on your ears every day, and clean your piercing with soap as needed (once a day at most) for the 4-6 week healing period. After your piercing is totally healed, you can stop doing the saline solutions altogether, and clean with soap only when you experience symptoms of an infection or irritation., Washing your hands properly prior to cleaning your piercing is important, so that you don’t infect the piercing. Use warm water and an antibacterial soap for sensitive skin; choose one without a scent when possible, as perfumes may irritate your piercing. Scrub your hands for 30-45 seconds before drying them off with a clean cloth.

, It is recommended that for the duration of the healing process (4-6 weeks on average) that your earrings not be removed at any point in time. Taking out your earring before the piercing has healed can irritate the skin and possibly cause infection, not to mention your piercing could heal over and prevent the earring from being re-inserted. Therefore, when you clean your ears, don’t take out the piercings (no matter how tempting!).


The metal of your earrings won’t rust or become damaged from the water or cleaning solution you use.

, It is recommended that you soak your piercing in a saline solution on a daily basis for the first 2-3 weeks to help prevent infection. The saline solution does a number of things, including preventing infection by increasing circulation and preventing bumps or pockets from forming around the piercing. Use non-iodized fine-grain sea salt and distilled water, as other types of salt contain ingredients that could irritate your ears. Mix ¼-teaspoon of the salt with 8-oz (1 cup) of warm water, and pour into a shot glass or small bowl.


The ideal water temperature for the solution is drinking temperature for a warm drink - around 120 to 130 °F (49 to 54 °C).

, Hold your ear in this solution for 2-3 minutes, and then rinse with clean distilled water afterwards. Doing this on a daily basis for 2-3 weeks is often enough to clean your ears and stimulate healing.


Be sure to rinse the solution off your ear, or else the salt will re-crystallize and cause irritation afterwards.
If your piercing is on your cartilage, it may be easier to soak a bit of gauze in the saline solution and hold it to the piercing, that to dip your ear into a cup of the solution.

, If you’re concerned about infection, you can use soap to rinse your ear in addition to the saline solution. Use a mild anti-bacterial soap and warm water to gently rub around your piercing, doing so for no longer than 30-seconds. Rinse off your ear with more clean water, and then pat the piercing dry with a clean cloth or tissue.


Don’t clean your piercing with hydrogen peroxide, witch hazel, or alcohol, as these are too drying and may irritate the skin around your piercing., It might be tempting to put on an anti-bacterial ointment, but this could actually cause an infection. Ointment and thick creams seal over the piercing hole, preventing airflow and slowing the healing time as a result. Further, they trap dust, germs, and other airborne particles which can cause an infection. It is unnecessary to apply anything to your ears after your clean them, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.

, If you’re not spinning your earring or removing them (both of which you should avoid for the 6 weeks post-piercing), then there should rarely be another time you should touch them. Touching your piercing introduces bacteria that could cause an infection. Therefore, don’t play with your earrings or touch your piercing unless you’re cleaning it or swapping out your earrings.

, On post earrings, the butterfly is the backing that secures the earring in place. However, putting this too tight on your ear cuts off circulation and airflow to the piercing, causing pain and possibly infection. Most post earrings have a small notch on the needle-part that shows where the butterfly should stop. In general, only push the butterfly onto the post so far as to only barely touch the back of your ear, but not to pinch it.

, Even if you’re using 14-carat gold or stainless steel earrings, the metal can still become contaminated with germs that might cause infection. Therefore, whenever you put in a new pair of earrings or take yours out for a bit, you should clean them to kill possible germs. Swab them down with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and allow them to dry. Don’t do this while they’re in your ears though, as they peroxide and alcohol will dry out the skin in your ears and possibly cause an irritation.

, If your piercing is new, then it is still very sensitive and can become infected from exposure to the bacteria in water. Showering is fine, but taking a soak in a hot tub or going swimming in any pool, lake, river, or sea is out of the question. These bodies of water contain harmful bacteria and chemicals that are likely to infect your ear. Wait 3-6 months after a new piercing before attempting swimming or submerging your head in water, to significantly limit the possibility of infection., Although it may sound counterintuitive, cleaning your piercing too often may cause infection. That is because over-cleaning dries out the skin and causes an irritation, which over time may become raw and exposed to bacteria and grime that cause infection. You should clean your piercing once a day until it is healed, but doing so more than once a day can have unwanted repercussions.

, Cell phones and headphones being the primary culprits, things that you put near your ears often contain bacteria that can cause infection. Clean these items with antibacterial soap or rubbing alcohol once a week, to reduce the risk of possible infection.

, While some minor swelling, redness, and tenderness is normal for the first 3-6 days after a piercing, extended pain and swelling may be a sign of an infection. If you’re worried your piercing is infected, check for these symptoms:


Pain and swelling that extends beyond the hole
Bleeding
Yellow discharge or a crust around the hole
The earring becomes stuck in your ear
A fever above 100-degrees Fahrenheit

, Most piercing infections are easily treated and don’t progress to anything harmful, so long as they aren’t left to run their course. To treat an infection, use the same saline solution as you would to clean your ear shortly after getting it pierced. Mix a solution of ¼-teaspoon non-iodized sea salt with 8-ounces (1 cup) of warm water. Pour this mixture into a small bowl or shot glass and soak your ear in it for 3-5 minutes. If using a cup is too difficult, soak sterile gauze in the solution and hold it to the infection for 3-5 minutes. Repeat this up to two times a day until the infection has cleared.

, Although holding ice to your infected piercing won’t reduce the infection, it will reduce the swelling and numb some of the pain. Hold an ice cube to your piercing for 5-10 minutes until the swelling has gone down. You can do this daily 2-3 times, or whenever you notice swelling.

, If you’re dealing with a particularly tough infection that does not go away after 2-3 days of treatment, you may need to visit your doctor for a prescription antibiotic. If your earring is stuck in your infected ear or if it won’t stop bleeding, you should also make an appointment with your doctor."

Don't change your piercing.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Pick Earrings when You Get Your Ears Pierced," Surgical stainless steel earrings are typically your best bet for new piercings, as this metal is the least likely to cause an allergic reaction. Nickel and cobalt allergies are very common, so avoid these metals when you first get your ears pierced. When you get your ears pierced, ask the piercer to help you pick out earrings so that you get the right metal.


Besides surgical stainless steel, other fairly safe options include platinum, titanium, and 14K gold.
Talk to your doctor if you want to determine if you have metal allergies.;
, These small hoops and rings are usually made of stainless steel and are the ideal type of starter jewelry for a lobe piercing. Since slight swelling may occur after you get your ears pierced, getting hoops or rings won’t put any pressure on your healing piercing like studs sometimes can.


There are 2 common types of rings/hoops:

Ball closure rings are squeezed together around a ball to stay in place. The ball has a tiny indent on each side for the ends of the ring to fit into. The pressure of the ring keeps the ball in place.Spring closure earrings are hoops/rings that open and close with a spring that snaps in and out of place. Open the spring to place the earring on your ear, and once the earring is on, close the spring. This creates a solid hoop/ring.


Hoop and ring piercings are typically easier to clean because they don't have earring backs that block your fresh piercing.
Make sure to get hoops or sings that are snug on your ear lobe, you won't want your piercing to move too much., Studs are the most popular type of earrings for new piercings because they are small and cute. Many people prefer studs because they don't get in the way and they go with everything. Studs are fairly easy to clean but tend to get infected more easily than hoops. This is because they have earring backs than can be tricky to clean.If you choose studs, make sure to take extra care when cleaning your piercings.
Most piercing stores like Claire's or Icing use specialty studs when they pierce ears. These studs usually have a sharp, pointed tip to make a clean piercing, as well as a ""safety"" clutch earring back that limits the risk of pushing the back too tightly against the fresh piercing.If you are going to a store to get your ears pierced, pick an earring that doesn't catch on clothes, such as ones with rhinestones because they need prongs to hold them in. Also, avoid overly large studs, as this will make your piercing more troublesome to clean.

, Since you'll have to wear these earrings for at least 6 weeks before changing them, make sure you pick a pair of earrings that you like. Picking a pair of simple hoops or studs is ideal, as they'll go with everything.


Make sure to get lightweight earrings when you get your ears pierced. Heavy earrings could damage your new piercings, take longer to heal, and cause you pain.

, It's best to get all of your piercings done at professional piercing shops. Often, piercing shops are combined with tattoo shops, but don't let that scare you. The piercers in these shops are always properly licensed and have a great deal of experience. Also, the sterilization process at these shops is much more strict than at any other piercing locations.


These piercers give piercings with sterilized needles and usually use small rings/hoops.
Even if a young child wants to get their ears pierced, you can take them to a tattoo/piercing shop.
These shops usually have a jewelry selection for you to choose from. They can help you choose the right earrings if you're unsure of what to get., These stores have a huge variety of earrings to choose from and usually offer free piercing with the purchase of a pair of earrings. Most of the jewelry in stores such as these tends to be lower quality, so ask for assistance in finding higher quality jewelry for your piercing.


These stores do piercings with piercing guns and usually pierce with studs.
These stores and kiosks are usually found in malls and shopping centers., Medical Ear Piercing clinics are usually picked by parents when they're looking to get their children's ears pierced. The staff at these places are always professional trained and the piercing is done in a completely sterile environment.


There are a few Medical Ear Piercing clinics around the country, but these clinics are far less popular than piercing shops or piercing stores.
You must book an appointment to get your ears pierced at one of these clinics.Other doctor's offices and walk-in clinics sometimes do piercings as well.

, All professional piercing locations should have properly sterilized earrings and piercing equipment, and most new earrings will come in sterilized packaging. If you decide to bring your own earrings to the piercer, soaking them in rubbing alcohol is a great way to sterilize them.

, It is important that you clean your new ear piercings 2-3 times per day. After each cleaning, you should turn the earrings one full rotation to avoid any scabs or infection. Make sure to wash your hands with antibacterial soap prior to cleaning your ears.


Some choose to clean their piercings with rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide. These are good options, but they do tend to sting.
Some recommend cleaning your new piercings with salt water. This is a more natural method, but is just as effective.
Some piercing stores give out an after-care solution for you to clean your ears with.Apply your cleaning solution of choice with cotton swabs or cotton balls. Gently rub your cotton ball or cotton swab on the front and back of your piercing.

, It is important that you do not take your earrings out for a minimum of 6 weeks for lobe piercings and 12 weeks for cartilage piercings. If you take your earrings out, your ears are likely to close or possibly get an infection.


For the first 6 months after your piercing, try to leave earrings in at all times. Fresh piercings can close very quickly, so it's best to leave in your earrings to allow your piercings to completely heal., It's common to be anxious to change your earrings but resist the urge. Keep in your basic hoops or studs until your piercing has completely healed. If you change your earrings too soon, you risk damaging or infecting your piercings.

, Piercings are prone to infections if they aren't properly cleaned, which is why you must take extreme care when cleaning your piercings. If you notice signs of infection, visit your doctor.


Some signs that your piercing has become infected include:

Tenderness around your piercing after the first 48 hours.
Swelling around the piercing more than 48 hours after a new piercing.
Bleeding from your piercing.
Puss discharge from the piercing.
Being unable to rotate your earrings when cleaning them.
Fever, especially in children. If you have a fever, it's important to get to a hospital right away, as you may have a serious infection."

Hide your gauges with hair.,
Stretch large gauges over top your ears to rest along the base of your ear.,
Accessorize to your advantage.,
Buy plugs that match your skin tone.,
Substitute gauges with more acceptable jewelry.,
Avoid tapered jewelry.,
Reduce the size of your gauges.,
Massage your gauged lobes daily.,
Use a restorative cream.,
Test your gauge alternatives.,
Get a second opinion on your hidden gauges.,
Practice your gauge hiding technique.",How to Hide Gauges," This is one of the easiest ways you can camouflage your gauged ears, though it might not be feasible if your hair is short or thin. You might want to talk with your barber/stylist to learn about hairstyles that can be arranged to block your gauges from view.Even if your hair keeps its shape relatively well, you might want to use hairspray, hair gel, or styling wax in your hair. This way your hair is less likely to be brushed out of the way and your gauges revealed.;
, This is an extreme technique that will only be possible if you have very large gauges. Use your hair to conceal the base of your ear where your gauges rest.


You can also wear a pair of thick-framed glasses, even non-prescription ones that have fake lenses, to help block your gauges from view where they rest over your ears.Very large gauges can be difficult to conceal, and questions may arise even if you do your best to hide them. Many state laws protect those with ""deformities"" from being discriminated against by employers, so if necessary, you may be able to cite this law., There are many kinds of head covering you might use to tuck your gauges out of sight. Bandannas and hats can be used to hide your gauges at less formal occasions. Women and long-haired men might be able to get away with wearing a stylish headband to keep your gauges out of sight., In a professional environment or conservative fields like banking, teaching, and office work to name a few, you might find you are not taken seriously if you interview with obvious gauges. To give ear gaugers a better chance of overcoming this kind of discrimination, many piercing and gauge manufacturers offer skin tone plug to make your gauges less noticeable.You'll have to experiment with different kinds of plugs before you find the one that works best for you. This is especially true for skin tone plugs bought online. A gauge that looks suitable online might be obvious once you put it in your ear.
You could always make your own flesh tone plugs. A pair of simple wooden plugs can be painted the same color as your skin tone to achieve the same effect as pre-made skin tone plugs., Some gauges have large studs that cover the outer part of your ear, like large diamond studs or studs with thick metal designs. These can effectively hide your gauges and make it look as though you only have a ""socially acceptable"" kind of earring.You may have to invest in several different varieties of this kind of gauge. In a workplace or less accepting environment, people might get suspicious if they see you wearing the same earring too frequently.

, The size difference of the hook or stud that is inserted into your ear in tapered jewelry will draw attention to your gauged ears. Even if you have a pair of beloved tapered ear accessories that you want to show off, when trying to hide your gauges, you should refrain from wearing these., Your ears, in some cases, will naturally heal from the stretching caused by your gauges if you remove your gauge jewelry, or can shrink if you decrease the size of your gauge.However, the amount of healing that your body is capable of will depend on individual factors and also the size of your gauge. By reducing your gauge little by little, you can see how much your body is capable of recovering without an unsightly hole in your earlobe cramping your style.


Allow your ear enough time to heal until your decreased size fits comfortably. Once it does, you can reduce your size even more to continue shrinking your gauges.
Especially if your gauges are a ½ inch (1.27 cm) in size, you stand a good chance of being able to close your ears naturally. Larger gauges may require surgery for you to restore your gauges to normal., By massaging your lobes once or twice a day, you'll encourage circulation in the stretched tissue. The increased blood flow there will help your gauges to heal.You might also consider using oils that promote healing. Some examples include:


Vitamin E
Neem oil
Jojoba oil
Extra virgin olive oil, After removing your gauges from your ears, you can apply special creams to reduce any scar tissue that has built up and to help repair damage that has been done by stretching your lobes. Some options you might consider include:


Hemorrhoid cream, which is intended to reduce swelling and inflammation while encouraging healing in your skin.Using this could promote the healing of your gauged ears.
Specialty earlobe creams, which are formulated to help heal your gauges. Some popular options that should be available at your local drug store include Ear Butter and Holey Butt'r.

, Even with flesh toned studs specifically designed to hide your gauges, you may find that some brands work very well for your ear type while others do not. The same is true for hairstyles and jewelry that hide your gauges. Try out each gauge-hiding technique before going into a situation where you really have to hide your gauges.


A mirror will be a great asset for evaluating how natural your gauge-hiding technique works. Try not to rely on a wall mirror only, as these often miss more dynamic angles. Use a wall mirror and a handheld mirror to view your disguised gauges from many different angles.
If you are using your hair to hide your gauges, try messing up your gauge hiding hairdo with your fingers. Note the point at which your gauges start becoming noticeable again. Knowing the limits of your hairdo will help you maintain it for the best possible coverage.

, Trusted friends and relatives will be able to see where your covering techniques or jewelry are insufficient, and may even be able to give you advice on how to hide your gauges better. Even if you're methodical with a mirror assessment, there's no replacement for another set of eyes.


For the best results, you may even want to recruit people of different heights. The difference in perspective might make you aware of a part of your gauge that's peeking through your hiding technique.

, It might take a while before you develop the awareness necessary to keep your gauges hidden. You'll also want to avoid any gesture that draws attention to your gauges, like tugging on your ears, tucking hair behind your ears, or playing with your earlobes.


Habits and absent-minded fidgeting can sometimes be difficult for you to identify on your own. You might want to recruit a friend to help you get a sense for the things you do that draw attention to your gauges."

Keep your first earrings in continuously for six weeks.,
Cut the ball off of a small, inexpensive post earring.,
Cover them with flesh-colored band-aids.,
Wear your hair long and down.,
Don scarves and hats when appropriate.,
Take proper care of your newly pierced ears.,
Remove your earrings when necessary.,
Use quartz retainers.,
Choose flesh-colored jewelry.,
Apply concealer to your piercings.,
Take advantage of perspective with multiple piercings.,
Pick your battles.",How to Hide an Ear Piercing," If your ears have only recently been pierced, you should not remove your earrings for any reason. Doing so before the aforementioned six-week period is over risks bruising, bleeding, piercing closure, and an increased risk of infection. This point cannot be emphasized enough! If you believe you will be unable to keep your earrings in for this long, consider waiting to get your ears pierced until the circumstances of your life allow it. Clip-on earrings are one temporary possibility available to you which require no such time commitment, and magnetic earrings are even available to try on cartilage piercings.
Cartilage piercings, however, often require a much longer time to properly heal, taking anywhere from three to twelve months. ;
, If you elect to have your ear pierced with the smallest post available, you can remove the earring’s back, push the post as far forward as possible (while keeping it in your ear) and snip the ball off of the post with wire cutters. After pushing the post back into its normal position and replacing the earring’s back, the post may resemble little more than a tiny mole


It is recommended that you enlist the help of a parent, and take extreme caution when using wire cutters near your ear.

, The notable word here is “cover.” This will not make any secret of your ears being pierced, but it will obscure the actual jewelry. Try this if secrecy is less of an issue than coverage.


Useful for playing sports or engaging in any athletic activity. Double-check that the leagues you’re a part of will actually allow this method before getting your ears pierced, though.
Various combinations of sports tape and bandages can be used to achieve the same purpose.

, Longer hair (anything past the piercing site on your ear, for our purposes here) is extremely advantageous for hiding earrings. Consider growing your hair longer before getting your ears pierced, if you believe you will have need to hide the earrings.


Give yourself at least a few inches past the piercing height for consistent coverage as you move around.
Generally effective for hiding cartilage piercings regardless of gender, as shorter hairstyles can still effectively cover that part of your ear.
For occasions where you need to tie longer hair back, put it in a low ponytail and let the hair hang down over your ears while it’s pulled back.

, While these won’t work in every situation (good luck explaining why you’ve got a scarf wrapped around your head at the dinner table), they can be useful in colder weather jobs, or when trudging to and from school. Beanies, headbands, and fur trapper hats can be pulled low over your ears to get the job done.


Baseball caps can also help simply by pushing voluminous, springy hair downward, to better cover your ears.

, For several day after the act, both earring and lobe should be gently cleaned with rubbing alcohol, applied twice daily by a cotton swab or ball. Your earrings will become quite noticeable if the area becomes inflamed!


Always wash your hands before cleaning your earrings and piercing site.
Recommendations vary when it comes to the issue of whether or not to rotate your earrings; while some suggest rotating them slightly at night before bed, others suggest abstaining entirely. Adhere to the instructions of the professional who pierced your ears, but sources agree in their advisement against perpetually twisting and fidgeting with your earrings.

, A bit of a no-brainer, perhaps, but once you're past those first six weeks, simply remove your earrings when the situation calls for it. Bodies can close their piercing sites at unpredictable rates, but it's highly unlikely for them to close over a day or weekend.


Most piercings will close without anything in them, taking anywhere from a few days to several weeks. A thin membrane may grow over the hole, without the hole actually closing; jewelry can typically be pushed back through this with minimal pain. Try lubricating the area with antibiotic ointment if you encounter any difficulty.

Reopening the closed piercing is also possible, if the earrings must remain out of your ears for extended periods of time.
Cartilage piercings, as opposed to lobe piercings, can remain without jewelry for a much longer time without closing. As was mentioned in part one, though, the healing process for these is also much longer compared to lobe piercings.

, Clear, quartz jewelry can be worn to keep the earring tunnel open with discrete results. While far from invisible, clear jewelry requires fairly close inspection to detect.


Clear acrylic is less recommended for its quality issues, but it’s also a viable option.
Clear jewelry is not recommended for your very first earrings; your first earring should be 14-carat gold or stainless steel, as these are less likely to cause infection or swelling. Other metals can also induce allergic reactions.

, Small, flesh-colored posts work similarly to clear ones, but may be even less noticeable. Stretched ears in particular—while difficult to hide—will have more success with flesh-colored plugs.


These can be found in a variety of materials, including acrylic and various silicones.

, If you’d like it to be secret that you have your ears pierced at all, remove your earrings and apply a small dab of concealer or foundation to the hole. Make sure to choose the right shade for your skin tone.

, If you wish to draw less attention to a second piercing, for example, try choosing a much bigger stud, jewel, or hoop for your first piercing. With the first piercing drawing the eye, your second piercing will be less noticeable.

, For as much as you may want to wear a certain style of earring, or to go for something more stylish like a rook, conch, industrial, or daith piercing, consider the environments you’ll be wearing these in. You may not have to expend so much energy hiding your earrings or arguing with your boss if you opt for minimalist jewelry, or more conservative piercing styles.


At the same time, these are your ears you’re adorning. You should simply ensure that you’re aware of the situations in your life which may be less amenable to more adventurous ear choices.

, The warmth of the water will promote blood flow and decrease swelling, while the salt dries and shrinks the size of the bump. Apply enough pressure to the bump to keep the cotton ball in place, but not so much that it’s uncomfortable.Salt is naturally good for killing germs, so it will also help sterilize the piercing as a bonus.Your skin may be a little dry after the salt soaks, but resist the urge to use a lotion or moisturizer. These products may just make the irritation worse.

, Soak painful, enlarged bumps twice a day until they begin to show signs of improvement. After each treatment, rinse your ear with warm water and a gentle antibacterial soap. This will remove any traces of salt and keep germs from building up around the piercing.Space out your soaks so that you’re doing one in the morning and one later in the evening or just before you go to bed.
If the bump isn’t looking better after about a week, schedule an appointment with a dermatologist."

Talk to your piercer.,
Prepare yourself for the piercing.,
Hold your friend's hand.,
Focus on something else to take your mind off the piercing.,
Take deep breaths.,
Stay positive.,
Joke about the piercing.,
Get the piercing over with quickly.,
Celebrate your newly pierced ears.",How to Get an Ear Piercing Without Freaking Out2," When you go into the piercing studio, let them know you're a little nervous. Have them walk you through the process, explain what they're doing and why, and answer any questions or worries you might have. They might offer you a comfortable chair or a glass of water. Chances are most of the people getting piercings are a little nervous, so they'll know exactly how to make you feel better.

, Know that it's probably going to hurt a little, and be ready to deal with it. Bring a friend for moral support, and bring painkillers for afterwards if you think you'll need them. Think about how you best deal with stress and pain. Do you like to squeeze a stress ball? Does gossiping with a friend or playing Angry Birds help take your mind off the pain? Plan ahead and bring anything you think might help you deal with the potentially stressful situation.

, When you get nervous, having your friend there to comfort you is invaluable. Squeeze your friend's hand when you need to, and talk to your friend to take your mind off the piercing.

, Read a book or magazine. Gossip with your friend, or get to know your piercer a little. Chat about your weekend plans, what's going on in school, that great movie you just saw -- talk about anything but the piercing. Thinking about other things will help you calm down enough to get through the piercing.

, Focus on your breathing to physically calm down and force yourself to relax. Breathing deeply slows your heart rate and lowers your blood pressure, mimicking the state your body is in when it really is relaxed.Doing breathing exercises, or just focusing on breathing deeply, will help you calm down your body, which will make the stress of the piercing much easier to deal with.

, Focus on the best part of getting your ears pierced -- think about how you'll look with your new earrings! When it comes to the actual piercing, don't think about the pain or the stress. Instead, tell yourself that you can do it, you will get through it. If you do this enough, you'll find that it becomes true.


Friends are great for this. Ask your friend to help you stay positive and to periodically remind you how great having your pierced ears will be.

, Your friend can help you approach the piercing with a sense of humor. Laughing is a key way to reduce stress and calm you down, so whether you're laughing about the piercing itself or about an unrelated story your friend tells you, it will help you relax. Joking about the piercing will make it seem less daunting, which will help you approach it more calmly and easily.

, Ask the piercer if they can pierce both of your ears at the same time so that you can get it over with faster. Know that it will be over soon, and the pain will be over.

, Thank the piercer and give your friend a high five. Pay, making sure to tip your piercer, thank him/her again, and leave. Congratulations, you made it! Enjoy your newly pierced ears.

Crush a tablet of aspirin.,
Mix the powder with warm water to form a paste.,
Spread the paste onto the bump.,
Let the aspirin sit for 10-15 minutes.",How to Get Rid of Bumps on Cartilage Piercing2," Place the aspirin in a dish with a flat bottom. Then, use a blunt object, such as the back of a spoon, to grind it into a fine powder. Break up as many big pieces and clumps as you can—this will make it easier to blend with water.


Aspirin is often used orally to treat pain and swelling, but it will also work when applied topically.
A single tablet should be more than enough for most bumps. If the irritated site is so large that one won’t do the trick, forego the home remedies and see a doctor right away.

, Pour in the water gradually until you achieve just the right consistency, stirring as you go. The paste should be roughly the same texture as cake icing. That way, it will be thick enough to cling to your skin.Avoid adding too much water. If the mixture is too thin and runny, it won’t be able to hold.

, Scoop up a glob of the aspirin paste with a cotton swab and brush it lightly over the affected area. Dab on enough to completely coat the bump and a small portion of the surrounding skin. If possible, use a small bandage to cover the bump once you’ve smeared on the aspirin.Be careful not to jab at the bump with the cotton swab.
Your skin should be clean and dry before you apply the aspirin paste.

, It will take a few minutes for the medicine to begin working. Once it does, you should begin to feel relief fairly quickly. After treating the bump, rinse out your ear with warm water to flush away the residue left over from the paste. Repeat this process up to twice a day to keep tenderness and inflammation under control.Applying the aspirin directly to your skin effectively cuts out the middleman of ingesting it and waiting for it to make its way through your bloodstream.
After a few days, you should be able to notice the bump shrinking.

Have infected piercings looked at by a doctor.,
Take antibiotics as directed.,
Make sure you finish your prescription.",How to Get Rid of Bumps on Cartilage Piercing3," Mild pain, redness and swelling may be routine side effects of a cartilage piercing. However, they might also be symptoms of an infection in the tissue beneath the skin. If your piercing aches constantly, doesn’t respond to pain treatments or gets worse after several days, call your doctor or dermatologist right away.Other symptoms like fever, chills or discharge may also point to an infection.

, After your doctor has examined the infected piercing, they’ll most likely prescribe you a round of antibiotics. These drugs will help your immune system fight off the infection. Be sure to follow your doctor’s orders exactly, as different medicines will need to be taken differently.It will be important to know, for example, whether your antibiotic should be taken with food or on an empty stomach.Let your doctor know about other drugs you’re taking (along with any other medical conditions that might be a factor) so they’ll be able to make an informed decision about how best to treat your infection., Continue taking your antibiotics until there are none left. If you don’t, the infection may return and get worse. Check in with your doctor after you’ve completed the first round. You may need a refill in order to clear up the infection for good.You may not notice much of an improvement over the first twenty-four hours, or you may feel completely better after only a few days. Either way, make it a point to stay on track with your course of antibiotics.If necessary, set an alarm to remind yourself to take your medicine. This can be especially helpful if you’ve been directed to take them at different times of day.

Make sure to include tattoo shops, since they usually offer piercing services as well. Ask friends and family for recommendations, referrals, and places to avoid. Make a list of all the studios you want to contact, including their phone numbers and addresses.;
, Before choosing a studio and a piercer, make sure they meet all the criteria for cleanliness, hygiene, and sterility, as well as safety, competence, and experience. Some of this you’ll be able to figure out from their websites, but most of it you’ll have to find out by asking and visiting the studio. Make a chart or graph so that you can easily record information about each studio. Write down questions like:


How do you ensure a sterile environment?
Do you use an autoclave (a pressure chamber) to sterilize reusable equipment?
Do you spore test regularly to ensure the autoclave is working properly?
Do all your piercers have the necessary certifications and qualifications? These will vary depending on the area, but be aware that many places don’t have any sort of certification for piercers.
Has your studio passed all necessary inspections and does it have all the necessary permits and licences? Again, this will vary depending on the location. You can call your local health department to find out about regulations specific to your area.Do you provide consultations?
How much experience do your piercers have with industrials?
How much do you charge for an industrial?

, Have your list ready to ask questions, along with a way to take notes. Pay attention to the feeling you get from the people you talk to, and how comfortable they make you feel about the process. Cross off studios from your list if they avoided your questions, tried to rush you through, gave you an uneasy feeling, or provided answers that weren’t up to par. A good studio will take the time to answer your questions and walk you through the process. Keep only the top studios on the list based on the answers they gave and how they treated you.

, Meet the staff, talk to the piercers, and make sure you feel comfortable with the people and the environment. Ask to see portfolios as well, and see if you can watch the piercers work. Make sure each studio is clean and that they do not allow smoking or drinking inside.


Check that the studios use sterilized and individually wrapped needles, and that used needles are placed in a sharps container, which is a container for biohazardous materials.
Be wary if a studio uses a piercing gun, since these cannot be sterilized and could indicate an unsanitary studio.Check to see if the piercers and tattooists use clean, reusable gloves with every client.

, Using all the information you gathered and the studio visits, choose the studio you felt offered the best service, the most sterile environment, the friendliest staff, and the most talented artists. If you have the option to pick a specific piercer, consider who:


Provided the best answers.
Made you the most comfortable.
Had the best portfolio and the most experience.
Talked clients through the piercing process as it happened.

, Some studios require an appointment, but if they don’t it’s still a good idea to make one if you can, because good studios can get overrun with walk-ins. Discuss any allergies you might have and your jewelry options. Take notes about any instructions they provide for the day of your appointment.


Consult with your physician before getting any piercing if you have any medical issues or concerns, or take regular medication.

, Follow any instructions the studio gave you when you booked your appointment. Eat at least four hours prior. Shower or bathe the day of your appointment. Tie your hair back and away from your ear if you have long hair, and bring some extra bobby pins or barrettes with you. Choose clothing that is loose and comfortable.


Take photo identification to the studio.
Arrive sober. Reputable studios will not pierce or tattoo anybody who’s under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Even alcohol in your system from the night before could cause excessive bleeding because it thins the blood.
Avoid taking aspirin or other blood thinners before your appointment.Some tattoo and piercing studios are cash-only, so make sure you have enough cash on you to cover the cost of the piercing if they don’t take debit or credit.

, This is just standard practice for any appointment. This will also give you time to ask any last-minute questions or prepare. When you arrive, tell them your name and that you have an appointment, or that you are there for an industrial piercing if you don’t have an appointment.

, The first thing the piercer should do is wash his or her hands, and then put on a new pair of single-use surgical gloves. All the equipment should be in sealed, individual packages, should be opened in front of you, and should then be placed on a tray.At this time, the piercer will also select the right jewelry to fit your ear and choose a needle with the proper gauge.


Good piercers will walk you through every step of the process as they work. Ask questions if you have any.
Ensure the piercer is using a bar that’s long enough to allow for swelling.
Using a single bar is preferable because it guarantees the holes line up properly.

, This will clean the area, decrease the risk of infection, and make it easier to pierce your ear.

, Once your ear is disinfected, the piercer will mark the two piercing points with a marker and show you how they’ll line up. Don’t be afraid to ask the piercer to change the location or angle, because you can’t fix it afterward!

, The piercer will push a hollow, single-use needle through the skin to create the first hole. Once the needle is through, jewelry will be put in place immediately, and lined up to connect with the second hole. It’s important that you sit still and remain calm during the process, so try relaxation techniques like:


Deep breathing.
Visualization to distract you from the pain.
Meditation.
Talking to the piercer or someone nearby.

, Continue breathing deeply and practicing your relaxation techniques. The needle will go in first to create the second hole, and then the jewelry will be put in place.

, Once everything is over, expect some level of pain and a burning sensation. You’ve just had two piercings, so it’s completely normal to feel pain and burning at this time.


If you haven’t already, discuss aftercare with your piercer before you leave.

, As with any service industry, most piercers will be more than happy to receive a tip, with 15 to 20 percent being standard.Make sure you pick up any forms or sheets they might have that outline the aftercare procedure.

, Industrials can be quite painful, and they often take longer to heal than other piercings. Generally, an industrial can take anywhere from three to four weeks, or upwards of six months to heal.Most over-the-counter pain medications will be sufficient to manage the pain you’ll feel in the first couple weeks. Avoid hot compresses. Instead, apply a cold cloth to the area to help relieve pain if necessary.

, The best way to clean your industrial is with a warm salt solution. The ratio is one-quarter teaspoon of sea or non-iodized salt to eight ounces of warm water. Soak the piercing by submerging it in the solution for seven to 10 minutes. Repeat this two to four times a day.Don’t clean your industrial with soap more than once or twice daily, and if you use soap, use something mild, liquid, and vegetable-based, such as castile soap., This includes sports and exercise, especially anything that involves physical contact. Do not change the jewelry until your industrial has healed, and don’t twist or rotate the jewelry. Avoid saunas, hot tubs, and pools.Industrials are very sensitive piercings, and can heal improperly if they are jostled, rubbed, or chafed.
Keep long hair away from the industrial so that it doesn’t get tangled up with the piercing.
Avoid sleeping on the piercing until it’s healed.

, Certain products can cause irritation, dryness, cell damage, and clogged pores. Don’t clean your piercing with: hydrogen peroxide, scented soaps, rubbing alcohol, antibacterial ointments, and petroleum-based creams or gels. Also avoid using premade ear-care solutions that contain any of those products.Make sure that items that come in contact with your piercing are clean as well, including your hair, fingers, clothes, and even your phone.
Try to prevent your piercing from coming in contact with cosmetics and haircare products like shampoo, conditioner, hairspray, and makeup.

, There’s about a 30 percent chance of infection with a cartilage piercing, and infections that aren’t addressed immediately can cause permanent damage.If you suspect an infection, seek medical attention immediately. Leave the jewelry in until you are told otherwise by a medical professional.Signs of infection include:


Pus around the site of the piercing.
Loss of feeling, a tingling sensation, or the surrounding skin turns pale.Excessive bleeding.
Swelling, redness, pain, and throbbing.
Fever.

, Nickel allergies are quite common, and since body jewelry often contains nickel, watch for the symptoms. If you begin to exhibit signs of an allergy, go back to the piercer as soon as you can. Your piercing will not heal properly if you are allergic to the jewelry. Symptoms will generally appear within 12 to 48 hours after exposure, and can include:


Itching and swelling.
Redness, a rash, or dry patches of skin.
Crusty or scaly blisters."
"
Decide which piercing you want.,
Choose a piercer familiar with the trend.,
Pick a reputable parlor.",How to Get a Heart Cartilage Piercing1," The main heart cartilage piercings are the daith (a single hole in the inner part of the ear) or the helix piercing (two holes at the top of the ear). With the daith, one side of the heart will go through your ear. In the helix, both sides of the heart go down through the ear, with the bottom meeting in the point of the heart and curves of the heart going above the ear.If you don't have many piercings, you may decide the daith is easier since it's a single hole, although some people have more trouble with this placement than the helix placement.
A double piercing with a single piece of jewelry is called an ""orbital."";
, The trend is relatively new, so you need to pick a place that has piercers who understand the trend. The helix piercing is particularly difficult, as it requires the two piercings be lined up precisely., When choosing someone to pierce your cartilage, you want to make sure they know what they're doing and that they're using safe procedures for piercing. It's a good idea to visit the parlor before you want a piercing, though if you go the day you want a piercing, just be willing to walk away.The whole parlor should be clean and well-lit. Also, the parlor should be licensed if it's required in your area. You can call the health department to verify.
They shouldn't be using ear guns at all but especially not on cartilage.
When it comes to sterilizing tools, they should use an autoclave that employs both steam and pressure. A new needle should be used for each person.
The piercer should use gloves when piercing.

"
"
Bring a picture.,
Ask the piercer to make the jewelry.,
Be still and breathe through the process.,
Expect more bleeding.",How to Get a Heart Cartilage Piercing2," If you know exactly what you want, it can help to bring in a picture, especially for a trend that not every piercer is familiar with. That way, there will be no confusion about what you want.

, Keep in mind that the ""heart"" part of the piercing is usually created by the piercer. That is, they take a standard hoop for cartilage, and they bend it into shape. They must take out the bead to make the shape. Once again, a picture is helpful here.Keep in mind that some piercers will prefer that you start with other jewelry while you're healing and then have this piece put in later.

, When the piercer is getting ready to pierce you, you need to stay as still as possible. That includes when the piercer is marking where the piercings will go. This step is especially important in an orbital piercing, as it takes more precision. Take slow, deep breaths, and try to hold as still as possible. Don't worry, though, the piercer will talk you through it., In general, a cartilage piercing will bleed more than a tissue piercing (like the ear lobe). Therefore, be ready for a bit of bleeding when you get a heart cartilage piercing. The body produces more blood for cartilage because it doesn't have it's own blood supply; the nearby tissue increases blood flow to the area."
"
Keep the piercing in.,
Clean the piercing daily.,
Use a saline solution instead.,
Keep your ear clean.,
Watch for infections and other problems.",How to Get a Heart Cartilage Piercing3," While your piercing is healing, it needs to stay in your ear. If your piercer chose to pierce with another type of jewelry and then move to a heart later, don't try to change early. You need to keep the jewelry in so it can heal., You should usually clean the piercing at least once a day, and you shouldn't clean it more than twice a day. You can clean it in the shower. Apply a mild soap to the piercing and then rinse it with water. Make sure to get all the soap out., If your piercer suggests it, you can use a mixture of salt and distilled water instead of soap. Add a 1/4 of a teaspoon of sea salt (no iodine) to a cup of warm water (use distilled or bottled). Mix it together until it dissolves. Apply it using gauze or paper towels, soaking the piercing for 10 to 15 minutes., That is, anything that comes near the piercing should be as clean as possible, including your headphones and mobile phone, as well as hats, other jewelry, and glasses. At night, use a clean t-shirt to cover your pillow. You can rotate to a clean side the next night, then turn it inside out. Make sure to change it after you run out of clean areas (the fifth night).It's also a good idea to skip swimming and soaking in hot tubs for about 2 months.

, When you pierce something, you've put a new hole in your body. Even if the piercer is very careful, you can still get an infection after the fact. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, and discharge near the piercing.You'll also likely notice heat and tenderness. If you think you have an infection, see a doctor, especially if it seems to be getting worse. Don't remove the piercing until you see a doctor.Bleeding in the first day or two is normal. Itching and tenderness are also normal. You may notice some whitish discharge that forms a crust, which is also normal.
It's likely that the doctor will have you keep the piercing in, anyway, as taking it out could allow it to heal over the infection. Leaving the jewelry allows it to drain."
"
Gauge correctly in the first place.,
Decrease the the gauge you are wearing by 'going down' one size.,
Wear the smaller gauge for a week.,
Repeat this process until you are wearing the smallest gauge.",How to Close Gauged Ears1," The best chance of your ears healing depends on how nice you were to your ears during the stretching process. If you barged ahead and sized up every other week, you most likely caused small tears and potentially ripped the delicate tissue of your holes. If you allowed them to heal for at least a month before sizing up, that will speed up the healing process and your ears will thank you.

Remember never to stretch dry. Always use some kind of lube, like a special stretching balm, Vitamin E oil, or coconut oil. Stretching in or after a hot shower has been said to help with the stretching process. Also, tapers are not meant to be worn as jewelry, because the weight is uneven, so only use them for stretching. Don't use acrylic or silicone tapers; although acrylic tapers are the cheapest and easiest to find, acrylic can't be fully sterilized, and silicone tapers can cause blowouts due to trapped bacteria.;
, For example, if your normal gauge is a 000 (10.4 mm), put a 00 (9.26 mm) in your ear.


If you have gone above a 12 mm g, it is unlikely that you will experience much shrinkage. This is because stretching your ears involves (surprise, surprise) stretching--you stretch the tissue of your ear and then allow it to heal. If blowouts, tearing or infections occur, scar tissue builds up which can sometimes keep ear lobes from shrinking back to normal once they have been stretched. Of course, everyone's body is different. Just be aware of the potential that your ears might not shrink back without surgery., You should wear the smaller gauge until your ear has shrunk down so that this gauge fits well. This may take only a few days for some people, and longer than a week for others.

, The smallest is a 17g (1.14 mm). Most wire earrings are .812 mm and studs are 1.02 mm."
"
Take your jewelry out of your ears.,
Massage your lobes every day.,
Moisturize your ears after showering.",How to Close Gauged Ears2," DO NOT put antiseptic in your ears, because this will cause them to dry out and sting like hell. Instead, clean your ear pieces with a saltwater soak, and soak a cotton ball in the saltwater solution and hold it up to your ear holes.

, Use oils like Jojoba oil or Vitamin E oil. These oils will help repair the scar tissue caused by stretching your ears and will speed up the healing process., This will help the skin become softer and make blood flow to the area. Moisturizing after showering also helps get rid of dead skin, allowing the holes to heal without irritation or infection.

"
"
Remove your jewelry from your ears.,
Put a small dab of hemorrhoid cream on a different cotton swab.,
Rub the cream around and in your gauge holes.,
Massage your ears with the cream.",How to Close Gauged Ears3," Run a cotton swab under water. Gently clean the holes with water.

, Hemorrhoid creams like Preparation H work well. Hemorrhoid cream will reduce the scar tissue that has built up due to damage the stretching has done.You can also use store-bought 'ear butter' like Holey Butt'r instead of hemorrhoid cream.

, You can also apply the cream with your finger or tissue if so desired., Repeat this process every day. You should notice a difference in size within a couple of weeks.

"
"
First of all, get a good lubricant: Vitamin E oil (jar or pill form), jojoba oil, olive oil, or emu oil are commonly used.,
Have a clean taper at hand; if it is made of surgical 316L steel, or glass, it can be autoclaved at a piercing shop.,
Once that is done, some recommend taking a hot shower to open the pores of your skin and increase blood circulation in the area to aid elasticity.

,
After that, rub the lubricant onto the taper and slowly move it into the earlobe.,
Next, make sure that jewellery (plug, tunnel, earring, etc.),
Then, place the jewelry behind the taper and slowly move the taper out and push the jewelry through.

,
+Preventing a blowout is just that - prevention.

,
+Never carry out a stretch if it is painful - this means your ear is not ready to stretch.,
+If your ears bleed or are infected, remove the new size and downsize to your previous size or smaller.",How to Gauge Your Ears Without Getting a Blowout," This assures a smooth painless insertion of jewelry. Do not, under ANY circumstances, use Vaseline.;
, (316L steel is a very low grade of steel. When looking for jewelry, look for 316LVM. Surgical Steel does not mean implant grade, and should be avoided.)

,, Careful! We don't want to tear it. Be aware as this is where most blowouts occur; the fistula is being pushed out to the opposite side of insertion. If a blowout does happen to appear at any point of tapering, an upgrade to taping may be the way to go. If you don't want to do the taping method, you must downsize to the size that you were beforehand.

, is clean and at hand. (Autoclave is the safest way because the micro tears in your skin make you vulnerable to microbes.) Do not leave tapers in for any amount of time as it will result in uneven weight distribution, greatly increasing the chances of a blowout.

,,, Listen to your body. While some discomfort is expected and a mild stinging, it should be easy, not painful.

, Allow plenty of time to heal properly with warm saline solution (or sea salt soak) twice daily then follow with oil massages, and wait before you stretch again. Apart from listening to your body, this is the next best thing you can do. Bleeding stretches are a sign of tearing somewhere in the fistula; if not healed properly, this can create a blowout during future stretches.

If you won't be able to wash your hands, you can apply some hand sanitizer to sterilize your fingers before touching your piercing.;
, You can use isopropyl alcohol or a sea salt solution. Many piercing professionals will provide you with a saline and sea salt solution to use. If not you can mix 1/8th teaspoon of sea salt per 8 oz. of saline.

, Do this twice a day to keep the area around your piercing clean.


First, dip the cotton ball or swab in the cleaning solution or alcohol. Try pressing the cotton ball to the opening on top of the bottle, then quickly turning the bottle over to soak the cotton with alcohol.
Apply the swab around the piercing to keep the area free of germs.

Invest in some proper jewelry.,
Prepare yourself and your surroundings for the stretch.,
Open the sealed jewelry bag and have a lubricant ready to be used with Holey Butt'r, Vitamin E Oil, Jojoba Oil, or Coconut Oil.,
Using clean hands, massage your ear lobe to soften up the tissue and encourage some nice blood flow to the area.,
If your stretch was successful, and you bought a no-flare plug, then place an o-ring on both the front and back of the plug to keep it in place.,
After both plugs are securely in place, soak them with a sterile saline solution on cotton round (something that doesn't have tons of loose fibers).,
Clean your piercings daily.,
Massage.,
Give your lobes a break.,
Wait before you consider stretching again.,
Never skip sizes.",How to Gauge Your Ears," You will need a pair of glass or titanium no-flare or single-flare plugs. When stretching up from 20g (standard earring size), you will want your jewelry to be 18g. Ensure that you buy jewelry made of a quality material, such as implant-grade titanium or glass.


Terms such as ""stainless"" or ""surgical"" are not real grades of metal and are not implant grade materials. They are merely terms to make you think what you are getting is a safe piece of jewelry when in reality it's actually garbage. (The surface or ""polish"" is very poor and rough and allows bacteria to harbor in the nooks and crannies.)
Organic jewelry (wood, bone,) should never be worn in a freshly-stretched piercing. Organic pieces often are -/+ .5mm in diameter because they're made of organic material. Wood should not be worn long-term even in healed piercings because it is porous, and therefore likely to cause an infection.;
, Begin by washing your hands and jewelry-free earlobes thoroughly with warm water and soap. Your titanium or glass plugs should still be sealed in the baggies they arrived in from a reputable seller. It is crucial not to use jewelry that arrives with a broken seal.


When you order jewelry from a reputable source, you ensure that your jewelry comes to you sterilized. You don't own an autoclave, so the best thing you can do is buy from a reputable source. If you're not going to an APP-certified piercer, an online alternative to order jewelry is Body Art Forms (supporting your local APP piercer is way better though.)

, Emu Oil is also an excellent non-vegan option.


Never use Vaseline, Neosporin or tea tree oil. If those are your only options, run to the store for proper stretching supplies.

, Be sure to put lubricant on your jewelry as well and then begin to try and insert it. If you feel resistance, pain or discomfort stop immediately and return to your previous size. Don't be discouraged! Let your body take it's time, it will only reward you in the end.

, If you bought a single-flare plug, then place an o-ring on the back to keep it in place. It's important that you bought a plug with a decent wearable size so that the o-rings do not rub against your earlobe.


Remember that tapers are a tool used by piercers to insert jewelry. They are not supposed to be used to stretch piercings or be worn as jewelry either.
Using tapers to stretch can result in scar tissue, blow outs, tears and many other complications. If worn as jewelry, the uneven weight distribution can cause also cause blow outs and tears as well as thinning of the lobes.
Remember everybody heals at their own time. With most people, one ear readily wants to stretch more than the other. The ear that gives you a hard time stretching commonly referred to as your ""bitch ear"". If one piercing will accept the new size, but the other one is uncomfortable or hurts when you try to insert the jewelry, do not force the new size. Simply wait a month and then stretch the other piercing to match the successful first. Never rush a stretch just for symmetry.

, It can be found in the first aid section in walmart for a very good price as well as in a pharmacy for a bit more. Do not use eye contact solution or just regular saline solution. The key word to look for is sterile.

, However, an APP-certified piercer in your area can check your piercings and give you their personal cleaning suggestion if you would like a second opinion. Once the stretch has settled down a bit, it's okay to remove your plugs to clean them.


Make sure that you clean both the plugs and your piercings thoroughly to remove dead skin cell buildup and other bacteria.

, Also once the stretch is not longer irritated and settled (no pain or discomfort at all), feel free to remove jewelry daily and massage your lobes with Vitamin E Oil, Jojoba Oil, Emu Oil, Coconut Oil or Holey Butt'r. Massaging daily allows your epidermal tissue to retain integrity while promoting cell growth. Remember to put your plugs back in once the massage is over. It's best to do massages just after cleaning your piercings.

, Sleep without your plugs in once the stretch has really settled and you're comfortable in doing so.. This relieves the stress that's put on them by your plugs, which gets worse the larger you stretch. Skipping this step can result in thinner lobes due to the restricted flow of oxygen, blood, and nutrients.

, The key is to listen to your body, there is no secret to having amazing lobes, it's just patience. Usually the rule of thumb is to wait a month or two when stretching at smaller sizes (20g-10g.) However not everybody will heal from a stretch that fast. You'll know when your ear is ready for the next size when your current jewelry is loose or the front flare slips through your ear lobe through out the day and is in no pain or discomfort either. At that point you should try stretching up and inserting the next size using the same steps supplied.

, Keep in mind that you should not force your ears to stretch if they are not ready within this time window. Everybody is different. Past that point you should wait a few months in between sizes, for some it may take 3 months to be able to comfortably insert a 0g plug. For others it may take 6 months for their ear to loosen up enough for the stretch. Don't compare yourself to others and be sure to listen to your body.

While there's no guarantee that you won't later get an infection, starting by going to a clean place will help ensure that your ears will heal properly.


There is no federal regulation of the piercing industry, and many states don't have legislation on the topic, so you'll want to research and visit different shops and parlors in person so that you can check for cleanliness and learn about how experienced the piercers are.;
, If you've never had a piercing before, a great way to find a safe place is to survey your friends for personal recommendations. Ask them what the procedure was like and if they had any difficulty cleaning their piercings or if they later got infections.


You should also study their piercings: do you like how the piercings were placed?
Besides seeing what your friends recommend, you can also go online to look for reviews of the shops you are thinking about going to for your piercing.

, When you're on your scouting mission to find the best place to have your ears pierced, stick around and watch other people as they are pierced, and also interview the staff. Make sure that all of the equipment that will be used, and also the jewelry, is sterilized beforehand.Experts recommend that you look for an autoclave at the shop, which is a sterilizing machine., Health experts also recommend that you avoid piercing parlors where needles are reused, even if they are supposedly sterilized between uses. If the shop you are visiting uses a piercing gun, then it should be a gun meant for just one-time use or which has sterilized disposable cassettes. These are sometimes referred to as “encapsulated guns”. The sterile stud is sealed inside, which means that there is less chance that bacteria will be introduced to your ear., While you always want to choose the safest, cleanest place possible when you're getting a piercing, you should be extra vigilant if you want your cartilage pierced.

,, Medical professionals recommend that you use a saline (salt) solution for cleaning. It's quite simple to prepare one yourself:


Mix either ¼ teaspoon of sea salt or 1 teaspoon of table salt with 8 ounces of warm water , Instead of reusing washcloths, you should dip gauze, a cotton ball, or a cotton-tipped ear swab in your saline solution each time you clean your piercing.Then, gently apply the saline solution all around your piercing.

, In order to get the saline solution throughout the entire piercing, many experts recommend that you carefully move your piercing back and forth as you clean it.

, Washing your new piercing more than twice a day could lead to irritation, which can extend the healing process longer than necessary., While you might think that alcohol or peroxide will sterilize your piercing, both of these can actually slow the healing process by over-drying your wound and killing healthy skin cells., Experts also tell us to not use any ointments or antibiotic creams unless directed to by a physician for an infection. These too can be counter-productive to the healing process as they can slow the flow of oxygen to your wound.Because they are so sticky, they can also trap dirt and bacteria, potentially setting you up for further trouble.

, Particularly when your piercing is fresh (for at least the first three days), you should keep it as dry as possible as dry as possible. While it will of course be wet when you apply your saline solution, you want to allow your piercing to dry out quickly.

If anything, the ingredients in your body wash or shampoo can further irritate your piercing.

Stay away from public pools and hot tubs, or if you really want or need to visit them, then it goes without saying that you shouldn't dunk your head!, Besides making sure that your hands and cleansing materials are sterile, you should carefully wash all of your bedding, hats, and scarves that may come into contact with your new piercing.You may even want to wear your hair pulled back from your piercing for a while.

, If you only have one ear pierced, you'll probably find it more comfortable to sleep on the opposite side, and your ear may heal more quickly as a result.


If both of your ears are pierced, then try to sleep on your back and avoid doing anything that will put pressure on the piercings., You'll also want to be careful when you talk on the phone to not put pressure on your ear and to not bring your phone (which can harbor quite a lot of dirt and bacteria) into direct contact with your piercing.Consider using the speaker-phone function for a while!

, Even if you follow all of the above steps religiously, you could develop an infection. Be sure to get to your doctor at the early signs of an infection.

If you take the earring out too early, it could begin to heal over and trap the infection inside the wound.This can lead to the formation of an abscess, which can be serious and painful to care for., Your cartilage piercing may be more likely to become infected, and if it does, it will probably be more difficult to treat than a regular piercing. This is because the cartilage doesn't have its own blood supply, and it's therefore harder for your prescribed antibiotics to do their work.Talk to your doctor about what is being prescribed for your infection; a stronger drug is often needed., If your ear doesn't seem infected, but is uncomfortable, itchy, or slightly swollen, you may have a sensitivity or allergy to the metal used in your piecing. Many people are allergic to nickel, cobalt, and/or white gold.The best choices for a new piercing are surgical-grade stainless steel, titanium, or 14 or 18 carat gold.Niobium is also recommended as being a good choice for a new piercing., Even with careful cleaning and no infection, an ear piercing can take a while to heal. If you pierced your earlobe, you should plan on waiting 4 to 6 weeks for it to heal completely.If you pierced your pinna (the area above the lobe of your ear), it can take up to 12 to 16 weeks to heal., If you take out your piercing before the wound has fully healed, the hole(s) can begin to close over.Thus, you should leave them in, even to sleep, until the piercing has healed completely.

, Once your new piercing has healed, though, it's generally a good idea to take your piercings out on occasion, especially when you sleep., Make it part of your routine to wipe down your earrings with rubbing alcohol when you take them out, and again before you put them (or a different pair) in again.This simple step will help ensure that your ears are healthy and that you can enjoy experimenting with fun and different accessories.

Pick something small.,
Get the tattoo somewhere hidden or easy to cover.,
Try white ink.,
Go to a reputable shop.",How to Get a Tattoo Without Your Parents Knowing1," Now is not the time for that full sleeve of a koi fish. A smaller tattoo will be much easier to hide, as it will take less effort to cover it. If your parents surprise you and your tiny tattoo is in full view, you can even slap your hand over it so they won't see. Hiding, and taking care of, a large tattoo is much more complicated.


A small tattoo shouldn't be extremely detailed, as the fine lines will spread over time and blur the design. A simple and bold design will age better.
Think shapes like hearts and stars, arrows, crosses, musical notes, flowers, anchors, or paw prints. Or if you have major hometown pride, ask for a very simple, single-line representation of the skyline of your city.
A small tattoo might be easier to accept if they find out or you eventually show them. It might be the ""ice breaker"" that makes it easier for you to proceed with larger pieces.;
, There are plenty of spots on your body your parents rarely see, and these are great places to hide a tattoo. Keep the seasons in mind when you are thinking about a good spot--if you run around in a bathing suit all summer your back-of-the-shoulder tattoo will be in full-view.Conspicuous or easily hidden spots include the inside of your lower lip, behind your ear, your ribs, your ankle, your foot, the inside of your wrist, your back.
Areas like the inside of the lip and bottom of the foot, and hands will fade much faster than other areas of the body, because those areas are constantly shedding cells and regenerating skin., If you have pale, un-freckled skin, you may want to consider a white tattoo. Geometric patterns are especially striking in white, and white ink will be far less noticeable than other colors.It is imperative you get the tattoo where it will see as little sunlight as possible--even with a powerful SPF the sun can cause the white ink to disappear, just leaving some raised bumps and the memories of your rad tattoo., You may be tempted to go the stick-and-poke route, especially if you are under 18, but rethink that notion. Even if you sterilize the needles, you risk a serious infection, from skin infections to hepatitis to HIV. Plus, they rarely turn out very well.Bond with your friend not by giving each other stick-and-poke tattoos (and potentially a staph infection), but by going to the shop together and supporting each other as you get tattooed.
Check out the shop online and choose an artist you want to work with, whose style fits with your concept.Go into the shop to make an appointment and speak with the artist. The shop should be clean, and smell like soap and cleaning supplies. If not, go somewhere else.For a small piece, you may be able to get tattooed as a walk-in, but the best tattoo artists are usually booked up well in advance."

Follow the artist's care instructions exactly.,
Cover the tattoo with makeup.,
Hide it with clothes and accessories.,
Be non-committal if the subject of tattoos comes up.",How to Get a Tattoo Without Your Parents Knowing2," If you get an infection, you're going to have to tell your parents, because you may need medical treatment. Tattoo aftercare includes not picking at or scratching your skin, which could make your parents suspicious, anyway.Don't try to hide your new tattoo by re-wrapping it. The tattoo artist will cover the piece immediately after tattooing and instruct you when to take it off. Do not wrap it again, with a bandage, cloth, or anything else.Tattoos cannot be submerged in water for at least two weeks afterwards, so if you are on the swim team, wait until the off-season.Tattoos can ""weep"" for a few days, so be aware some fluid (clear or the color of your tattoo) may soak through your clothes. You should try to wear something loose anyway, so the tattoo can get air and heal., Once your tattoo is fully healed, you can disguise it with makeup. There is high-quality makeup made for this specific purpose, and it actually works. Many are strong enough to stay on all day, won't rub off, and may even be waterproof.In a pinch you can use white face paint to cover a tattoo. Paint two layers over your tattoo (allowing the paint to dry in between layers), then cover with liquid foundation the color of your skin. A spritz of hairspray can help keep it in place.If your tattoo is very dark or has bring colors, purchase a primer as well. This will neutralize the colors of the tattoo so it won't show through your coverup., If you strategically placed your tattoo, it should be easy to hide with long sleeves, a thick watch band or bracelet, a bandaid or a ring. Just wearing your hair down can cover a tattoo behind your ear or on the back of your neck.

, Try not to be adamantly anti-tattoo. Say something like, ""Actually, I think they can be really beautiful if they're done well."" You could even hint that you would consider getting one someday. If you say there's absolutely no way you would ever get one in a million years and then your parents see the one you've been hiding, you're going to come of as a bigger liar.

"
Expect to be punished.,
Apologize for concealing the tattoo from them.,
Make up a compelling reason why you got the tattoo.",How to Get a Tattoo Without Your Parents Knowing3," You got caught, prepare to deal with the consequences. Whining, screaming, and making a scene isn't going to help you prove to your parents that you are more than an impulsive child.

, Acknowledging that you were wrong to lie shows maturity, and they may eventually realize you are old enough and mature enough to make decisions about what you do with your own body. This is another good reason to avoid the stick-and-poke--it makes a better impression if you made smart, safe choices when you got your piece and they don't have to worry about your health, too.


Bringing up that it's your body and you can do what you want with it might not go well in the heat of the moment. It is a valid point, but probably one to be made once things have cooled down and you can talk rationally about your decision.

, It's sort of a dirty trick, but if you say your tiny heart tattoo is to remind you of your dearly departed grandpa, your parents might soften a little. Or if you got a crucifix, tell them it's tied to your faith and to remind you to be a good Christian, or your shamrock tattoo is to keep you grounded in your Irish roots.


This works best with broad, symbolic tattoos that you can easily connect to something significant.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Prepare the tattooed skin.",How to Fade Tattoos1," There are several things that can be used at home to help to fade a tattoo. These include a hand towel, a bowl of water, a razor for shaving, an emulsion agent for washing, such as unscented anti-bacterial soap, a gauze sponge, a cup or bowl containing two tablespoons of ground salt, an antibiotic cream and some sterile gauze.;
, It is important to shave the section of skin with the tattoo. This helps to ensure that the whole process is more effective and less painful.


Once the area is hair free, it should then be cleaned with the emulsion agent or the anti-bacterial soap and warm water. This helps to disinfect the region and prevent the introduction of bacteria. A hand towel can be used to pat the area dry.
It is advisable to ask your doctor to prescribe a specialized emulsion agent that is antibacterial in nature as this provides better results.
Press a clean cloth that has been dipped in warm water against the tattoo. This opens up the pores and helps the fading process along.

Clean the area with alcohol.,
Apply a layer of foundation primer to the tattoo.,
Sponge on a layer of concealer.,
Add a layer of skin-tone concealer.,
Finish with invisible loose powder.,
Hide the tattoo with clothing.,
Choose a meaningful design.,
Get a dark, complex design.,
Choose a skilled, experienced artist.,
Check the artist’s qualifications.,
Ask if you should be getting laser removal sessions.,
Get in the chair.",How to Cover Up an Armband Tattoo," Not only will this clean and disinfect the ink, it will also remove any oil buildup in your pores. Use a cotton swab, dipped in rubbing alcohol, to dab the tattooed area., Use a makeup sponge to dab the primer onto the tattoo. This will give any other makeup you apply a better grip on your skin. It’ll make for a more opaque cover up.

Once dry, foundation primer will be transparent, so you don’t need to worry about trying to match it to your skin tone. , The first layer of concealer should be full-coverage concealer. This darker tone will hide most of the tattoo. Use a makeup sponge to dab the concealer onto the tattoo., This second layer of concealer will help completely cover up the tattoo and the first layer of concealer (which usually won’t match your skin tone). Use a ½ inch (1.3cm) brush to pat the concealer onto the covered tattoo. Be sure not to brush or sweep back and forth over the concealer; you’ll essentially reveal the tattoo and make the job harder for yourself., This will help the makeup set. It won’t run and is less likely to rub off. Use a fluffy eyeshadow brush to dab the powder onto the layers of concealer. Again, you don’t want to brush the powder on, as it might rub some of the concealer off., The kind of clothing you use will depend on the tattoo, its placement, and the reason you need to hide it. Darker tattoos will show through sheer or light clothing, so you’ll need to wear darker clothes. The best kind of shirt for covering up a tattoo is a dark, long sleeved shirt.

If you’re hiding your tattoo in a professional setting, you’ll likely need to wear a collared shirt.
If your tattoo is higher on your arm, you can get away with a short sleeve shirt. Make sure it’s the right size so the sleeves won’t ride up., If you’re thinking of covering up your armband tattoo, you want to make sure the cover-up lasts. It’s important to choose the right design. The best tattoo is something that you feel passionate about or holds a special meaning to you. Choose carefully and confer with your chosen artist., The more detail the new design has, the more effectively it will cover up your other tattoo. Fish scales, vegetation, and hair are examples of these details. Additionally, tattoos with dark colors are especially good for covering up tattoos. Black shading, purple, and green are all great colors for cover-up tattoos.

Cover-up tattoos will usually need to be larger than the original tattoo. In some cases, the cover-up will be up to twice as large., Much like getting any tattoo, there are a few things to consider before choosing a tattoo artist. You need to see samples of their work to make sure they’re skilled with the kind of design you’re looking for. Get some references as well; this will give you a better understanding of the kind of person you’ll be dealing with.

With cover-up tattoos, it’s important to find a tattoo artist who’s done them before. They take a tad more skill to render correctly., You should make sure that any licenses or certifications the artist holds are up to date. Find out what experience they have, if they underwent an apprenticeship, and if so, where. This will give you a better idea of their professionalism.

Additionally, you should confirm the tattoo parlor is safe and clean. While tattoo parlors aren’t regulated everywhere, there are a few things you can check to confirm safety. For example, the parlor should use disposable needles and inkwells., Some designs are simply too dark to be covered up, and might not mesh well with the new design you have planned. The best person to ask is a tattoo artist. They’ll give you some advice, including whether it’s needed and how many sessions you might need., Once you’ve spent time choosing your artist and your design, it’s time to get it done. Be aware that a good coverup design will take a good amount of time to be done properly."

Cleanse your skin.,
Apply a light concealer.,
Apply foundation.,
Apply translucent powder.,
Spitz with hairspray.,
(optional) Do a trial run before the event.",How to Cover a Tattoo with Makeup1," Before you begin, it's a good idea to cleanse your tattooed skin with a wipe or a little facial wash. This prepares the skin to receive the makeup.


Keep in mind that you shouldn't attempt to cover a tattoo with makeup unless it's fully healed, otherwise you could ruin the ink or develop an infection.
Tattoos can take as long as 45 days to heal completely.;
, Take a heavy coverage liquid or cream concealer that's several shades lighter than your natural skin tone.









Use a makeup sponge or stippling brush to apply the concealer to the tattoo. Try to dab or blot the concealer onto the skin instead of rubbing it. Rubbing simply pushes the product around rather than adding coverage.
As a result, blotting will also help you to avoid wasting too much of your concealer. Once you've coated the tattoo in an even layer, wait a minute or two for it to dry. Don't worry if the tattoo is still visible.

, Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone perfectly. Spray foundations are the easiest to work with and provide the most even coverage, but liquid or cream foundations will also work.









If you're using a spray foundation, give the can a good shake then hold it approximately 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the tattoo. Spray the foundation in spurts, rather than spraying in a continuous stream. This will prevent you from being too heavy-handed with it. Spray until you have evenly covered the tattoo, then give it 60 seconds to set.If you're using a liquid or cream foundation, use a makeup sponge or stippling brush to apply the product, using the same blotting technique you used with the concealer. If necessary, use your fingers to smooth out the top layer and blend around the edges.

, Use a large powder brush to apply a layer of translucent powder over the foundation. This provides a matte finish. 







, When you are done layering the makeup, finish with a light spritz of hairspray. This sets the coverage and will prevent the makeup from rubbing off onto any clothes or furniture. Allow the area to dry before touching it or attempting to cover it with clothing.







, If you plan on covering up your tattoo for a specific event such as a job interview or wedding, it's a good idea to do a trial run beforehand. This will give you a chance to practice your technique and ensure that your makeup is the right color for your skin tone.

Scrub the skin with salty gauze.,
Allow the tattoo to sit for two hours.,
Cover the tattoo with sterile gauze.,
Know what to expect next.,
Alternatively, use a tattoo fading cream.",How to Fade Tattoos2," Dip the gauze sponge in warm water to moisten it. Then roll the gauze repeatedly over a pile of ground salt as this helps to salinate the water that has been absorbed in the gauze.


The sponge should be rolled until the salt has stopped dissolving into it. The sponge is then rubbed over the tattoo for approximately 30-40 minutes until the skin is red.
Ground salt is a good exfoliating agent when it is rubbed on the skin - it removes several layers of the skin, which helps to fade the tattoo.

, After scrubbing, allow the tattoo to sit for two hours without washing the salty scrub off. Once the two hours are up, you should wash it thoroughly with cold water for 5-10 minutes. You may notice some ink being washed away as the area is rinsed with water.


In case there is any bleeding, it is recommended that you soak a fresh, clean hand cloth in hydrogen peroxide and then press it against the broken skin. This helps to disinfect the area and prevent any infection.
It is also advisable to apply a small amount of vitamin E over the area as this helps to promote healing and prevent the formation of a scar. Vitamin E also helps to reduce inflammation and pain.

, Use a clean hand cloth to dry the skin and then an antibiotic cream can be applied on top. Use sterile gauze to cover the area, which can be held in place using tape from a first aid kit. This helps to protect the area and prevent infection.

, The dressing can be taken off after three days and the area assessed. If the skin is painful or reddened, it may be infected. If this is the case, it is advisable to see the doctor or visit the nearest hospital.


There is also a likelihood of a scab forming on the tattoo after scrubbing - this should be left alone and allowed to fall off. When this happens, the inked area should appear lighter than it did before.
This process can be repeated until the tattoo has faded to your liking. This process works for old and fresh tattoos as well as the white, black and colored tattoos.

, There are also a number of creams on the market and that can be used to fade tattoos .It is advisable to do some research on these creams before you make a decision on which to buy.


The creams that are used for the removal of tattoos work by sinking deep into the skin and disintegrating the pigments that make up the tattoo.
Be aware that while some people have experienced positive results after the use of these creams, others didn't see any changes in the appearance of their tattoo.

"
Do some research.,
Read up on blood borne pathogens and the potential risks of piercing yourself.,
Decide on what size, or gauge you would like to be pierced at.,
Order your surgical steel piercing needles.,
Get your titanium or surgical steel jewelry.,
Get other tools.,
Get gloves and other safety supplies.",How to Pierce Your Own Penis1," There are many different types of piercings you can get on or around your penis. Some of the most common are Prince Alberts, Ampallangs, Frenums, and more. Look them up and see what you think sounds best. Google Image Search will usually help you sort out the basics.;
, Getting this done at home can lead to all sorts of diseases that can risk your health, as well as the health of your package. If you want to ever use that thing again, go about this very, very carefully. Dong rot is nothing to joke about. This is the only body you've got, so don't ruin it.


Also read up on your local laws. In most places, you must be 18 years or older to get piercings without an adult accompanying you. Please be responsible.

, Piercing sizes generally follow the American Wire Gauge standard in which a larger number represents a smaller size. For example, genital piercings are typically done from a size 16 to about a size 12, though there are always exceptions. A 14 gauge is about 1/16"".

, Make sure to get the correct gauge size for your piercing. Most tattoo/piercing shops won't sell you piercing needles due to liability issues, but you can order them online without too much trouble. Make sure you are getting them from a reputable source and that the packages come entirely sealed, because you can get some very serious diseases from unhygienic needles. As we said: dong rot is not something to joke around with.

, Make sure it is the right size and shape for your new piercing. Barbells or rings for a Frenum ladder, a curved barbell for a Prince Albert, etc. Keep in mind the length of jewelry that you will need. Having jewelry that is too small can cause significant problems while healing, so if you're not sure, get something a little bigger just in case, that way you have some extra room if it swells (and it will most likely swell).

, Depending on the piercing, it might be useful to buy a pair of clamps as well. Sometimes it can be very difficult to hold the head how you want it, especially in places like the scrotum or the shaft of the penis. These clamps allow you to mark your spot, then clamp the skin just how you want it so you don't have to worry about it slipping and moving while you are trying to pierce. Piercing in the incorrect location can cause serious bleeding or worse, permanent injury, so clamps are a good idea.


This is one reason why it may be good to get it done by a professional. Placement is very important and experience will go a long way towards helping with getting your piercing where it should go.

, You can order gloves from these sites as well. They are very important. You must be sure to take any possible precaution against the spread of Blood borne pathogens and other infectious diseases. Alcohol wipes are good as well to sterilize and clean the skin around your potential piercing spot. Also it's very useful to get some A&D ointment to lubricate your needle. It makes it a lot easier when you push it through the skin.


Remember that all the alcohol wipes in the world may not help. In fact, even alcohol wipes can become contaminated. Professional equipment is useful for this reason.

Use tattoo cover-up.,
Use stage make-up.,
Get an airbrush tan.",How to Cover a Tattoo with Makeup2," There are many products on the market designed specifically for covering up tattoos. These products are highly effective, due to their heavy coverage and broad selection of colors, which can match nearly any skin tone. The only downside to these products is their cost. Some of the best products include:










Tattoo Camo: This tattoo camouflage brand provides a complete kit for covering your tattoo. The product comes in a tube which can be rubbed directly over the tattooed skin with no need for brushes or sponges. The kit also provides a special cleanser for removing the product. The kit is available from their website.

Dermablend: Dermablend is a fantastic product which was originally designed by dermatologists to cover up scars and skin conditions. It is hypoallergenic, making it an excellent option for people with sensitive skin. It can last for up to 16 hours. It is also available online.

Covermark: Covermark Tattoo Removal is another tattoo removal kit, which is available in variety of shades. The kit includes a skin primer, a liquid foundation, a matte powder and a special applicator.

, Stage makeup provides extremely heavy and long-lasting coverage and is good for tattoos covering large areas of skin.









It's possible to buy stage makeup in a variety of skin colors, but you can also use plain white makeup to cover up the tattoo, then use your regular foundation on top to match your skin tone.
Some of the most popular and widely available stage makeup brands include Killer Cover, Ben Nye and Mehron.

, If your tattoo is quite small or light in color, it may be possible to cover it up with an airbrush spray tan. These spray tans not only darken the skin, but also even out skin tone and cover imperfections.


Call into your local tanning salon to see if they offer airbrushing services. Show them your tattoo and ask them if they think the treatment would effectively cover it up.
At-home spray tan products such as Sally Hansen airbrush legs can also be used to try to cover up small, light-colored tattoos.

You can ask for recommendations from friends, but always check out the place for yourself. It's a good idea to go in a day or two before you want your piercing to look around and ask questions.The whole studio and the people working in it should be clean. Ask if they use an autoclave (a type of cleaning unit) and if they use new needles and gloves for each person.
Look to see if there is a separate area for piercing and tattooing.
Check to see if they use a piercing gun. Guns are not safe, as they cannot be disinfected properly.
Talk to the piercers. Ask about their experience and how long they've been piercing. Also, check whether they use hypoallergenic jewelry, made from materials such as gold (14- or 18-karat), stainless steel, titanium, or niobium.;
, If you're at a reputable parlor, the piercer will walk you through the steps as they're cleaning items and preparing to pierce you. The piercer should wash their hands and use single-use gloves. They should show you that all instruments are either one-time use or have been through an autoclave. Also, they should clean your lip and shave the area with a one-time razor (if you need it).If you aren't comfortable with their cleanliness, walk out.
Pay attention to what the piercer says. At a reputable parlor, your piercer will provide information on what you should do for aftercare. In fact, it's a requirement that piercers provide this information in many areas. Don't be afraid to speak up with questions. You have a right to ask.

, Oral piercings need to be rinsed regularly while they are healing. You should rinse your piercing four to five times a day, after every time you eat (particularly meals) and before you go to bed to help reduce bacteria.You can use either a salt solution or an alcohol-free mouthwash (that's both antibacterial and antimicrobial). To make the salt solution, dissolve a teaspoon of (non-iodized) salt in a cup of warm water.
To rinse, just swish the mouthwash or solution around the inside of your mouth, particularly near your piercing, for fifteen to thirty seconds.

, While you need to rinse the inner area, it's also important to pay attention to the outside, too. You can wash it off with antibacterial soap, for instance. You can also use an antibacterial spray on it once it's clean.Try using a cotton swab to apply a bit of liquid antibacterial soap to the area. You can dilute the soap a bit if that makes it easier. Rub it all around the piercing, getting it thoroughly wet. Try to rub off any dried bits. After it's wet, you can turn the piercing as needed. Rinse off the soap.
Do not use hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, or antibiotic ointments, gels, or creams., An oral rinse helps keep the area clean. You apply five drops to each side of the piercing. Once it foams up, spit it out. Some brands you can use include Gly-oxide or Peroxyl. You can usually buy them at the piercing parlor or at a drug store.Do this routine twice a day.

, If you are going to clean or touch your piercing, your hands need to be as bacteria-free as possible. Wash them for a good twenty seconds, scrubbing them with soap and water. Dry on a clean towel., Taking care of your mouth and teeth while your piercing is healing is also important. Make sure you are brushing twice a day (with a soft-bristled brush) and that you are flossing once a day. Doing so will help reduce the bacteria your piercing is exposed to., Kissing, at least French kissing, introduces new bacteria to your mouth. You should skip this type of kissing while your lip is healing. Also, avoid giving oral sex while your lip is healing, as that can also introduce bacteria., Any kind of body of water carries bacteria, even treated swimming pools. While your piercing is healing, make sure to avoid these areas. You don't want to introduce extra bacteria to the area, as that could lead to an infection., Sometimes, you may get a ""pimple"" near or in the piercing while it is healing. Most of the time, you can treat these at home, though if it is particularly swollen or you notice signs of infection, you should see a doctor.Use a saltwater rinse on the area. Keep it up for two weeks after the pimple disappears.
Antihistamines may also help.

, An infected piercing can be a serious medical issue if you just let it go. Watch for signs of infection, which include swelling, redness, and pain. Red streaks going out away from the piercing are particularly problematic, as that means the infection is spreading quickly.Also, watch for thick discharge, especially if you see a lot of it. It will likely smell bad.
If your infection worsens, you may get a fever, sweating, and/or chills. You may also get nauseated, vomit, or become disoriented.

, If you notice signs of infection, you should go to the doctor. A doctor will help you treat the issue. Plus, you may need prescription antibiotics to stave off the infection.Also, don't immediately take out your piercing if you suspect an infection. You may need to leave it in to help drain the infection."
"
First you must decide on a location to get your piercing done.,
Sanitize everything.,
Don't neglect your jewelry.,
Prepare your supplies.,
Clean the surrounding skin.,
Mark the entry and exit locations.,
If everything looks good, take off your gloves and throw them away.,
Apply the clamps.,
Alternatively, stretch the skin.",How to Pierce Your Own Penis2," Choose an area with a good bit of flat space that you can work with and a good counter. A bathroom is a good place. You'll also want an area that is easy to sterilize and clean up all the blood when you're done.

, First of all, make a solution of 1 part bleach and four parts water. Clean the bathroom thoroughly. Scrub any area that you think you might touch during the procedure. Clean every inch of the counter. The cleaner this place is, the safer you are.

, If you bought sterile clamps and jewelry, then great, but if not, it might be a good idea to boil these in a pot of water, then wipe them down with some of your bleach and water solutions. It's probably a good idea to sterilize these regardless since you don't know what they may have come into contact with since you got them.

, Once everything is clean, put on a pair of gloves and lay out all your supplies. Extra gloves, sterile needle, sterile clamps, sterile jewelry, alcohol wipes, a marker, and a small blob of A&D ointment. Remove your gloves and throw them away.

, Now, put on a pair of fresh, clean rubber gloves. Use an alcohol wipe to clean off the area where you want to pierce yourself.

, Use a marker to make two dots, one where you want the needle to go in, and one where you want the needle to come out. Make sure that these dots are a suitable distance apart for your jewelry. Take a step back and imagine it with jewelry in it. Make very sure that it is straight and just how you want it because it is a pain to have to take it out and redo it all over again.


Realize that marking these dots does not guarantee that this is where the jewelry will go. If you move (due to, for example, serious pain), you might shift the needle and end up with a crooked piercing. A good reason to have someone else do this for you.

, Put on a fresh pair.

, Now take your clamps (if you have them) and stretch out the skin in the place you have marked. Line up the two dots on either side of the skin and gently let the clamps close on the skin. You should be able to see one dot on each side of the clamp, and each dot should be centered so that a straight line(a needle) could pass through both of them correctly.


This method is better suited to only certain types of penis piercings. For PA's, you'll need to use a different method. They are harder to do and really should be done by a professional.

, If you didn't buy a clamp, this would be a little trickier. You must use one hand to stretch the skin and line it up like above so that a straight line could pass through both. It can be tough to hold the skin like this when you are coming at it with a needle in the other hand (another reason to have it professionally done).

"
"
Get out your needle.,
Apply ointment.,
Line up the needle.,
Pierce the skin.,
Insert the piercing.,
Secure your jewelry.,
Dispose of your needle correctly.",How to Pierce Your Own Penis3," Once you've got your clamp latched on, it's time to unpackage your needle. You bought a sterile piercing needle that matches the size of your jewelry right? If not, stop now. Go get the right size. MAKE SURE YOU BUY IT STERILE. If the packaging is damaged, get a new one. This is NOT the place to be lazy.

, Once you've got your needle out, rub on just a little bit of the A&D ointment. This will make the next step easier.

, Okay! Now double check to see that both marks are still lined up in the clamp. If they are, then hold the clamp in one hand so that you can clearly see your mark. Now with the other hand, take the needle over and line it up on your mark. You can hold the sides of the needle between your thumb and middle finger and use your index finger on the back of the needle to push through, but hold it whichever way is steadiest and most comfortable for you.

, Now, take a couple of deep breaths, check to make sure you're lined up correctly and quickly push the needle through the skin till you see it poking through the other side at least a centimeter or two. Make sure you don't push the entire needle out the other side because we will use the needle to guide the jewelry in.


Pushing the needle through your skin will hurt! Very beefy dudes cry like babies during this type of piercing. You just have to push all the way through. It's very hard to keep going once you feel that initial pain, but it doesn't get any worse than that first little bit of pain, so you might as well just keep going so that it's all the way through, rather than going to all this trouble and not even having a piercing to show for it.
If it hurts, just push through a little harder. It will stop hurting very quickly once you get through to the other side.

, Great! Now that you've got the needle through, the hard part is over! Now you just have to put the jewelry in. You still have the needle sticking out both sides of the hole, right? I bet it looks pretty cool, but now it's time to put in your jewelry. So, unscrew or remove a ball from one side of your jewelry. Don't lose it! Now take the threaded, ball-less side of your jewelry and line it up inside the back of the hollow needle. It should fit in there just fine. Now you can use the jewelry to push the needle the rest of the way out and the jewelry will follow right into the hole.

, If you did everything correctly, you should see the threaded end of your jewelry poking out the exit hole of your new piercing. Now just screw that ball on and you're good!! Take the time to clean the area with another alcohol wipe.

, If you bring it to a piercing shop or a hospital, they will gladly dispose of it for you. If you absolutely cannot get it to one of these places, then put it in a hard plastic container such as a prescription pill bottle and throw it away. Be considerate, this is considered biological waste, and it's not fair to put your garbage collector at risk.

Take care of yourself.,
Be careful around water.,
Slow down on the sex, tiger!,
Ask if you have any questions.",How to Pierce Your Own Penis4," Congratulations, you're pierced! Now you just need to take care of it properly. You should soak it in a solution of warm water and sea salt for the first couple weeks. When taking a shower, it is a good idea to use an anti-microbial soap just in case.

, Showers are fine, but try to avoid baths or swimming during the healing process since it is easier to get infections from sitting water.

, With genital piercings, you should not have sex for at least four weeks or so. You have an open wound on your penis, so keep that in mind. You are much more susceptible to STDs during the healing process, and having unprotected sex makes it much more likely to get an infection. So wear a condom every time for at least two months, whether you're in a committed relationship with other forms of birth control or not. This is for your safety. Also, remember you have metal down there, so it might not be a good idea to use ""Shear"" or ""extra sensitive"" condoms as they may break more easily.

, Enjoy your new piercing, and if you have any questions, ask your local piercer. They are more than happy to give you advice. They want everyone to be safe.

Anticipate cartilage fracture, whether a piercing gun is used or a piercing needle is administered by hand.",How to Pierce Your Own Cartilage," There are significant health risks involved in cartilaginous piercings and minor complications are frequently reported. There are often no minimum qualifications for one to practice body piercing, which represents a serious health concern. The health risks associated with cartilaginous piercing are not significantly higher than with a lower piercing of the fatty lobe tissue.;
, Purchasing sterilized, sealed piercing needles is key. Your jewelry should not be made of nickel or any metal you may have an allergic reaction to, and should be a gauge smaller than the hollow piercing needle.

, You can use a pressure cooker on objects to achieve a similar effect, by setting a high pressure and temperature with water in the cooker so as to steam disinfect the items to be used. Soaking in a disinfectant like alcohol or dilute bleach will sterilize the materials, though not as effectively.

, Have gloves, topical disinfectant to prep the site (iodine is preferred), a marker to designate the piercing site, a stopper to help prevent the needle from poking your scalp. Set up a sterile work bench for the materials to rest on, as well as a separate site for handled materials to be placed on. Do not handle non-sterile items and sterile ones interchangeably.

, The location is difficult to clean, so consider just taking a shower. Hot steamy water also helps to loosen your skin, making the piercing a bit less painful. Clean the area thoroughly, and make sure that the site is marked with an indelible marker or pen.

, These will not reduce the overall pain significantly as these topical solutions do not affect the avascular cartilage. Ice is not recommended. It causes the skin to contract. Contact with the ice pack or ice itself can cause dermal tissue damage and make it more difficult to target the site or maintain sterility.


This will hurt. If you wish to avoid pain, do not put a large hollow needle through any part of your body, and do not pay anyone to do this for you or to you if you truly wish to avoid a wound in your ear.

, Apply liberally and cover the back of the ear as well. Avoiding infection is key as intervention for infections resulting from piercing often requires draining, surgery, and the removal of the piercing, and symptoms include severe pain and fever.

, Avoiding discomfort or contact of the needle with any unsterilized or unintended surfaces is critical to avoiding infection. A friend can be extremely useful with this part, as placing and holding the stopper and performing the piercing can require some dexterity.

, After breaking the first layer of skin, make sure the needle is angled correctly to push through as you like it. There will be resistance, and a total of 3 distinct pops as you pierce the skin, cartilage, and then skin again.

, Make sure your needle is one size bigger than the jewelry, so you can easily do so. Again, avoid use of any metal you have an allergy or sensitivity to, as simple contact dermatitis from metal exposure can morph into an infection with repeated contact of the wound site.

, This should leave the jewelry in your ear. Screw the ball or holder into place to hold the jewelry there and maintain the piercing. Do this quickly, as the process is painful and will require repeating at a different site if you make a mistake and wish to avoid mangling your cartilage or inviting infection with a larger wound on your ear.

, Don't pick at any crust or scabs that will form. It can take up to a year for the wound to heal completely. Poor blood flow in the area of the upper cartilage of the ear keeps the risk of infection high and the rate of healing low during the entire process.

, While keloids, deposits of skin, and some malformation from the pierced cartilage are expected, redness, swelling, heat, or oozing from the wound that persists for days is not. See a doctor if symptoms last as long as a week, as courses of antibiotics and surgical intervention may be required, and average hospital stays are over two days., These solutions kill living cells and can damage the capillaries and healing tissue in the ear. Keeping the site clear of foreign debris and clean will help significantly reduce the risk of infection.

, However, for a number of piercings of specific structures of the ear a piercing gun cannot find adequate purchase, as they are designed around use on the earlobe. Seek immediate medical attention if ear deformities begin appearing.

Keep an eye out for infection.",How to Pierce Your Own Belly Button at Home," Using the correct equipment for piercing your belly button is essential. Otherwise, the piercing could go badly wrong or result in a nasty infection. To pierce your belly button in the safest way possible, you will need:


A 14 gauge sterile piercing needle, a 14 gauge belly button ring made from stainless steel, titanium or bioplast, some rubbing alcohol or alcohol wipes, a body ink marker, a piercing clamp and some cotton balls.
Using a sewing needle, safety pin or piercing gun to pierce your belly button is a bad idea, as these items are unsafe and will not produce good results.;
, Before you proceed with piercing your belly button, you will need to take all precautions necessary to eliminate the chance of getting infected. Spray any used countertops or tables with a disinfectant (not an antiseptic).

, Don't forget to wash your hands (and lower arms) in warm water! Everything needs to be completely sterile. An even safer precaution is wearing latex gloves (if they're sterile and haven't been sitting out). Dry your hands with a paper towel--not a cloth towel that's porous and attracts bacteria.

, If you have bought all of these items new (which you should have) they should be in sterile packaging. However, if they did not, or you have handled them already, you will need to sterilize them yourself before piercing.


You can do this by submerging the items in rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and leaving them to sit in the liquid for a minute or two.
Remove them from the liquid (wearing clean latex gloves, if possible) and leave them on a clean piece of paper towel to dry completely.

, Before piercing, it is necessary to thoroughly clean in and around the belly button to remove any bacteria from the surface of the skin. It's best to use a disinfecting skincare gel especially designed for piercings (such as Bactine) or rubbing alcohol.


Generously apply the disinfectant or rubbing alcohol to a cotton ball and wipe thoroughly around the area to be pierced. Wait for the area to dry completely before proceeding.
If you are using rubbing alcohol, it's important to use one with a concentration of above 70% isopropanol, to achieve the necessary level of disinfection.
If necessary, use a Q-Tip or other similar device to get inside your navel. Make sure to clean both above and below the piercing site.

, Before you pierce, you will need to have some idea of where the needle is going, so using a body ink marker to mark the entrance and exit locations of the needle is a good idea.There should be approximately 1 cm (.4 inches) between the navel and the pierced hole.


Belly button piercings are typically located at the top of the belly button, rather than the bottom, but the choice is yours.
Use a small hand-held mirror to check if the two marks are aligned horizontally and vertically. Only do this while standing, as your stomach scrunches up when sitting and will not give you a straight pierce.

, Some people who are squeamish about pain may want to numb the skin around the belly button with an ice cube wrapped in paper towel before proceeding.


However, it is important to be aware that numbing the area with ice will also make the skin tough and rubbery, making it harder to push the piercing needle through.
Alternatively, you can apply a little numbing gel (such as those used for numbing gums before injections) to the area using a q-tip.

, You don't want to be fumbling with this while struggling to hold both the clamp and the needle in place.

, Now you are ready to begin! Take the piercing clamp and use it to clamp the skin of the navel and pull it out from the body slightly.


The entrance point you marked with the body ink should be centered in the bottom half of the clamp, while the exit point should be centered on the top half.
Make sure to hold the clamp with your weaker hand, as you want the stronger, steadier one holding the needle.

, Take the sterilized, 14-gauge piercing needle. This needle has a hollow center, which will allow you to easily insert the belly button ring once you have pushed the needle through.

, Align the sharp end of the needle with the mark on the underside of the clamp. Take a deep breath, then with one fluid movement push the needle through the skin, making sure that the needle exits through the mark at the top of the clamp.


Never pierce from the top down. You need to be able to see where your needle is going and you can't do this if you're piercing downwards.
The best way to pierce is while standing up, as this will give you the most mobility and allow you to see what you're doing. However, if you're concerned about fainting, pierce while lying down (not sitting!).
Don't be concerned if the piercing bleeds a little -- this is totally normal. Just wipe away the blood with a clean q-tip dipped in saline solution.

, Place the end of the jewelry without the ball into the hollow needle (it should be virtually flush or slightly smaller than the needle) and push the needle out with the jewelry. DO NOT pull the needle out. You want to keep the contact between the needle and your navel ring for a smooth transition. The needle will fall off the end of the jewelry as it exits the skin so be prepared to catch it.


Refrain from pulling the needle out to soon, before the jewelry is fully through!
Take the loose ball and screw it tightly onto the top of the belly button ring. Tah-dah! Your belly button is pierced!

, As soon as you've finished, wash your hands with antibacterial hand soap. Then take a cotton ball soaked in a saline solution or a cleaning solution and very gently clean around the piercing.


This is the first day of your cleaning regimen and arguably the most important. Take a few minutes to be thorough.
Don't tug at your new piercing. Clean it and leave it alone to heal. Touching it or playing with it will only lead to infection, which is the last thing you want.

, The work isn't over yet! Remember that a new piercing is like an open wound, so it is extremely important that you maintain a strict cleaning regimen over the next couple of months. You will need to keep this up until the piercing heals completely, in order to prevent any itching and infection.


Wash the piercing with antibacterial soap once a day. Avoid rubbing alcohol, peroxide, or ointments, as these can be very drying and irritating on the skin of used everyday.

, A great way to keep your new piercing clean and free of infection is to use a salt solution. You can buy a saline solution at a drugstore or piercing studio, or you can simply dissolve some non-iodized sea salt in a cup of warm water.


Dip a q-tip in the solution and use it to carefully clean around both ends of the piercing.
Gently push the jewelry from one side to the other in order to clean the ring as well.

, Whether it's a pool, a river, or a hot tub, stay away for the first few months, as the water can harbor bacteria which can easily infect your new piercing.

, If you see a clear or white liquid, it's healing properly. Anything with color or smell is infected and should be seen by a doctor.


Some professionals advocate a stringent care routine for up to 4-6 months. After 2 months, assess how your piercing is doing.
Don't mess with it! Allow it to heal before you go changing rings. You may replace the balls, but don't touch the barbel. This will not only inflict pain but also slow the healing process.

, Even after it seems healed, your piercing can get infected. If you suspect an infection (signs include swelling, tenderness, bleeding or seeping) apply a warm compress to the area every three to four hours, then clean with an antiseptic cleanser and apply a topical antibacterial cream.


If you don't see an improvement within 24 hours, consult your doctor.
If a doctor isn't an option, see a professional piercing artist. They will help you adjust your care routine and give you professional products.
Never take the belly button ring when dealing with an infection - this only runs the risk of the infection becoming trapped inside the piercing.

Before you do anything, make sure you decide if you really want to pierce your lip.,
Use the appropriate equipment.,
Clean your needle.,
Prepare to pierce your lip: Dry your inner lip with a dry tissue or cloth so you don't salivate all over your piercing hand.,
Wear clean vinyl/rubber gloves.,
Start from the inside of the lip: Going through muscle tissue on the inside of your mouth is a lot easier than getting through the skin first and then going through the muscle layer.,
Follow-through: For pro hollow needles, simply slip your jewelry into the end, and pull the needle out pulling the jewelry through the hole.,
Go show off your new lip piercing to all your friends!,
For about three weeks there will be a discharge from your new piercing.,
Finished.

",How to Pierce Your Own Lip," While the hole can close up, it entails a lot of pain to get it done. If you don't handle pain easily, piercing your lip is not for you.;
, Mainly the proper piercing needle. professional needles are to be use used. Sewing needles are for fabric NOT your skin!

, This is a very important part. You don't know where any of these needles have been. If you have a packaged pro needle, then it has probably already been safely cleaned in an autoclave, so no worries.


Be sure to clean your jewelry properly, too. Though some caution was probably taken in manufacturing it, you can never be too careful!

, First mark where you want to pierce so you know were to put the needle. Then make sure the area you're in is very clean; not sitting at some grungy bathroom sink. Have your supplies ready, laid out on a clean tissue. Don't get any unnecessary germs on them.

, Once your gloves are on, be sure to not touch anything but the needle and clamp.

, If you pierce it from the outside, it'll hurt more, as your epidermis will feel it, and it doesn't hurt quite as much from the inside, but is a bit more difficult, to be honest. Hold the area you're ready to pierce, and push through the first layer of muscle with your needle, and make sure you get halfway through your lip on the first push, that way you should be through the muscle layer on the inside and only have to do the skin on the outside, which is easier. Again, be sure this is where you want to pierce, and have it ready at a good angle. Instead of forcing the needle through, push your lip into the needle. This will reduce the pain, and will make the whole process go smoother. Another way is to put your finger behind your lip, where the needle will come out, and push, while pushing in the needle at the same time. The pressure will keep you from feeling as much pain, and will make it thinner and easier to pierce through. Also a good reason to have a clamp not only for good grip is to reduce pain and make it easier for you to pierce.

, Voilà!

, But, don't stop there! Be sure to clean it well, and don't take the jewelry out early unless you absolutely need to (i.e. your parents force you, your job makes you, school makes you. Don't take it out just because. That's the easiest way to get an infection. A good, effective and easy way to keep your piercing healing properly is saline solution. This is simply 8 oz. distilled water with about 1/4 tsp. of non-iodized sea salt. Do not touch the piercing unless you are cleaning it. Using alcohol-free mouthwash and avoiding spicy foods will help the healing. Let it totally heal on its own time. Some take longer than others.

, That's good, and shows your body is healing properly. Stay clear away from yellow or greenish discharge. That's usually a sign of infection, in this case do not take out the jewelry because it will trap the infection inside the skin. You should take it to a shop and get professional help. You may see this discharge the first day or two after you pierce it, but afterward it may be infected; so again, keep clean! Avoid drinking alcohol, smoking and swimming pools for a few weeks to a few months after piercing it. The usual healing time is about 2 months, but most find it heals in a month and a half.

Ask for advice.",How to Pierce Your Own Nose," Look at various styles of nose piercing, and decide what you want. For your first home piercing, consider a simple stud or a nose ring. Think about how you're going to look with this piercing, and make sure that you know exactly what you want.


Consider getting your nose pierced professionally. A professional job is usually a much safer, cleaner, and less painful experience. If you pierce your nose at home, you risk bleeding, infection, or a botched job.On the other hand, it can be fulfilling to do the piercing yourself.;
, You can find piercing studs, rings, and bars in jewelry stores, tattoo parlors, and novelty shops. Try searching online if you know exactly what you want. Make sure that you're buying sterile, unused jewelry, and consider starting with something small. Make sure you have the right size, length, and thickness. Do not use a ring, an earring, or anything that has been used before.


Be aware that some people have allergies to certain metals. Nickel allergies are the most common metal allergy, and may cause a painful rash. Gold, cobalt, and chromate are other common sources of metal allergy.If your skin looks cracked or blistered after the piercing, you should remove the piercing and see a doctor as soon as possible.
Consider using titanium jewelry, or stainless steel – anything that will not easily corrode. Look for metals that are free of nickel: 14-24 karat yellow gold, sterling silver, copper, or platinum. Polycarbonate plastic is usually safe to use., If you try to pierce over (or near) an infected skin blemish, the piercing itself will face a higher risk of infection. Thus, if you have any acne or blackheads, wait a few days or weeks until the rash recedes. Wash your face regularly, and consider using a pore-cleansing (or medicated) facial scrub.

, Be sure to use a fresh needle; if it isn't pre-packaged, then you can't be sure that it hasn't been used before. Use a hollow needle – these are more effective. Use a thin gauge, between 20G (.81mm) and 18G (1.0mm), and make sure that the hole is not smaller in diameter than your jewelry.Take the needle out of the packaging, when you are ready, and be sure to sterilize it before you put it into your skin.


A safety pin, a pushpin, an earring, or a sewing needle will make the piercing more prone to infection; it can be hard to properly sterilize these objects. The point may also be too dull to pierce, which can tear the tissue and put too much stress on the piercing.
Don't set the needle down anywhere, lest it gets contaminated. If you must set it down, use a clean tissue or a sterilized tray.

, This includes the needle, the jewelry, and any other tools that you will handle during the piercing process. Soak the needle in rubbing alcohol, and then boil it in hot water. Wash your hands with antibacterial soap, and then put on latex gloves. Do not touch anything that has not been sterilized.


Change the gloves every time you touch your nose. Put on a fresh pair of gloves just before you do the actual piercing.

, Use a sharpie to make a small dot on your skin where you want the stud to go. Look in the mirror and make sure that it's right. If the mark is too low or too high, wash it away and adjust it. Draw and redraw the mark until you are completely satisfied.

, Dab a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol, then wipe down the area that you plan to pierce. Watch out for your eyes: the alcohol will sting.


Consider using an ice cube to make the area numb. Hold the ice against your nostril for up to three minutes, until you can't feel the tissue. Be aware that this might make your skin tighten up, which could make it more difficult to pierce.

, If you have a piercing clamp, tighten it so that it secures the area that you plan to pierce. Consider buying a clamp if you don't have one already. The clamp should hold the space open so that you don't poke the inside of your nose or your finger.

, Take a deep breath before beginning. If you are shaking, take a moment to relax and find your center. Take solace in the fact that a nose piercing is relatively simple, as piercings go. There is not much skin or fat to pierce in your nose, so the procedure is straightforward and the pain is relatively minimal., Look in the mirror, and line up the needle with the dot that you marked. Take a breath, and then do it quickly. Push the needle in perpendicular to the surface of your skin, and take care to slide straight through the tissue. You will feel pain, but it will be temporary.Remember: the more quickly you perform the piercing, the more quickly it will be over.
Try not to poke the inside of your nostril. If you are piercing the side of your nostril, you don't want to push too deep – or it will be more painful.

, It's essential that you're quick about it. The wound will begin to heal as soon as you remove the needle, meaning that the hole will begin to close. You want the hole to heal around your jewelry so that it's a natural fit. If you wait too long, you will have pierced your skin for nothing!

, Use a sterile saline solution, a 50/50 water-and-soap solution, or hydrogen peroxide. Twice a day, saturate a Q-Tip or cotton swab with the cleaning solution, then let it soak into the pierced area for a few minutes. Wipe your piercing from inside and outside your nose. If you've given yourself a nose ring, rotate it slightly each time you clean it.If you are especially worried about infection, it's okay to clean the piercing as often as every few hours. Avoid cleaning too often, however, if you're using a particularly harsh cleaning agent.
Repeat this process every day until the piercing heals. Your nose will be swollen and sore for a few days after the job, but it should feel normal before the week is over. Be aware that the piercing may take as long as 3-4 months to completely ""heal"".
Be aware that hydrogen peroxide may disrupt scarless wound healing. Many piercing professionals advocate the use of this chemical as a cleaning agent, but you should be aware of the risks., Always wash your hands before handling the piercing, and clean it regularly. If you are fastidious about cleaning the piercing, and you were careful to sterilize all of your equipment, you shouldn't need to worry. If, however, your piercing is still red and painful a week later, there's a chance that the wound has become infected. Seek medical advice before it gets worse.Consider using antibiotics like Neosporin and antibacterial soap to protect the wound. These products can seriously reduce the risk of inflammation. If you don't clean your piercing regularly, you may need to use heavy-duty prescription antibiotics – which can be costly and questionable for your health.

, If you take it out for longer than a few hours, there's a chance that the hole will close up. The skin of your nostril heals very quickly, and you might have to pierce it again if the stud no longer fits. Leave your stud in for at least three months before changing it out with something else.

, If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask around at your local piercing parlor. Although you didn't get your piercing done there, they will probably be willing to give you advice if you ask nicely. If you have any medical concerns, don't hesitate to visit your doctor.

You can only pierce the upper or lower lip of your outie, not the actual outie., Slide the piercing clamp over the outie lip and pinch down. The clamp should fit snuggly and securely on the part of the lip you are going to pierce. If it’s not secure, your piercing might not turn out right., Swiftly and forcefully push the needle through the clamped spot that you marked. Don’t hesitate or go slow, as this will complicate the piercing and make it more painful.Once the needle has penetrated the skin of the lip, quickly pull it out.

, Insert the jewelry immediately after you remove the piercing needle from the lip of your belly button. The longer you wait, the bigger the chance that the piercing will close. After the jewelry is in, take care to secure it so it doesn’t fall out., After your initial piercing, you should clean the site of the piercing (and the jewelry) twice a day for a month. You can use saline solution to do this. To do this, fill a small cup with the solution and place the cup against your stomach near the piercing. Do your best submerge the piercing in the saline solution. Then, take Q-tips moistened with the solution, and clean around your entire navel.

If submerging the piercing does not work, you can squirt the solution onto the piercing., Watch the wound very carefully for a month after piercing. This is important, as belly piercings can easily become infected. If you notice prolonged redness, yellow/green discharge, a foul smell, swelling, or see red lines emanating outward from the wound, you should see a medical professional. These could be signs of infection or even an allergic reaction to the jewelry., Since outies stick out more than normal, you’ll need to take some steps to avoid snagging your piercing on your clothes. The easiest way to do this is to wear loose clothes and low cut pants. This is important, as snagging your piercing could cause tissue damage and expose you to the danger of infection., The should look like a piece of raised skin around the belly button. It may be limited to the area above or below the belly button. If you have this raised skin, you may be able to pierce it with minimal risk.You cannot pierce the actual skin of your outie.

, While you think you may have enough skin to pierce your outie, you need to confer with someone who does piercings professionally. Since they regularly do navel piercings, they’ll know if your outie can be safely pierced., Since the tissue of an outie belly button is different than the tissue of an innie, outie belly buttons are much more susceptible to infection. As a result, you should consult your doctor before getting a piercing.

If you have any autoimmune disorder or conditions that make you more susceptible to infection, your doctor may advise against piercings."

Piercing your ears at home results in a higher chance of infection. Professional establishments have far more experience with both the practice of piercing and sanitation procedures. As your forward helix is a more painful piercing, you will want someone else to do it.If you do decide to go with a professional, make sure that they use proper sanitation procedures. Most establishments will have photo books of piercings they’ve done. Check them out to make sure this is the piercing for you. Now is not the time to go for the cheapest option or to rush. Pick a place you feel comfortable with.;
, The last thing you want to do is pierce your ear, but forget to have earrings ready. If you don’t have an earring ready to put in your freshly pierced ears, the hole will close on itself. You’ll have to wait for it to heal and then pierce it again. The best thing for a pierced forward helix is a barbell stud. 16 or 17 gauge and about 10mm long (3/8"") is a good size. This size leaves room for the swelling that will occur after piercing.

, If you decide to do it yourself, be sure to get a proper piercing needle. Piercing needles have a hollow center so you can easily slip your earring through your ear once you make a hole with the needle. You can buy piercing needles online or from local stores that perform piercings.Do not share needles with other people as this could lead to infection.
Make sure to use a needle that is at least one gauge bigger than the earring that you plan to wear. Many places use 18 gauge needles for forward helix piercings.
There are piercing packages for sale, which normally comes with two piercing earrings that have been loaded into a spring puncher. You can purchase these online or at beauty supply stores. Follow the directions as closely as you can.
Avoid piercing earrings. Some locations sell earrings with sharp needles affixed to them. These are used for piercing, but should not be used to pierce your forward helix. The cartilage in your helix is far too thick for these piercing earrings to work properly.
Be careful. Some people have allergies to certain kinds of metals — mainly nickel and gold-plated materials. If you have the money, spring for a higher quality metal like silver or titanium.

, Sterilization is key. If you don’t sterilize your needle, this will lead to infections, which normally means removing your piercing, treating the infection, allowing your ear to heal up, before piercing the spot again. There are several ways that you can sterilize your needle. Your needle should come in a sterilized package. If so, then you can use it immediately. Just make sure that it doesn’t come into contact with anything after you remove it from its package.


If you are using a non-factory sealed sterilized needle, sterilize it over an open flame. Hold it there until the tip becomes red hot.
Wear sterile latex gloves while sterilizing your instruments, so you don’t get germs on the needle after sterilizing it.
Wipe the needle clean with 10%+ rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. This will kill 99% of the germs on the needle.You could also sterilize the needle with boiling water. Boil water and place the needle in it for 5 to 10 minutes. The hot water will kill off most of the germs on the needle. Remove it with tongs and only hold it with sterile latex gloves. Be careful, the needle will be hot for a minute or two., Use pre-packaged 70% isopropyl alcohol swabs. Wipe repeatedly and dab dry with a cloth.You can also use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol to sterilize your ear.
Brush your hair out of the way as well. Your hair is covered in dust, grease, and germs. Take precautions to keep your hair away from the piercing site once it has been cleaned. If possible, tie your hair up and away from your ear. Use bobby pins to hold in place.

, Take a non-toxic pen and put a dot where you want the piercing to be. If you’re not sure, rub the dot off and try again. Get it exactly right. You don’t want your piercing to be too close to the edge of your forward helix or too far from it, which would make the piercing harder to see. Get it right in the center of your helix.


Take into account other piercings as well. You’ll want them to be evenly spaced.

, During the piercing process, you’ll need to pick up and lay down several needles, sterilization equipment, and your earring. You want to pick a spot that is clean so you don’t add unwanted bacteria to the process. Clean your bathroom. Lay down a towel or paper towel and place your tools on it after you’ve cleaned them.

, You need to have something against your ear so that you can push the needle through your ear without puncturing other parts of your ear. A wad of toilet paper or a cork are both good choices.If possible, don’t pierce your forward helix yourself or by yourself. Have a friend help you with the piercing. The forward helix, in particular, is difficult to get to, especially if you are looking in the mirror. This whole process is much easier to do when you have someone there to help you.

, You might consider taking a single Advil or other pain reliever a half hour before piercing your forward helix. If you can tough out the pain, do not take the pain reliever as it will increase blood flow to the spot and possibly cause more bleeding during the actual piercing.

, It should be perpendicular to your forward helix to ensure that it goes in straight.

, Don't stop midway through your helix as it prolongs the process and the pain. You will hear a popping noise when the needle goes in. This is normal., After you've pierced your forward helix and the needle is still in place, take the shaft of the earring into the hollow tube of the needle and then push it all the way through the ear. It is important to get the earring in place as soon as possible, before your ear begins to swell.


Most likely, your ear will start to bleed. Dab the blood away with a cotton ball covered in hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol. Alternatively, you can use an alcohol swabs. Do not wipe up the blood with anything that hasn’t been properly sterilized or might lead to infection.

, The most important part of this step is to make sure your earring stays in place as you pull out the tool. Many people find this part equally painful as the initial piercing, so they rush it. Keep the earring in place and slowly remove the tool.

, Do not take your earring out for any reason other than sheer discomfort. If you take your earring out of your forward helix, it will close up and you won’t be able to put the earring back in. After 6 weeks, you can take it out, but you should replace it within a couple of minutes. Most of the time, healing will occur from 4 months to 1 year after initial piercing and largely depends on the person, blood flow to the area, and ability to keep the piercing clean and free from infection., Make a warm salt water solution in a bowl just big enough for your ear to be completely submerged in. Take 1 tsp of sea salt and dissolve in 1 cup of warm (not hot) water. Sea salt works better than normal table salt. The salt fights infection in the piercing. Do not use Epsom salt; it has a different chemical makeup and is not actually salt.Dipping a cotton bud/Q-tip in the warm salt water solution and rubbing it around and against the piercing can also do the trick.Buy antiseptic solutions specifically made for newly pierced ears. You can buy them at beauty stores and pharmacies. Dip a cotton ball in the solution and rub gently around the piercing. Make sure to clean both sides of the piercing as well to insure that it remains free of harmful bacteria.

, When you are cleaning the earring, rotate it to both clean as much of the shaft as possible and to prevent your ear from healing to tightly around the piercing., Put the new earrings in immediately after taking the original earring out and cleaning the hole. Your piercing has not yet fully healed, but has reached a point where the earring can be replaced.

, In the event that you think you have an infection, see a doctor promptly. It is possible that they can give you something to fight the infection and you might be able to keep the earring. If you go too long without receiving medical attention, you will probably have to remove the earring while it heals.

Wash hands for about thirty seconds, rubbing hands together vigorously. Thoroughly rinse soap from hands with warm water, and dry hands using a clean towel or paper towels., Soak a q-tip or sterile gauze in warm water. Apply the damp tool to both ends of the piercing to dampen the site, softening the openings., These balls hold the jewelry in place, and are typically screwed or snapped in place. Wearing rubber gloves or using a piece of sterile gauze will help you keep control of these small, slick objects. Clean and store the balls in a container. Some jewelry comes with its own storage box, but a plastic storage bag or other container will also work., Apply a small amount of water-based lubricant or neutral pH soap to either end of the ring or bar piercing. Gently move the eyebrow jewelry back and forth to spread lubricant into the piercing. Take extra care if there are threads at one or both ends where the balls attach., Gently pull the jewelry from the piercing, and place it in a disinfectant or salt water solution to cleanse it. Then, place the jewelry in the container with the balls., Once you’ve removed the existing jewelry, use soap and water, witch hazel, or saline contact solution to clean the piercing site by soaking a q-tip or gauze in one of these cleansers and applying it to the piercing., Using water-based lubricant or soap and water, coat the ring or post of your replacement jewelry.

Don’t attach too tightly or using pliers as this makes removal more difficult., Soak q-tips or gauze in warm water, and apply to the piercing site to remove lubricant. If your piercing feels swollen or inflamed following the placement of new jewelry, you may also want to place a steeped chamomile tea bag onto the piercing site to reduce swelling and discomfort., In most cases, the person who pierces your eyebrow will discuss the various gauges available, and make a recommendation based on the appearance you desire. Make note of the gauge you choose, and don’t hesitate to follow up with your piercer to make sure you have the right size before buying new jewelry., You may be tempted to choose a smaller gauge or if you’re planning to expand the piercing, a much larger gauge, but this can actually be detrimental to the healing process. Choose jewelry that is no more than 1/8 of an inch larger or smaller for best results.


Smaller jewelry may cause pulling or tearing. You may believe that exchanging your current jewelry for one of a smaller gauge will be more comfortable, but actually, it may cause a number of concerns. The piercing may shrink too quickly causing additional scar tissue, or the piercing may move around too easily snagging or tearing the piercing.
Carefully choose jewelry of slightly larger gauge to expand piercings. If you’re planning to expand your piercing, make sure you’ve discussed this with your piercer prior to the placement of your initial jewelry, and ask for recommendations on the next gauge size you should use., Most piercers are happy to exchange your jewelry for a minimal fee or no cost at all, especially if you buy your new jewelry from their shop. Most piercers will also walk you through the process, so you’re able to confidently complete the process on your own."

While you're busy printing, market the heck out of your publication.,
Send out the magazines!",How to Self Publish a Magazine," Don't kid yourself. Creating and self-publishing a magazine can end up being an expensive task, both mentally and financially. Research is required!


Is there a magazine currently in circulation that is already providing similar content?
What makes it a winner?
What makes it a loser?
How will your magazine be better?
Or, will your magazine be absolutely the only one of its kind reaching your target demographic?
What is your target demographic looking for in a magazine?
What other magazines are targeting the same demographic?
From which can you learn the successes?
From which can you learn the failures?;
, Realistically. We know your circulation will be one million copies by the end of the first year, and your profit margin will be 85%. But, let's pretend, just for fun, that you might have a few hiccups along the way.


What are your printing options versus your budget?
How many pages need to be color, and how many can be black and white?
What is your circulation target?
What are your circulation and distribution options?
Is sponsorship an option?
Is it possible to secure advertisers for your first run before going to press?

, You need to know exactly who your target demographic is. Without knowing this, it will be difficult to properly layout your magazine content, market your magazine, or secure serious advertisers. Assuming you know quite a lot about your magazine's subject, this shouldn't be too difficult. Sign up for discussion groups (such as Yahoo), subscribe to other magazines, join local groups, etc.

, Before you get the word out about your new endeavor, you MUST publish a website. Work to make the site as professional as possible. Don't advertise the fact that this is a one-person gig.


On your site, you should have a page for contributors. This allows you to mark deadlines, point out what sorts of articles you'd like to receive, and let writers know how you'll be using their work. List your pay rates and what rights you intend to purchase.
You should also have a way for people to subscribe online, if at all possible. Paypal is a good way to do this, at least when you're just starting out. If you don't want to take subscription orders online, make sure your address is easy to find and note what forms of payment you DO take. If you accept checks or money orders, you'll need to get a DBA (doing business as) so that your bank will accept checks made out to your magazine name.

, Post a ""call for submissions"" to your newfound groups. Try to get your notice on a few high traffic blogs. If you're looking for more general articles, try posting your notice at the local library. Consider placing a classified ad in magazines with a cross-over audience. A call for submissions will not only net you articles; it will drum up anticipation for your new publication. Don't forget to point people to your website!

, Since your magazine isn't established, you might consider charging a nominal amount for ads ($20-$50). Consider who might want to advertise in your publication, and don't be squeamish about contacting them. Be bold. You might look for members of your online discussion groups who place business links in their signatures.

, Once you're armed with a binder full of possible articles, choose the most interesting, best-written pieces of the bunch, and grab your red pen. Try not to be too heavy-handed. Writers will submit more often to an editor who doesn't mangle their work.

, You don't necessarily have to wait for them to approve all changes, but allow them to question or challenge any editorial decisions you've made.

, Professionals use desktop publishing (DTP) software such as QuarkXPress (the industry standard), Adobe InDesign (or the older version, PageMaker) but Scribus and even word processors (which can handle layout) such as OpenOffice.org Writer are free. Get to know your layout program inside and out. Look at other magazines for design tips. You might also check out books devoted to the subject. Have the authors sent you photos to run with their work? Do you have photos of your own? If not, consider purchasing stock photos (easily found on the Internet). Buying a bundle of cheap stock photos may be the best purchase you ever make.

, Printers' prices vary greatly, so plan on spending some time asking around and getting samples. Look for one that will do laser, rather than off-set, printing. This will save you TONS of money.

, Duplexing will prove to be the most important feature of the printer. If you put some time into your search, you should be able to find a good printer for a few hundred dollars. This should be sufficient for the inside pages. The cover should still be done at a print shop, if at all possible.

, Online groups, other magazines, blogs (consider starting your own), MySpace, Google's AdWords, etc.

, Keeping a database of subscribers might only need a spreadsheet program such as Excel or the free OpenOffice.org Calc but a dedicated database program is better. Make sure to talk with your post office about the best way to send out your new publication. They'll have great, time-tested ideas and may be able to save you quite a bit in postage costs.

Begin forming ideas.,
Don't worry about errors; you can correct your writing later.,
Set daily writing goals.,
Stay diligent.,
Get early feedback.,
Categorize your book.,
Recheck and re-edit your story.,
Get an editor to look over your book.,
Do a final check to make sure you’re ready to publish.,
Consider getting an agent.,
Research different publishers.,
Narrow your publishing options.,
Consider self-publishing online.,
Wait and stay patient.",How to Write and Publish a Book," Write some of these ideas down. Afterward, select the ones you want.


Some people are able to start writing with only one sentence for inspiration. Others spend months or years thinking about a story before putting a single word down.
Whichever type of writer you are is fine. The trick is following an idea down the proverbial rabbit hole.
Stephen King, a famous author has noted that he doesn’t write ideas down in a notebook. To him “A writer’s notebook is the best way in the world to immortalize bad ideas.” This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t write ideas down in a notebook you carry around. If that works for you, grab a notebook and jot your ideas down. But be cautious about which ideas you do write down. Ask yourself, if you didn’t write this idea down, would it be good enough to remember tomorrow?
Once you find inspiration for an idea you want to pursue, start writing.;
, You get the best stories by continuing on and not looking at the screen, obsessing over every little error. If you keep looking at the screen, chances are you will want to change everything right away instead of continuing on with the story.


When writing a book, and hoping to get it published, you will write many drafts before it’s ready to send out. Some of those drafts will probably include major changes to your story. But at the beginning, you’re just trying to build a world and get your ideas on paper, or your screen.
Focus on building your characters. Some books are plot heavy, and that’s ok. But a book that people typically want to read is really about the characters and the importance of the situation you put those characters in.
While the plot moves a story along, it’s the moments between characters that sell a book. Whether you’re writing a fantasy like Harry Potter, or a strict novel like Freedom, by Jonathan Franzen.
Focus on the “Who” you are writing about. The “When” “What” “Where” “Why” and “How” will come more naturally. , There should not be a limit on how much you can write a day but create a minimum. It will help you focus on the story.


Whether you set a goal of 300 words a day, or a goal of one hour, doing so will help you stay on track. 300 words a day isn’t much but can be a great starting place. If you’re new to writing, or very busy, give yourself a smaller goal which you can easily meet.
Large goals are much harder to meet and will often cause you to not write at all. You are taking one step at a time, and at the end, you will have arrived at your large, final goal.
You can increase your daily goal as you continue along, or if you have more free time to write. Just make sure you can stick to it. Even if you feel stuck in your writing, press on and reach your goal. You never know when you’ll get some inspiration.
Work in a quiet or empty place. Finding a quiet place where you can focus, and which you can make yours is invaluable to writing. Even if you write at a coffee shop, find a corner where you won’t be too distracted.

, Many writers start out strong but quickly become distracted, frustrated with the slow process, or bored. One of the simplest and best ways to prevent this is to simply put yourself in the chair.


Following and reaching your daily goal will help you stay on course. The act of sitting in your chair and chiseling away will help you make reaching that goal a reality.
Try to have a set time to write every day in addition to a daily goal. John Grisham has published many best-selling books, and he started his writing career while he was a lawyer. He got up early every morning and wrote one page.
Make writing a habit you can’t quit. Find that unique place to write and do it every day at the same time.

, Even though you may be protective of your work and want to keep it hidden until “it’s ready”, don’t. Get frequent and early feedback on your writing from people you trust to be honest with you.


If you’re not part of one already, consider joining a local writer’s workshop. These groups will help you flesh out your ideas, give you feedback, and keep you accountable.
Use the internet. If you’re nervous about showing someone you know your work, find an online forum where you can get feedback and bounce ideas back and forth. Places like /r/Writing on Reddit.com offer options for you to get help on your work. , Once you finish your story, make sure it follows the guidelines which publishers Allen and Unwin follow:


Junior fiction

For beginner readers, aged 5-8, word length 5,000-10,000
For confident readers, aged 7-10, word length 10,000-30,000
For middle readers, aged 11-14, word length 30,000-55,000


Young adult novels

For teenage readers, aged 13-16, word length 40,000-60,000
For mature teenage and older readers, aged 15+, word length 40,000-100,000


For a total list and for more information and writing and publishing, go to ""Submission Guidelines"" on the Allen and Unwin website. , Don’t feel like you have to stop looking at your story at a certain point. Edit as many times as you need to.


While you do need to edit and give the editing process as much attention as, if not more than the actual writing, you also need a break. You’ve been living inside this story you’ve created and now it’s time for a vacation. Giving yourself time will help you get into the editing mindset. Because, as the editor, you have to look at your work with a cold eye, ready to chop up it up and make changes.
When you do start editing, edit as much as you need to, but don't keep editing if you don't know what the problem is. If you don’t have a concrete solution, you’ll chop up your story and have no idea how to put it back together.
Over-editing is possible and dangerous, so get others to check your work. Another pair of eyes can spot gaps that you overlooked because you’re so close to your work.
Get someone you trust to give you notes and feedback. So far, you’ve been operating in a vacuum. There will be parts that need work that will be hard for you find on your own.
Read others’ notes, and then put the notes away. You probably won’t like what someone else’s notes are. So read the notes, decompress, and after some time go back and incorporate the ones which are helpful. Discard the ones which aren’t.

, After you’ve made a pass, or several at your book, it’s time to get a real editor to look at your work. Editing is not the same as writing. You will need someone who knows how to deconstruct a book, find the issues, and give you advice on how to put it back together. A professional editor is especially valuable if you’re going to self-publish. The last thing you want is a glaring, yet silly, spelling error in your book after all of your hard work.
The right editor will be able to bring clarity and flow to your narrative without changing your voice. Your editor will bring a much needed objective eye to your work and will help you not only fix those small errors but help you find the true story underneath all the extra stuff you don’t need.
An editor will also, at the end of the day, make your book look professional.

, After you and your editor have revised your book to its final form, make sure everything is in order.


Make sure you have a good title you’re ready to stick with.
Start building buzz on social media. Create a Facebook page and Twitter profile for your book. Post frequently with updates about what’s going on, next steps, and other exciting information.

, Agents are people who will work for you and help you get your book published and sold. These people have industry contacts to help you. Agents are also elusive and not easy to get a hold of if you’re new. You won’t always need an agent. If you plan to go the self-publishing route, you may find that an agent is something you can do without.
Look for agents on sites like PublishersMarketplace.com. Here you can search many profiles and see what kinds of work are getting published. Make sure to read over the agent’s submission guidelines before you submit your materials. You will most commonly need:

Query Letter. A one-page pitch letter that describes your work.
Book Synopsis. A brief summary of your story.
Nonfiction proposal (if you’re writing for nonfiction). This is a very detailed document, usually around twenty to thirty pages, that outlines your argument for why your book deserves to be published. Sample chapters, or your whole manuscript.



, You may choose to self-publish, but getting published by a big name publisher is better for getting a larger audience. Some publishers only choose to publish or even read solicited material, manuscripts which have gone through an agent.
Agents and publishers also like material which either comes from already known authors or writers. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t attract the attention of either. These people will want to see that you have a following, and are being self-promotional on social media.
Some publishers such as Penguin or Allen & Unwin will also look at your manuscript if you aren’t represented by an agent.
Check out self-publishing options. Self-publishing might sound like a way to circumvent a bunch of people who will just say “no” to you. But it’s hard work, and the reason there are people who publish books is because these people know how to best do it. If you’re going to self-publish, you have to find a good distributor if you’re going to publish hard copies. You can also self-publish your story as an ebook through Amazon’s self-publishing site. , Once you have decided on a few publishers (the more the better), start researching these publishers more in-depth.


Some choose to publish for adults only and in selected genres while others may have a wider range of books that are accepted.
All information should be available on the publisher’s websites. Some have different guidelines and word limits, or whether your book need be solicited or not.
Almost all publishers require a hard copy (printed) manuscript of your story. Also, keep in mind the specifications. Some publishers prefer double spaced lines, with a certain type of font in a certain size, etc.
Stick to what is specified. Do not send emailed copies or ones on a disc, unless stated you may.
Never send in your original or only copy of anything. You will not get your materials back.

, Self-publishing an ebook is a viable and popular option. The biggest opportunity for this method is Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing. You can simply upload your manuscript to the program and begin to sell copies.


The KDP service is free to use, however, Amazon will keep up to 70% of your profits.
If you are self-publishing online, make sure that you have gotten your book edited professionally and have had the cover designed by a professional graphic designer.
All the work of promoting your book will also fall on you when you use this method.
Be realistic. You’re most likely not going to become the next breakout hit with your first book. You won’t gain fame overnight. It takes several books and many years to gain a solid reputation in most cases.

, Send your copies to all available publishers that you can.


It may take up to four months or more, to get your book reviewed.
If you get a “yes” from a publisher, well done! You get to see it in the stores! However, the publisher may not advertise it for you. That will fall to an agent. The good news is getting an agent after you have a book deal is easier. But remember, that in most cases, the advertising usually falls on you.

If you have a lot of clutter, your right brain will tend to feel cluttered and hence prevent you from thinking clearly. Although some writers write better this way, it's rare. Also think about the color scheme. Your color scheme may change depending on your mood and what you write so don't make anything permanent. Maybe use colored paper or pens, place colored objects on your desk, hang a colorful curtain, use colored lights...the possibilities are endless!

, Do you prefer paper and pen or computer? Big leather chairs or wooden ones? Think about what you want your body feeling and doing as you write. If you want lots of sensations then try writing on paper and sitting in a comfortable chair. If you want your mind more stimulated than your body, use a computer.

, Perhaps if you're writing about a bakery you want a vanilla pound cake candle burning next to you. If you like to smell things to make your descriptions crisp and accurate, then think about different scents. If you don't like scents then try to write in an area with clean, fresh air. But if you want to be surrounded by good scents and the like, go to a coffee shop, burn scented candles, or even use incense.

, Lots of the time writers feel the need to eat when they get stuck in their writing so be careful about how much you eat! Think also about what you're eating. Caffeine, chocolate, or candy are common choices but only leave you hyper, making it hard to think. Try drinking herbal teas or eating fruits or veggies to give you the real energy you need to write.

, A notebook and pen or a computer are required for any writing. If you need other supplies, such as ink, keep those handy, too. If you refer to a dictionary, thesaurus, style guide, or other reference material, keep them close. You may also wish to keep favorite books nearby for inspiration. If you can include them without cluttering up the space, objects of personal significance, whether whimsical, sentimental, or spiritual, can also help to get you in the frame of mind for writing.

Success in business books
Books that establish the credited author as a subject-matter expert;
, Many ghostwriters are not great writers, but they are good writers who know how to structure a book effectively. You'll need to show that you can write better than the person who's considering you as a ghostwriter for the project.


Having clips of something you've previously published to show clients will lend you credibility. If you haven't been previously published, showing a good sample of unpublished writing relevant to the book project is the next best thing.

, Much of the preliminary work as a ghostwriter involves hours of interviewing the subject. You'll need to learn to ask the right questions and ask them effectively.

, Depending on the nature of the project, you may have to interview people associated with your subject, consult works published within the historical period associated with your project or pore through reams of correspondence. Expect to immerse yourself in your work.

, No matter what ideas you may have for the project, it is still your client's work and should be structured to your client's tastes and expressed in your client's voice. If it helps, think of yourself as an actor taking on a role.

, Depending on the work, your client may provide you with access to confidential materials or extremely personal information. You need to be able to maintain client confidentiality as a ghostwriter and to assure your client that information given off the record stays off the record.

, Putting the issues in writing before starting protects both the ghostwriter and the client. Some issues to consider:


Duties: Who is responsible for what and when it is supposed to be done.
Compensation: How the ghostwriter is to be paid while working on the project.
Credit: Typically, the client will be listed as author. The ghostwriter may be credited as co-author, ""as told to,"" in the dedication or not at all. Ghostwriters may want additional compensation for the lack of credit, or they may accept less compensation to have the credit for the hope of future work.
Copyright ownership: Typically, the client will want the rights to the book; however, if ownership of the rights is not addressed in writing, the default is that the collaborators share it equally, which could cause problems if the contract is cancelled and both parties wish to pursue it with other collaborators.

Many writers find that they are most productive and imaginative right when they get up in the morning. Find out what time of the day works for you and set aside time during that period to write.
Don't forget to read while you write. Reading is the superfood that keeps writers nourished. Set aside time during your day, if you haven't already, to seriously engage with books and the ideas in them.;
, Self publishing takes a lot of initiative and drive. Remember that it is your passion for getting the book out to the public that will carry you through the frustrations you will most certainly encounter along the way. That being said, self-publishing can be an exciting and profitable venture. It is kind of fun to self-publish your book in the internet.

, Decide if self publishing is the right choice for you. Talk to a few publishing companies and compare cost to benefit ratio. List the reasons why you want to self-publish your book, and get an estimate on how much it will cost; cover art, editing and formatting can all be quite expensive. Determine whether the reason you're publishing is strong enough to outweigh the cost, and providing that it does, keep going.


A breakdown of the rough costsof self-publishing may look like this:

Formatting: $0 (DIY) - $150 and beyond, although you shouldn't be spending lots of money here.
Cover art design: $0 (DIY) - $1,000. Know that if you opt for an e-book creation business, they'll likely just use stock photos.
Editing: $0 (DIY) - $3,000 for ""developmental"" (substantive) editing. Many first-time publishers expect to pay around $500 for a combination of proofreading and copyediting.



, Make sure that it is complete, well-edited, and thoroughly proofread. You might give a manuscript out to a few trusted friends who will give you valuable feedback, and talk with you about facts, or motivations for the characters, or other minutiae about your book.


If you're part of a writing community or a frequent participant on a forum, consider using that forum as a source of free (or relatively free) advice. Forums feature dedicated fans who are inspired to help other people along the way, and for whom proofing might be a huge source of pride.
Proofing often takes several go-arounds until all the errors, formatting mistakes, and stylistic boo-boos are wrinkled out. Especially if you are relying on someone's free services, it could take two or three read-throughs to get the book proofed. Even then, don't expect it to be flawless.

, Hire a good one that will give you the best feedback and improve your work relative to how much they cost. Decide on whether you need developmental editing or copyediting. Developmental editing is where large swaths of the book are changed, new themes are introduced, and characters are smoothed out, in addition to humdrum mistake-finding. Copyediting is largely the humdrum mistake-finding; is more about toying with what's already there instead of creating something entirely new.

, If you haven't done so already, create a title that will pull people in. The title of your book can sway people to buy your book — or not. For example, ""The Guided Consumption of Bacterium-injected Milk Byproducts and Apidaen Excretions"" does not sound nearly as appealing as ""The Delicious Delight of Gorgonzola and Honey.""

, Unless you are an artist and can do it yourself, hire a professional. They will be quick, and will help your book have visual appeal.


This is especially important if it's on a shelf at the book store. Expect to pay not just for the cover art, but also for the spine and back cover as well, which will cost extra. If you're going through all this, however, it makes sense to have the very best presentation you can have.

, Though submitting your work to the copyright office is the safest and best way, you can claim copyright by stating it explicitly, in a prominent location.Most self-publishing sites will provide the copyright language. For example, in the credits page, or back cover, adding ©20--, Ima Nauther, all rights reserved to declare the work your own, is sufficient. Follow up by visiting the government's copyright page and filling out the requisite forms.

, An ISBN number is a 13 digit code used to easily identify and track your book. Many self-publishing sites will provide one for you, but if you plan on publishing entirely by your own, you should acquire one for yourself. You will need this so that your books can be listed in the Bowker database where bookstores pick up latest books for retailing.


You can buy an ISBN direct from ISBN but beware, a single ISBN is $125.ISBNs also come in bundles if you're trying to be economical. 10 ISBNs cost $250, 100 cost $575 and 1000 cost $1000.
You will need an ISBN for each format the book will be in: .prc (kindle), .epub (Kobo and others), etc.

, Shop around and get quotes. Prices will vary depending on the quality of the paper, the binding, and colors. Your price per book will be lower the more copies you print. Consider about 500 to 2000 copies.

, The advantages of publishing through a website include:


Little overhead; the costs that go into writing and editing the book are the same costs that go into publishing it. Making an e-book doesn't cost much extra.
If you hit it big, you hit it big. E-book publishers such as Kindle Direct Publishing let the author keep 70% of the total revenue of the book, meaning that if your book blows up and you price it competitively, you could be in for a windfall.You keep all of your rights. You don't have to give up your rights to a publisher who may not have your best interests in mind.

, The disadvantages of publishing through a website include:


You're responsible for all the marketing and advertising yourself. The publisher won't market or advertise for you, usually.
Competitive pricing. E-books can cost as little as cents, meaning that you'll have to sell a lot of books in order to make publishing profitable over the long term.

, Online publishers such as Smashwords, Kindle Direct Publishing, PubIt (Barnes & Noble), or Kobo's Writing Life will let you self publish your book for free in e-book format.

, You will need this to upload your book and manage all the details involved. Many of these format from familiar word processing programs, or you can hire someone to format the document for you.

, Once you finish the categories listed by the website, choose to finish publishing and your book is printed. You are now a published author!

, POD is where you submit an electronic copy of your book and have a vendor print the book for you. The vendors usually try to distribute your book to other sellers (such as Barnes & Noble), but often they just offer the book online.

, The advantages of publishing POD include:


Having a physical copy of the book, which is potentially valuable as a marketing tool.
Leaving the physical printing of the book to a vendor, who handles all the production.
Having a source that will distribute your book to perhaps major sellers worldwide.

, The disadvantages of publishing POD include:


POD publishing costs more money. You may have a physical copy of the book by the end, but your production costs will skyrocket compared to e-books.
You have to format the book to the vendor's specifications, which are sometimes idiosyncratic. Each vendor will have a list of formatting specs that you need to meet before submitting your book.
Not as much marketing and distribution as you might think. Vendors may help market and distribute your book, but not as much as you might think. Often, POD vendors simply place the book online to sell, and you're responsible for any major marketing and distribution.

, There are plenty of POD vendors out there for struggling writers who want a physical copy of their book, but who have very little in the way of money. Some services include Lulu, Lighning Source or Createspace.

, The formatting could be different from website to website, so be prepared for some potentially confusing directions. Once you've formatted the book and submitted it to the vendor, they should take care of the rest of the process.

, Vanity presses are a pejorative term for smaller-scale publishing houses in which authors have to pay to have their works published. Mainstream publishers have to recoup money by selling copies of books; vanity presses recoup money by fees that the author has to pay him or herself. Vanity presses are typically a lot less selective than mainstream publishers and therefore confer far less prestige.

, That is, unless the author has an overwhelming desire to publish and cannot publish using another method. Vanity presses market themselves as traditional or subsidy publishers, but charge high fees and do very little or no marketing/distribution for you. They don't make selections for the most part, and take whatever comes their way.


The single advantage of going through a vanity press is seeing a physical copy of your book out there. POD should give you the same result, however, and so many serious authors shy away from vanity presses like the plague.

, Subsidy publishers are nearly identical to vanity presses. They are not as selective as traditional publishers, but work in a similar manner in that they reject manuscripts often. However, they charge the author for binding and publishing; the upside is that they contribute to marketing and distribution, and publish under their name. Authors tend to have limited control over design and such, although they could receive royalties.

Consider publishing through a partnership.,
Understand how to publish through a service provider.,
Use a distributor.,
Weigh the pros and cons of self publishing.",How to Get Published1," When you go the traditional publishing route, the publisher pays you for the right to publish your work. Traditional publishers assume all costs and pay the author an advance and royalties on all sales of the work.To get a traditional publisher, you will need to persuade a publisher to accept your work and offer you a contract.
A traditional publisher takes on the financial risk of publishing the work. They can also offer you marketing and publicity expertise.
Going the traditional route gives you access to mainstream exposure. But it is competitive in the traditional publishing world. Sometimes successful DIY or self published authors can negotiate better deals without a publisher.;
, In this option, the author partners with a literary agent, a publisher, or an author collective.The author does not have to pay a fee to the partner, but usually does not get an advance.
As well, the partner will need to select the author and be able to offer marketing savvy and industry expertise to the author.
A partnership is beneficial because it is less risky than self publishing. The author also gets better royalties in a partnership. It also frees up the author from having to deal with the administrative side of publishing. This then gives the author more time to focus on creative work.
Not all partners will offer the same thing to an author, so shop around. Always have a legal representative look over a partnership contract before signing it.
Examples of partnership publishers includes: Rogue Reader, Diversion Books, and Cool Gus Publishing.

, This means the author pays upfront for a package of services and the service provider only does the work the author pays for. As well, all work is usually accepted by the service provider, as long as the author can pay for the service.Usually, an author can make more royalties if they go through a service provider. Examples of service providers include: Author Solutions, Infinity Publishing, and Outskirts Publishing.
But, you get what you pay for, so you may get a published product that does not have much commercial value. Your book may be available for order through bookstores, but rarely stocked on the shelves in the store.
These books are usually considered of lower quality in the publishing world. Most self published success stories do not originate from publishing through these service providers.

, If you publish your work through a distributor, you will have to do the majority of the administrative work on your own. You will need to hire a book designer, find a good copy editor, and do all the administrative work. You would then provide the distributor with the final files of the book and they would proceed with the publication.The distributor may charge an upfront fee and/or take a cut of the sales, but they are responsible for paying the authors.
Using a distributor can also save you the headache of managing many retailers (or book sellers). The author is also not bound by a contract to the distributor, so they are not giving up their royalty rights.
Use distribution service providers. Such as: Smashwords (e-books), BabyBook (e-books), eBookPartnership.com, and Blurb (full color books).

, Self publishing, or DIY direct, means the author does all the work on their own. They then hire any outside help like a book designer or an editor. Self publishers will also need to provide retailers (book sellers) with finished, ready to go files or books.Keep in mind the retailer will take a cut of the sales, but the author is not exclusive to a publisher. This means the author can deal with each retailer on an individual basis.
Self publishing allows the author to maximize their earnings from the sale of the books. This also allows the author to get the highest percentage of sales. The author retains complete freedom over the work so they can adjust or edit it on the fly, and can control the pricing of the book.
But, self publishing can become a full time job if the author is aiming for high profit and high quality. As well, Amazon and Apple need you to be exclusive to them if you are going to use their services to self publish.

Edit.",How to Publish a Children's Book," Although some forms of self-publishing are cheap, successfully self- publishing a children's book isn't. This is because to reach your audience, you're almost invariably going to have to publish actual paper books – most kids don't rely on e-readers for their daily dose of Richard Scary and Roald Dahl. Furthermore, the children's book market is extremely competitive, and profit margins tend to be small even for successful books.

, A traditional small vanity press is usually the best choice to self-publish your children's book, since it's important to have physical copies on hand for promotion. Vanity presses charge you money to print a set number of copies of your book, typically between 50 and a few hundred, and then print and ship them directly to you. Alternatively, you can choose a print-on-demand service, which will print one copy every time a copy is ordered, and charge you for each one. These are easily found online. Shop around and compare prices and feature packages to find one you like.


Color is expensive. Expect to pay a lot more for a picture book than you would for a chapter book without pictures, or with black-and-white pictures.

, Now that you have a printing service lined up, you'll need to find some way to pay them to print copies of your book. (Even if you choose a print-on-demand service, you should print at least 20 copies of the book for yourself to show to stores and other customers.) Start by asking your friends and family to donate a small amount, and plan to match the total with some of your savings. Offer them a copy of the book once it's printed, in return for their generosity.


Other popular options include starting a Kickstarter fund or taking a second job one or two days a week.
There's a decent rundown of other fundraising methods in this wikiHow.


, Once you've paid the press to print and send you some books, it's time to beat the pavement. Start with local independent bookstores. Show the owner your book and ask if you can sell it on his or her shelf space for a commission. Ask larger bookstores as well, but don't expect to always get a positive response. Offer to do book readings at stores that carry your book. This is a good way to drum up business for both you and the owner, so most who've agreed to carry your book should agree to a reading as well.


Once bookstores have been covered, talk to libraries. Donate a copy of your book to each branch, and ask the head librarian if there's any way you could stage a reading at your local branch.
Consider schools. Elementary schools are a good way to get your book into the hands of local children, but it's unlikely you'll be able to simply waltz in and read to a class. Instead, speak with the librarian about donating a copy, and then speak to school administrators about possibly staging a reading event. If they say no, don't press the issue.
Sell online. Be sure to set up at least a small website or Facebook page to promote your book. People who are interested in it should be able to easily order a copy from there. It also provides a neat way for parents to get more information about you and your book before buying.

, You already have a manuscript, so the logical next step is to submit it to publishers. Unfortunately, many publishing houses won't look twice at your book without the solicitation of a literary agent. In exchange for a commission on your earnings (usually 15%), an agent will critique your manuscript, promote it to publishers, and negotiate a contract for payment.


It can take time to find a good agent who'll work with you if you haven't been published yet, and there are plenty of bad agents and scammers in the game. Be careful, and only work with agents who are recommended by trustworthy sources. Some of the best places to find agents worth your time include:


Guide to Literary Agents, a book published every year by Writer's Digest Books

Literary Marketplace, a yearly book available in the research section of most libraries

The Association of Author's Representatives (AAR).



, If you decide not to hire an agent, you'll need to scour sources for publishers who accept unsolicited manuscripts for children's books. Thoroughly review the latest edition of the Children's Writers and Illustrators Market, and note every publisher who seems to fall into the appropriate category.


Pay special attention to published guidelines and tips for submissions. Many publishers won't even bother reading a manuscript that doesn't conform to its submission guidelines. If you can't find the details you need, send an e-mail or a self-addressed stamped envelope to the publisher and request submission guidelines.
Find children's books that are similar to yours in content and audience and make note of the companies that published those books. They may be more likely to look at your manuscript favorably.

, Submit to each agent or publisher according to their specific guidelines. Follow the formatting requirements exactly as described. Expect to hear back from the agencies and publishers you submit to within three months of submission. If you haven't heard from the by then, chances are you never will.


Unless you are a professional illustrator, do not send illustrations. Publishers typically choose their own to avoid potential copyright issues. If you're dead set on including your own illustrations in the book, it's best to go through an agent, who'll be able to make a stronger argument to publishers than you can.

, Keep copying manuscripts and sending them out. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Many authors got rejected upwards of 50 times before their first books were published. Rejection isn't a wake-up call; it's a normal part of the submission process. Eventually, either someone will offer you a contract, or you'll run out of people to submit to. Don't stop until that point.


When you get offered a contract, do research to be sure it's a fair one. If you have an agent, he or she will take care of this step for you; otherwise, consider hiring an expert to consult with you for an hour or two about the contract and whether or not it's worth entering.
If you've been rejected hundreds of times and agents aren't showing any interest, it may be time to up your game. Join a community writing workshop, or read a book about how to write a great children's story. You might find that one or two simple style mistakes have been preventing your book from getting the attention it deserves.

, This, of course, is imperative for publishing any form of literature. Have a browse in major bookstores, or online; find out what is selling and what is popular for children at present. How does what you've written compare? Is it similar, or entirely different? Are you following familiar themes or doing something very new? This will give you an idea on where you will stand in the current market, and how and where to target your book.

, It is not as simple to aim books at children as it is at adults. Think carefully about what age group you are aiming your children's book at. Is it very simple? Is it a little more complex and for slightly older children? Is your work designed to be read aloud by a parent or teacher, or can the child read it to themselves?

, Many people will tell you that for younger children, the typeface should always be large, or enlargeable on a Kindle, so it is easier for them to read. You might even want to think about the size of the book itself, if you are planning to publish it in print. Famous children's writer Beatrix Potter deliberately had small books printed so they would fit in the hands of very young children.


Children's books are all about the illustration. Pictures are vital for telling a children's story, and, some would argue, even more important than the words. If you are not an artist yourself, get an illustrator. Children, especially the very young, are very visual. They will understand and enjoy the story more if there are pictures.







, When editing, pay attention to the language you have used. Children's stories must follow a simple structure, with a clear beginning, middle and end. Think deeply about the language you use to tell the story. Most of it should be very basic, but don't be afraid to throw the occasional longer word in there too; this will serve an educational purpose as well as sparking interest in the child. Also, think about what level of literacy your target age group are likely to currently be learning in school, and try to incorporate it into your story. Do some research into the current curriculum if need be.

Reach out to book clubs.",How to Advertise a Book on a Budget2," Book readings and signings are a great way to advertise your book. This is often an affordable option because having the event brings business to the location where it’s held. Think outside the box and contact coffee shops and cozy restaurants in addition to local libraries and bookstores. Prioritize readings over signings because they have a better ability to attract people’s attention quickly.Capture people’s interest by giving a little back story before you give the actual reading. Share how you were inspired to write on the topic at hand and talk a little about your writing process.
If you struggle to set up readings and signings at local businesses, consider having a friend host a book party in their home. This is a free option that is also smaller and more intimate, which may work in your favor.

, Getting shelf space can be tough, so be open to different locations. Head into book stores, public libraries, school libraries, and even retail stores that carry products where your book might fit in. Politely ask to talk to the person in charge of inventory to see if the store would have an interest in selling your book.


Look into consigning your book if stores aren’t buying it up front. Consigning allows you to get reimbursed by the retailer as people buy your book. If your book hasn’t sold after a few months, you can just go to the store and get back whatever copies are left., Use a websites like Vistaprint.com and pick from different types of cardstock and add text or even upload your own business card layout.After you’re done designing, select a quantity to order. Then, type in your payment information and address to have the cards delivered to your home for a reasonable price. By doing this, you’ll always have a professional-looking marketing material to give out to friends, relatives, bookstores, libraries, and anyone else who shows interest in your book., Posters and fliers are a great way to spread the word about readings that you’re having, or to just display your book’s title for all to see. Think about who your target audience is and sketch out some drafts to decide between different text and graphics options. Get permission from the desired location’s owner or representative to pass out or display your fliers or posters there.


If your book is a children’s book, you might consider trying to hang posters on walls of elementary and middle school libraries.
Once it’s time to print or photocopy a finished product, get quotes from multiple printing shops to ensure that you pay the least amount possible for their services., Call, email, or fax the producers of radio shows with a helpful and informative interview pitch. When trying to get your foot in the door, impress the producer with your expertise by giving a quick summary of the book and explaining why it contains information that’s useful and interesting to listeners.Beforehand, find out how long the interview will be and prepare what you’d like to say during the interview.


When you’re on the air, remember to have an open or smiling face while you talk, keep it conversational, and thank the host at the end., Find book clubs online through websites like meetup.com and at local libraries and community centers. Book clubs are full of reading enthusiasts who are more likely to want to interact with you as an author."
"
Start networking early.,
Set specific goals for yourself and focus on meeting them.,
Keep writing.",How to Advertise a Book on a Budget3," It takes time to establish relationships with people. If possible, start reaching out to people about your project years in advance. By sending occasional emails to reviewers and potential buyers you’ve connected with, you can build connections that will make the promotion process much smoother when your book is finished. While it’s a slower process, trying to sell to one already interested person at a time is much more effective than try to sell to faceless thousands., Write down a list of clear goals that you’d like to accomplish, pick dates to accomplish them by, and brainstorm ways that you can make them happen.


As you’re nearing the end of the writing process, you might set a goal to finish the book and have it ready for editing in three weeks. You can reach this deadline by estimating how many hours of writing it will require each day, and committing to putting the work in.
Later in the process, you may set a goal to sell fifty more books within the next month. In order to make this happen, you can commit to reading a book on how to improve your salesmanship skills and put what you learn into practice., Getting your book recognized on a large scale is possible, but it will take a lot of time and consistency. Instead of putting all of your effort into promoting the book you just finished, spend some time starting your new one. Continue doing what you do best to work towards becoming an established author with a growing platform."

Prepare a polished manuscript if you are writing a novel or a memoir.,
Complete a book proposal if you are working on a nonfiction manuscript.,
Research the traditional publishing market.,
Consider the commercial viability of your book.,
Decide if you need a literary agent.,
Prepare your submission to the publisher.,
Work hard on your query letter.,
Gauge the responses to your query letters.,
Keep querying and don’t give up.",How to Get Published2," Before you look for a publisher or an agent, make sure you have a final manuscript to shop around. It is rare for first time authors without a strong publishing track record to sell a novel or memoir based on an idea or proposal.Many writers have great story ideas or a partial manuscript. But it almost never a good idea to pitch your work to a publishing professional when your manuscript is still at an early stage.
Seek out a writing critique group or mentor who can offer constructive feedback to help you revise and edit your work.
Its important to be confident and happy with the final manuscript before you submit it for publication. So don’t rush into publishing your work until you feel it is at its best state.

, This will help to convince a publisher to contract you to write the book.To create a book proposal, research the market for your idea. Build a business case for why your book will sell and why you are the best person to write it.
Research other comparable titles or writers who examine the same topic or issue. Make sure your take on the material is unique but doesn’t break all the rules of the genre. Avoid confusing the potential audience for the book.

, Familiarize yourself with the Big Five publishers, as well as mid-size and small presses. Look up the titles listed on the websites for these publishers to get a sense of the type of writing and content they publish.The Big Five are the major book publishers in the United States. They are: Penguin, HarperCollins, Hachette, Macmillan, and Simon & Schuster. All five publishers have their headquarters in New York City.Mid size publishers like Tin Houseand Graywolf Pressare great smaller publishers.
Another great resource is PublishersMarketplace.com, which announces upcoming book deals. This resource can also help you get a sense of what the current landscape of commercial publishing looks like.

, Commercial viability means how valuable your book may be to certain audiences. Some books are “big” books that work well for the Big Five traditional publishers. Other books are “quiet” books that work well for mid-size and small presses. Its important to remember that not every book is a good fit for a New York publisher. To find the right fit for your work, you need to be honest about your work’s potential.The Big Five usually publish genre writing. Such as: romance, mystery/crime, thriller, fiction, fantasy, and young adult.
Usually, a New York publisher will only sign a nonfiction book if they expect to sell at least 10,000-20,000 copies.
The Big Five may have a harder time selling books like exceed 120,000 words, depending on the genre. They also rarely publish poetry, short stories or essay collections. Unless the author is a known writer or has a solid audience base.
The Big Five also might not accept memoirs with common story lines that do not have a unique angle to the story. They also may not be as open to literary and experimental fiction.
If your work doesn’t seem like a good candidate for a New York house, don’t despair. There are many mid-size publishers and small presses that might show interest in your work.

, In today’s market, literary agents sell about 80 percent of the books acquired by New York publishers. These agents act as experts in the publishing industry and have inside contacts with specific editors.They also know better than writers what an editor or publisher would be most likely to show interest in or buy. If you want to publish with one of the major New York houses, you will likely need an agent.
An agent should negotiate the best deal for you and ensure you get paid. They should also be the go between you and the publishers. The best agents are career advisers and managers. Usually, agents only get paid when they sell your work. They receive a 15% commission on your advance and your royalties.
When looking for an agent, it's a good idea to make a long list of possible agents. Rank the agents based on the ones you want to work with the most and the ones you would settle for. To find a list of literary agents, look at Writers Market, Publishers Marketplace, and Agent Query.Avoid agents who charge fees. Agents take on clients based on the size of the advance they think the publishers might offer for a book.
If you are writing for a niche market (e.g. soccer moms, vintage cars) or have an academic or literary work, you may not need an agent. As well, if your work does not command a sizable advance, at least 5 figures, you may not be worth the agent’s time.

, The most common materials you will need are:


A query letter: a 1-page pitch letter that gives a brief description of your work.
A novel synopsis: a brief summary, usually no more than 1-2 pages of your story, from beginning to end. If it is a synopsis of a novel, it must reveal the ending.Nonfiction book proposal: usually rather long, complex documents, about 20-30 pages.A novel proposal: this usually refers to your query letter, a synopsis, and perhaps a first chapter. Keep in mind there is not an industry standard definition of a “novel proposal”. The publisher should explain their expectations of a novel proposal.
Sample chapters: send sample chapters from the beginning of your novel or memoir. Don’t select a middle chapter, even if you think its your best. For nonfiction, usually any chapter is acceptable.

, The query letter is a time-honored tool for writers seeking publication. It is like a sales letter that tries to persuade an editor or agent to request a full manuscript or proposal. You need to seduce the editor or agent into loving your work through a well written query letter. Make sure your query letter includes:Personalization: customize the letter for the recipient. If you are sending a letter to a big New York publisher, you should be formal and use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
What you’re selling: explain the genre/category of your work, give a work count, and the title of the work.
A hook: what will keep the editor or agent engaged in the letter, and by extension, your work? Keep the hook 100-200 words long for a novel query. Introduce the protagonist, their conflict and the stakes of the story (or the choices the protagonist has to make). Always include a detail that will get your reader to care about the story enough to request a manuscript.
Your bio: this is sometimes optional for uncredited fiction writers. Keep it short and sweet.
A thank you and closing statement.
The blog Query Shark, run by literary agent Janet Reid, offers feedback and critiques on query letters. It also has an archive of over 200 real query letters. Look at examples to get a sense of query letters that work and letters that miss the mark., You will likely get one of three responses back:No response at all: usually means a rejection from the editor or agent. But you can re-send the query letter just to be sure. If you receive no requests from any editors or agents for more pages of your work, you may need to revise your query letter.
A request for a partial manuscript and maybe a synopsis.
A request for the full manuscript. If you get a rejection once the editor or agent reads more pages, there may be issues in your manuscript or proposal.

, Some authors get rejected hundreds of times before they finally get a request for more material or sign on to a publisher. So, if you have put years of time and effort into a project, don’t abandon it after the first rejection.Instead, look at your rejection slips for patterns about what’s not working. Rejections can work as lessons to improve your writing. Getting rejected can also help you reconsider the editors and publishers you are querying.
Keep in mind some manuscripts need time to develop. There may not be a market for the story or there may not be a way to revise the work to make it more successful.
Most authors don’t sell their first manuscript. But they might sell their second, third, or fourth manuscript. Every manuscript, and every draft you write, can only make you a better writer."
"
Determine if your genre has a big online audience.,
Keep in mind e-publishing retailers and distributors are not publishers.,
Upload the completed manuscript as a PDF to the distributor’s site.,
Don’t expect fast or easy money in self-publishing.,
Promote your work and maintain an active online presence.",How to Get Published3," E-books are becoming a popular option for writers tired of rejection who still want to see their work published. But e-books are just that: books published on an online platform. So the author will not be able to hold a physical copy of the book in their hands or see a physical copy of the book in a bookstore.Some genres, like thriller, romance, or erotica, have a large online audience of readers. Check if it is common for authors in your genre to release e-books. If digital only publishers exist in your genre, this is a good sign there are online readers for your genre.
An author who is successful at self-publishing should have an entrepreneurial spirit. They should also have an active online presence and an established author website.
Unlike traditional publishing, self publishing sales will snowball or grow over time. So it’s important to be patient and be willing to promote your work online all the time.

, This means e-publishers take no responsibility for the quality of your work, but they also do not own any rights to your work.


If a traditional publisher shows interest after you have published as an e-book, you can still sell the rights to your work.
This also means you have to find an audience for your work on your own. You are also responsible for all aspects of publishing a book, from editing to design to marketing.

, Most distributors will offer easy to use options to customize the look of your book, from font size to cover art. You can also create your own cover art in Photoshop.The self publisher will send you a book proof within a few weeks.
Even after you publish the book, you can make changes to the cover and the text by submitting new PDFs to the distributor. Most distributors charge a fee of $25-$50 for uploading a new cover or new interior.

, Though the e-publishing process may take no more than a few days to complete, you likely won't earn a lot of money on sales. There is a continual stream of new self published titles available online every day, many of which are low quality.In fact, the average self published book sells about 100-150 copies.

, Now that you’re a published author online, it’s important you promote your work as much as possible. Write posts about your book on forums, on social media, and on your blog.


Remember, you will have to act as your own marketing guru. You will need to commit to growing your readership and drawing attention to your work.

"
"
Be professional and polite to agents, editors, and publishers.,
Be aware of the difficulties of publishing a hybrid work.,
Attend writers conferences.,
Create quality work and keep writing.",How to Get Published4," Never call an agent or editor to query or ask questions if you are not one of their clients. You need to earn a spot on their radar through a great query letter and quality work.As well, do not visit them at their offices in New York or go knocking on doors. Agents, editors, and publishers could consider this unprofessional or rude.
Its important to remember publishing is a business, like Hollywood or Broadway. The publishing industry will support authors and work that will make money and provide a good return on investment. In the current age, this return investment needs to happen fast, usually with one book and in less than one year.

, A hybrid work combines several genres or styles of writing like essays, stories, and poetry. But it can be difficult to get a hybrid work published in the traditional way, as it does not fall into a single, salable category.In fact, even novelists and memoirists often get more rejections than acceptances. But it’s important to persevere and not be too discouraged by rejection.

, These conferences are a great way to meet editors and agents in a professional setting. You can also determine which publishers might be a good fit for your work.Do some research before attending a conference. Select a conference that allows you to meet with a specific author, editor, or agent that is ideal for your work.
Discuss the possibility of a critique session with the chosen editor. Make an appointment with them to discuss your work.
Attending writers conferences shows you want to be part of the writing community. It also shows you are not afraid to put yourself out there to promote your work. You’ll be far more attractive to publishers if they believe you’ll be an active marketer and promoter of your book.

, The quality of your writing matters more than a perfect query letter or the right cover design.Read other authors who relate to your work. Continue to practice your craft through many drafts and redrafts.
Your writing can only get better with time. Once you achieve quality in your work, your letter of acceptance from an agent or publisher will likely follow.

Avoid some common cartooning mistakes.,
Never stop practicing.,
Read other successful cartoons.,
Don't give up.",How to Publish a Comic Strip3," Although you are free to create your comic in a way that you feel is best, there are some common mistakes that cartoonists can make. Avoiding these mistakes will help boost your chances of getting your comic published.

Get yourself organized.,
Use the outline as a subject guide.,
Have the ghostwriter/editor perform extensive research to see what other people have to say about your subject.,
Search for possible publishers.,
Have the ghostwriter/editor compile a chapter outline with rough copy ideas sketched in for you.,
Go through the chapter outline and give your ghostwriter/editor your thoughts.,
Go through the rough draft(s) and mark your corrections.,
Approve the final draft, page design and cover design.,
Obtain price estimates for publication.,
Send the final book package to the printer with the check.,
Pay the printer's final invoice and the printer ships the books to you.

",How to Produce a Book Using a Ghostwriter," You and your ghostwriter/editor will need to determine together what kind of book you want. You must decide on the size and the approximate length and sketch out a basic outline.;
, Compile more information following the outline, including any articles, brochures or other marketing pieces you can find that cover the topics you want included in the book. Use a file folder for each topic or chapter. Send these ideas to your ghostwriter/editor. This can also work if you decide to find other professionals to contribute chapters to your book.

, This search is vital because it will provide you with an idea that publication of the book is worthwhile; it shows that you're not just a person with a wild idea. Get references from peers in the field that you are writing in. Two things are important here:


The references must be recent;
They must be sources your target market will respect.

, The internet or the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature at the library both afford you access to hundreds of credible journals and publications.

, He or she will ask you some questions along the way and send you some page layout ideas and layout ideas for the cover.

, Drawing from the information, research and outline, your ghostwriter/editor produces a rough draft of your book. Typically, that is done in sections. (This is also a good time to submit articles to magazines your target market reads and/or respects.)

, Your ghostwriter/editor will include your corrections and deliver a final draft to you.

, The ghostwriter/editor transfers the final version into the desktop publishing program for the printer. It's important that you understand this step. The printer will not print your book from a word processing program like WordPerfect or Microsoft Word. All book printers work with publishing programs like Quark XPress and Aldus PageMaker.

, Once your ghostwriter/editor knows what the cover will look like and exactly how many pages you're going to have, get print estimates and determine which printer to use. (This is probably a good time to start sending news releases to local media, like newspapers, radio and TV stations).

, The printer sends your ghostwriter/editor the ""blue lines"" for approval. ""Blue lines"" show exactly what the type will look like. Both of you should approve them. The printer lets your ghostwriter/editor know what the final charges are. That's determined by the exact number of copies printed and if there were any unanticipated print production charges.

How you organize your writing submissions with binders will depend on the type and length of your writing endeavors. Tailor the following system to your situation.
Standard binders are approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm). For larger, multi-volume submissions, you may need larger binders. For durability, choose vinyl or non-paper binders.;
,,, Depending on your specific kind of writing, these subsections can include agents, magazines, online publications, current clients, potential clients, and/or publishing houses.

, The dossier should include the most current contact information and detailed guidelines for submissions, queries, or completed projects. Technical writers should also include any stylistic guidelines specific to their clients.

,


Keep the queries, submissions, writing samples, or completed projects in this binder ordered chronologically. Anything with an upcoming deadline should appear first in the binder.

, On the first of every month, rearrange so the current month is the first month seen when the binder is opened.

,


The contents of this folder should be clearly marked with the date of submission as well as the anticipated waiting period for a response. If the client said responses would be issued in 6 to 8 weeks, wait 8 weeks until sending a follow-up. Refer to your binder of publishing house dossiers to remind yourself of specific waiting periods.
If a publisher, magazine, agent, or client has rejected your submission, query, or project, keep the rejection slip. If you submit a new piece at a later date, refer to any suggestions or hints they offered for future success.
Keeping rejection slips serves as a reminder not to send multiple submissions to the same company.

,,


Organize writing submissions that have been accepted into 2 subsections. The first subsection should include writing submissions that require additional changes or work before final approval. The second subsection should include writing submissions that have been accepted as is.

Don’t drown your snail.,

Wash your hands or wear gloves.",How to Wash a Pet Garden Snail's Shell," Each of these tools has their own merits, and which tool you choose depends on what kind of cleaning your snail’s shell needs. No matter what tool you use, make sure that it’s unused and free of any chemicals or detergents.If you need to do more specific, detailed work, the cotton swab is the best choice.
If you want need to do a more genera wipe-down of the snail’s entire shell, a soft cloth or thick tissue will be best.
If your snail’s shell has algae or other material that you need to scrub off, a soft-bristled toothbrush might be your best choice.;
, You’ll hold your garden snail in the palm of your non-dominant, and then you’ll use your cloth, soft-bristled toothbrush, or cotton swab with your dominant hand. Make sure to hold your snail in the palm of your hand and in a good position so that no water gets inside the shell.You can entice your snail to walk on to your hand by putting your finger flat near its head or by placing a small bit of food in the palm of your hand.

, A snail is a mollusk, which means that your garden snail is a delicate invertebrate that relies on its shell for protection. And while snail shells have firm outer layers, the inner layers have varying softness, porousness, and flexibility, and the shell is not one solid, thick, indestructible structure. Take care to handle your snail gently, never pressing down on their shell, because the shell can easily crack.It’s a good idea to never pick your snail up with your fingers, instead just let them walk on to your hand.

, Cleaning algae and other debris from your snail’s shell will likely improve its health and overall quality of life. Consider that snails like to eat decaying food, which is full of bacteria, which you’ll need to remove regularly. Use the cloth, tissue, cotton swab, or soft-bristled toothbrush to wipe the shell and remove dirt and droppings off of it.Don’t use soap or detergents.
Make sure you get everything off, including cleaning the underside of the shell.
Hold your snail in the palm of your hand non-dominant hand while cleaning with the dominant hand., You need to rinse your snail off, possibly more than once, to make sure that the shell is clean and to remove any debris that you dislodged. Pour water on the shell while holding the snail over a bowl. Or, if you’re uncomfortable with pouring water over your snail’s shell, simply fill a new, clean spray bottle with purified water and spray the shell.Garden snails are land snails, meaning they aren’t able to breathe under water. Take care that you don’t pour water over your snail’s head. Remember, you’re only cleaning the shell.
Do not put water in the snail’s shell as your snail could drown.
Let the shell air dry.

, Garden snails love to eat plants, vegetables, fruits, and algae, and any of these make a great snack. Whichever snack you choose to reward your snail, keep the treat small so that you don’t overfeed your pet. Occasionally, garden snails even like a small drop of beer.Snails are naturally attracted to foods that are high in calcium, because they need the mineral to build their shells.
Collard greens, kale, spinach, leeks, butternut squash, broccoli, and artichokes are all great sources of calcium., You’ll clean your snail over a bowl so that you can catch the water that falls off of them, and, more importantly, so that they have a specific space in which to land should you accidentally drop the snail. Protect the snail’s fall by filling the bowl with dry substrate, the same that you use in their tank, which will give a soft landing if your snail should fall., You will need to rinse your snail with water several times in the cleaning process – twice at the minimum, but likely more. Land snails, such as garden snails, can drown fairly easily, and you cannot under any circumstances put them under water. A great way to avoid any risks of drowning is to use a spray bottle to apply water to your snail’s shell rather than pouring water over them.A spray bottle filled with warm, not hot, water will give you better precision when applying water to your snail’s shell.

, When you pick up your snail, use a spray bottle filled with warm water to gently mist the snail. Your goal isn’t to lubricate the snail, but simply to encourage it to move. More domesticated snails may not need this stimulation. Put your finger down in front of the snail’s path so that it climbs on to your finger or hand.Never pull a snail up by its shell. Snail’s create suction and you could seriously injure the animal by pulling on it.
You also want to avoid handling snails by their shells because you run the risk of applying too much pressure and cracking their protective shell.

, Any time you touch your snail, wash your hands afterward, and consider wearing gloves when you bathe your snail. Never let a child touch a snail unattended, either, as they may forget to wash their hands before touching their face, eyes, nose, or mouth. Snails can pass along a host of potentially threatening issues, such as salmonella, parasites, like those that cause meningitis, and other bacteria.Snails make great pets, but you do need to take necessary sanitary precautions when handling your pet.
If you handle your snail without gloves, make sure that you don’t have lotion or perfume on your hands, which could be harmful to the animal.

Submit a piece to a literary journal.,
Find an appropriate academic journal.,
Decide where to submit a personal essay.,
Propose an op-ed article.,
Research the publication.",How to Submit Articles to Publications1," There are many different types of publications. Where you submit your piece will depend on what type of article you have written. If you write fiction, you will want to submit your article to a literary journal.Start by doing your research. Use the internet to search for literary journals.
Look at the website for each journal. Browse some of the past issues. This will give you a good idea of what types of articles that particular journal publishes.
Head to the library. Ask the reference librarian to help you find a complete list of literary journals. Make sure that the journal you are interested in accepts unsolicited submissions.;
, If you are a scholar, your article will usually be best placed in an academic journal. These publications are typically categorized very specifically by topic. They also generally require a very rigorous review process.Make sure that your research fits the scope of the journal. For example, if you are a scholar of European history, do not submit your article to a journal that focuses solely on East Asian history.
Verify that the publication is peer-reviewed. This means that other scholars will review your work.
Be aware that it may take a while to receive an answer from the editor. The review process for academic journals can often take several months.

, A personal essay is non-fiction. It can be a story about your own experiences. The most effective personal essays are ones that many different types of people can relate to.There are several different types of publications that publish personal essays. Make sure to choose one who's readers might be interested in your story.
Many newspapers publish personal essays in the magazine section of the paper. Major papers such as The Boston Globe and The New York Times publish these types of pieces.
You might also consider submitting your essay to an online magazine. Popular publications such as Slate and Salon offer their readers essays on a wide variety of topics.
Send a pitch to the appropriate editor. For example, if you want to write an essay about politics, send an e-mail to the editor at Slate who works on political topics.

, An op-ed is an opinion piece. It differs from a personal essay, which might just be telling a story. With an op-ed, you are taking a definitive stance on an issue and trying to persuade readers that you are correct.Op-ed pieces are typically fairly brief. A common op-ed is usually between 400-1200 words.
Most newspapers accept op-ed pieces on a variety of topics. You can find specific guidelines on the newspaper's website.
Make your piece topical. If your op-ed is timely, it will have a better chance of being published. For example, a piece about veterans services might be appropriate to submit around Memorial Day.

, You want to make sure that your work appears in a reputable publication. For example, you don't want to publish in a journal or magazine that has a reputation for publishing sub-par material. Do some research before submitting your pitch or article.Try to avoid predatory publications. These are journals who charge exorbitant author fees and will publish almost anything.
Academics often feel pressure to publish regularly. It's important not to be lured by promises of publication in exchange for high fees. These publications typically do not have rigorous standards.
Fiction writers can also find magazines that will publish in exchange for money. These publications are typically not highly regarded. If you are asked for money before your article appears, consider whether this is the right venue for your work.
Some publications that charge author fees are reputable. If you feel a fee is appropriate, make sure that you pay it using the specified method.

Go out.,
Consider your book title.,
Don't rush to the computer the first time you have an idea.,
Start to write!,
Go out again.,
Remember that when you're writing, you can be who you want to be each day.",How to Start Writing a Book and Stick to It," To start a book you need to be out. Being out and about stimulates your mind and creates ideas you wouldn't be able to think about if you were sat at a desk. Whether you're on the train, on a walk or even talking to a friend. You might want to take a notebook with you wherever you go - take a very small one, as you never know when any phrases or titles may come up.;
, A great many people start a book and think of the title later. Although this may work for some people, some think of a good title - purely randomly, and then know what the story is going to be about. For example if you think up the title 'Sophie's Life' or 'Fly Fishing' you're not going to write a book about a man called Steve who works at a garage. Titles tend to crop up at unusual times but keeping a note can be extremely helpful when it comes to getting a book started.

, A lot of people make this mistake. By rushing to a computer as soon as you've thought of one thing will just end in disappointment when the idea doesn't get off the ground. Instead, write a plan down in a book, gathering ideas, characters and settings before you sit in front of a computer and type. Some of these are irrelevant if your book is non-fiction. Research is more important than thinking of characters if you intend to start, and stick to, writing a non-fiction book.

, When you get to this step you should have a good idea about what you're going to write about. A lot of people say that the start is the most difficult part. Well if you follow the steps above, you should only be sitting in front of your computer when you've got notes, characters and general plot ideas. By this time you'll have so much to write about you won't fall at the first hurdle.

, By this step you should be in full swing. The best way to stick to a book is again to go out! When you're out seeing sights and having fun - even if you're just going to work, it counts as being out - ideas will crop up in the most unusual places! Note down the ideas, and put them into the text you've already written when you are back by your computer. The best way to stick to a book is to keep an open eye out for ideas in general life. The best books contain people's thoughts, emotions and lifestyles, which you are seeing everyday.

, You can wake up each morning with the choice of who you want to be today - and that is one of the best feelings in the world!

Say something original.,
Edit extensively.,
Get some feedback.,
Follow the submission guidelines.",How to Submit Articles to Publications2," Your article should offer some new information or a unique perspective. Editors are looking for a fresh take on a topic that will excite or interest their readers. This is true for fiction and non-fiction.Make it clear why your article is original. For example, if you are writing an academic article, you can emphasize the new sources you've utilized.
In your introduction, highlight the unique aspects of your research. For example, you might say, ""Based on newly declassified sources,...""
If you are submitting a personal essay, explain your point of view. Make it clear to the editor and the readers why your take on the topic is interesting. You could say, ""My experience as a first time mother was different than most because...""

, No matter what type of article you are writing, it is important that you edit your piece very carefully. Editors will not be impressed if you submit an article that is full of errors. You also need to make sure that your article flows coherently.After you produce a first draft, go back and edit for content. Make sure that the points you are trying to make are clear.
Pay attention to organization. Do you make it clear at the beginning what the point of your article is? Is your conclusion thorough? Would reorganization help?
Edit for grammatical/stylistic errors. Make sure that your spell check is set to check style as well as just grammar. Spend time carefully reading each sentence to make sure your piece is error free.

, Sometimes it can be difficult to be objective about your own writing. Or maybe you are just feeling uncertain about your content and you could just use some advice. No matter what you are working on, it can be really useful to get a second opinion.Ask a friend to read your work. Try saying, ""Do you have some time this week to read an article that I'm working on?""
Accept constructive criticism. Don't take it personally if your friend offers you some tips for improvement.
Choose a friend whose opinion you respect. This will make it easier to accept and utilize their feedback.

, During the editing process, it is important to make sure that you understand all of the submission guidelines. The guidelines should be clearly stated on the publication websites. Most journals, magazines, and papers will tell you the precise qualifications for an article.Pay close attention to the guidelines. They are not merely suggestions. Many publications will not read your work if it does not fit the parameters of the guidelines.
Adhere to the length requirements. Most journals will give you a word count for minimum and maximum length.
Format your citations as specified. Some publications prefer endnotes, some require footnotes. Make sure you use whichever system the journal uses.

Deliver your article.,
Keep thorough records.,
Handle a rejection.,
Acknowledge an acceptance.",How to Submit Articles to Publications3," Many times, you will submit a pitch or abstract before you actually submit an article. Check the submission guidelines to see if that is the process for the magazine or journal you are interested in. The editor will often approve your pitch and tell you to write and submit the article.If your pitch is accepted, the editor will often request the article within a specific time frame. Make sure that you submit your article on time.
If you are an academic, your first submission may receive what is called a ""revise and resubmit"". This means that your article shows promise, but needs some revisions.
Submit your revised article in a timely manner. Ask the editor for a clear timeline, and then deliver the article by that deadline.

, Getting an article accepted for publication can be a lengthy process. You will likely have to submit your piece to more than one publication. Make sure to keep track of where you send your work.Write down where you send which article. If you are working on multiple pieces at once, it is helpful to keep track of where you have sent various pieces.
Make note of the date you send each submission. That way, you can have an idea of when you can expect to receive a response.
Maintain records of any communication with the publication. For example, if the editor e-mails you with suggestions for future pieces, you will want to retain that organization.

, As a writer, you have to deal with rejection. Finding an outlet for publication can be difficult, and often takes several attempts. Make sure that you are prepared to handle a ""no"".Do not take it personally. Understand that editors receive more submissions than can be published. Just because your article was not the best fit for that journal does not mean that your work is not good.
Move on. Be ready to send the article on to the next publication on your list. And you should definitely have a list of publications that you would like to submit your work to.
Do not respond. There is no need to follow up on a rejection note. While it might be tempting to express your frustrations, it is better to accept it gracefully and move on.

, If you get an acceptance notification, congratulations! You can immediately reach out to the editor and acknowledge that you have received their notification. E-mail is usually the preferred method of communication.Provide the editor with any information that is requested. You may be asked for contact info., for example.

Pay close attention to your snails and their health.",How to Take Care of an Apple Snail," Before getting your snail, make sure you have the right setup.


The optimal temperature is between 64-84°F (18-29°c).
PH should be between 7-8.;
, It's good to have an aquarium of at least 5 gallons, but if you have a good filter and do regular water changes, you can fit as many as 1 snail per gallon.

, Make sure your fish (if any) cannot fit the snail in its mouth, or it will eat it.

, Put your snails in a bag (if there not in one already) and float it on the top of the tank for a few minutes.

,, Your snails may become inactive from the stress of moving, but once they get used to it they will come out.

, Remember they are omnivores. They eat both plant and animal


They eat any type of wafer or pellets and veggies, such as zucchini, cucumber, spinach, or romaine lettuce.
They can eat floating foods.

, Remember that a male and a female are needed to lay eggs.


Females may lay fertile and un-fertile eggs. They lay 100 - 500 eggs per clutch, though there is a high mortality rate.
The eggs will drown.
Baby snails eat the same and have the same requirements. The most important thing is keep the lid on the tank.

, Your snail will not float if it's dead; however snails do it to travel, or for fun. When your snail is dead, you will get a funky smell  and he will not move.

Choose a healthy-looking snail.,
Recognize the risks of certain varieties.",How to Take Care of an Aquatic Snail," One of the biggest needs your snail will have is adequate food.If your snail doesn't have enough food it will go hungry, but with too much food the water quality will quickly deteriorate.


Most snails enjoy having plants in the tank to graze on. They also eat algae, whether it is found naturally on the tank's walls or provided in the form of store-bought algae wafers.Some snails require other food sources, such as fish food or bottom feeder tablets.
Depending on the species of snail you choose, you may need to feed it every day or just a couple times each week.Some experts recommend feeding aquatic snails as much food as those snails can consume in under three minutes, twice daily.This will require some trial and error, so make adjustments accordingly.
As a general rule, if you provide supplemental food to your snail and it hasn't touched that food in two days, you may be feeding it too much/often. It could also indicate that your snail does not care for that food source, so try different options and gauge your snail's response.Talk to a qualified aquarium expert at your local pet store or at a local college/university to ensure that your snail gets the care it needs.;
, Many municipal water supplies use chemicals like chlorine to treat tap water, which can be deadly to snails (though it's safe for humans to drink). Bottled water will help ensure a safe, neutral water source for your snails, but it can get very costly. Some snail owners with access to an outdoor freshwater source also opt for fresh pond water.Snails need a stable, neutral pH. You can buy pH testing kits at your local pet store, or order them through an online retailer.
If you cannot use bottled water or pond water, you can simply let the tap water you'll be pouring into the tank sit out in an open container for 24 hours. This should allow the residual chemicals to evaporate, leaving behind a safe source of water for your aquarium., If you plan on caring for saltwater snails, you will need to prepare a suitable environment for those snails. Preparing saltwater for marine snails is no different than preparing saltwater for a tank of any other marine creatures, such as saltwater fish or corals. The biggest thing you'll need is a special salt mixture, as household salt cannot be added to water to create a marine environment.Test your tap water for nitrates. You can purchase a water testing kit from your local pet store or through an online retailer.
Use purified water if your tap water is high in nitrates, as this water may not be safe for aquatic invertebrates. Common methods of purifying tap water are reverse osmosis, deionization, and ion exchange.
Purchase an aquarium salt mix from your local pet store or online.
Mix approximately 35 grams of salt mix per liter of water to closely replicate natural sea water.
Consider purchasing a salinity measurement kit to ensure that your salt to water ratios are stable. Most aquarium owners who measure salinity use either a hydrometer (typically the least expensive option), a refractometer, or an electronic salinity meter.

, Some common snail behaviors often result in owners wondering whether the snail is still alive. The best way to care for your snail is to check up on it periodically, especially if you notice it acting strangely.Snails often float to the surface of an aquarium, leading some owners to think that the snail is dead. It's simply got a gas bubble temporarily stuck under its shell, and the problem will resolve itself over time.
Some snails withdraw into their shells, which owners frequently mistake as a sign of death. This is an incorrect assumption.
A dead snail will hang limply outside the shell, while a living snail may retract into the shell.
You can check on your snail by gently pushing against the flap where the shell closes. If the shell remains closed and the snail resists your efforts, it is still alive.

, The size of your tank will largely depend on how big your snail is, how many snails you have, and whether the snails you've chosen are prone to rapid and large-scale reproduction.Do not exceed 20 snails per one gallon tank.If you don't have a full aquarium tank, you can use a clean quart- or gallon-sized container with transparent walls. It's best if you can see your snails to assess their health, so opt for glass or clear plastic containers when choosing an environment.
If using a smaller container, do not exceed three to six snails per quart, depending on their size.
Make sure you have a secure lid for your tank (ideally a screen lid that will allow fresh air to circulate through the aquarium). Some snails are notorious for finding ways to escape from their tanks., The ideal water temperature for freshwater snails is between 72 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 28 degrees Celsius).Many saltwater snails require similar temperature ranges. The bumble bee snail, for example, does best when the water is between 72 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 25 degrees Celsius).Depending on certain environmental factors, like the ambient temperature in your home and the climate you live in, you may need to regulate the aquarium temperature to keep the water within an appropriate range. You can also rearrange the aquarium within your home so that it is in a more stable environment, with an ideal room temperature between 64 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 25 degrees Celsius).Keep the aquarium away from direct sunlight to prevent the water from getting too warm during the day.
Aquarium heaters are available to warm up the water if you live in a cold climate with poor insulation or inadequate heating, or if it gets too cold at night in your home.
You can buy aquarium heaters at most pet stores and through online retailers.

, The bottom of your tank is an important component of a healthy aquarium. Most snails need some type of aquatic plants in the aquarium, which means you'll have to bury the roots in substrate. Many snails also scavenge through the substrate looking for food, so be sure your snail has some type of stable environment available at the bottom of the tank.Sand works best for many varieties of aquatic snail, though some may enjoy digging through gravel.
About one or two inches of substrate should be sufficient for most snails.
Talk to a qualified aquarium expert at your local pet store to find out about the ideal conditions for the type of snail you're interested in.

, Every aquatic creature needs a clean tank. However, snails are particularly sensitive to their environment. They feed off of algae and decaying plant matter, but they also need clean, fresh water. If your aquarium is left unattended, your snail may not survive for long.Check the water on a regular basis to make sure that none of your snails (or any other aquatic organisms living in your tank) have died.
Use a fish net to scoop out any dead organisms from your tank before they begin to decompose.
Any time the water becomes murky/cloudy or starts to smell, you'll need to change the water.

, There are many different varieties of aquatic snail, though the most common varieties you'll encounter are the Gold Inca, mystery, nerite, pond, ramshorn, and trumpet snails. Each one is marked by its own distinct features. Which snail you choose may depend on your aesthetic preferences, your tank's needs, or both.Gold Inca snails are recognizable by their bright, yellow shells. Gold Inca snails are considered good cleaners of freshwater tanks, as they tend to consume algae and detritus.
Ivory snails are identified by their cream-colored shells. Ivory snails are also considered good tank cleaners and ""scavengers"" of freshwater aquariums.
Mystery snails have a shell that tends to vary in appearance, but is usually somewhat dark (though some are ivory), typically with brown accents or stripes. Mystery snails have a tendency to scavenge, but they can also easily escape tanks and will most likely require a secure lid.
Nerite snails come in different shapes, colors, and patterns, depending on the variety of snail. Nerite snails tend to scavenge for algae, but they also burrow into the substrate at the bottom in search of food.
Pond snails are one of the most frequently-encountered unwanted snails. Pond snails tend to travel on aquatic plants and in aquarium water, often inadvertently making their way home from the pet store to a new home.
Ramshorn snails have a shell that appears to twist and curl, much like the horn on the head of a ram (hence the name). Ramshorn snails are good scavengers, but like pond snails they often end up in home aquariums by accident.
Trumpet snails tend to have elongated and cone-shaped shells. Trumpet snails are excellent scavengers, but like pond snails and ramshorn snails, they often appear without invitation in new aquariums due to their ability to sneak in on freshwater plants.

, Saltwater snails are also a popular addition to many marine tanks. They tend to eat algae and plant matter just like freshwater snails do, but some snails are carnivorous. They also tend to be more colorful than their freshwater counterparts. For this reason, many aquarium enthusiasts prefer saltwater snails for their home tanks. Which snail you choose will largely depend on your personal aesthetics and your home aquarium setup.


Bumble bee snails are carnivorous invertebrates. They typically eat meat-based detritus, including decomposing organisms in the tank, and have been known to eat other snails in the tank when food is scarce.Cerith snails are easy to care for and can help improve oxygenation within the substrate of an aquarium. They scavenge for algae, detritus, leftover food, and fish waste.Nassarius snails eat detritus, leftover food, decaying plant material, and fish wastes. They are excellent at keeping aquariums clean as they typically seek out a lot of food within the tank.Turbo snails are generally easy to care for and tend to be very colorful. They come in a number of varieties, including Astraea turbo snails and chestnut turbo snails, and they tend to feed on algae and dried seaweed flakes., If you're new to keeping aquatic snails, you may be uncertain about what to look for while selecting a snail. Avoid any snail that exhibits a loss of color, a lack of appetite, an inability to move/exert energy, a tendency to hide inside its shell, or visible spots or other types of fungus anywhere on the body or mouth, as these snails are most likely ill or carrying parasites.When you choose a snail, look for the following signs of good health:


active movement within the water
a healthy appetite for whatever type of food that snail prefers
consistent/evenly-distributed coloring
a clean shell

, It's important to be aware of the risks that come with certain varieties of aquatic snails. Some varieties are considered ""pests,"" appearing unexpectedly and reproducing on a large scale. These population booms can reduce oxygen content in the water, increase the levels of carbon dioxide, and create a great deal of organic waste through their excrement and eventual decomposition.When choosing aquatic snails, it's best to select snail varieties that are not generally considered pests by aquarium owners.Ramshorn snails are considered one of the biggest pest varieties. These snails reproduce quickly and in very large numbers.
Pond snails and trumpet snails are also considered pests by many aquarium owners, though some owners select these snails for aesthetic reasons.
Talk to an aquarium expert at your local pet store if you're not sure whether a particular variety of snail might become a pest in your tank.

Stand in front of your seat as close as you can.,
Put your knees together.,
Ease down gently.,
Smooth your skirt under you.,
Decide how to place your feet.,
Angle your legs.,
Sit up straight.,
Place your hands in your lap.",How to Sit Like a Lady1," By starting out close to the chair, you will have less work to do and are much less likely to expose yourself or miss your mark and fall.


At most formal functions, it is customary for a gentleman to help you be seated. He will pull out your chair, wait for you to stand in front of it, and then nudge the chair forward to touch the back of your legs. This is sometimes done by your date, a waiter, or another man seated nearby.;
, Make sure both your knees and most of your legs are lined up and squeezed next to each other. One leg should not be in front of the other. By sitting down with your legs together, you will keep your undergarments from showing, no matter how short your skirt may be.

, Do not bend forward; make sure to keep your torso straight. Keeping your knees together, sit down smoothly by bending your knees. Your calves will naturally tilt forward, which is a position you will want to hold.


Try not to use your hands for balance. Keep your arms either straight down or slightly bent at the elbow.

, If you are wearing a skirt or dress, it may have become rumpled while you sat down. Sitting will also have raised its hemline. If you don't want your skirt looking rumpled or shorter than it actually is, smooth it down gently with your hands.

, You have two main options for your feet: flat on the ground or crossed at the ankles. If you are short enough that your feet don't touch the floor, be sure to go with the ankle-cross. When crossing your ankles, be sure to do so with your knees still together. There should be no space between your ankles., If your legs are long or you've chosen not to cross your ankles, you will likely need to angle your knees to either your left or right. Such placement will make you look less stiff and more feminine. You do not need to maintain this angle for the duration of the event. In fact, it is polite to shift your knees towards the person you are speaking to.

, Do not lean back into your chair. For formal occasions, it's most appropriate to sit in the center of the seat with your back not in contact with the chair.Likewise, do not lean forward and slouch in your chair.

, When not in use, keep your hands folded or holding a clutch. Rest them just above your thigh. However, if you are attending a formal dinner in France, be sure to place your hands on the table on either side of the plate instead. There, it is considered rude to place your hands underneath the table on your lap.

Ease into your chair with your knees together.,
Place your hands in your lap.,
Move your right leg to the left.,
Position your right calf over your left.,
Maintain a straight line with both legs.,
Switch legs gracefully if necessary.",How to Sit Like a Lady2," Keep your torso straight without leaning forward. While you will eventually cross your legs, the act of sitting down is identical to the one used for maintaining traditional ladylike posture.


Keep in mind that crossing your legs at the knee is much less modest than keeping your legs parallel. It will both emphasize your legs while raising your skirt's hemline., Once you are seated, fold your hands and place them on your lap between your legs. Maintain this placement when your hands are not in use. This position will also weigh your skirt down, preventing you from flashing your undergarments while crossing your legs.

, Begin by raising your right thigh slightly. Then, place your right calf in front of your left. Be sure to keep your thighs together. Spreading your legs, even when adjusting in your seat, is traditionally considered unladylike. Also, even with your hands in your lap, spreading your legs runs the risk of momentarily exposing your underwear.

, Your right knee should now be directly on top of your left knee. Your calves should be tight together, forming a diagonal with your feet pointing towards either your right or your left.You will not be able to have a straight up-and-down leg placement with both feet on the floor in this position.

, Your right and left calves should remain as parallel and as closely lined up to each other as possible. Be sure that your legs remain firmly together while you sit. Keep your toes pointed downward.Remember to always sit up with your torso straight.

, At some point while sitting, you may want to switch positions so that the opposite leg crosses over the other. This can be done if you are quick and graceful enough but should be avoided if you are wearing a particularly short skirt. Simply uncross your legs so that they are in the same position they were in right after you first sat down. Then, simply move the chosen leg over the other to return to a crossed position.


Remember to make sure your hands are in your lap while uncrossing and recrossing your legs.

Fair trade practices ensure growers are paid fairly.
""Shade Grown"" coffee helps promote a diverse ecology, friendly to wildlife and ecosystems.;
, Although a simple and mundane activity, making coffee can be a ritual which helps you focus and relax. It is often the beginning of a daily routine or a pause in the day, allowing an opportunity to embrace the moment.


Embrace the moment. Focus on the coffee, not stresses like a deadline or the meowing cat. They can wait a few minutes. Keep your attention on what you are doing.
Add your favorite flavor enhancers (such as sugar, cream, or milk) with deliberation. Do one thing at a time, carefully, to reach your goal of making yourself happy.

, Do this by sipping slowly and focusing your attention on the intricacies of the taste and the fragrance of the beans. According to F.B. Bryant, Ph.D author of Savoring: A New Model of Positive Experience, savoring positive experiences can increase happiness in the short and long term., According to research by Chen-Bo Zhong and Geoffrey J. Leonardelli, warm ambient temperatures affect your perception of others, related to the metaphorical association with ""warm personality"" traits. A warm cup of coffee may help you feel warm and friendly.

, Coffee is something people gather around and talk over. Conversing--or simply savoring a quiet moment--with friends also compounds the positive experience of savoring. It ""is the glue that bonds people together, and it is essential to prolonging relationships"" and ""people who savor together, stay together."" When you engage in conversation, be polite, well-mannered, and listen more than you speak.

, Have a seat and take in your surroundings, whether it is at home, your break room, a diner, or a coffeehouse. Get out of your own head for a moment, and quietly observe the world about you. Listen to the sounds around you. Gaze out the window. Pet the cat. Absorb the wealth of positive experiences at your disposal around you in this comforting environment.

Do your best to be discreet as it's important that it be seen as a gift given in good spirit and not a call for attention. Is there a homeless person outside? Offer to get them a warm drink. They'll appreciate it and you'll feel connected with your human nature.

, Ultimately, human beings make coffee, and honoring them helps create a pleasant atmosphere. A nice ""thank you"" is always appreciated. If they're not busy, try to chat them up and get to know them. Let them know you appreciate their work verbally and by leaving a good tip. When you come into the café, greet people by their first name if you can. Taking time to make someone feel good about themselves will make you both feel comfortable and enhance positive vibes in the world.

Place the letter in the mailbox.",How to Write a Letter to Your Best Friend," It can be scary to sit down to a blank page and try to write a long, meaningful letter. Even though you know your best friend well, it can still be difficult to think of what to write.


As you go through your day, take notes of little things you think your best friend would like, events you want to tell your best friend about, or just things you find funny. Your friend will appreciate that you include these little details about your daily life in the letter.
You can do this in a physical notepad, but it can be convenient simply to keep notes in your phone using a note-taking application with a section titled “Best friend Letter.”When you sit down to write your letter, look back over your notes to get ideas of what you want to include as you write.;
, Even though you’re best friends and likely have been for a while, there’s always more to learn about each other. Ask them questions, and let them know your answers to those questions. Fun questions you could ask include:


“If you were an animal, what animal do you think you’d be, and why?” You can even tell them what animal you think they are like.
“If you could meet one fictional character in real life, who would you want to meet?”
“If you could choose to magically have any ability or skill, what would you want to be able to do?”
“Do you think aliens are real?”
“What makes you happiest?”
“What’s a food that you absolutely hate?”
“Who do you have a crush on right now?”
“What’s your favorite thing that we do together?”

, These plans could be specific or just general fun things you’d like to do together.Having plans written down will make you excited to see your friend and do new things together.


Plan to marathon your favorite movies.
Decide you’re going to have a two-person book club.
Think of a project you’d like to do together.
List out places or attractions you’d like to visit.

, Sometimes, when you have a best friend, you’re so comfortable with each other that you don’t have to talk about your friendship, it’s just a given. A letter can be a nice way to express the things you always know but never say.


Think about the qualities you admire in your friend.
Also, think of times that they helped you or made you feel better.

, Think about things your friend likes. For example, if your friend loves daisies, try to find stationary with a border of daisies. Get a corresponding envelope as well.


If you choose unlined stationary, you can lay a piece of lined paper underneath to help guide you as you write.

, Just write the date on which you write your letter in the top righthand corner. This will help your friend remember the occasion on which he or she received your letter.


Also, if your letter is delayed for some reason, your best friend will know when you wrote it.
This is especially important if you’re sending the letter far away.

, This is the standard format for any kind of letter.Begin your letter with “Dear Jane.” Use the name of your best friend.


Then, for your greeting, you can simply start with “Hello!”
Or, if you want it to be slightly more personal, try “Hello best friend!” or “Hey BFF!” or use a nickname that only you call your best friend.

, Write as much or as little as you’d like. Even if you only write a paragraph or two, your friend will still be happy that you wrote them a letter.


Don’t be afraid to use more than one sheet of paper.
In this part of your letter, include your funny anecdotes and ask how your friend is.
Write them an update on your life. They’re your best friend, and they want to know what’s going on with you. For example, if you have a new crush, let them know.
Give them a list of things they might want to check out, like songs or TV shows.

, You want to end your letter with something sweet. If you haven’t seen them in a while, let them know you miss them.


Say something like, “I love you! Write back soon!”
End with “Your best friend,” or “Love,” and then write your signature.
If you forget to write something in your letter, you can always go back and add a P.S. with the message you forgot.

, To make the letter even more personalized, consider adding little drawings to it. You can even draw on the envelope. Use colored pencils or markers in all your best friend’s favorite colors.


Draw a little picture of you and your friend, or add hearts and flowers.
If you don’t want to draw, you can also use ink stamps or stickers to decorate the letter.

, This will sweeten up your letter, and remind your best friend of you. Hold a bottle of perfume several inches from the letter, facing it directly. Spray a few times over the page, but don't soak the paper.


A little bit will go a long way.
Sniff the paper to make sure you can smell the perfume.

, Once you fold your letter, slip it into your envelope.


Seal the envelope by licking it or using a sponge to wet the seal.
You can also place a sticker or a piece of decorate tape over the front flap of the envelope for extra security and decoration.

, First, write your best friend’s ful name on the back middle of the envelope.


If you don’t plan to mail the letter, you can simply write the name.
If you do want to mail the letter, write the street number and name on the line underneath the name. On the next line, write the city, state, and zip code.
In the top left hand corner, write your own name and address. Then stick a stamp in the top right corner of the envelope.

, When you put the letter in the mailbox, put the mailbox flag in the upright position so that your postman knows that you want something delivered.


You can also take it to the post office, instead of placing it in your own mailbox. This will decrease the time it takes for your letter to get to your best friend.
If you include anything extra in your letter that makes it heavier, it is a good idea to take it to the post office to make sure you use enough postage.

Decide which species of snail you want to farm.,
Make sure that you have the proper permits for the snail farm.,
Purchase your snails online or find snails in your garden.,
Choose fully grown snails.,
Get enough snails for the size of your farm.,
Pick a wind-free moist location for your pen.,
Choose a fencing material.,
Create the snail pen perimeter by driving posts into the ground.,
Dig a .4 meter (1.3 foot) deep trench around the posts.,
Wrap and staple the wire mesh around your posts.,
Cover the trench with dirt.,
Lay down moist, loamy soil.,
Choose a well-ventilated container if starting a small, personal farm.,
Add snail food to your habitat.,
Change the soil every three months.,
Water your snail farm if it doesn't rain.,
Pick the weeds that grow in your pen.",How to Snail Farm," When creating a snail farm, you'll have to use a single species of snail. The smaller helix pomatia and helix aspersa can lay hundreds of eggs and can survive in seasonal climates. The larger achatina achatina and archchatina marginata can only live in climates that are warm all year round. Research common snail types in your region and choose the one you'd like to farm.The helix aspersa is a popular snail to farm in Europe.;
, There are different local and federal regulations regarding snail farms depending on where you live. For instance, in the USA, it's illegal to transport most snail types over state lines without a special permit.Other countries will have their own restrictions and laws about starting a snail farm. Check on your country's website for agriculture to determine what forms and permits you may need to start a snail farm.

In some countries certain snail species are deemed as invasive and are thus illegal to own.
The lissachatina fulica or the large African land snail is illegal in the USA., If you want to start a snail farm, you'll need to get snails. Look online to find another snail farm near you, where you can purchase adult snails. It's always best to be able to examine the snails before you buy them so that you know they are healthy., When you first start your snail farm, you'll want to get healthy, fully grown snails that will lay eggs and help populate your farm. Look on the shell of the snail. If there is a lip, they are a fully grown snail. The lip will look like rolled or curled shell near the entrance of the shell.Choose snails that fit in their shell, as this is an indication that they are healthy.

, If you are farming smaller snails, there's a max of 6 snails per square meter. If raising larger snails, you'll need at least 1 square meter for each snail. Getting more snails than this will lead to overpopulation and an unhealthy snail population. If you get more snails they will lay more eggs., Places where the soil doesn't drain well after rain or that are exposed to high winds are not good for snails. Pick a location that has ample space and won't be exposed to the harsh elements.A trench is the perfect location for a snail pen because it's not exposed to high-winds.
Being on the bottom of a hill or surrounded by trees will also protect your farm.

, You can purchase snail pen fencing material online or from most hardware stores. Popular fencing materials include corrugated metal or plastic, chicken wire, or a woven material. The purpose of the pen is to keep the snails in. Choose a material within your budget, and get enough of it so you can build a 5x5 meter (16.4x16.4) pen.You can make the perimeter of your fence larger if you want to house more snails.
Larger snail farms can be anywhere from 1000 square meters (3280.84 square feet) to 10,000 square meters (32808.4 square feet) in size., You can purchase wooden fence posts at the same store that you bought your fencing. Space each post 1.25 meters (four feet) away from each other so that there are 5 posts on each side of your pen. This is the perimeter that you'll be using as your snail pen, and will be what you wrap your fencing material around., Use a shovel to dig the trench outside of each of the wooden posts around the perimeter of your snail farm. This will house the bottom of your fencing material., Take your fencing material and wrap it tightly around the wooden posts. Put the bottom of the fence into the trench that you dug earlier. This will ensure that the snails can't escape and that larger predators won't be able to dig under the pen., Use a shovel and fill the trench in with dirt. Once the trench is covered, make sure to pat down the soil in the area so that the fence stays under the ground. Your snail pen is now ready., Snails prefer damp, loamy soil with low acidity and a lot of organic matter. Go to a home and gardening store and get one that has a pH of 7 or lower to encourage good snail health. Pour the soil into the snail habitat, giving the snails ample room to move around.Clay is unsuitable for snails because it becomes too hard when wet.
Sand is also not ideal for snails because of its low water-holding capacity., Snails will eat their way through cardboard, so cardboard boxes don't make the best containers. Instead, create a habitat inside of a glass or plastic bin. An aquarium will also work. Make sure that habitat is covered so that the snails can't escape, and be sure to punch ventilation holes into the lid of the habitat so that the snails can breathe., Snails eat a variety of different foods. You can feed your snails things like lettuce, cabbage, weeds, vegetable peelings, and slices of fruit. Put the food inside of the habitat and remove it once it starts to turn or grow mold. In addition, leave out a tray of distilled water so that your snails can drink.You can also grow leafy vegetables in your snail farm to feed your snails.
Other plants that snails like include turnip, hybrid turnip, and dandelion clover.Tap water sometimes contains chemicals that would harm the snails, so remember to boil and cool the water if you decide to use water from your tap.

, The chemical composition of your soil will change over time. Also, your soil will likely have a buildup of feces and mucus from your snails. For this reason, you need to replace all of the soil every three months to keep your snail's healthy. Extract the snails from their habitat and transfer them to a temporary habitat before using a shovel to replace the old soil with fresh, loamy soil., Use a spray bottle to spray down the leaves and ground of your snail farm. Water your farm towards the evening or in the morning when it's cooler out. If you water them when it's hot out, they may be attracted by the water and get killed by the sun. If you are snail farming outside and it hasn't rained in a couple of days, you'll have to add water to your snail farm. If it is very dry, water your farm every day.Do not flood your snail farm.

, Weeds and wild grass can disrupt the growth of leafy greens that you may have planted in your snail farm. Carefully pull the weeds and grass around the perimeter and inside of your snail farm's pen."

Talk in private.,
Begin the conversation gently.,
Listen to their side of things.,
Encourage them to be an individual.,
Manage any defensiveness.,
End on a high note.",How to Get Your Friend to Stop Copying You1," Pull your friend to the side and away from the earshot of others to have this talk. You don't want to risk embarrassing them or having your business aired out to everyone. Ask them to meet you after school or call them at a time you’re both free.Say “Hey Sarah, do you have a few minutes to talk after school? I was thinking we could get ice cream. I wanna chat about something.”;
, Avoid jumping straight to the issue; ease into it instead. Spend a few minutes chatting about their day or the latest news. Once you are both comfortable, you can talk to them about the copying.You can say “Lately, I’ve been feeling like every time I buy a shirt or pair of shoes, you go out and buy the same ones. I’ve tried to ignore it but it’s been bothering me and I wanted to talk to you about it.”

, Once you have said your peace, listen to what they have to say. Don’t interrupt them, and even when you feel that they are wrong, try to see things from their perspective. This ‘copying’ could be a coincidence, or perhaps the items that you have are very popular and worn by many people.

They might also admit that they’ve been copying you. If you tend to get more attention or are more confident, them copying you could be a way to feel cooler.

, If they do admit to copying you, let them know that you’re not mad at them. Talk to them about the reasons you two are friends and the things that you like about them. Encourage them to express those things rather than copying your personality or style.For instance, you might say “Kris, you have such a fun personality and I don’t know why you’d want to change that to be more like me. I want to be friends with YOU, not a copycat version of myself.”

, Your friend might not have taken this news well. They might be offended that you think they are copying them. Even if they yell or get upset, keep a completely neutral tone and demeanor so they don’t get more upset.When they make valid points, let them know that you understand where they’re coming from.

, After this talk, try to be positive. Your friend might be feeling a bit low after the chat, but do try to reaffirm your friendship. Hug it out and then give them some space to think. Text or call them the next day to check in.

Say something like “I’m glad we could talk about this. Thanks for hearing me out. I still want us to be friends; that hasn’t changed. I’ll call you tomorrow, okay?”

Compliment them on their own style.,
Don’t let them know what you’re wearing beforehand.,
Go shopping alone or with others.,
Be selective with your social media.,
Keep your accomplishments to yourself.",How to Get Your Friend to Stop Copying You2," Your friend might copy you often, but they probably can’t do so all the time. On the days that they are being themselves, compliment them. This will reinforce to them that their individuality is valued and they will copy you less., If you know your friend is a copycat, give them less opportunities to copy you. If they call asking what you are wearing to a party, tell them you aren’t sure yet., Avoid shopping with a friend who copies you, as they will likely buy the same or similar clothes. Especially avoid shopping for big events like prom with these types of friends., Be mindful of what you post, as your copycat friend could be using your social media to bite your style. Only share things that you wouldn’t mind them copying from you, like the books you’re reading or movies you’re watching.

You might also consider limiting their access to your profiles so they can’t access your updates.

, If you did something nice for someone, won an award, or were complimented on something, avoid telling your friend. Your friend might take this information and copy something that you did or said so that they can be praised, too.

Don’t keep all of your successes to yourself, though! Share with your family and friends who don’t copy you.

Wait it out.,
Determine if confronting them is worth the conflict.,
Assess your own style.,
Ask for a friend’s help.,
Take a break from the friendship.",How to Get Your Friend to Stop Copying You3," Before you confront your friend about something like this, be patient. They could be going through a phase that will be over soon. Wait until the copying has lasted at least a month before you say anything., If your friend has a few of the same shirts as you because they liked them, is it really worth confronting them over? If the copying is very low level, you might decide instead to just table the issue for now., Are you copying a celebrity with some of the clothes you wear or things you do? Could your friend be doing so, too? Ask yourself these questions before you speak to your friend. You might find that they are not copying you, but someone else instead., Talk to a friend about the concerns you have. See if they have noticed the copying. If not, then you may overthinking things a bit. Ask them to help you to be fair and objective during this process.You might say, “John, I’ve noticed that Charly sometimes copies my ideas on and he has even bought a few of the exact same ties as me. Have you noticed anything? I wanted to check with you before I said something.”

, If the copying has become too much for you, step back from your friend for a while. Don’t ignore them, but do let them know that you need a bit of space and ask them to respect that.During this time, consider whether this issue is worth losing your friendship over.

, Nothing special, just something else to think about. A little pleasant thing will make you feel better.

, Because your angry with him or her don't be mean about it. Going around and uncovering your ex-friends secrets or gossiping will not make you feel good, just bitter. Isn't it better to play it cool?

, If you meet with them by accident, don't try to pick a fight or respond to any. Fights get nasty. Nobody needs that.

, When you feel like you have, think about the things that passed after. Do you want to make up and be friends again? Or do you want to forget and move on?

, Don't be pushy or dramatic. When the time is right make a joke or laugh together. Apologize if you've done something wrong, but don't make any promises. Step by step will make things back as they were.

, It's easier if your friends are on the same page as you. If not, be good to him or her but be careful to remain acquaintances.

When you explain to him why your feelings are different, it may be easier for him to accept.


If you don't know exactly why you are saying no, you won't be able to tell him, and he might get his feelings hurt even more. Spend some time figuring out why if you don't immediately know why, and then come back and tell him (if you needed some time after he asked you out).
Honesty is an important trait for friends to have.If you want to maintain your friendship with this guy, then being honest about how you really feel is important.;
, While you are telling him no, make sure that you are kind and gentle. Don't laugh or be sarcastic--he is being serious, and you should respect him by also being serious. You want to keep your friendship intact, and laughing at him may push him away.


Don't bring up that he asked you out in a group setting. This is not only embarrassing and awkward, but he might interpret this as making fun of him. Let him decide whether or not to talk about it in front of others.
Try to have some empathy for what he must be feeling. This is an important quality for friends to have.If you were in his position and liked someone who did not like you back, how might you feel?
Keep in mind that it can be easy to accidentally lead him on again if you are too kind. Be kind but firm, maintaining your decision not to date him.

, The best way to go back to being friends is to resume your activities from before he asked you out, as though nothing has changed. You both might be able to forget it ever happened this way.


For example, if you used to study together on the weekend, then continue to do that. Or, if you and some friends used to go out for coffee together once a week, keep up that commitment. Try to treat him the same way you did before.

, You will likely experience some awkward moments after turning down your guy friend, especially if other friends know about it and bring it up in a group setting. Instead of acting embarrassed or trying to walk away, just change the subject. Loyalty is important among friends, so it is important for you to avoid gossiping about your friend or making fun of him behind his back.Try saying something like, “I don’t feel like talking about that. How was your weekend?” After a while, people will lose interest in the subject.

, If a guy friend is wanting to date you but you don't feel the same way, he may need some time to get over you. Let him know that this is OK with you because your friendship is more important than getting to talk to him every day.


Don't get upset if he decides not to talk to you for a while. Be aware that even though he doesn't tell you that he needs time away from you, this doesn't necessarily mean that he is angry with you. He just needs time to figure things out.
If he continues to ignore you after a long period of time, you may want to ask if he'll sit down with you and talk about it. This will help both of you gain closure if he has decided not to be friends anymore, or may help you get your friendship back.

, Knowing why you don’t want to date a guy friend will help you in many ways when he asks you out, from feeling less guilty to helping him understand and back off. One reason you may not want to date is because you don’t feel any physical attraction or chemistry. If you don’t feel any physical attraction or romantic attraction for your friend, tell him.

, You may want to turn down your guy friend when he asks you out because you don’t want to ruin your friendship. Even if you feel something that is more than friendship for him, if you are concerned about losing him as a friend, you may want to say “no” to dating.


Be aware that this reason for not dating may not hold out for either party; if a guy senses that he has a chance, he will most likely keep trying. If you are a little bit attracted to him, you may end up dating anyway., If you are of a different sexual orientation from your guy friend, this is obviously a reason why you should say no, and one that will most likely keep him from pursuing you further. However, make sure that you are comfortable telling him about your sexual orientation. If you do not feel comfortable sharing this information with him, then you do not have to. You can just continue to be firm about your decision not to date him.

, Dating someone in the workplace is never a good idea. For one thing, it is usually against the rules of an organization. For another, if you break up, this creates a stressful environment not only for you and your guy friend, but for everyone around you.


This is another scenario where if you do have feelings of attraction, the guy friend might sense it no matter how many times you say “no” just because he works with you every day. In these cases, it can be difficult to stay out of a romantic relationship, so you need to practice good boundaries.

, If you are in a situation where someone is significantly older than you, saying “no” is socially understandable. This is especially true in high school, when dating someone older than 18 is not only ill-advised, it can get you in trouble with the law. Turning down a date because of age is a good idea when you’re a teenager.Age for statutory rape varies by state in the US.
Sex with someone who is considered underage (less than 12 if you are 16 or older, for example) can land you life in prison in the US.
As people get older, age difference matters less and less, so this reason for not dating may not last very long after high school.

, Even if you are attracted to your friend, his reputation may stop you. If you know that your guy friend parties on the weekends, is excessively clingy or possessive with his girlfriends, or any number of red flags, you may choose to say “no.”


You don’t have to offer a reason for your answer, which is a good idea to avoid hurting his feelings.
If a guy knows that you would date him if he didn’t do a specific activity, he may try to change for you. Keep in mind that this should not be a reason to date him; most people do not truly change in a short period of time unless there is a dramatic event attached to it—an event that evokes a lot of fearful and apprehensive emotions., On TV, people might date within their group of friends or family circle, but in real life, this exchange of partners is not so comfortable. Not only can this strain your friendship with someone if your guy friend is their ex, it can make familial relationships awkward if you date his brother or cousin. Not to mention that your relationship with this relative or friend may be negatively impacted., If you are in a relationship with someone else, the obvious answer to your guy friend is “no.” Don’t lie about this—if a guy is your friend, it will be pretty obvious if you’re not really dating anyone else—but having this excuse can make it less awkward to say no.


If a guy friend knows that you are dating someone else before asking you out, your boyfriend or girlfriend will probably not like this very much, and strained relationships among your friends may ensue. Be careful how you handle this.
For example, if you know that your boyfriend will be upset, tell your guy friend that you need some space after he asks you out.

, If your guy friend won't stop pressuring you for a date, there are some things you can do to set clear boundaries and send him the message that you aren't interested. Avoid texting your guy friend, since it’s easy to share too much information about yourself over text messages and you don’t have the nuances of body language to show how you really feel. Restrict texting to necessary communications, like where to meet up or if he has something you lost.


If he is taking your “no” especially hard, you may want to consider not texting him at all anymore. Continuing to text him when he is sad about not being with you only leads him on, making matters worse.
Ceasing texting communications is also appropriate if he begins to harass you about your decision not to date him, or if your current significant other is uncomfortable with it.

, Going out one-on-one with a guy friend who asked you out can be confusing to your guy friend. Make sure you are clear with him that the outing is not a date, but just as friends.Two, it creates opportunity for romance and for you to accidentally send the wrong signals.


If it make you more comfortable, you can restrict outings to group settings so that outings do not seem like dates.

, Physical affection is the wrong body language for keeping a guy friend from wanting to date you. Even grabbing his arm or laying your head on his shoulder tells him that you’re interested, even if you only mean to express enthusiasm or appreciation.Try side hugging instead of full frontal hugging, as this prevents accidental affection or opportunity for it.Don’t have physical contact like making out or sex. This creates a confusing situation for both of you, because if there is enough chemistry to want to do those things, chances are there is enough chemistry to start dating.

, What you talk about with a guy friend also can send the wrong signals. If you want to remain friends with a guy after he has asked you out but you said no, avoid having conversations about things that are for more intimate relationships.


Some topics to steer clear of include strong feelings (such as fear and jealousy), family problems, past romantic problems or previous relationships, financial struggles, medical problems, etc.
Instead, focus on “friend level” topics such as current movies, recent concerts, school or specific classes, recent vacations, things that happened at work, etc.

, Just like texting, body language is mostly lost over the phone. You do have tone of voice on your side, but that’s about it. Talking on the phone is also spending time one-on-one, and since your communications with your guy friend need to be short and to the point, texting works better anyway.


While talking on the phone isn’t advised, certainly don’t talk late at night or under the influence—anything that takes away your inhibitions. You may end up sharing way more than you mean to, creating a bond with your guy friend that makes him like you even more.

, When you feel upset about something, go to your girlfriends instead of the guy friend who just asked you out. Venting and crying means you are going to share a lot about how you feel, and that creates an emotional bond with whomever you are with.


Keep away from confiding in him, even if you’re not venting or crying. Sharing secrets creates intimacy, making it difficult to communicate that you don’t want to date.
Refrain from making him promises, which can also engender intimacy.

, One way to avoid sending signals that will lead your guy friend on (make him think that you like him) is to send non-romantic signals with your body language.Body language signifies whether or not you care, are lying, and how much you’re listening.Body language includes eye contact, facial expressions, tone of voice, posture, timing, and touch.
Use this knowledge to send signals of friendship instead of romance, such as maintaining a conversational distance of 3 ft (1 meter), refraining from physical touch, and sitting across a table for lunch or dinner instead of on the same side.Avoid flirting, which is a combination of body language and conversation meant to attract a partner, usually for amusement rather than with serious intent.Don’t make long, deep eye contact, touch unnecessarily, or try to engage in witty banter.

, Your guy friend may ask you out repeatedly; keep saying no. Even if he doesn’t keep asking you out, say no through your actions by having firm boundaries about when you will spend time with him and how often you will use your cell phone to communicate with him.


Restricting time spent and using body language cues will help you to keep saying no even if he doesn’t keep asking.

, You want to keep him from being your boyfriend, not end the friendship altogether. Be kind in your rejection. Don’t make faces when he asks you out (such as humor or disgust), and be honest.


Try to get things back to the way they were as soon as you can after you turn him down. You may feel weird about him at first, but after repeated interactions similar to the way it was before he asked you out, you will eventually feel more comfortable.

These types of friends are bad influences, because they don’t respect your opinions and values. Instead, they try to pressure you and make you feel guilty if you don’t agree with them.Look out for friends who

:

Boss you around
Use drugs
Are disrespectful or mean to others
Are destructive of property or violent
Try to manipulate you
Make you feel bad about your eating habits or body
Belittle your ideas or opinions;
, You’ve probably been noticing for awhile that this friend has a bad influence on you, but maybe you’ve been trying to give them more chances. You probably even defend them to your parents or other friends who object to the way they treat you. Take some time to think about the effect these friends have on you. Ask yourself if you feel:

Used
Drained
Stressed out
Unsupported
Trapped
Guilty for things you’ve done with the friend

, If you are having trouble saying “no” to or walking away from a friend who’s a bad influence, ask for help from a more trusted friend, your parents, or the school counselor. These people can help support you and make you feel better for the next time you face that friend. Other people can help give you a more objective opinion about if the friendship is a good one or worth saving.Depending on what your friend has been doing, your parents may want to talk to their parents. They may also want you to spend less time with those friends or spend time with them in safer ways, like at home., Confronting someone who has upset you or is a bad influence can be hard, but you’ll have to take responsibility and try, otherwise they’ll just keep treating you the same way. By talking to them, you’re showing you care about yourself and them. Keep in mind that they may become angry or not understand. Try to focus on your friend’s behavior you disagree with, rather than criticizing them.You can say, “I know you’re a good person and I know you’ve been having a hard time since your parents divorced. But I don’t want to be around your smoking and drinking at school. I feel unsafe when you do that and I’m worried about you.”

, To protect yourself if you still want to be around the friend, you’ll need to set some boundaries so that they know they can’t treat you that way anymore. You’ll have to be direct and clear about what you need from them and what is not okay with you.Limit the time you spend with that friend
Express your feelings and needs honestly
Leave situations where your friend offends you or puts you in danger
Don’t force them to change, that’s up to them

, If your friend continues to drain you, stress you out, or otherwise remain a bad influence on you, end the relationship. You cannot force them to change, but you also have to respect yourself and listen to your needs. Let your friend know that you’re ending the friendship not because of who they are as a person, but because of their actions and how they’ve made you feel.You can say, “I really care about you, but our friendship isn’t working for me. It doesn’t seem our interests are the same and I don’t feel good about myself in this friendship.”

, Once you’ve ended the friendship, it may be difficult to completely avoid friends who are a bad influence, particularly if you’re in the same classes, live close to each other, or have mutual friends. It will be awkward for awhile, particularly if there are hurt feelings involved, but it’s important to be firm in your decision in taking time apart. To help you stay away you can:Defriend or unfollow them on social media
Avoid talking about them with your mutual friends
Avoid answering any texts or phone calls from them
Avoid sitting next to them in class or at other events

, Even if you were ready for the friendship to end, breaking up with a friend can take a toll on you. Take time to move on and overcome the hurt caused by your bad friendship. Allow yourself to process any feelings you have about the friendship ending, either on your own, with a parent or loved one, with a good friend, or with a counselor.Cry and let yourself be sad
Write a goodbye letter, but keep it for yourself

, Ask yourself what qualities most troubled you about the bad friendship, and how you can keep that from happening again. Good friendships are well balanced. Each friend gets their needs met fairly equally, and you’ll feel safe, supported, and appreciated in a good friendship.You’ll want friends who are there for you in good times and in bad. Look for people who

:Build you up
Genuinely care about how you are
Don’t focus only on themselves

, Once you know the types of people you want to be friends with and the types you’re trying to stay away from, put yourself out there. Look for people who have similar interests as you and ask to spend time with them. You can also try new activities to meet new, different kinds of people.


It might be uncomfortable or scary at first, just like asking someone out on a date. You can say, “Hi, I noticed your t-shirt. Do you like that band, too? I heard they’re coming out with a new album this weekend. Do you want to go check it out at the record store with me sometime?”

, If you’re having trouble making new friends, or just aren’t ready, focus on yourself. Make time for yourself by exploring new hobbies, focusing on school, and doing extracurricular activities that you like. Spend time with your family doing things you enjoy. Remember that friends are an important part of life, but they’re not the only part! Take some time away from friends to build back up your sense of self-esteem and self-confidence.

, Before you’re tempted to talk to your child about their bad influence friend, think about what’s making you react to their friend in that way. You might be putting all the blame on your child’s friend, when in fact there’s something going on with your child that’s pushing them toward that friend.Understand that it’s normal during adolescence for your child to try to fit in and imitate their peers, so it might not be only about peer pressure or negative influence from the friend., Even if you don’t like your child’s friends or the way they treat your child, it’s important to avoid only giving negative feedback about their friends. This will only push your child further toward those friends and push them away from you. They’ll get angry and defensive and will be less likely to come to you about that friend in the future.Seek out positives. You can ask, “What do you like about your friend?” or “What do you get from this friendship?”
Let them know they have choices. You can say, “You don’t have to spend time with those friends. You don’t have to be treated this way.”

, When your child’s friend does something you’re not happy about, like talking back to you or stealing something from your home, be clear and direct with your child about the behavior you don’t like. Don’t judge the friend’s personality or character.Be clear about what limits you’ll have for your child and that friend from now on.


You can say, “I’m sure your friend is a good person, and I don’t know everything they’re going through, but I don’t like that your friend stole beer from our refrigerator. I don’t want you to think it’s okay to do that, here or at someone else’s home. He isn’t allowed to come back over until he apologizes to me.”, Sometimes you won’t be able to keep your child or teen away from friends who are bad influences just by talking to them. Instead, you can keep your child busy with structured activities during the week. Control more of their schedule by setting limits on who they spend time with, when, where, and for how long.


If you have a child 12 or under, you can plan visits to relatives, schedule doctors’ appointments, or schedule time with other friends instead of allowing them time with bad influences. When they do spend time with the bad friend, make sure it’s at your house or that you’re nearby and can listen in on interactions.If you have a teenager, you can limit the nights they’re allowed to go out and make sure you know what their plans are when they do go out. Let them know their activities with friends have to be approved by you first, and enforce consequences if you find out they did something other than what they first told you., Friendships come and go during adolescence. Once your kids reach high school, their brains and identities are developing even more. They'll start to feel more secure in who they are and what they believe, and they won't be as easily swayed by friends and peer pressure. Be patient with this process and trust that as long as you support their independence while providing them with some structure and limits, they'll make good choices in friends.

Think about what your best friend is usually like.,
Consider what your best friend is capable of.,
Let out your anger, sadness or disappointment.,
Consider writing down what is bothering you most.,
Show your pain.,
Talk to your friend openly.,
Argue calmly.,
If your friend just doesn't get it and won't back off and return to being a good friend, don't be this person's friend anymore.",How to Stand up for Yourself when Your Best Friend Is Being a Jerk," Is this behavior typical or your best friend or is it something that appears to have started recently? If it has started recently, is there anything bothering your friend perhaps? Maybe something has changed in his or her life, at home or school, to make your friend behave in an unkind way. While this isn't an excuse to behave badly, it might help you to better understand where your friend is coming from.;
, Nobody knows your best friend better than you, right? Sometimes girls or boys need to learn how to be a true friend. Back off for awhile and see what happens. Don't answer when your friend talks; you can see what they will do from their reaction. If they are upset, you know your friend's not hurting you on purpose. If your friend's living her or his life just fine by being mean-spirited, then it's probable that you have a problem.

, You could talk to your other best friend, or your teacher, or you mom, or your dad, or anyone in whom you have trust. Let people know you are angry, sad or disappointed and that your friendship isn't shaping up how you'd like it to be. Just make sure that whoever you talk to won't spread the word, or things will get tricky.

, What things are hurting you about your friend's behavior? What feelings are you experiencing as a result? Writing it down can help you to clarify what is really going on, allowing you to develop a solid way of expressing yourself verbally when you confront your friend later.

, Act a little strangely around your friend. Act depressed, angry or undeniably unhappy. See what your friend's reaction is to that. If you're depressed, see if they will cheer you up. If not, then your friend may not be invested in the friendship.

, Let your friend know you are upset with him or her. Tell your friend calmly, so that you won't both start a stupid fight with each other. Tell your friend that you can't take her or his harmful acts anymore. The worst thing she or he will do is push you back, but don't push your friend over the edge. He or she might get worse.


Just don't get violent, that will get you both a trip to the principal's office.

, Stay calm, make eye contact and make strong points about the bad behavior and how it affects you. Do not name call or suggest that your friend has personality defects. Stay focused on the mean-spirited acts, the rudeness and the bad behavior. Do not repeat yourself.


If your friend starts to swear or insult, you know they don't know what to say and are replacing words with insults and cusses while they think up a new point. This means that they know your points have validity. While they are vulnerable, throw your last few points in, with maybe a couple of references too, such as: ""I believe that drinking at this age to make yourself seem bigger than everyone else is just sad. Addiction is serious."" Then simply state that there is no point in carrying on this argument and that it's okay to be confused in your opinions but that that is no reason to be mean.

, If this person has made it clear he or she is not willing to be a good friend to you, let it go or it will only continue to be harmful. Stay away from this friend and avoid her or him. Just think, it could be one of the best things you've ever done. There are new friends waiting out there for you to discover.

Don’t wait for them to tell you something's wrong. If you know your friend is having a rough time, make sure they know you care and that you’re there to talk to them about it.Don’t force the conversation to happen. Simply let them know that you realize they’re going through a tough situation and that they can come to you if they need to discuss it. Say something like:


“I’m very sorry to hear about the passing of your grandfather. I want you to know that you’re very important to me and if you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here.”
“I know you didn’t get into the college you were hoping you would. I’m always around if you ever want to talk about it.”
“I heard you didn’t make the basketball team. I know you trained you really hard for it. If you ever want to let off any steam, I’ll be there.”
“I’m sure the divorce has been really difficult to cope with. Let me know if you want to discuss it.”;
, Make the conversation about them. Show an interest in everything your friend has to say. Make eye contact, keep a concerned expression on your face and point your chest toward them while they’re talking. Don’t take the time to talk about yourself and don’t try to “fix” your friend's problems. Most of the time people only need to be heard and they don’t want to hear answers. Make sure your friend knows that they have your full attention.


You may want to tell stories from your own life to relate to your friend, but you’ll better serve them by being quiet and letting them talk.
Keep your opinions to yourself. Your friend will feel worse if they feel like you’re judging them.
Never say “I told you so.” Even if you warned your friend about a situation in the past, what’s done is done. Being right isn’t as important as being there for your friend.

, Try to get your friend to reminisce about experiences that they enjoyed. You can bring up times when the two of you had fun together or ask them to tell you about memories that make them happy.Make sure to let them tell the story. Reliving happy moments from their past will help put them back in the state they were in when the events took place. Say things like:


“Do you remember that time we went to the beach for spring break? What was your favorite part of that trip?”
“I know you really miss your uncle. What’s the funniest thing he would do at your family reunions?”
“Lucy was such a good dog. What was she like as a puppy?”

, Everyone feels emotions in their own way. You may have had a similar experience to your friend's, but that doesn’t mean you know exactly how they feel about it. If you act like you know exactly what your friend is feeling, they may think you’re disqualifying their emotions. Try to show your friend you care and that you realize their feelings are unique. Say something like:“I can’t fully understand your dilemma, but I really want to help you get through it.”
“There’s no way for me to know exactly how this is affecting you, but I’ll try my best to help you cope with it.”
“I realize what you’re going through is deeply personal and I appreciate you sharing your feelings with me.”

, Negative emotions can eat away at a person’s self esteem. Your friend may need help rebuilding confidence. Tell them why you think they’re great. Bring up their past successes. Remind them of situations where you were impressed with the way they handled things. Let them know that you’re glad to have a close friend with all their great qualities. Say things like:


“You’re an amazing parent. You’ve raised such wonderful, talented children.”
“Remember that time we got lost on that hiking trip? I’m really glad you had the skills to guide us home.”
“I’m really grateful to have a friend like you who’s smart, caring and fun to be around.”

, Bad feelings may drain your friend’s energy. Your friend may find it hard to get up and take care of obligations which could lead to even more stress. See if you can take some of the pressure off of your friend. Ask what you can do lighten their load.


Go to the market to pick up groceries for your friend.
Pick up your friend’s kids from school.
See if there’s any yard-work you can do around your friend’s house.

, Certain foods have been shown to help people feel better. Hot drinks, like tea or coffee, can have a calming effect on a person’s emotions while spicy foods and chocolate can cause the brain to release endorphins (a hormone that makes you feel happy and content).Be careful that you don’t encourage your friend to use food to deal with all their problems. Constant comfort eating can lead to binging which can cause a variety of health problems.
A little alcohol can help boost your friend’s mood, but too much could have the opposite effect.

, Show your friend you care by wrapping your arms around them in a warm, genuine hug. A hug has incredible healing power to make a person feel better. Psychologists theorize that hugs make us feel calm and protected by reminding us of what it’s like to be a baby in the womb.


Give your friend the right type of physical attention for them. Your friend may not need a hug but may simply want you to hold their hand for a while or give them a shoulder rub to help them release stress. You can even do something nice for them like paint their nails or do their hair.
Use your better judgement. Always ask before hugging or initiating any sort of physical contact with your friend. Some people don't like to be touched when they feel vulnerable. They may prefer to have their own personal space to deal with their issues.

, If your friend has been stuck inside all day feeling bad, they could benefit from a change of scenery. Try to get them out of the house. Make plans to do something both of you enjoy.Doing something social might help get their mind of their issues. If your friend doesn’t feel ready to be around large groups of people you can invite them to do something with just you. Some ideas for fun outings include:


hiking
exercising together
riding go carts
going out to eat
attending a party
seeing a movie

, If your friend is unable to shake their depression, they may at some point contemplate committing suicide. If you fear for your friends safety, watch out of for warning signs that they could be planning something dangerous. Some common behaviors of suicidal people include:


expressing extreme anger or guilt
neglecting personal hygiene
obsessing about death
becoming dependent on alcohol
giving away their favorite possessions for no reason
getting their affairs in order
seeking to obtain guns, pills or other tools to commit suicide

, If after watching your friend’s behavior you still fear that they may commit suicide, have a conversation with them about the topic. Don’t act shocked if they admit that they’re thinking about it. If you act surprised or judgmental, they may shut you out and you won’t be able to help them. Try to make them comfortable enough to be honest with you. The questions you should ask if you suspect someone of being suicidal are:“Are you feeling so bad that you are thinking about suicide?”
“Have you thought about how you would do it?”
“Do you have what you need to do it?”
“Have you thought about when you would do it?”

, Talking about suicide can be an intense experience. Prepare yourself to deal with your friends emotions. You don’t know how they might react.They might yell, cry or hit things. Do your best to stay calm so you don’t escalate the situation. Remember that they’re only acting out because they are in extreme emotional anguish.


It you feel that your friend poses a threat to your personal safety, get out immediately.

, If you think your friend has a moderate to severe risk of committing suicide call 911. If your friend has a low risk of committing suicide but still needs to talk to someone, have them call a national suicide prevention line. The number to a national suicide prevention line is: 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433). Encourage your friend to visit a mental health facility and to enroll in therapy sessions. A person who is in distress or has any risk of committing suicide should never be left alone. Stay with your friend until they are in the care of a professional or with a trusted family member or friend. The risk levels associated with a suicidal person are:Low risk: Your friend has some suicidal thoughts but no plan to do it and says they will not commit suicide.
Moderate risk: Your friend has suicidal thoughts and a vague idea about how they might do it. Their plan isn't very lethal and they say they will not commit suicide.
High risk: Your friend has suicidal thoughts and a specific plan about how they would do it. Their plan is very lethal but they say they will not commit suicide.
Severe risk: Your friend has suicidal thoughts and a plan to commit suicide that is highly lethal. They say that they will commit suicide.

Don't freak out; stay calm.,
Decide if it is serious.,
Assess.,
If you suspect that the person talking to you is an impostor, politely ask the following questions:


Why are you acting like this?,
Think over your actions in the past.,
Think of how it could have happened.,
If you really do think this is not your friend, then ask a security question.",How to React when a Friend Is Being Mean Online," Only then can you handle the situation right. Otherwise, it can get more complicated.;
, Some mean things can end up as harmless jokes between friends, but without voice modulation, deciding such things can be hard. Ask your friend, ""you are kidding, right?"" Include a smiley face to indicate you know. If they deny, keep persisting. After about the 2nd time and they still say they are serious, move on to the next step.

, Most people reside with other people, and it could always be someone else pretending to be your fiend when really, it is a family member. Ask yourself the following questions:


Is this a true friend? If this person has stuck with you through hardships and not betrayed you several times, then most likely, they are a true friend. Or do you find this person back-stabbing you or other friends? Does he/she use you for homework, studies, etc?
Is this person likely to really be mean to you? If it is a true friend, the answer is no. If not, then it is possible. Keep in mind what this person has done with other people too, a betraying friend can betray anyone.

, You are never like this.
Please tell me if you are kidding. I am really having a hard time now understanding.
Are you mad at me?

, Have any of your actions been things which could have aggravated this? Keep in mind the friend may have been offended but have hidden it.

, Is this person prone to jealousy? Insecurity? Or has someone else, an enemy, instigated the ""friend"" against you?

, If in reality, this is the person they claim to be, then their goal is to offend you through themselves and they want to prove it is themselves. If they will not answer a security question (may make excuses) or get it wrong, then most likely, this is not your friend.

Be thoughtful.,

Let things go.,

Move forward.,
Live happy and let them live happy also.",How to Try to Fix a Friendship After You Broke It," That even if you thought at the time it was the right thing to do, you now realize it caused the other person to feel less important and as such, it was not worth battling over.;
, This will help you to know how to form a solution. This is not the time to just think you can text or call the person and expect everything will be just fine. Sometimes, they feel it is ""too late""; however, if they mean the world to you don't just give up; after all, if it was your fault, you need to prove to them that they are worth fighting for.

, After you have looked at the situation and have seen in your own mind how the other person felt about it contact the other person and apologize. They may not be ready to hear from you but at least they know that you are sorry for your actions. If the person is not ready to talk to you, do not get upset and do not keep texting them. This could cause them to block your texts and make it almost impossible to get in contact with them

, After the first attempt to apologize, give it a day or two. This could feel like a lifetime when you care so much for someone and you know you hurt them but give it time.  Rushing to get that person to accept your apology could hurt things even more. Give them time and plenty of space.

, When you do text back to that person after a few days just let them know that you are still thinking about them. Don't go all crazy and leave a long text that takes days to read. It could be as simple as ""just wanted you to know that I am still thinking of you and I know I messed up"". They might respond back or they might ignore it. If they do not respond, do not blow up their phone with a bunch of mean texts. Remember that you are the one who messed up, not them.

, If they do not respond after three attempts to contact them you know you really messed up. This is the point when you decide how much this person means to you. If you want to keep trying the next step is to try to approach them and talk to them. If you start to walk up to them and they walk away from you ask them once to please stop, if they don't do not run after them and cause a big thing in front of everyone. If you are lucky and they do, stop don't get excited and start just start saying everything on your mind. Be truthful about how you feel without flooding them with all your thoughts and feelings.

, If you were not able to talk to them because they didn't stop the last thing you can really do is just let them be. Whatever you did really made them upset and you may have lost them forever, but it was your fault so you have to deal with it. This is where you start over.

, This means really look at yourself! Why did it happen? Were you drunk?  Then stop drinking...Were you mad and out of control? Then find a way to get the anger out in a good way. Start working on yourself because once you figure out what is wrong with you, then you can start fixing what is wrong with your friendship

, It's going to be hard to get on with your life if you lost someone who really was your everything, but you can do it. Find something that makes you happy––surfing, photography, any old hobby you haven't done in a while and pick it up again. Once you find something that makes you happy again, take that energy and try to channel it. Keep that energy and move on with your life do not look back. Yes, you at one time loved this other person but it didn't work out. You realized what you did wrong and you know not to do it again. Learn from your mistake and don't keep repeating it; you will find someone who will make you feel whole again. It might even be the original person who made you start over. Just don't fall into the same routine.

, If you truly did love them at one point, then you shouldn't be sad that they found someone to make them happy. After all, that is all that you wanted right? So find your happiness in the best way that you can, and remember the friendship for the treasure it once was.

, If you're stalking the person, you're not taking the space you need. Plus, if you get caught, you look desperate, which is not an attractive quality. You'll likely push your ex farther away rather than make him or her miss you.Stalking includes “real world” stalking (sitting outside your ex's home when you know he/she might be returning or leaving, calling at 3 AM without saying a word, following your ex around town) and cyber stalking (obsessing over new photos of your ex's social media accounts, secretly snooping around an email that you discovered the password to, and so on).

, That is, don't be sad on social media where your ex can see you. In fact, don't talk about the breakup at all. Eventually, the silence will get the better of your ex, and your ex will start to miss you., Getting new friends will help you feel confident and strong, plus it will give you a chance to change and grow. In addition, it will show your ex that you can create a social life without him. If you had the same friends before you broke up, any sadness you show around them may get back to your ex, and it's harder to cut ties if you're constantly hanging out with the same people.

, You have the right to see whomever you want now, so feel free to go out on dates. In addition, if the information happens to get back to your ex, all the better. Your ex may find that he misses you more than he thought.Also, you might even find the beginnings of a new love and realize that you are not as desperate for your ex to miss you or want you back.

, You need to feel happy about your life again. You also want your ex to miss you. The more well-rounded you are, the more interesting you are as a person. If your ex sees you doing something new, she may miss you more.This technique could cause your ex to feel jealous of how much fun you are having without him/her.
This action also causes the familiar to become unfamiliar. By expressing attractive, fun-loving sides of yourself that your ex may never have seen, you might cause your ex to wish she was still around to see them.

, After a breakup, you might feel tempted to let yourself go and indulge in comfort foods that are bad for your body. Do not cave in. Instead, make yourself eat healthier foods, and take the time to exercise. You'll feel better, and you'll look better, whether you lose weight or not, which may cause your ex to miss you., You do not need a completely new wardrobe or a total makeover to get a new look. Just try a different haircut or pick out a jacket that's a bit different than you normally wear. Even adding a different style scarf can make you look a little bit different and feel confident. Getting a new look may make your ex jealous by itself, but it will also give you more confidence, which will certainly make your ex miss you more.


The key is to avoid going crazy with it. You can spice up your look a little to put a little pep in your step and to give your ex something good to look at and long for, but if you go into debt trying to redo yourself, you will regret it.
Also, right now is not the time to make drastic decisions about your body. Avoid any kind of plastic surgery, and take a little while to think before getting a tattoo.

, When the time comes for you to cross paths again, be polite. Smile, and speak warmly. You will remind your ex of your good points while also suggesting to her that you are no longer deeply affected by the breakup.

, A text is a good way to start contact again. It doesn't have the pressure of a phone call, and it gives your ex a chance to respond in his or her own time., When you do decide to contact your ex, send a message or start with a conversation that has a bit of substance to it. After ignoring your ex for a month, your first bit of contact needs to seem comfortable, not awkward.For example, you could say something like, “I saw that there was going to be a sequel to This-And-That-Movie. I know how much you loved the first one, and I immediately thought of you when I heard the news.” You could also try something like, “I heard your favorite song on the radio today and thought of you. It actually made me smile, just so you know."" Reminding him or her of the good times will cause your ex to miss you more., After you have begun talking casually again, mention a fond memory that will remind your ex about the good aspects of your relationship. Bringing up the good times will help him remember why he fell in love with you in the first place, increasing how much he or she misses you.Consider something along the lines of, “Remember when we tried to go to that fancy restaurant, but ended up getting lost on the way there? I can't believe we missed that reservation, but I'm glad we did. Eating hot dogs on the beach with you is one of my favorite memories.""

, When you first met your ex, you probably acted differently than you did by the time your relationship ended. By acting like the person your ex fell for, you have a better chance at swaying his or her emotions back toward affection. That is, try to recapture that initial chemistry by showing her the person you were, that laid-back and fun person who may have gotten lost in the shuffle of your relationship.Of course, the effectiveness of this tactic will depend on how different you were while you were dating. If you were more attentive while trying to woo your ex but a little less so during the relationship, this tactic may work.
However, if your behavior did a complete 180 and you changed from a sweet person to a verbally or physically abusive person, this tactic will probably only remind your ex of how crazy the change was.

, Even after you initiate contact again, you should avoid communicating with your ex obsessively. Make sure that your ex knows how much you miss him/her, but do not seem desperate about staying in your ex's life. You want to remind your ex why he or she liked you, but you also want to still give the person space to miss you.Try this rule of thumb: let your ex contact you twice as much as you are contacting him or her.

, Once you begin contact again, feel free to share pictures of your new life with your ex. Of course, the best route to share them is likely more subtle than just sending them in a text message; try posting them on social media, as long as your ex is still friends with you. If not, you can occasionally send him or her a text of what you're doing., Remembering special dates, like your ex's birthday or Christmas, is a good way to be subtle about expressing affection. These small gestures can let your ex know that he/she is still on your mind without making it seem like your ex is the only thing you think about.


When taking special considerations into account, it is better not to include any of your anniversaries among them.
Keep your gestures small. A card on Christmas or a birthday works well, but pricey tickets to a sports game or expensive jewelry is coming on too strong.

, Jealousy can work to your advantage if done right, but too often, people are too obvious in their attempts to make another person feel jealous. If you're doing something just because you know it will catch your ex's eye, it is likely that you will come off as desperate. For instance, don't date someone your ex knows just to make your ex mad."
"
Notice a sudden drop-off in communication.,
Identify when someone is making excuses not to spend time with you.,
Try to make eye contact.,
Send the person a few messages, and watch the response.,
Listen for short, disengaged answers.,
Be aware of how the potentially avoidant person treats you in a group setting.,
Consider whether this person respects your opinion.,
Don't put up with someone who's stringing you along.",How to Tell if Someone Is Avoiding You1," Be aware when a person stops contacting you, even sporadically. The person may not even bother to speak with you in person: perhaps he/she only contacts you via email, text message, and social media. If you consider yourself friendly or romantically-linked with someone, but s/he suddenly stops talking to you, it could be a sign that s/he is avoiding you.


Consider that your friend may just be busy, and may legitimately want to see you. They might send a message like: ""Sorry I haven't returned your calls... I'm just so busy with school right now. Let's get together next week when I have more time."" However, if you continue to get these messages week after week—or no message at all—then you can assume that they are trying to avoid you.;
, Perhaps they keep blaming their busy work schedule, or their hectic social life, or maybe something always seems to ""come up"". If a person is consistently finding reasons to back out of plans, there's a chance that they are avoiding you.


Don't be too harsh. Things do ""come up,"" and this person might legitimately feel overwhelmed by their hectic schedule. Excuses indicate avoidance, but they do not necessarily mean that the person doesn't want to spend time with you.

, If you encounter this person face to face, try to look him/her in the eyes. If he/she is avoiding you, odds are that he/she won't make eye contact with you. If s/he does, it may just be brief – or s/he may roll his eyes.

, If you send a simple ""Hey! What's up?"" message, and they haven't responded by a few days later, they might not want to talk to you. Try again, if you don't hear back, but don't accuse them of anything; just try to strike up a normal conversation. If they don't respond to this second message, don't keep pushing the issue. Respect their reasons for avoiding you, and do not give them even more reason to avoid you.


Some messaging services show you when a recipient has read your message. Use this to gauge whether you're being ignored. If s/he reads all of your messages, but never responds, this indicates at least that s/he isn't interested in holding a message conversation. If your messages don't show up as ""read"" or ""seen"", you might be able to tell that s/he's online from the ""Chat"" bar or the timing of her/his other posts.
Use your knowledge of the person's technology habits. If you know that your friend doesn't log on to Facebook very often, it might be completely in character for her/him to miss your message. However, if s/he's constantly on Facebook, but s/he's doesn't respond to your messages, it seems likely that s/he's avoiding you.

, If you manage to start a conversation with the person, notice if they're giving only short, monotone answers. They may just be trying to deflect your questions so that they can slip away.


For example: you say, ""Hey, we haven't talked in a while. How are you?"" they say, ""Fine,"" and walk away. This could indicate that your friend is avoiding you.

, If the friend makes a point to talk to everyone except for you, they might be avoiding you. Avoidance doesn't necessarily mean that someone won't spend time with you – it may just mean that they don't acknowledge your presence. Try to say something directly to the friend, and see how they respond. If the friend responds quickly and curtly, then turns away—or does not respond at all—there's a good chance that your friend is avoiding you.


Compare this treatment to how the person acts one-on-one. Perhaps s/he only ""avoids"" you in group settings, or perhaps he quickly slips away as soon as it's just the two of you. Try to figure out whether he does this with other people, or just with you.
Notice whether the person leaves the room when you enter. If this happens consistently, it may indicate that he/she doesn't want to spend time with you.

, If this person doesn't ask for your input in meetings or friendly discussions, it may indicate that he/she is trying to ignore you. Perhaps she doesn't ask you how you feel about decisions; perhaps she doesn't even react when you weigh in with your perspective.

, Consider whether you are a priority in his/her life. Someone might be avoiding you if he/she doesn't make time for you. Perhaps this person is uncomfortable committing, and wants you to be content to ""go with the flow"". Look for these indicators that you may not be a priority:


The relationship doesn’t progress: it sputters through dramatic skips and hops, or it stagnates, or it actually sets you back.
This person is only around when he/she wants something from you. This includes money, attention, sex, or just an ear to talk to. Consider whether you are being consistently used.
They only make plans at the last minute. He/she may just show up at your door or text you late at night without even trying to make plans,

"
"
Ask yourself why this person might be avoiding you.,
Look for patterns.,
Think about how you are trying to contact the person.,
Consider that people grow apart.",How to Tell if Someone Is Avoiding You2," Perhaps you had an argument or a falling-out; maybe you said something to offend the person without realizing it; or you may have been making him or her feel uncomfortable in some way. Think carefully about your behavior, and try to identify a reason.

, Examine the circumstances whenever you feel ""avoided"", and notice whether any common threads run between each instance. Maybe this person avoids you at certain times, or with certain people; maybe it has to do with you, or maybe it has to do with them. Put the pieces together and try to understand why.


Does this person seem to avoid you at certain times, or when you are doing certain things? For instance, maybe you've recently begun to experiment with drugs, and your friend doesn't like to see you in an altered state.
Does this person avoid you when you are with certain people? Perhaps you aren't the one they're avoiding – or maybe they don't like how you act around a particular group. Maybe your friend is shy or introverted: s/he is always down for a one-on-one conversation, but disappears quickly when you show up with a large group.
Does this person avoid you when he/she is trying to work or study? Maybe your friend loves to spend time with you in a relaxed social setting, but finds it hard to get any work done when you're around.

, If your friend or significant other is present and engaging in person, but never responds to your texts, he/she might just not like communicating over text. This may especially be the case if your friend leads a very busy or disciplined life – it can be hard to take the time for a deep, involved text conversation when you're constantly working, studying, or practicing.

, Gauge whether the person has changed since s/he started avoiding you – and if so, how much he has changed. Perhaps he's begun hanging out with a new group of friends; maybe he's gotten wrapped up in a new love interest; maybe he's busy with a new sport or hobby that isn't really your thing. It is a beautiful thing to be close to someone, but people change, and things fall apart. If you can tell that someone is moving on, it might be time for you to move on, too.


Also consider how you have changed. Maybe this person acts the same as he always has, but you have begun to act differently. Perhaps you've started running with a new crowd of friends, or you've picked up a habit that bothers your friend, or you simply haven't been as available.
Growing apart does not mean that you can't grow back together. If you can feel yourself growing away from someone, it's your choice whether you let them go or try to keep the relationship alive. Keep in mind, however, that this process must be mutual.

Confront the person.,
Ask mutual friends for insight, but don't talk behind the person's back.,
Give the person space.,
Let go.",How to Tell if Someone Is Avoiding You3," If you're feeling certain that someone is avoiding you, consider tactfully bringing up the issue. Perhaps you want to right any wrongs that you've committed; perhaps you suspect that your friend is avoiding you because she's going through a hard time. Be respectful and direct, and explain exactly what's bothering you.


If you aren't sure why someone is avoiding you, say, ""I've been meaning to bring this up – I feel like you've been avoiding me lately. Did I do something to upset you?""
If you know why someone is avoiding you, don't beat around the bush. Apologize for anything that you've done, and try to reconcile the situation. Say, for example, ""I've feel like things have been awkward between us ever since we had that fight last week. I value our friendship a lot, and I want to talk about this so that we can move past it. This argument isn't worth ruining our friendship.""
You can confront the person by getting them one-on-one, or you can ask a guidance counselor to moderate the conversation. Consider your comfort level, and choose the situation that you think will best resolve the problem.

, If you have mutual friends with the person who is avoiding you, ask someone trustworthy to weigh in on the situation. Say, ""Do you have any idea why X would be upset with me? I feel like she's been avoiding me lately.""


Do not spread rumors or gossip about the avoidant person. If you value your relationship with this person, be very careful about what you say. If you say negative things behind the person's back, there's a decent chance that your words will find your way to his/her ears – which will only further inflame the situation.

, Sometimes, people need to go through their own personal journey before they are ready to reconnect with others. In many cases, forcing this connection will only push the avoidant person further away. Be patient, be open, and move on with your life. If the person decides that he or she wants to be in your life, you will know.


Make your intention clear. Say, ""It seems like you need your own space to grow right now, so I'm going to leave you alone. If you ever want to talk, my door's always open.""
Keep your heart open. It can be very difficult to move on with your life and still remain open to letting this person back in. Take a step back from the relationship, remember the good times, and try to let go of any anger.

, It can be very hard to give up on someone, especially if you've invested a lot of time and energy. At some point, though, you may need to accept that things are not going to return to the way they used to be. It's a matter of growth and emotional well-being: if you spend your hours living in the past, lingering on what once was and could have been, it will be immeasurably more difficult for you to learn and bloom in the present. Let go.


Letting go does not mean forever. It does not mean that you can't rekindle a friendship with this person. It simply means that you aren't spending your precious emotional energy on someone who isn't receptive to it right now.

If you're reading this article there's a pretty good chance you're in a situation where you think that there three important words might be coming in your direction in the near future.,
Clarify the situation if love isn't on the cards.","How to React After Saying ""I Love You""1"," Prepare a response:



Ask yourself if you love them. Clarify your feelings for them in your own mind.
Prepare a response based on your feelings. There's no need to learn off a speech and carry around your notes in case they 'fess their feelings. However, especially if your answer isn't an outright 'Yes, me too, me too', it is important to have the right words in the moment. Having a few lines roughly planned out will smooth over the awkwardness.
Give a moment's thought as to how you will reply through body language. Do not give them false hope if you're not interested or not sure. A genuine smile and touching them on the arm or hand shows you're touched but you're not about to rush into their arm either.;
, That doesn't mean telling them straight out that you're not in love with them. Mention how they're a great friend and are really special to you. Perhaps you're glad you met them and you really like them (but that's it as of now!). You'll know what's appropriate. Make it clear what they do mean to you and make them feel valued but clarify the situation of you think you're on a different page to each other.

The key phrases are 'I'm flattered...', a genuine 'Thank you' and a straight response.

,
You think: ""I'm not ready to say 'I love you' but I'm getting there"".,
You think: ""I really don't love him/her, it isn't going to happen"".,

There will be a bit of awkwardness.","How to React After Saying ""I Love You""2",", You might say Thank you Keanu (no exclamation mark implied)and give them a gentle smile. Make eye contact! It my not be their dream reaction but if you pull it off they will know that their feelings are appreciated, they haven't made a fool of themselves and that they have a chance. When the air has cooled a little you can say something along the lines of how you really like them or give them a meaningful kiss.

, Say that you are very flattered but not interested. Do nothing crazy, like crying or running away. Always stay very calm and treat the person well so as to not hurt their feelings.

, Period."" If they are a friend t it must be handled very carefully because there will be a lot of emotion in the air. Say that you are flattered and how you think of them as a beautiful person, inside and out, but that you just don't feel that way. Be firm. (A sidenote- this is not something that can be joked about, not for now at least. Be sensitive.)

, After all, it must of taken a lot of courage to approach you like that.

, 'Eh...thanks?' is not good enough. A genuine 'Thank you Tom' with a smile and a hug isn't the response they might have wanted but if you're not ready to say 'I love you' it's the next best thing.

, Life isn't the movies after all. It's your job to improve the mood. Do not rush away from the situation. A lot can be said in a meaningful silence if there are good feelings on both sides and they need a minute to gather themselves together. If possible move along to a different room or bring the topic around to something they really like. Don't act like things are normal; they're not. Do give them your undivided attention and make them feel valued if there are feelings. If you're flat out refused, move to a group of people to dilute the situation. If there are feelings on both sides, spend some time in private enjoying each others' company.

Choose an activity or event that both of you will enjoy.,
Make bookings if needed.,
Decide whether you'll do something very special.,
Save up.,
Be sure to alert your loved one to leave the night free.",How to Plan a Special Night Out1," This might be dinner together, a concert, a late summer's night picnic on the beach, and so forth.;
, This might need to be done well ahead of the day if you want to go somewhere that is popular. Having a reservation at an upscale restaurant or scarce tickets for a concert can be part of the thrill of the night out for your loved one.


Don't forget to book the babysitter if you need one. Leaving the kids out of this special night is part of what makes it special!

, For example, you might have a special bottle of champagne delivered to the table or you might organize a horse-drawn carriage ride to downtown. Try to think of adding on an extra that is really amazing and different from what your loved one would normally expect. Some other ideas include:


Do something you haven't done together in years, like going rollerskating or visiting a sideshow.
Hire a special form of vehicle to go around in, such as a Hummer, a Harley or a horse.
Consider natural possibilities, such as seeing glowworms in a cave at night, having a bonfire on the beach or watching the Northern/Southern Lights if you're near enough (or just stargaze).
Do karaoke, competitive comedy or some other fun interactive session. This is a good choice if your loved one enjoys competing and being the center of attention.
A picnic under the stars or a barbecue on the beach could be amazing.
An outdoor spa at a snowy resort could be part of an amazing night out; finish with a magnificent meal in the resort's restaurant.
If you and your partner are adventurous, you might like to plan a nighttime treasure hunt.
Set up a movie screen in your garden, make a sumptuous area on the lawn laid with cushions, blankets and candles and have a feast ready to share while watching the movie. This is a wonderful way to spend a hot summer's night together.

, You might need to save for the special night out. If so, planning ahead will help you to have a goal and to put enough money aside so that the night isn't too expensive for you.

You may sit down and admit to yourself that you have an attraction to someone else besides your partner. Then, you should work consciously to move past it and get over it.It may be difficult for you to acknowledge that you are attracted to someone else besides your partner. But denying your attraction to yourself can make the situation worse. Instead, try to be honest with yourself about how you feel and then work on resisting your feelings.;
, One of the most effective ways to resist cheating on your partner is to put some distance between yourself and individuals you find attractive, whether it is at work, at school, or among your group of extended friends. Do not put yourself in situations where you may be alone with a person you find attractive or have a lot of one on one time. This can help you avoid any opportunities to cheat.You may try to include your partner in situations with the person you find attractive so you are not alone together. This could include being with your partner in large get togethers where you know the person you find attractive is going to be, or opting out of group hang outs for a date with your partner if you know the person you find attractive is going to be there.

, You should pause and think about the long term consequences of acting on your attraction to someone else. Though it may feel satisfying in the moment, you will be putting your serious relationship with your partner in jeopardy. Consider all the years or months you and your significant other have devoted to each other. Then, ask yourself if it is worth putting all of that at risk for a fling with someone else.If you have children, you may also think about how acting on your attraction to someone else will put them at risk. It could lead to a strain in your relationship with your children and chaos in your household.

, If you are still struggling with your attraction to someone else, you may reach out to a friend or someone you trust and have a talk with them.

Choose a kid-friendly place to eat.,
Avoid outstaying the evening.",How to Plan a Special Night Out2," It could be eating out, movies, ice skating, ten pin bowling, go-kart racing, etc. Whatever it is, ensure that the activity will be available at the time you intend to go.


Keep in mind the ages of the children. A special night out for younger kids will start and end earlier than one meant for your teens.
Some of the activities suggested for the date night can work for kids, such as setting up an outdoor movie screen and/or having a picnic under the stars. Just be sure to scale everything down and use kid-friendly food and drinks.

, Most kids will want to be fed and do an activity. If you don't feed them, the night out could be more complaint-filled than special! Work out whether it's best to eat first, during or after the activity and factor this into the planning.

, Do you need to drive or can you add to the adventure by taking public transportation? This will all depend on where you live and how easy it is to take kids out. However, if you can catch a train, bus or ferry, many kids will consider this part of the fun of the night.

, Look online to check out the menus before going, and to see whether you need to book. And while you might not like the food as much, remember that it is a special night for your kids, so pick the restaurant with their preferences placed foremost.

, When the kids get tired, it's time to end the activity. Too tired and everyone will end up miserable. Short and sweet will ensure it stays special for everyone.

Say positive things about your partner around others.,
Dress down.,
Be friendly, not flirty.",How to Resist Cheating on Your Significant Other2," If you work with someone you find attractive, you may not be able to simply avoid them. You can stay faithful to your partner by mentioning your partner around the person you are attracted to and saying positive things about them. Let everyone around you, including the person you find attractive, know how much your partner means to you and how well your relationship is going.This is especially important if you have to work closely with the person you find attractive. Letting the person know you are in a committed partnership may encourage them to keep their distance from you and maintain a strictly professional relationship with you.

, You can also stay faithful to your partner by dressing down so you do not appear as attractive to others around you. You may avoid wearing clothing that exposes too much of your body or that shows too much skin. You may also try not to look too enticing around the person you find attractive so they do not try to flirt with you.


Dressing down may not always be an option if you work in a professional setting with the person you are attracted to. You may be required to dress well for work and you do not want to jeopardize your job to avoid making yourself attractive to others.

, You should also try to maintain boundaries around individuals you find attractive and work on being friendly but not flirty with them. Though you want to have a healthy, platonic relationship with others, you should know when you have crossed the line from friend to flirty. Try to toe the line and stay in the friend zone so you do not put your relationships with your significant other in jeopardy.You can avoid being flirty by appearing engaged, but not too engaged, in what the person you find attractive has to say.

Spend quality time together.,
Confirm your relationship goals.",How to Resist Cheating on Your Significant Other3," Put your focus into your relationship and make it as fulfilling as you can for both you and your partner. One way to do this is to maintain trust in your relationship. You and your partner should not try to hide information from each other or keep secrets. Try to be trusting of your partner and hope that they will do the same for you.You may entrust your partner with confidential information, such as your passwords, usernames, and IDs. You may also share your financial information with your partner, especially if you live together and share the financial responsibilities of having a home.

, You should also consider if you and your partner have a sex life that is fulfilling for you both. A fulfilling sex life will mean different things to different couples. You may need to discuss your sex life with your partner and work together to ensure you are both getting your needs met.Maybe you and your partner have fallen into a routine in the bedroom and you are starting to feel bored or under stimulated. Communicate with your significant other and mention different sexual positions you can try.
You may also consider using sex toys in the bedroom or roleplaying. Propose different sexual activities to your partner and discuss ways you can keep your sex life interesting.

, You and your significant other should also try to maintain a healthy relationship by spending quality time together on a regular basis. You should make an effort to go out on dates, just the two of you, once a week. You may also try to prepare meals together and do fun activities on the weekends. Spending quality time together can make your relationship feel more fulfilling and important for you both.You may try to plan a surprise date for your partner to show them how committed you are to the relationship. Or you may suggest that you both plan a trip, just the two of you, so you can create lasting memories together.

Having the same goals and expectations will ensure that you both understand each other and help to avoid conflicts in the future.If you and your partner do not appear to be on the same page in terms of your relationship goals, you should have a discussion about this. You may talk about ways that you can compromise so you both share the same goals and promise to work on fulfilling your partner’s expectations of the relationship.

Keep communication open and active.",How to Resist Cheating on Your Significant Other4," You can resist the temptation to cheat by making sure you and your partner have good communication. This means acknowledging and discussing any issues before they get out of hand. Be honest with your partner and let them know how you are feeling. Only then can you both address the issue and come up with a solution that satisfies you both.For example, you may feel your partner works too late and this gives you too much time to spend with a person you are attracted to. You may then tell your partner, “I feel like you are working late too often. Is it possible for you to come home earlier in the day so we can spend more time together?”

, Active listening can help to ensure both you and your partner are communicating well. Be an active listener by maintaining eye contact with your partner when you are talking and by displaying open body language, where you turn your body toward your partner and keep your body relaxed.You should also avoid interrupting your partner and acknowledge what your partner has said after they are done speaking before you speak. You may say, “What I am hearing you say is…” or “I think you meant..”. Your partner should then agree that you have heard them correctly before you respond to them.

, You and your partner should work hard to maintain communication that is open and honest, especially if you are starting to feel tempted to be unfaithful. Rather than isolate yourself or shut down, be willing to open up to your partner. Tell them how you are feeling and be honest about your emotions.You may also consider getting professional help, such as a therapist or a counselor, to work through your communication issues together. You and your significant other may go to a therapist and support each other as you tackle your feelings for others and your struggle with monogamy.

Take a self inventory.,
Come to terms with your weaknesses.,
Find goals that serve your best interests.,
Keep a journal.,
Think of finding authenticity as an ongoing process.",How to Pursue Relationships As Your Authentic Self1," Think of qualities that drive you and define your character. Recognize the things that you’re most proud of and would like to share with others.You could reflect on values like honesty, humor, a sense of duty, or independence. You could also recognize other traits or talents, like being good at a sport, drawing, or playing an instrument.;
, The next step in taking your personal inventory is to consider things that you’re not so proud of, but are part of who you are. An essential step in becoming your authentic self is recognizing that no one is perfect, and learning to accept and love yourself exactly as you are.There might be some things you'd like to change about yourself, but make sure this is coming from a place of self-improvement and not for the benefit of others.


Some traits can’t be changed. Whether you don’t like your height, or just can’t seem to learn how to dance, there are things that you should try to accept and appreciate. Learning to appreciate how they make you unique will help you show up as your authentic self in relationships.
This doesn't mean you need to be ""stuck in your ways."" For instance, if you have a short temper, you may want to work on anger management skills, because you don't like the way it makes you feel when you react so heatedly. This doesn't mean, however, that you should be ashamed or hide this part of you. You might say to yourself, ""I have a short temper, but I still love and accept myself.""

, Many goals, like wanting to make lots of money or to lose weight, serve to fit society’s expectations. Instead of doing things to look good for other people, pursue goals that are rewarding, fulfill lifelong dreams, or express your values.Think of childhood dreams, deep passions, and things that don’t have an immediate use. Examples might be learning to paint, reading a book every week, traveling, or gardening. Pursuing goals that express your authentic self will help build your confidence and self-knowledge. These qualities will help you avoid misrepresenting yourself just to please others.
Note that this doesn't mean making money or losing weight are inherently ""fake"" goals. You may want to make more money to support and provide for yourself, or you may want to lose weight to be healthier. The key is to examine your motivation for these goals — are they truly for your benefit and something you want, or something you feel you're ""supposed"" to do or want?

, Journaling is an effective way to get to know yourself. Take 15 to 20 minutes a day to write about your experiences and how they made you feel. Once every week or two, read back your entries to review your thoughts.Writing and reading what you’ve written will help you develop a healthy level of self-examination. Critical thinking is an important part of being authentic, but you don’t want to be overly critical about your every step.

, Remember that discovering your authentic self is a journey without a fixed destination. We all proceed through phases of authenticity and inauthenticity throughout our lives.

Keep taking regular personal inventories by reflecting on your values, strengths, weaknesses, and goals. Ongoing self-examination will help you pursue and maintain relationships as your authentic self.

Make it a point to remember the good aspects of others, for example how helpful they are, and thank them when you have the chance to.

",How to Prove to Someone That You Are a Good Soul," Of course people won't trust you if you stretch the truth. Therefore, they won't see the good in you either. No matter what the consequence, you have to accept your punishment for what you did. Always remember that people will eventually find out. Liars never prosper.;
, Don't let your anger get the better of you. Don't be unkind to others. Instead, be supportive and reinforce their positive aspects. And when people aren't as kind to you as they should be, know that you are a bigger and better person.

, Don't be shy and greedy. People automatically assume that people who act timid have something to hide. You will be thought of as a good soul if you are open, and kind to everyone.

, Cowards are not good souls. Though you do defend yourself, never start fights or arguments with others.

, Thoughtful people are almost always thought of as kind-hearted souls. Give presents on holidays to friends and family, and put others before yourself.

, Don't drink, drink and drive, cheat, be mean, steal, lie, or any other irresponsible things that people might do. All irresponsible people are thought to be bad souls.

, You can donate, help local soup kitchens, recycle, all of these deeds and more make you considered to be a generally good person.

, Bad people can influence all people-good and bad to do bad things. Being around bad people will make others assume you are bad too. Surround yourself by kind people who will do good deeds with you.

, Things that you like and good things such as religious items make you feel happy and want to do good things to others.

, Kind people have a smile on their face from the joy that they cause others. Kind-hearted people take joy in being kind to others.

, If people make the effort to spend time with you, you should never ignore them. You should enjoy your friends and family and the effort they put into enjoying your presence and kindness towards them.

, Good souls don't go around asking for what they want, but rather give others what they need.

, Make an effort to understand the other person's side. Think about forgiving the one you are arguing with and why you are doing it. When someone offers an honest apology to you, never refuse it. You can't be a good soul and hold grudges all together.

, Good souls want to help those in need rather than laugh at their sad misfortunes. Don't use rude names such as crazy, stupid, ugly, and any others you can think of. Be the one who wants to help, because other people need you.

, Make your own decisions, because the other person's might not be a good idea. Kind people don't ""go with the flow"", especially bad ones. You should think of good ideas and goals and then stick to them. Don't let other people control your life.

, When and if you are expected of something, you need to do it. Don't make a promise you can't keep. This also applies to goals. If you set your mind to something, don't give up.

, Some people are so kind, they can be pushed to do things that they don't want to. If you know someone who is a ""pushover"", don't take advantage of them. Your friends are not your slaves. You should encourage others to be their own person.

Evaluate your interactions with other people.,
Spend time with people who make you feel comfortable in your own skin.,
Choose people who value uniqueness.,
Go for quality over quantity.",How to Pursue Relationships As Your Authentic Self2," We tend to represent ourselves most authentically around people we know well. Pay attention to how you interact with your family, close friends, and acquaintances. Ask yourself, “What are the differences between how I act around people close to me and those I barely know?”Everyone wants to put their best foot forward around new people, but do your best to be the same person regardless of the situation. You don’t want to talk to your boss or teacher the same way you’d talk to your little sibling, but you can still be yourself. Being a little more polite doesn’t mean you have to be fake or make things up about yourself.  
Writing in your journal will help you keep track of how you interact with various people.

, No one wants to walk on eggshells around their friends or romantic partner. Choose to hang out with people who put you at ease instead of those who pressure you to be someone you’re not.As you grow more comfortable being your authentic self around others, it might be a good idea to challenge yourself by spending time with people who have a different viewpoint from you or with whom you might not normally spend your time. Push yourself to remain authentic around these people
Suppose you’re forming a relationship with someone who criticizes the words you use or music you like. They want you to change how you talk and to listen to different music just to be their friend. Don't give in. Honor and be proud of how you talk or the music you like. You might say something like, ""This is how I talk. There's nothing wrong with it — it's just different. You can accept that or not accept that. It's up to you."" You never know, you may inspire this person to begin their own journey of authenticity.

, Pursue relationships with people who appreciate individuality and appreciate your uniqueness. Being authentic involves being comfortable with the qualities that make you a unique individual. Inauthentic people only want to please others and change themselves to conform to a norm, which destroys everything unique about them.Form relationships with people who encourage you to do what makes you happy instead of those who pressure you to do things that make you uncomfortable. For example, if your friend pressures you to dress in ways you don't like or makes fun of activities that you love, they're not an authentic friend.

, Build authentic friendships with a smaller number of people instead of trying to be friends with everyone. People in our lives play a major role in shaping who we become, so it’s good to be selective. Choosing a limited number of people who accept you for who you are will allow you to let your authentic self shine.There’s nothing wrong with being friendly or social, but remember that there’s a difference between a minor acquaintance and your best friend. You should be yourself around both, but put your effort, trust, and commitment into your relationship with your best friend.

Try not to lie to people.,
Have meaningful conversations with your friends and family.,
Challenge your friends and let them challenge you.",How to Pursue Relationships As Your Authentic Self3," Do your best not to lie to anyone, whether they’re strangers or your loved ones. Someone you’ve just met could turn out to be a close friend or romantic partner in the future. You wouldn’t want to misrepresent yourself, then pursue a relationship on the basis of a lie.Suppose you meet someone at a party, and the two of you start talking about cars. You pretend to love cars because you want them to like you, but you actually hate cars and don’t even have a license. You become friends and eventually start dating, but they still have no idea that you misrepresented yourself. Even if it was a little white lie, it was still an inauthentic way to pursue a relationship.

, Try not to settle for small talk, especially with those closest to you. Talk about your dreams, beliefs, fears, the world, and other complex subjects to deepen your relationships.Having a meaningful conversation doesn’t mean you have to be overly intellectual. You could talk about childhood, your cultural traditions, or what you hope to do with your life.    
Pay attention to how you feel when you have these conversations. If you begin to feel a little uncomfortable (perhaps you notice that the person you're talking to disagrees or disapproves of what you're saying), try to push through and continue the conversation. This is good practice for you to learn to be your authentic self, even when challenged. This doesn't mean you have to be rude or defiant, just don't veer away from a disagreement or change your opinion because someone disagrees.
You should still be open to other points of view and ideas. The person disagreeing with you may have great points and ultimately change your mind — there's nothing wrong with this, as long as you are not just coming around to their view point because you are uncomfortable being in disagreement.  
You may find that the more you get used to being open, honest, and authentic, the more others are willing to be authentic with you.

, As you become more comfortable being your authentic self, you can use your new skills to lead and inspire others. You and your friends can each other to pursue authenticity and live thoughtful, examined lives. Know the difference between having a friend who accepts your authentic self and one who’s just a “yes person.”A ""yes person"" would just agree with everything you do or say, but wouldn't share how they really feel. An authentic friend tells you the truth, even when they disagree with you.
If your friend, family member, or partner tells you that you haven’t been yourself lately, listen to what they have to say. Remember that the relationships you pursue help you stay authentic. Our loved ones help us see our blind spots and challenge us to stay true to ourselves.

Don’t give one too soon.,
Avoid singling her out in groups.,
Highlight what makes her unique.,
Make sure your comment is relevant.,
Note why this trait is important to you.,
Keep it short and sweet.,
Ensure your language is clear.,
Don’t expect a response or gift-in-kind.",How to Compliment a Woman's Personality1," Unless you are responding to an online dating profile or mutual friends set you up on a date, have at least one pleasant, personal conversation with her before you try to compliment her character traits.Give her a chance to tell you about herself before indicating you know her in a personal way, even if your mutual friend has spoken profusely about her great qualities. Say ""Roger told me you are really into volunteering,"" for example, instead of ""You are a really generous person!""
If she is already a good friend of yours, and you suddenly start wanting a relationship, be especially careful about starting off too strong too quickly.;
, You have mutual friends, and are hanging out with the woman you like. Giving her compliments in front of others might make her feel put on the spot. Save it for when you two are speaking privately. , Even comments about one’s personality can seem insincere if they are too common or obvious. Point out to her something that makes her an individual who you want to get to know better.

Never use a cliché or obvious pick-up line. “I’ve never met anyone like you before,” or “You are a real keeper” are not compliments. If you can’t think of a compliment that doesn’t sound rehearsed or looked up online, opt not to give one at all.Be specific when complimenting her sense of humor. What exactly about it is so awesome--her snarkiness, her ability to make puns hilarious when no one else can, or that it’s so similar to you own?

, It should flow with the conversation or be related to what you are doing at that moment. Bringing up something wonderful about her character out of the blue will likely either make her uncomfortable by indicating your romantic feelings, or sound insincere.


Wait to tell her how much you admire her intelligence until you are having a philosophical discussion or watching a political debate, etc., not during a game of Ultimate Frisbee., She can have lots of good qualities that a lot of people won’t care about. Make sure she knows you are sincere by briefly stating why you care that she volunteers at the homeless shelter or goes regularly to the Buddhist meditation group nearby.#* If you don’t make a connection to her great quality or characteristic, then you are just giving false flattery., A well-received compliment is succinct. You need two sentences at most—one to tell her what you admire about her and a second to qualify why this trait matters to you as a person.Don’t give a whole treatise on how smart she is. She probably knows she’s smart and doesn’t need you to convince her.
Keep your compliments down to earth. Don’t “put her on a pedestal.”Even if you think she’s the most amazingly intelligent woman you’ve ever met, avoid such generalizations.
Think about how a celebrity might feel when a starstruck fan standing behind them in a long line at Starbucks starts delivering a ten minute speech about how amazing they are.
Don’t overdo it. If you are constantly giving this woman praise, it will start to come off as insincere or forced. Also, when you give out compliments all the time, they mean less. She might come to expect them and be hurt when you stop trying so hard., Sometimes what we mean to say doesn’t come out the way we meant it. A lot of words have double meanings or multiple uses that make them ambiguous. Make sure you are clearly stating what you mean so that she can’t take it the wrong way.”I love your rare .” Is it rare in the general population, rarely a quality attributed to women, or rare as far as her typical behavior?
Instead, say “I think its wonderful that you are so because you inspire everyone around you to be that too.""
Also make sure you aren’t accidentally giving a back-handed compliment. “Wow, you are really funny today,” feels like “You aren’t usually funny at all. What a surprise!”

, Give her a compliment because you admire her and want her to know, not so she will go out with you or think you’re good dating material.Avoid “nice guy syndrome.” Don’t be nice to a girl and expect her to reward you by going out with you. You should be nice because she’s a person, like you, and deserves respect.

"
"
Be careful not to overstep your boundaries.,
Don’t compare what she is now to what she was before.,
Give compliments that are selfless.,
Avoid unintentional condescension, especially if you are male.",How to Compliment a Woman's Personality2," Avoid compliments that are too familiar or inappropriate when praising your co-worker’s performance or your mother-in-law’s exceptional family values.

You are trying to make her feel good about herself and associate you with this positive self-image, not make her self-conscious or feel threatened.

Just like it would be inappropriate to tell a co-worker how sexy she is (regardless of any positive personality trait you try to pair this with), you wouldn’t tell her you bet she’s a really great wife no matter what you know about her marriage.
Praising your boss with, “That was an especially difficult meeting and you handled it with grace and assertiveness,” is much better than saying “Those guys were really gunning for you, but you really whipped them into shape!”
Tell your mother-in-law that she should be proud for raising a strong and compassionate, well-rounded daughter, rather than just saying she must be a good mom and/or wife. The first praises her for her character strengths and passing those on, the second implies her identity is based on her ability to play a stereotypical female role well.

, In the same way that telling a woman, “Wow, you lost a lot of weight! You look great now!” can send her into a spiral of self-consciousness about others noticing her weight before, saying a co-worker is “really good at ___ now” references the fact that you didn’t think she was before. Concentrate on the present, not what you thought she was like before said improvement. Watch your tone. It’s incredibly easy to sound insincere when complimenting someone you don’t know very well and want to impress. Saying the same thing in a different tone could come off as sarcasm or spite. Likewise, don’t sound overly excited or it will feel forced or superficial. Imagine her saying it to you first.

, No sincere compliment should ever benefit you, as the giver, at least not in an obvious manner. Consider compliments gifts given for no reason. Tell your aunt she's excellent at creating her own dishes after having dinner at her house because you honestly enjoyed the meal, not so she will invite you again tomorrow.
Avoid fishing for a return compliment. Yes, you may want to impress or endear this woman to you, but your compliment should not make her feel like she is expected to give you one in return.

, You can ruin a perfectly good compliment by adding a diminutive like ""sweetie,"" ""honey,"" or ""girl"" at the beginning or end. Also, be careful not to give unsolicited compliments without an appropriate catalyst.


Telling your boss ""You are really great at managing people"" as you pass her in the lunchroom is not the best opportunity to show appreciation. Wait until she demonstrates that skill.
A good rule is to refrain from giving a female co-worker or academic partner any compliment you wouldn't give to another male.

"
"
Avoid envious overtones.,
Don’t reinforce a stereotype.,
Be sincere.,
Qualify any comments on her appearance as evidence of a great character trait.",How to Compliment a Woman's Personality3," Whether a co-worker you admire or your new mother-in-law, be sure to state your compliment in a manner that acknowledges her good qualities or successes without sounding like her new biggest fan. She may feel threatened by any suggested ambition to take her place in the office or in her place as the most important woman in her son’s life.No one wants to be around someone who wants to be just like them. Instead, let her know that her traits inspire you to become a better version of yourself.

, Women predominantly compliment other women on their appearance, which enforces gender stereotypes instead of acknowledging her individuality. Make a practice of starting conversations with another woman off with a compliment on her character or achievements before mentioning you love her outfit. And make sure it isn’t reflective of a stereotype or social constraint. Imagine her saying it to you first and assess how you would feel.
Don't qualify a great compliment with ""For a woman, you are really great at..."" or ""Most girls can't do ______ well.""
Instead of telling a stay-at-home mom she is great at managing her kids and husband, tell her you are amazed by her ability to manage time or multi-task. Make what you say about her, not about how well she fits into a traditional female role.

, Suck-up compliments can be good sales techniques for business people and customer service related jobs. But nobody wants to work with the car salesman that is obviously schmoozing them. Likewise, your fiancé’s sister doesn’t need to be your new bff. Only give compliments when you really want to, and mean them, not to “sell” yourself to them., Women tend to compliment other women on appearance right away, even though they would rather be complimented on character or performance.

Tell her she looks like she could take over the company in that amazing outfit, instead of just saying you like her suit.

Qualifying this physical compliment in this way can make her feel proud for promoting an image of herself as an intelligent, ambitious, and strong-willed business woman in a predominantly male-run field.

, As you come across prompts in your everyday life, write in your diary about the special memories you have of your loved one. Initially you may feel overwhelmed with memories.


Write about how you spent a certain holiday or celebration with them or what they thought of the approaching springtime, whatever is foremost in your mind. Whenever you feel the need to talk about them and remember them you can add to your journal or letters and read over previous entries.
Over time, this will become a precious keepsake and could be a beautiful gift in later years for a grandchild, nephew, niece, son or daughter, especially a child named after your loved one. It will give them a special connection to the person whose heritage is now intertwined in a special way with their own and in whom they will probably develop a great interest and bond which may be a source of strength for you. Create traditions to remember them by. You may want to make them private or for the entire family or, indeed, combine the two.
Create traditions to remember them by. You may want to make them private or for the entire family or, indeed, combine the two.

Religious ceremonies held on the anniversary or a birthday can be a great source of comfort and hope. You might like to hold a memorial service as an alternative near the anniversary, perhaps at home or in your garden, where you scattered the ashes or in a place that holds special memories. Songs and music, sharing memories of your loved one or special poems or reflections can all be incorporated and you may build up a tradition of using one composition or reflection each year if it held a special meaning.
This is a beautiful way to keep memories alive but can be a great source of comfort and a means of feeling close to your loved one by listening to 'Mary's song' or 'Dad's poem'. Going for a meal or a picnic, a family gathering around the date or a special outing are all traditions you and others close to your loved one can do to keep your bond strong and to build new memories associated with your loved one.



,, Sometimes, you need someone to care of the moment you want to share, but you can't. To your loved one, just try to write it in your dairy..

Talk to your partner.,
Set aside time to talk.,
Increase intimacy.,
Talk about sex.",How to Rekindle Your Sex Life1," Communication is essential for a healthy sex life. When you want to get that spark back in your life, the easiest first step is to talk to your partner more often. It may help in the beginning to have an open and honest conversation together about your sex life.Try and determine what might have led to the spark fading. Once you understand some of the causes you can begin to find solutions for them. Consider factors like the following.A preoccupation with other responsibilities or life events.
Emotional rifts in your relationship.
Health crises
A natural decline due to age.;
, It can be easy to get into bad habits or routines such as watching TV during dinner, or looking through your phone before you go to sleep. Change up your routine and instead use this time to talk about your relationship or your sex life. Schedule or set aside time to talk. Focus on connecting with each other and being present in the moment.Make evening meals a chance to discuss what you want for your future. Try turning off the TV and lighting some candles instead.
Choose one night a week to designate as date night with your partner.Write love letters to each other and read them before bed.

, Intimacy means more than just having sex. You can increase intimacy through conversation, sharing experiences, and developing trust.Increasing your intimacy helps show your partner that you love them and want to rekindle your spark. It will also help you be present in your relationship and you sex life as well. Take the time to focus on each other in ways you maybe have not been able to in a while. Try the following.Face each other and make eye contact when you are talking or while silent.
Be silly and share laughter together.
Ask each other deeper questions about hopes, dreams, and memories. For example, ""What is your most treasured memory?"" or ""What are your dreams for your life?""

, As your relationship progresses what you find attractive may change. You and your partner may be operating under the turn-ons and turn-offs from earlier in your relationship. You also may not have discussed them in a long time. Take the time now to have a romantic conversation about what lights the spark and what puts it out. Talking about it before hand will also set the stage for being more open, talkative, and maybe even directive during sex. If you want to try something new, talk to your partner about it now.Talk about the best sex you've had together. Recall what you liked about it. Tell your partner.
Talk about any fantasies you have or something you've always wanted to try.
Talk about turn-ons and turn-offs. Try starting the conversation with, ""We haven't talked about this in a while, and I'm curious. What turns you on? Is there anything that's a big turn off?""
If you are nervous, try taking turns listing your turn-ons and turn-offs with your partner.
If you are struggling to determine what turns you on now, try and reconnect with some turn-ons from earlier in your relationship and see if they still work.If you or your partner are still not sure, have a night where you both focus on just one partner and find out what your turn-ons are."
"
Touch more often.,
Try sexting.,
Take a trip.,
Have spontaneous sex.To add a little fire to your sex life, try stealing your partner away from what they are doing for spontaneous sex where ever you can.",How to Rekindle Your Sex Life2," Rekindling the spark in your sex life involves adding a bit of excitement back into your relationship. With the stress, responsibilities, and comfort in your relationship, maybe you and your partner don't touch as much throughout the day. Don't wait until you are behind closed doors or until you have the desire to have sex to touch one another.Touching more often can increase intimacy and shows your partner that you desire them.


Hug each other for longer than usual.
Hold hands.
Give your partner a neck massage.
Playfully brush against them or whisper in their ear.

, Being spontaneous will often involve adding new things suddenly to add excitement. Try sexing, which involves sending a sexy picture of yourself or a suggestive comment to your partner via cell phone. Keep your partner excited about what is to come and discover new sides of each other. Sexting can be new, exciting, and can open sexual communication between you and your partner., It is common to wait for special occasions or for family vacations to take trips with your partner. That's not a bad thing, but it also does not give you and your partner the feeling of excitement or of running away together. Plan a small trip for a few days for the two of you, just because. This will allow both of you to relax, unwind, and get more time to be with each other.


Go to a nearby romantic cabin for a weekend.
Take a short road trip without hotel reservations.
Plan a quick getaway to the closest beach or island.

, Depending on where you are this might include having sex in the kitchen, in the car, or if you get a chance to in an elevator. You can also try having sex at a time that you normally would not, such as the afternoon.The spontaneity will help spice things up and the risk of being “caught” will add to the excitement. This can also increase the urge to have sex in both you and your partner.

Do activities together.,
Try phone sex.,
Add food.,
Role play.",How to Rekindle Your Sex Life3," One quick and easy way to stir things up is to change the way you dress. This can include items you wear during the day to work or out to social activities, as well as what you wear in the bedroom or to sleep at night. Wear clothes that energize you and that you feel attractive in.Also choose clothes that you know your partner likes.


Buy new lingerie that makes you feel attractive and pampered.
Surprise your partner by being skimpily dressed or naked when they return from work or get out the shower.
If you are used to wearing more baggy clothes, try something a little more form-fitting so your partner can enjoy getting to see your shape.

, In the beginning of your relationship, you may have tried setting the stage for romance. Get back to that excited feeling you had while dating and create a romantic atmosphere for you and your partner. Putting in the effort will show your partner you are committed to increasing the intimacy and reconnecting. Try the following to add a little more romance into your time together.Have soft, warm, and low light by dimming lamps or using candles.
Play slow, romantic, or sexy music to set the mood.
Stimulate the sense with scented candles, perfume, or room scents.

, Changing up your routine and doing things together allows you to step out of your comfort zone, adds excitement, and increases intimacy in your relationship.Try something altogether new, or take a normal task that you would typically do alone and complete it together.


Shower together and apply soap or shampoo for each other. If you are feeling bold, have sex in the shower together.
Exercise together. Exercise is beneficial not only to your health, but will also increase blood flow and flexibility in both you and your partner.Get competitive with an activity like tennis, rock climbing, or even with games at an arcade., If you or your partner travel frequently or are often spending time apart, trying some of the other suggestions may be difficult. Instead try and explore any connections you have available, such as phone sex. Phone sex can be challenging, but it can also increase your communication and connection with your partner. It can additionally provide you with the opportunity to talk about fantasies or things you might be nervous about trying in person.Try the following.


Start by talking to your partner over the phone about routine activities, while he/she is at work or away from home. Do this in small bits through the course of the day.
Occasionally, add in some hints about how you are dressed at the moment or what thought just crossed your mind about your partner.
Have longer conversations about fantasies that you have with your partner.
Read erotica out loud together.

, Another suggestion to being spontaneous and trying something new can be to add food into your sex life. It sounds messy, but using food can be very arousing for you and your partner. Consider foods that are aphrodisiacs, or foods that cause an arousing physiological response, such as dark chocolate.Think of new and interesting ways to incorporate food into your time with your partner.


Bring their favorite dessert and feed it to them.
Try strawberries, cream, and champagne for a pampered luxurious vibe.
Purchase and use edible body paint.

, Try to make sex a different experience every time you have it by trying role play. Role play is simply, the act of taking on a role, pretending to be other people, or pretending to be somewhere you are not.Role play gives you the opportunity to bring excitement into your relationship, try things you haven't before, and a freedom to get a little wild if you want.


Pretend to be a masseuse and client. Act like you do not know each other and are meeting for the first time for your client's massage appointment.
Try being a magician's assistant. It might involve blindfolds, handcuffs, or scarves.
Discover power play. Start with little playful fights while in bed, ending in you overpowering your partner or vice versa. If you are comfortable, try giving one partner total control.
Agree on sessions where, during an agreed upon amount of time, you or your partner gets to be ""spoiled,"" or ask for whatever they want, within both of your comfort zones."

Keep it simple – say ‘Good luck!” One of the best and simplest ways to wish someone luck is use that very phrase.,
Use another phrase.,
Express yourself in another language.",How to Wish Someone Good Luck1," “Good luck!” is straightforward, heartfelt, and almost impossible to get wrong.


Make sure that you sound sincere. If said in the wrong tone, this phrase can be interpreted as sarcasm. So make sure that the person understands your sincerity when you express the sentiment.
Some people dislike the phrase because, they feel, it carries a note of negativity. “Good luck” for them implies that you have little to do with your own success.Use the phrase at your discretion.;
, If you are dealing with someone who dislikes “Good luck!” or if you want a more creative English expression, there are other sayings that essentially mean the same thing. Try one of these depending on the situation.“Best of luck” or “hoping for the best” both carry the sentiment and are subtle variations.
Crossing one’s fingers is often done to express a wish for luck, so you can also wish good luck by saying, “I’m keeping my fingers crossed.”
Some actors feel that it is bad luck to say “Good luck!” before a performance. For this reason, it is traditionally better in the situation to “break a leg,” which refers to taking a bow at curtain call.While not an exact match, people sometimes borrow the phrase “May the force be with you” from Star Wars to wish people luck with a challenging task.
Other English variants include, “Knock them dead!” “You’ll do great,” or “Blow them away!”, English is not the only language that has expressions for “Good luck,” of course. One way to stay fresh is to wish someone luck in a foreign language. This works especially well if the other person speaks that language or has some connection to its culture.In Spanish, wish someone “¡Buena suerte!” Both “Viel Glück!” and “Alles Gute!” can be used to express well wishes in German, while “Bonne chance!” works in French.
In Italian, try “Buona fortuna!” or “In bocca al lupo!”
“Jūk néih hóuwahn” (祝你好運) is the Cantonese Chinese way of wishing luck, while “Gokoūn o inorimasu” (ご幸運を祈ります) is the formal way to wish good luck in Japanese. “Ganbatte ne” (頑張ってね) is the informal expression.
Wish someone luck in Greek with “kalí tíhi” (Καλή τύχη). “İyi şanslar” or “Bol şans!” work in Turkish.

Post one thank you message.,
Post a picture instead (optional).,
Reply to messages that go the extra distance.,
Respond briefly to other posts (optional).",How to Respond when Someone Wishes You Happy Birthday1," If you use social media frequently, you might get birthday wishes from acquaintances, old friends, and people you don't even remember. Even your friends are probably not waiting anxiously to receive a personalized response. One message to your wall thanking everyone for the birthday wishes is common practice, and unlikely to offend anyone.Here are some example responses:


Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes! I'm having a great time!
One man. One birthday. So many great birthday messages. :)
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY SO I GET TO USE CAPS LOCK. Thank you for the kind thoughts everyone!
Check out the examples section for more ideas.;

Post it along with a comment thanking everyone for their birthday wishes. This shows that you put a little effort into making your thanks special, but is still fairly simple to do.

, If someone posts a long, heartfelt birthday wish over social media, reply to it in person. Post a reply at least three sentences long. You can reply directly to the comment, or in a private message. There's no need to respond with a new post on the other person's wall.


Older relatives, ""low tech"" people, and people who don't use social media much are all more likely to expect an individual response.

Choose a charm from the natural world.,
Choose a symbol from the animal kingdom.,
Use a made-made charm.,
Think in religious terms.,
Cast a luck spell.,
Give the gift of food.",How to Wish Someone Good Luck2," Most good luck charms and symbols are derived from objects in nature. Give the actual object itself when possible, or look for a visual representation of that charm when you are unable to use the charm itself.


Four leaf clovers are rarer than their three-leaf cousins and therefore lucky. The first leaf symbolizes “faith,” the second symbolizes “hope,” the third symbolizes “love,” and the fourth symbolizes “luck.”Acorns represent good luck, youthfulness, prosperity, and spiritual growth. The Norse once placed acorns on their windowsills to protect a house against lightning.
Rainbows are considered lucky for several reasons. Many cultures see them as bridges or paths used by spirits. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, God created the rainbow as a promise to never again destroy the world with a flood.
Some people believe that amber – that is, fossilized tree sap, brings good luck, balances emotions, and eliminates fear.Stars are often used to symbolize luck because many ancient cultures believed that one’s fortunes could be predicted and controlled by stars. Shooting stars are especially lucky.
Small bamboo plants known as “lucky bamboo” are often kept for the sake of longevity and strength. Bamboo is fast-growing and resilient, which is why it is a symbol of strength in Chinese culture., There are a few animals specifically tied to the idea of luck or various applications of luck. Try using one of these to express your wishes to a person. Additionally, there are certain parts of various animals that are considered lucky.


The rabbit’s foot is a popular choice, for example. Rabbits were considered lucky since they were associated with spring, the season of new life. Since the back feet touch the ground ahead of the front feet, they are considered especially lucky.Some people think that wishbones from a turkey or chicken grant wishes when broken in two. The person who gets the bigger half is the one who can make a wish – just don’t tell anyone! The wish won’t come true if you share it.
Goldfish are symbols of prosperity, wealth, wisdom, power, longevity, and peace. They are also one of the eight symbols of Buddha, and are thus symbolic of fertility and harmony.
Dolphins are symbols of luck and protection, as well. This comes from the belief of ancient sailors, who would see dolphins around their ships when they neared land.
The “maneki-neko” or “beckoning cat” is a specific cat figure in Japan believed to usher in good fortune and wealth., Not every good luck charm comes entirely from the natural world. There are also some that are made by human hands. Many of these charms are easier to give than nature-based charms, so consider one when you want to express your hopes of good luck.


For example. horseshoes are sometimes hung inside homes to protect the household and usher in good fortune. Originally these were made by blacksmiths, which was considered a lucky trade.Coins, for instance, are considered lucky in many cultures. The exact coin you need for luck can vary, however. In the United States it is usually the “lucky penny,” particularly those that you find facing heads up. In Britain, it was the sixpence coin.Three keys kept together symbolize the keys of health, wealth, and love.

, Some religions have symbols related to good luck. While these symbols may have greater significance than mere charms, they are sometimes used to express sentiments dealing with well wishes. If you or the individual you are wishing luck has a tie to one of these traditions, a religious symbol might be a good idea.


For example, dream catchers figure in some Native American spiritual beliefs and are supposed to keep evil from entering dreams while you sleep.
The “Laughing Buddha” or Pu-Tai is used in Chinese culture to symbolize happiness, health, abundance, and contentment.While a cross primarily serves as a symbol of faith for Christians, it served in ancient times as a token of good luck and protection. Some Christians today also use medals, statues, and similar representations of saints to express an earnest desire for protection or guidance in a certain area of life (usually the one under the saint’s patronage).Remember to be careful about giving a religious symbol. People often feel strongly about faith, and could take offense if given one in the wrong spirit. For example, a Christian might gladly accept a cross with wishes that “God bless you.” But they might be offended if told that the cross is for “good luck.”

, Some religious traditions believe that spells and incantations can grant good fortune. For example, there are a number of appropriate magical spells in Wicca, which draws on ancient European pagan beliefs. If you are comfortable with the idea – and your recipient is, as well – you might try one of these spells.The Wiccan good luck spell involves oil and a black candle. With a drop of oil on its tip, move your finger up and down the candle while visualizing the person’s fortune and good luck and chanting, “Black candle, turn X’s luck around / Let prosperity and joy abound.”
Another spell can be said before bed. With a candle and pen and paper, write your wish clearly on the paper and then put the paper underneath the candle. Then clear your mind. Light the candle and concentrate on what you want to come true – good luck for your friend – and visualize it.

, There are even a few foods that can be used to express good luck. Give one of these foods to the person in question or cook them a meal using one or more of these foods.Long noodles are eaten in various Asian countries to bring a long life, but know that you can’t break the noodles before they reach your mouth.
Black-eyed peas are eaten in the southern Unities States, where, traditionally, they are the first food eaten in the New Year for good luck.Cabbage is connected to luck, especially of a monetary nature, since the green resembles paper money. This is especially true in Germany, Ireland, and parts of the United States.Lentils look similar to coins and are thus eaten for good fortune in parts of Italy.
Pomegranates are connected to abundance and fertility in Mediterranean countries, like Turkey.
Fish is considered lucky in parts of North America, Asia, and Europe since fish ""swim forward"" toward new goals. They also swim in large schools, so they represent abundance."
"
Send a card.,
Give a box or jar of good luck.,
Make use of products that already use the concept of luck.,
Give a charm bracelet or piece of jewelry.,
Ward off bad luck.",How to Wish Someone Good Luck3," One of the easiest ways to express your wishes is to give the person in question a greeting card. Greeting cards typically have their own “good luck” messages written inside, but you can express more personalized wishes in a blank card, as well.


Personalize the message by expressing your wishes in further detail or by saying “good luck” with another saying or in another language.
If words are not enough for you, consider taping a small good luck charm—a penny, a four leaf clover, etc.—to the inside of the card.

, Some people that jar or boxes filled with spices, herbs, or symbols can “attract” good luck. Fill a container with small, inexpensive tokens and give it to the person to whom you want to express your wishes. In essence, you are handing over a care package of luck.


The package can include an excess of one symbol or a variety of several. For instance, you could hand someone a jar of shiny pennies to wish him or her luck. Alternatively, you could pack a small box with a lucky bamboo plant, three skeleton rings looped on the same key-ring, a plush dolphin toy, a few star decals, and a few acorns—or any other assortment of symbols.
Herbs that go well in these jars include chamomile, clover, dandelion, mistletoe, rose hips, sandalwood, spearmint, anise, and thyme.If giving small trinkets or herbs does not appeal to you, write out your wishes on slips of paper and tuck them into a jar. You can then give this jar to those needing a bit of extra luck. Instruct them to open it and draw out a slip whenever they need a dose of well wishes. Write different expressions meaning “good luck” on each slip.
Similarly, you can write your own specific wish on each slip. Vary these expressions, as well.

, A cute, whimsical way to wish someone good luck is to send them a product with “luck” in the name or description.


One of the easiest, most inexpensive examples is the “Lucky Charms” cereal.

, Since many good luck symbols are difficult to give in their true forms, jewelry manufacturers tend to use these symbols and their likenesses in metal charms. You can give a piece of jewelry with a single charm on it or give a charm bracelet adorned with many symbols of luck.Birthstones are also considered lucky, so giving someone an accessory with his or her birthstone is another way to wish good luck.
For someone who doesn't wear jewelry, you could still give an an accessory—like a key chain—with a symbol of luck attached to it.

, Some gestures, while not exactly wishing good luck, try to ward off misfortune. These are called “avoidant actions” and, some people think, are effective ways to ensure neutral or good luck. Studies show that they really do bring people peace of mind.One avoidant action is to “knock on wood.” Knock on a nearby piece of wood is meant to avoid “tempting fate” – that is, jinxing an observation about one’s fate or a desired outcome.
Throwing salt over one’s left should plays on the association of salt with lies and treachery. It is supposed to “blind” the devil waiting behind you.Keeping your fingers crossed, as said, is another way that people “avoid” undesired outcomes.

Thank someone in person.,
Send a card or letter.,
Be specific.,
Say what your friend wants to hear.",How to Respond when Someone Wishes You Happy Birthday2," When possible, thank someone in person after he gives you a birthday present, or puts extra effort into a birthday wish. Give each friend or group of friends your full attention, smile, and make eye contact while delivering your thanks. Here are some ideas on how to do it:


Your card meant a lot to me. It really cheered me up.
That was the perfect birthday gift! You know me so well.

, Relatives and friends older than yourself tend to appreciate receiving a thank you card in the mail. Always add a handwritten message.A short thank you message is fine, but adding a heartfelt message is recommended for people who have been unusually generous or kind.


Look at the examples section if you need ideas on what to write.

, Make your friend feel special for her contribution to your birthday celebration, and to your life. Mention the specific gift she gave you, or the card she sent. Tell her how you will use the gift, or that you will ""enjoy it for a long time.""

, Never criticize the gift your friend sent you, bring up something embarrassing, or do anything else that might upset him. If you dislike the gift, try to find something about it that you do enjoy, or thank him for taking the time to pick out (or create) such a thoughtful gift.

Post something unique.,
Give a serious, meaningful thank you.",How to Respond when Someone Wishes You Happy Birthday3," Let the well-wishers know how wonderful they are, and how much you appreciate them. You can use more specific compliments that match your friends', or use these examples:


Thank you, that's such a kind thing to say!

Link to a video. There are many ""thank you"" videos available online, or you can find a clip from your favorite movie, band, or cute animal acting excited.

, Sometimes, it feels great to communicate your sincere, deep appreciation for a full year of kindness and support. Tweak these examples to include specific events in your life for greater effect:


I feel blessed every day, but most of all on the day when my friends send a flood of support and smiles. Thank you everyone for reminding me what matters on my birthday this year.""
It's been a difficult year, but the support of my friends and family made all the difference. My heartfelt thanks to all of you who helped get me back on my feet and face the next year with a smile instead of a frown.

Identify what they value in themselves.,
Look for things she values in others.,
Think about what she works to improve.,
Go beyond beauty.,
Compliment something new.,
Let compliments happen naturally.,
Be specific.,
Make your compliment unique to her.,
Compliment things she controls.,

Watch out for demeaning language.,
Make her feel significant.,
Be careful when talking about weight.,
Don't feel like you have to compliment her to get somewhere.,
Save compliments.,
Be completely genuine.,
Be respectful.,
Compliment her at the right time and place.,
Show her instead of telling her.",How to Compliment a Woman," First, try to think about what the woman likes about herself. Try to go beyond noticing her clothes and makeup, because she might do that more for other people than herself. Try to think about something that she really cares about. For example, she might be really proud of her ability to play an instrument. Or maybe you know she strives to be a good mother someday and you see that she’s really good with kids. These are good things to compliment.


For example, say something like, “You’re so loving and gentle with everyone, even when they make it really hard. That’s wonderful. I wish there were more people like you.”

, Think about how she talks about others. You’ve probably seen her compliment someone before or talk about someone or something that she admired. Look for key phrases like “I wish I...”, since this tells you very directly what she wants for herself. Now, think about when she’s shown that quality in her day to day life. Many women do at least occasionally show the qualities that they so admire but don’t think they have. By showing her that she can be the person she wants to be, you’ll earn a lot of points.


For example, say something like, “I think it’s funny that you don’t think you’re smart like him. I mean, there’s no way I could have done that report last year without your help.”
You can also say something like, “Don’t worry about being patient like Gina. You’re not only patient, you’re also very understanding. Just look at how you handled that whole thing with Frank!”

, Look at the character faults and bad habits that you know she works really hard on to improve and then commend her when she achieves success. You might not want to directly mention that this is something she has to work really hard on, but complimenting her on the behavior when she does do it can be really uplifting. You know how hard it is to make yourself a better person!


For example, say something like, “You really kept your head in that meeting. I admire that...I don’t think I could have,” after she stays cool (despite a history of sarcasm and defiance) while your boss is grilling everyone.

, Complimenting beauty is tricky. Many women do like to get compliments like this! However, it can have many negative consequences for both of you. She’s probably used to people telling her she’s beautiful to try to get what they want from her. It can also have long-term consequences, in that she might think you only like her because she’s pretty (which she will not always be, as she ages, creating self-doubt). Use compliments about her beauty sparingly and use them in a context where it really makes sense, like when you’re together for a special occasion.


For example, say something like, “Andrea may be the bride but you’re the most beautiful woman in the room to me.”

, Complimenting something new about her will show her that you care enough to pay attention to her. Generally, it is not expected that men will notice things like a change in her hair or a new pair of earrings, so when you do you’re pretty much hitting a home run. Of course, this means that you’ll have to actually pay attention.


For example, say something like, “I don’t really ‘get’ shoes but there’s something about those shoes that says you’re going to own this room today.”

, Compliments are far more meaningful when they’re natural — when you just speak exactly what you think as you’re thinking it, reacting to the specific situation that you’re in. This is because it communicates to her that you didn’t have time to plan it or that you weren’t pulling a stock compliment from some pickup artist website. It shows her that you’re honest. When you see her doing or saying something that you admire, just tell her that.


Of course, this can be kind of dangerous. You’ll need to think about how this compliment would sound. Just take half a second and try to see the compliment from her point of view. Does it highlight that she’d previously been doing something wrong? Does it make her sound weak, dumb, or anything else really negative like that? Learning how to truly hold respect for her can help you not screw up in situations like this.

, Don’t just compliment something really generic about her (“Your hair looks nice”, “You have beautiful eyes”). Specificity is your friend, because it tells her that you’re not just pulling stock compliments so that you have a compliment to give her.Instead of those flops, say something like “Your eyes just make your whole face look so bright and happy” or “I love it when you put your hair up like that because I get to see so much more of your beautiful face”.

, Try to be creative when you compliment her. It’s nice to compliment things like hair and eyes, if done correctly as discussed above, but it’s still a compliment that gets taken out a lot. You’re not the first person to tell her she has nice hair, you know? Get creative with your compliments to really show her that she’s the one with your attention and that you’re not just trying to get any girl.


Try compliments like “I love it when you talk because your voice sounds like home to me” or “You are so elegant, you remind me of Audrey Hepburn”.

, You want to compliment things that she has control over, since complimenting things she can’t control can lead to tension and self-doubt in the future. Imagine a woman who only ever received the compliment “You look beautiful”: she’ll be proud and happy at the time, but she’ll come to identify a big part of her worth as being “beautiful”. As she ages, she’ll be less traditionally beautiful and she might experience very bad self esteem. You don’t want that!


Examples of things that she can control are: her education, her determination, her skills, her accomplishments, her personality, and her interactions.
Examples of things that she cannot control are: her eyes, her skin color, anything relating to age, and her overall beauty.
Besides, complimenting a woman on something she can’t control is like someone complimenting you on your neighbor’s new job. You didn’t really have anything to do with it, so it’s more difficult to be happy or flattered.

, Don’t. Just don’t do it. There is zero chance that saying something like “Hey sexy girl, you wanna get with this?” is going to help your case. Even “classy” sexual comments aren’t good. Just avoid any compliment or comment that implies or states that you want to have sex with her, when she’s not your girlfriend. Women are in the unfortunate position of constantly having to question if the random guy that starts giving her sexual comments is just honestly trying his best or if he’s a potential rapist. Don’t leave that question open in her mind where you are concerned.

, Cheesy compliments can also easily sound cookie cutter and a lot like you’re trying too hard. This is because real cheesy compliments, which usually involve comparing her to a rose or a moon (for example), are insincere. They’re done for effect, not because they have anything to do with your specific lady.


You might make cheesy compliments like “Your smile is like a summer day” passable, if the context is right and you really, honestly mean it. In general, avoid any compliment that sounds like it might have come out of a romance novel or a guy at a gross bar, though. It’s hard to make them work.

, You want to be careful about any compliments which work by putting others down. While these compliments can be very flattering to her, they’ll say something about your personality that you might not intend. When a woman hears compliments that work by putting other people down, especially people she cares about, she starts to think that you generally build yourself up by putting others down...and she’ll wonder if she’s next.


For example, don’t say something like, “Don’t worry about Becky getting all the guys. I think you’re way prettier than her.”
Instead say something like, “I know you think Becky gets all the guys but I wouldn’t worry about it too much. You’ve got everything that a good guy is looking for...you just have to give yourself a chance to let all that shine through!”

, No one wants to feel like just another drop in the ocean, and on a planet of a couple billion people, that’s not too hard. By giving her a compliment that makes her feel unique or significant in some way that makes her feel like she matters, then you’ll really warm her heart. This can actually be one of the most effective compliments. Of course, who she is will really have an effect on what you say, so you’ll really need to rack your brain on this one.


For example, if she’s done a lot of volunteer work, say something like, “Have you ever heard of the whole Pay It Forward thing? You probably don’t give yourself enough credit for it, but every positive difference you make just radiates outward and creates more wonderful things in the world. I think what you’re doing is really incredible.”

, You might feel inclined to compliment a woman you know on her weight loss but this can be very tricky. Many women are sensitive about their weight (so are men!) and some women may have lost weight for bad reasons. For all you know, she might have cancer. You should only compliment her on her weight loss if you know it was an actual effort on her part. Now, for choosing the right words:


Do NOT compliment her by comparing her to how she used to look (aka “You look so much better now!”).
Try to compliment the larger effect that the weight loss has had. This might take the form of “You look so healthy and energetic today” or something like “You seem so much happier and confident lately.”
The best route is to compliment her actual effort at getting healthier. This is the thing she’s done that’s truly admirable. Go for something like, “You are my inspiration to make positive changes in my life too. I hope I can be as determined and committed as you!”

, Yeah, you’re probably hoping that your compliment will have some positive outcome for you. A date, sex...even just a deeper connection. But it’s good for you to realize that sometimes, a compliment isn’t the best way to achieve what you’re wanting to achieve. In fact, polling has shown that only about half of women will even remotely be happy about the compliment you just gave her.Many women have really negative associations with particular kinds of compliments given in particular settings, because they have to deal with so much street harassment. Sometimes, any compliment may be the wrong thing to say to a girl (talking to a girl you don’t know on the subway comes to mind!). Honest conversation may get you further. Just talk to her like you’d talk to anyone else and let your great personality catch her eye instead of your words.

, If you compliment her all the time, eventually the “special” feeling can start to wear off.How often is too often is difficult to gauge, but you should generally try to save compliments for special occasions and times when you feel like it’s really important. You know that feeling you get where you think your heart might just burst from how wonderful she is? That’s a good time to compliment her. When she’s clearly beating herself up about something? That might be a good time to point out that she’s got stronger traits that are going to carry her through.


The point of a compliment is to make her feel good; it’s not actually about earning you points. That means that compliments should be saved for times when it’s really important to make her feel good about herself.

, Women can almost always tell when you’re not being genuine with your compliment. This is why things will often go wrong if you’re trying to compliment a girl you’ve never met: you don’t really know her so how can you know anything actually worth complimenting. Whatever you compliment her on, you have to really mean it. You have to honestly think that it’s a good thing. Your earnest belief will come across and, even if it’s a little cheesy, she’ll be really flattered.


This is why we feel really good when kids give us a compliment. It might not always be worded in the perfect way and it might be complimenting something kind of weird, but kids haven’t learned how to flatter people to get what they want. When they compliment us, they mean it, and it’s extremely heartwarming, even if the delivery sucks.

, Now, you might hear advice telling you that you’ll be more likely to score with a girl if you give her a compliment that insults her just a little bit, making her think that her only chance is with a guy like you (who “doesn’t care” about her “faults”). If this works with any girls at all, it will only work with women who have very low self-confidence. They are not the kind of women that you want to date. Instead, when you compliment her, be respectful.


As a rule of thumb, don’t say anything to her that you wouldn’t say to your own mother or sister. If your mom would hit you on the head for saying that, then you probably shouldn’t say it to another women either.

, Right after she gives an important presentation is a bad time to compliment your coworker on her dress; this tells her that all that hard work she just put in didn’t catch your notice and that all you can think about her is what she looks like (even if that’s not true). This is a good example of the principle behind choosing when you compliment a woman. Any compliment on any subject needs to be presented at a time where she won’t get the impression you just want something out of her (to a stranger on a train platform, to your wife when you climb in bed, to your coworker before you ask her to take on a project). You’ll also want to pay attention to the context. The wrong subject for the setting can kill a compliment, as in our example.

, Show your affection or admiration in your actions instead of trying to come up with a compliment. Actions show sincerity and they might save you from a bad case of foot-in-mouth. If you’re worried that you’ll screw up the delivery of your compliment or that your words might somehow offend her, show her through actions instead.


For example, when you see her buy a sandwich for a homeless guy, sit her down and cook her dinner later that night (or even take her out to a fancy restaurant). You don’t have to take actions like these every time she does something wonderful: just like verbal compliments, save them for when you think they really matter.

, By praising your boyfriend’s way with others, you can let him know how sweet and generous you think he is.

Be as specific as possible for the most impactful compliment.,
Strive to make your compliment original.,
Be sincere.,
Avoid putting down others with your compliment.",How to Compliment Your Boyfriend3," Try to use as much detail as you can when you compliment your boyfriend. Specificity will make your compliments feel more personal and specific to him rather than something that you could say to anyone.Telling your boyfriend he has nice eyes is fine, but it is not as special as telling him his beautiful blue eyes remind you of the lake you grew up on.

, Some compliments, such as “You have a nice smile,” are very common. This doesn’t mean they can’t be true of your boyfriend, but the best compliments are usually ones the person you’re complimenting hasn’t heard before. An original twist makes the compliment seem more unique and special.Rather than, “You have a nice smile,” you might say, “I love the dimple on your right cheek when you smile.”

, Paying a compliment you don’t mean can immediately come off as false and insincere. If you don’t want to pay your boyfriend a compliment about something, it’s best not to. A fake compliment just doesn’t sound quite right to the listener. On the other hand, if you mean what you’re saying, your boyfriend will appreciate the sentiment, even if you’re nervous and the words don’t come out right.Try not to get hung up on complimenting your boyfriend with just the right words. The sentiment of what you’re saying matters most.

, Complimenting your boyfriend by putting down someone else, especially if he cares about them, can backfire. It can also cause jealousy to compare your boyfriend, even favorably, to ex-boyfriends or other guys you have dated before. Try not to compare your boyfriend to others with your compliment. Complimenting him should be about him and make him feel good."

Smile as you say the compliment.,
Make eye contact.,
Avoid complimenting him too much, which can cheapen the gesture.,
Add physical affection to drive home the message.",How to Compliment Your Boyfriend4," Your boyfriend will best be able to appreciate your compliment when he has a moment to talk with you. Avoid delivering a compliment in the middle of a stressful project or a moment when your boyfriend needs to concentrate. A quiet time at home or in your car is an opportunity for your boyfriend to appreciate what you’re saying to him., Smiling lets your boyfriend know that you mean what you’re saying. It also conveys warmth. Especially if you’re a little nervous about delivering a compliment, a happy smile can help you feel at ease, too., Look at your boyfriend as you deliver the compliment so he knows he has your full attention. This will make your boyfriend feel valued and appreciated. It also helps strengthen the connection and bond between you two., If you do anything too frequently, it can lose its meaning. Try to compliment your boyfriend when the mood strikes and only when you really mean it. This will keep your compliments genuine and significant., Kissing, touching, and hugging are all great ways of showing affection. Pairing some physical touch with your compliment lets your boyfriend know that your praise and love for him is sincere. Even a casual touch on the arm can make a passing compliment more meaningful and significant."
"
Wrap your arms around her from behind and kiss her neck.,
Touch her in subtle ways every chance you get.,
Kiss her slowly.,
Take your time with intimate moments.,
Make her feel comfortable without clothing.,
Try turning on some sexy music.,
Ask her how you can do better.",How to Make a Woman Feel Sexy1," If she is cooking, working on something, or just making her coffee in the morning, come up behind her and hold her. Wrap your arms around her and pull her back against you. Kiss her neck gently, smell her hair, and tell her how beautiful she is.This is a sweet, affectionate way of showing her you want her. The physical aspect of the exchange will stimulate her body, while the kind words and compliments will make her feel wanted and sexy and cared for.;
, Whether it’s holding hands while you walk down the street, or putting your arms around her in bed at night, try to touch her as often as you can. It doesn’t have to be gratuitous in public — just a subtle hand on the small of her back, or running your fingers down her arm gently as you stand in line for coffee. Touching her often will serve as a constant reminder to her that you want to touch her and be close to her, which will help her feel sexy and wanted.You can get more playful with this if you and her both feel comfortable with it. For example, you might give her a pat on the butt as you walk past her in the house, or put your hand in her back pocket.

, Instead of only quick pecks on the lips or cheek, take a moment to really kiss her. Kiss her gently and slowly, and spend at least 15 seconds doing so. Both of you will be able to really relax into the intimacy of kissing one another, and you’ll be showing her how much you really enjoy being intimate like that with her by not rushing it.When you kiss her, put your hand on her cheek or the back of her neck, or even into her hair. Get into the moment and lose yourself in it. Use the kissing as a way to show her in a nonverbal way just how much you want her.

, Don’t rush things like foreplay if you want to make a woman feel sexy. Really take your time making her feel sexy and wanted and building up during intimacy. Rushing right into sex can get boring after a while, and she might feel like sex has become something she gives rather than receives. Take your time and show her that she can still enjoy it and receive good feelings, too.When being intimate, be sure to let her know that you’re enjoying yourself. Be upfront about how she makes you feel, and you’ll give her confidence a boost and make her feel sexy in the process.

, Many women have issues with self esteem, especially when it comes to being nude. She might feel less sexy when she’s naked around you, which can make sexual intimacy a little trickier. To make her feel more at ease in the nude, you have to be comfortable in the buff, too! Try leaving your clothes off a while longer than you usually might after you get out of the shower, or be the first one to undress when initiating physical intimacy. If you’re also undressed and comfortable, she might feel more comfortable with it as well.Try keeping the lights dim or low when initiating sexual intimacy. She might feel more at ease to be undressed if there are less lights shining on her.

, Slow, sensual music is a great way to set a mood. Music will help her think more about how she’s feeling in the moment, rather than focusing entirely on how she looks or what you’re thinking of her. To turn things up a notch, you might coyly ask her what music puts her in the mood, and then turn those songs on for her.Try saying something like, “So, what are your favorite songs to make love to?” Then, turn on one of the songs she names.

, If you’re still stumped on how to make her feel good or sexy, simply asking her how you can do a better job can help. Having an open and honest conversation about how you can improve your sexual relationship by helping her enjoy it more and feel good about herself will show her you care enough to ask and put in the effort.Women are more likely to desire sex if they feel safe and comfortable. If you aren’t doing a good job meeting these needs, she may be able to tell you and help you work to correct it."

Keep your compliments succinct.,
Give sincere compliments.,
Be as specific as possible.,
Use compliments sparingly.,
Have the right intentions.",How to Compliment Your Girlfriend1," When complimenting your girlfriend, “keeping it short and sweet” is a good policy to follow. For example, say, “You did a great job on your presentation,” and be done with it. You don’t want to distract her with additional commentary that will make her forget the compliment. Remember that a small but insightful compliment is to the point and memorable., Be sincere and try not exaggerate when you compliment your girlfriend. For example, do not say, “You are the most beautiful girl in the world.” Your girlfriend knows she is not the most beautiful girl in the world. By overdoing it, you seem dishonest. If you want your girlfriend to believe your compliments, then you need to believe them, as well., Don't use generic compliments, like “You’re smart"" or ""You're beautiful.” When you use generic compliments, it makes it seem as though you haven’t put in the time to get to know her. However, when you use more specific compliments, you show that you pay attention to her and care about who she is and what she does.Instead, tailor your comments and say something more specific like, “The outfit you chose for the wedding really reflects your great taste. Have you considered going into fashion?”
You can also compliment your girlfriend’s efforts, regardless of the outcome. For example, if she studied really hard for a big test, compliment her on this hard work, even if she didn’t get the grade she wanted.

, Your compliments will lose their impact if you inundate her with compliments. In other words, if you compliment her too much, she will become desensitized to your compliments, and maybe even wonder if you really mean them. It can also seem desperate.Try to limit your compliments to one or two per interaction. Every time you see her, you don’t need to give her a new compliment. Maybe even a week will go by without you complimenting her. Remember that less is more.
You may also want to try alternating the types of compliments you give. For example, don’t always compliment her appearance. This may allow you to compliment her more with it seeming authentic.

, When complimenting your girlfriend, always remember to have good intentions. In other words, do not compliment her in return for a favor.Ask yourself, “Are you complimenting her because you want to share genuine praise, or because you are trying to get a response out of her?” If it is the former, then go ahead with the compliment, if it is the latter, then re-think the situation.

Keep it simple.,
Resist the urge to deflect or reject a compliment.,
Acknowledge other people who deserve to share the credit.,
Return compliments sincerely, but not competitively.,
Accept and respond to compliments the first time that you hear them.",How to Respond to a Compliment1," You may feel compelled to say all sorts of things when someone compliments you, but sometimes the best way to acknowledge a compliment is to simply say thank you to the person who gave you the compliment.Saying something like, ""Thanks! That makes me feel great to know that you feel that way,"" or “Thank you, I appreciate the compliment,” is a perfectly acceptable way to respond.
Remember to smile and make eye contact with the person who complimented you as you thank them.;
, Sometimes people feel the need to deflect or reject compliments by downplaying their efforts or abilities. In those situations, you might feel compelled to say, “Thanks, but it was really nothing.” While it may seem like you are being modest when you deflect or reject a compliment, it can make you seem insecure or like you are looking for additional compliments.Instead of deflecting or rejecting compliments, allow yourself to feel proud of what you have accomplished and simply say ""Thank you.""

, If you are complimented on something that involved the contributions of others, make sure that you acknowledge those people as well. Don’t take all of the credit for the accomplishment.Saying something like, “We all worked really hard on this project, thanks for acknowledging it,” will help disperse the praise to the other people who contributed to your accomplishment.

, You may sometimes feel the urge to downplay your own abilities by redirecting a compliment you just received towards the person who paid it to you, but you should resist this urge.Saying something like, “Thanks, but I am not nearly as talented as you,” will give the impression that you are insecure and perhaps even trying to outdo the person who paid you the compliment. This type of response can also give the impression that you are sucking up to the person.
Instead of redirecting the compliment you received, pay the person a non-competing compliment in return. For example, you could say something like, “Thanks! I appreciate that. I think that you gave a really great presentation today as well!”

, Don’t ask for an explanation or repetition of the compliment. By asking the speaker to repeat what they have just said to you or to explain the compliment in more detail, you will risk seeming vain or narcissistic. Accept the compliment for what it is and do not ask for reinforcement or explanations."

Approach them.,
Compliment them genuinely.,
Explain why you are complimenting them.,
Keep your hate to yourself.,
Allow them to respond.,
Be positive when they are negative.",How to Compliment Someone You Hate," Before you approach them with any nice gesture of thought, consider all of their positive attributes. Your hate for them may make it hard to see, but few people are all bad. Take some time to think about any time you have seen this person do something kind, or display intelligence, humor or maturity. This will be particularly helpful if you have been mandated to give this person a compliment.;
, Though you might feel tempted to, don’t give them an insult that is veiled as a compliment. An example would be saying something like “Wow, you don’t usually look that great but today you look nice, Josh.” Give them a true compliment or don’t say anything at all.

, When you compliment them, avoid being overly vague. Opt instead for being specific and genuine. Don’t say something like “You are a nice person, Claire.” Instead, you can say “Claire, the other day I saw you when you helped that elderly lady who was being taken advantage of in the store. You made sure they didn’t overcharge her. That was really admirable of you.”

, You might be feeling a bit nervous about approaching them with this compliment or even scared of what their reaction will be. Practice giving them this compliment in the mirror. Manage your facial expressions as well and try not to look too stern or agitated.


You might even want to practice with a friend.

, When you see this person, you might feel annoyed or stressed. However, you can keep calm if you breathe deeply and slowly; do so by breathing in deeply through your nose, and exhaling slowly through your mouth. You can also try to think of a memory that you have had that can calm you down, like a family trip to the beach., In approaching them, be mindful of the story that your body language is telling. You do not want them to interpret your compliment as being wrapped in aggression. Keep your arms and legs uncrossed, don’t frown or look away, and respect their personal space., Another way to successfully approach and manage the situation is to be as emotionally detached as possible. When complimenting them, pretend that you don’t know them or that you are someone else. Let go completely of anything mean or bad they have said or done in the past and focus solely on the task at hand - complimenting them., Walk up to this person with confidence and peace. Greet them with a “hello” and a smile so they know you are coming to them on friendly terms. You might even want to ask them how their day is going if you are feeling okay in the moment.

, Now is the time to deliver your compliment to them. You might also want to preface it by saying that something has been on your mind that you want to tell them. Then, give the compliment respectfully, calmly, and kindly. When you are doing so, be as honest and self controlled as possible.Say something like “Jess, I know we have had our differences, but I wanted to let you know that I admired what you did in class the other day when you stood up for Arnold. That took some courage and I respect that.”
You might also say something like “So, as you know we’re both in Communications class together and Mr. Chavis gave us this compliments assignment. So I wanted to let you know that I think you dress really well and that you’re smart.”

, This person likely knows that you hate them and might feel a bit confused as to why you are complimenting them. Explain your reasoning to them calmly and truly.You might say something like “I wanted to let you know that I think what you did was awesome because I really care about the issue of bullying. Even though we don’t like each other, I think it’s important to show others that you can be cordial to people even if you don’t get along.”

, Even in being nice to this person, you still might be seething with hate for them when you see them. Keep the fact that you hate them to yourself; avoid mentioning how deeply you dislike them. Allow this moment to be purely about the compliment., After you have spoken, you should give them at least a few moments to respond. They might thank you for your compliment, laugh, say something mean in return, or be in complete shock that you have even spoken to them. Whatever their reaction, let them respond without interruption, unless they begin insulting you.

, Even if they choose to be negative to you after you have made this nice statement, don’t fret. Keep a positive attitude and leave the situation. Know that you have done something that very few people ever do, and find some comfort and joy in that.You can say something like “Andy, I see that my compliment is not being received well. I don’t regret telling you, but I do need to go at this time since you are attacking me. Have a good day.”

Compliment her when she’s not expecting it.,
Be a good listener.,
Send her flirty texts throughout the day.,
Let her know you want her.",How to Make a Woman Feel Sexy2," Point out a specific feature you find particularly sexy about her. Not only will you brighten her day a little, you will also show her you find her attractive no matter what she’s feeling about herself.Letting her know she’s beautiful even when she isn’t expecting to hear it will boost her self confidence and make her feel more attractive. Self confidence will help her feel sexy and desirable.

, Showing that you are interested in more than just looks by listening to her. Actively listening to what she thinks and feels shows her that you love her mind, too, and that you want to truly get to know her. Demonstrating that you know she's more than just a pretty face can make a woman truly feel sexy.


To be a good listener, don't interrupt, put away your phone or turn off the TV, and give her your full attention. Make eye contact and nod to show that you are engaged.
Don't spend the time that she's talking thinking about what you are going to say — this means you are not truly giving her your full attention. Ask follow-up questions like ""That's interesting; why do you think that?"" or, ""Wow, I had no idea. Can you tell me more about that?""

, One of the best ways to make a woman feel sexy is to show her you’re thinking about her. By sending her sweet little texts throughout the day, she will know she’s always on your mind. Flirt with her via text, tell her she’s beautiful, or tell her you can’t wait to see her later.If you are at work and can’t use your phone, you could send her emails, or even leave sticky notes around the house for her to find in the morning or when she gets home.
Your texts or notes might say things like “You looked so beautiful last night,” or, “I can’t wait to see you again after work,” or, “I can’t stop thinking about you.”

, Feeling desired and wanted will help a woman feel sexy. Tell her that you want her. Tell her you find her irresistible. Show her you want her by staring right into her eyes when you tell her these things. Be genuine, and she will notice.Telling her you want her out loud will probably have a more profound effect than if you send it over a text. Make eye contact, take her hand, or run your fingers through her hair while you tell her you want her to make the moment even sexier. Say the actual words: “I want you so badly.”

Bring her small, thoughtful gifts.,
Avoid getting “too comfortable” in your relationship.,
Try not to ask outright for sex or intimacy.,
Try new things in your relationship.,
Work on yourself.",How to Make a Woman Feel Sexy3," Show up at her work with her favorite coffee drink. Have a new set of sexy lingerie waiting for her on the bed when she gets home. Send a bouquet of flowers to her. No matter how small the gift is, it will remind her that she is appreciated and that you are thinking of her, and that you care enough to go out of your way to do something thoughtful for her.Studies have shown that lingerie is one of the top things that make women feel sexy. Simply buying her a sexy bra or pair of panties is a sexy gesture in itself. You’ll be showing her that you want to see her in them, which will make her feel sexy and wanted., The “honeymoon phase” of any relationship doesn’t always have to come to an end. Rather than allowing your relationship to fall into a routine or a rut, make sure you don’t lose sight of what made you fall for her in the first place. Remind her consistently that you want her and desire her, no matter how long you’ve been in a relationship., If you want a woman to feel sexy, build up to it with flirting and touching. Even if you’ve been with her for a long time and feel comfortable just telling her you want sex, she probably won’t feel too sexy just being asked outright. If you get too comfortable and take this comfortability for granted, she might begin to feel less valued and appreciated, even if that's not your intention., Go on dates in new places. If you always go to a certain place for date night, switch it up and go somewhere else. Ask her to get dressed up and take her someplace fancy, or out dancing. Pack a picnic for the park, or even just for the backyard. Take a weekend trip away together. By keeping things interesting and new, you’ll be less likely to lose the spark you had at the start of your relationship., Women are more likely to be turned on by people who take care of themselves, and carry themselves with confidence. Simple things like bad breath or body odor can be huge turn-offs for women, which might make them feel less interested in sex, or feeling sexy themselves. By taking care of your own personal hygiene and putting a good image forward, you’re more likely to keep her attracted and drawn to you.For you to make a woman feel sexy, she has to feel like she wants you, to some degree.

Give the compliment.,
Tell her why.,
Ask a question.",How to Compliment Your Girlfriend2," Compliment your girlfriend on her personality, something admirable she said or did, or how she looks (like her attributes or outfit). Say something like, “You’re very trustworthy. I admire that,” ""You look great in that outfit. Is it new?"" or ""It was really nice of you to help Carrie with her homework.""


You can give a compliment in person, but you can also give it via phone or text message. You do not have to save the compliments up for when you see her. By calling or texting to compliment her, you will let her know that you're thinking about her even when she's not with you.

, Then, tell her why she deserved the compliment. For example, if you compliment her on her trustworthiness, say, “I see that your friends and family confide in you a lot. That tells me that you know how to keep people’s personal matters private, and that you respect their privacy.”You will seem more sincere if you can qualify the compliment.

, To complete the compliment, you can ask a question, like “What made you such an honest person?” Or, you can challenge her by telling her something cute like, “Can you keep my secret? I really like you.”You can also share something about yourself, like, “Growing up, my friends weren’t very trustworthy. It’s refreshing to have someone that you can trust.” You will seem very sincere while making your girlfriend feel great.

Compliment her appearance.,
Admire emotional bravery.,
Tell her she did a good job.,
Ask her how she did something.,
Tell her she’s smart.,
Know what not to say.,
Avoid sexually-charged compliments.",How to Compliment Your Girlfriend3," Complimenting your girlfriend’s appearance once in a while is a great way to make her feel good about herself. But, remember to be sincere. For example, don’t say you like her new haircut, if you actually don’t like it.


Tell your girlfriend that you think she is beautiful. Be specific when you tell your girlfriend that she is beautiful. For example, ""I love your dark brown eyes"" or ""Every time I see you smile, it brightens my day."", You can compliment your girlfriend by admiring her emotional bravery. For example, “I know last week was a really rough week for you. But you were able to focus and put all the negativity aside, and put together a great presentation. Everyone loved it.”, You can compliment your girlfriend by congratulating her on a job well done. These type of compliments will build her self-confidence. For example, “Good job on winning the talent show. I know the competition was fierce!” Or, ""I knew you were going to ace your test. I know you studied really hard for it. You deserve that A."", You can compliment your girlfriend indirectly by asking her how she did something. This way, you can admire her skills and expertise. You can say, for example, “Can you tell me how you studied for the midterm?” Or, “How did you create your own blog?”If your girlfriend is creative, admire her creativity. You can praise her creative touches by saying, “You did a great job on that poster board for the presentation,” or “The painting you gave Emily for her birthday was stunning.”, Compliment your girlfriend on her intelligence, but don’t just say, “You’re smart.” This seems generic. Remember to be more specific when you compliment her. For example, “You really deserved that reward for your paper. It was a thought-provoking and insightful paper.”

, It’s helpful to know which compliments can be misinterpreted or taken the wrong way. Try to stay clear of these comments. The last thing you want is miscommunication between you and your girlfriend, when all you wanted to do was to make her feel good. For example, if your girlfriend struggles with her body image, then you might think that you're helping by frequently complimenting her appearance. However, this may lead to her fixating on it. Some other examples of bad compliments are:“You clean up nicely.” She can misinterpret this as, “You don’t usually look good.”
“You’d be prettier if you smiled more.” This can be misinterpreted as, “You are not pretty.”
Any compliment that ends with, “for a girl.” For example, “You’re smart for a girl,” or “You’re funny for a girl.” These types of compliments are very demeaning to all women and girls.

, Sexually-charged compliments are ones that have sexual overtones, or are ones telling her what you would like her to do. For example, ""I heard you were great at kissing. Can I have a kiss after school behind the gym?""Also, avoid commenting on body parts that are explicitly sexual, like her breasts, buttocks, lips, or tongue. For example, don't tell your girlfriend, ""You have a nice butt,"" ""I like the size of your boobs,"" or ""You're hot."" You can make your girlfriend very uncomfortable by complimenting her in this way.Instead, focus on other attributes, like her hair, skin, eyes, the shape of her nose, or something unique, like her freckles. For example, ""I love your freckles. They are cute.""

"
"
Remember that backhanded compliments are not about you.,
Address back handed compliments.,
Redirect compliments about intrinsic qualities that you do not feel are accurate.",How to Respond to a Compliment2," If someone gives you a backhanded compliment, it is most likely due to their own sense of insecurity and rejection. Instead of hating the person for saying mean things to you, attempt to understand why this person might be so bitter. Understanding that the backhanded compliments are not about you will help you to respond in ways that will put them to a stop., Don’t allow back handed compliments to go by unnoticed. If someone gives you a backhanded compliment, let them know that you understand that it was not really a compliment.Say something like, “I know you might have meant that as a compliment, but it didn’t sound like one. Is there something you want to talk to me about?” This type of response can help you to address the backhanded compliment and open up a discussion about what is causing the person to say these things.

, If someone compliments you on being extraordinarily lucky when you accomplish something, don’t thank them. By thanking them for such a compliment, you are implicitly agreeing with them that you didn’t really work hard for your accomplishment.You don’t have to be rude or aggressive with your response, you can simply say something like, “Maybe I am lucky, but I think that my success on this project was more due to hard work than luck.”

Treat him like you’d treat any other human being.",How to Compliment a Guy2," Compliments don't have any worth other than what we give them — they're not things to be exchanged for favors, used to flatter people we need to like us, or given out for no reason. Compliments are only meaningful when the person giving the compliment truly believes in them. Giving a fake compliment is a white lie at best and, at worst, can be seriously harmful, so don't do it.


For example, let's say that a guy friend has just gotten off stage after bombing at the talent show. If might at first seem like a good idea to lift his spirits with a fake compliment like, ""Wow! That was amazing! Great job!"" However, since he probably knows that he didn't do well, this may make him feel even worse. In this case, it's probably best to go with a sincere option like ""Hey, don't worry. You'll nail it next time.""
Study of the brain shows that we use the patterns and stresses of speech to distinguish white lies from truth more so than non-spoken cues. If you're not being sincere, the guy will hear it in your voice., Most of the time, gracious compliments will be greatly appreciated. However, it's not always appropriate to give compliments — doing so at inopportune times can be slightly embarrassing at best (and a major faux pas at worst). Below are just a few examples of times when you won't want to give a guy a compliment, or at least will want to keep your compliment short and polite:


At solemn occasions (funerals, memorials, etc.)
After he's just been embarrassed
When his jealous significant other is around
When he's concentrating on something difficult
It's worth being aware that some guys can get embarrassed if they receive a compliment (especially a romantic one) when they're in front of their friends. In this case, since the guy is worried about saving face in front of his buddies, your compliment may have the opposite effect as you intended.

, Nothing spells sincerity like a smile! For some guys (especially those who are attracted to you), the simple pleasure of seeing your smile can be a compliment in itself! Even if you have no romantic intentions and you're just happy for your guy friend, a natural, warm smile will make your compliment much more meaningful than one given with a deadpan or gloomy expression. Smiles are simple means to validate someone; When you smile at someone you help to let them know things are okay., When it comes to giving compliments, short is always sweet! Don't ramble on about how nice the guy you're complimenting is, how great his hair is, and so on. Focus on one action or aspect of the guy that you find nice, make your compliment, then carry on as normal. Remember: the more compliments you give, the less memorable each compliment will be.


Long strings of compliments can sometimes give the impression that you have an obsession or crush on the person you're complimenting. Even if this is true, try to avoid it! For example, consider which of the following is likely to win your crush's affection: ""Hey, Dave, you look great! Have you been working out?"" or ""Hey, Dave, you look great! Have you been working out? I noticed that your biceps looked a little bigger. They go really well with your smile. You have fantastic teeth, by the way. They're almost as white as the paint on your car, which, in my opinion, was a really smart color choice...""
American compliments tend to be considerably shorter than other cultures.Length of a proper compliment varies by culture., When in doubt, abide by the golden rule: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""In other words, compliment him the way you would want him to compliment you. Remember, no matter how dreamy or intimidating this guy may seem, he's just an ordinary human being like you. There are things he worries about every day, things he's not good at, and ways that he's not perfect, just like you! So don't be afraid to approach him and give him a compliment when it's appropriate — there's a decent chance he might even be more bashful about it than you.

Compliment his tastes.,
Compliment his skills.,
Compliment his courage.,
Compliment his decision-making.,
Compliment his sense of humor.,
Compliment his intelligence.",How to Compliment a Guy3," Everyone — including guys — likes to hear that they've got good taste. Telling someone that the things they like are cool, fashionable, or intelligent is a subtle way of saying that they have these qualities. For this reason, it's almost always better to compliment the guy's choice rather than directly saying ""You have good taste."" Research shows that men are most likely to compliment a person's possessions.This indicates men may be most receptive to compliments that pertain to their possessions. Below are just a few topics you may want to use for compliments, along with examples:


Movies: ""You have great taste in films. From now on, we're having movie night at your house!""
Music: ""Hey, awesome shirt, man! That band rules.""
Art: ""That poster on your wall? Classic! Where do you find this stuff?""
Literature: ""Hey, you have this book!? That's one of my favorites! Much respect.""
Philosophy: ""Wow, I never thought about things that way. You have some really great ideas.""

, Guys love getting compliments about their skills, especially if the compliment is about something they've taught themselves or something they know how to do that few other people do. For a guy, the praise he gets for a skill he's learned is an added reward for putting in the time and effort necessary to master it.


Research suggests that when both men and women give compliments to men, they favor compliments of skill.For example, if your guy friend is working hard to teach himself guitar but struggling, you might want to make him feel good by complimenting him after one of his impromptu performances: ""Wow! I've never heard ""Wonderwall"" played like that before. I like how rough and heartfelt you made it sound.""

, Guys get scared just as easily as anyone else, but they're often reluctant to show it for fear of looking weak. This is no reason to avoid giving them a compliment for their bravery when they have to do something difficult — if they were afraid, they'll appreciate you having their back, and if they weren't afraid, they'll still appreciate that you thought what they did showed strong character.


Courage is a quality that is considered becoming of men. Studies show that complimenting these culturally scripted gender performances are essential to male friendship.For instance, if a guy recently had to deliver an important speech and you know that he usually has a difficult time with public speaking, you may want to offer a compliment like, ""Congratulations on your big speech! I heard your Remember the Titans analogy really killed.""

, By telling him you think he makes good choices, you're saying that you respect him.Everyone likes hearing that they made a smart decision; no one likes hearing that they made a dumb one. Complimenting a guy on a decision they recently made is a roundabout way of complimenting his instincts and intelligence. It can also help calm the nerves of someone who's still a little unsure that the path he chose was the right one.


For example, if a guy recently decided to accept a scholarship to pursue his passion of studying Polynesian art history, you might compliment him (and simultaneously reassure him) by focusing on the intelligence of his choice: ""Wow. You're really taking the opportunity to chase your dream. Don't worry — I know it'll pan out for you.""
Research on students shows that confidence impacts decisions of gendered persistence in academics., Complimenting a guy's sense of humor is an excellent way to boost his ego — best of all, it works whether you're seriously ""into"" him or you just view him as a friend. On its own, laughing at a guy's jokes is a harmless gesture of appreciation with no romantic implications. On the other hand, laughing while subtly making physical contact or moving close to him can signal your interest, making this a very versatile form of compliment.


Usually, the best way to compliment a guy's sense of humor is simply to laugh (with honest, genuine laughter) at what he says! If you'd like to, you can add your own small verbal compliments in between laughs, but this isn't necessary. You might try focusing on the way the humor makes you feel, like this: ""Ha! Man, I really needed that laugh. Your Dane Cook impression always gets me.""
Research suggests that complimenting a man's sense of humor does not generally cause a female partner to perceive the compliment as a relationship threat., Giving someone a compliment on his smarts is a great way to show that you appreciate him for more than just his surface qualities. As an added bonus, complimenting a guy for being smart can also be a small boost for yourself, depending on how you phrase your compliment — after all, it takes a smart person to recognize intelligence in another.


For example, if your guy friend is helping you with homework, you could simply say, ""Wow, you're so smart,"" but there are more imaginative ways to say this that won't make you look like you're throwing up your hands and submitting to his superior intelligence. A better choice might be something like, ""Wow, you really understand this material. I guess geometry isn't for squares after all!""
In some places, intelligence is more highly valued in men than physical attractiveness. It can be an indicator of social status and earning potential."
"
Compliment some part of his body.,
Compliment his fashion.,
Compliment his health.",How to Compliment a Guy4," Popular culture may not paint guys as being as appearance-conscious as women, but, in reality, some guys can be just as image-conscious (if not even more so). If you're looking to flat-out compliment a guy's looks, try telling him he has a nice smile, eyes, hair, or face. If you want to be more ""forward"", you can also compliment him on physical features like his arms, abs, and so on, but this is usually seen as an open acknowledgment of your attraction to him, so be careful about using this on platonic friends!


Research shows that women are much more likely to compliment men and other women on their appearance versus other attributes.The way you compliment a guy's appearance can also substantially change the meaning of the compliment. For example, if you're complimenting a platonic guy friend, it's probably best to keep things light with comments like, ""You have crazy eyes! There's a million different colors in there!"" On the other hand, comments like, ""Your eyes are like twin oceans... I feel like I could get lost in them"" are probably best left for romance novels or people you're already very close to.
Be aware that it may make their partner feel insecure. Studies show that women are much more likely to feel threatened when someone compliments their male partner's physical appearance., Sharply dressed men are practically begging for attention, so don't be afraid to give it to them. Complimenting someone's dress sense can be especially smart if you know the guy receiving the compliment is self-conscious about the way he looks. While it's fine to simply compliment someone's entire outfit, it's also acceptable to pick one specific part or aspect of the guy's style and focus on that instead.


Take note that men may not appreciate compliments on their fashion. Because it may violate gender norms for a man to care about being fashionable, he may take it the wrong way. By not accepting this kind of compliment, he could be trying to save face.Compliments that reinforce gender stereotypes can cause bad relationships. Research shows that these comments can be depersonalizing.For example, if your guy friend just got a new haircut but is still a little embarrassed to show it off, you might say something like, ""Whoa, check out your new look! Frosted tips will never go out of fashion."" At the same time, this could embarrass him.

, If a guy is really fit, he might want you to notice. If he has been working really hard to improve his health or maintain it, it can be nice to get some feedback. It is nice to hear that other people can tell you're trying to be healthy. Give him some support by giving him a compliment on it. You can even choose to focus on a particular aspect of his health, as opposed to his overall health.


Complimenting a man's level of health can be a good way to avoid making them seem less manly. Health is something most people have to work hard for. Compliments about their body can be redirected in this way to subtly say, “You worked hard.”
For example, if you notice that the guy is no longer winded after climbing up flights of stairs, say, “Hey, you got a lot better at that! I'm still wheezing!”

Understand the key elements of a newspaper headline.,
Try to solve a problem or answer a question.,
Use search engine optimization if you are writing a headline for an online newspaper.,
Identify the key terms in the article to create the headline.,
Use action verbs and the active voice in the headline.,
Put the headline in the present tense if the events are happening now.,
Do not use jargon or slang in the headline.,
Include humor or puns in the headline only when appropriate.,
Do the TACT test.,
Capitalize the first word of the headline.,
Do not spell out numbers in headlines.,
Use punctuation properly in the headline.",How to Write a Newspaper Headline," A good newspaper headline will be factually correct, connect to ordinary readers, attract attention using active words, and match the tone of the article.Accuracy is very important when writing a newspaper headline, as you do not want to create an unintended meaning or confuse your reader. Avoid exaggerating or embellishing the content in the article by using an overblown headline. Instead, aim to communicate clearly with your reader through a short, one to three word headline.;
, The headline will be in large letters on the page and will likely be the first thing a reader will see when they open up the newspaper. You want to draw your reader in by using the headline to pique their interest or curiosity. The headline should motivate the reader to read the rest of the article.Often, readers will be willing to read a headline that provides factual information that will solve a problem they might have or provide the answer to a question. For example, the headline: Lincoln: ‘The war has begun' would be of interest to people reading the newspaper in 1860, as it would answer their question: What is going on with the civil war in the United States?As well, a reader may continue reading an article with a headline like: Make Your Car Engine Sparkle if she is looking to solve the problem of cleaning her car engine.

, Search engine optimization (SEO) is a key element of any headline that will be published online. Your headline should contain focus keywords to make it easier for the headline to be found by search engines. Online newspaper headlines should only contain keywords and be no more than 70 characters, as additional words are considered too long for search engines to index.Keep in mind the expectations for newspaper headlines for online publications have shifted from more traditional rules of newspaper headline writing. Many websites will sacrifice accuracy and information for headlines that over promise or exaggerate a news story. Online newspaper headlines, and some print headlines, are also using emotion to tap into a reader’s curiosity and encourage the reader to read the rest of the article.For example, headlines like: The Cutest Otters on the Internet and You’ll Never Believe Who Prince Harry is Dating Now contain very little actual information and are full of hyperbole. However, these types of headlines are very common in online publications and some current print publications. You may also come across headlines that telegraph emotion, or tap into the reader’s emotions, such as: Daughter Comes Out to Father in Video. His Response Will Make You Cry, or Images of Men That Will Make You Happy on a Monday.
These types of headlines appeal to a certain audience and are usually used for light news stories. Hyperbolic headlines are not recommended for breaking news stories about local events, world events, and social and political topics as they can weaken the professionalism of the article. Rather than appeal to emotion or exaggeration, focus on creating newspaper headlines that inform your reader and that are based on fact.

, Read the article in full and make note of the details in the first paragraph of the article. The key details of the story should be in the first one to three sentences of the article, so look for the key terms in these lines.


For example, in an article about migrants found dead in a truck in Vienna, the first sentence of the article might read: “The decomposing bodies of as many as 50 people assumed to be migrants being smuggled across Europe were found in a truck abandoned on a highway east of Vienna on Thursday, the police said.” You may then highlight key details that should be included in the headline, such as the location of the incident (Austria), the number of people dead (as many as 50), who the people were (migrants), and where they were found (in an abandoned truck). Your headline may then be: Austria Finds Up to 50 Bodies Thought to be Migrants in Truck.Another example is an article on Google and the European Union’s antitrust laws, with the first sentence: “Google on Thursday rejected claims from the European Union’s top antitrust official that the company favored some of its own search results over those of rivals, saying there was significant competition in the region’s online search market and that the company’s services increased choice for local consumers.” You may then come up with a short, clear headline that identifies the subject of the article (Google), the action the subject is taking (denying or rejecting), and who the subject is reacting to (European Union’s accusations of violating antitrust laws): Google Denies Europe’s Antitrust Accusations., A good headline is driven by good action verbs, which are verbs that describe something a person does in a clear and convincing way. Often, simple action verbs are more effective than complex action verbs, for example “use” instead of “utilize” or “show” rather than “demonstrate” or “model”. Prevent confusing your reader by sticking to action verbs that will appeal to the average reader and will not muddle the overall meaning of the headline. As well, you should never start a headline with a verb. The headline should begin with the subject of the article, whenever possible.Avoid verbs like “think”, “believe” or “feel”, as these are not verbs based on fact or statements. The headline should use only factual evidence from the article and should not be based on emotion or uncertainty.An effective headline should also be written with logical sentence structure and a strong present tense verb. Using the active voice will make the headline feel immediate and draw your reader in. For example, a weak headline in the passive voice, with weak verbs, might be: No affair, says Clinton, suggests witness should ‘tell the truth’. A better headline in the active voice, with action verbs, might be: Clinton claims no affair, urges witness to ‘tell the truth’. The second headline is much clearer and the subject of the article (Clinton) is stated first in the headline.You should also avoid using words that could be read as either a noun or a verb. For example, in the headline Violinist linked to JAL crash blossoms, the verb “blossom” can be read as a noun or a verb in the context of the rest of the headline. The reader is not sure if “crash blossoms” refers to the noun “blossoms” or the verb “to blossom”.If you read the article, you will understand the headline is referring to a violinist. Her father dies in a crash, but her career blossoms. The headline only makes sense once you read the article, which means the headline itself is confusing and not useful to the reader.

, The headline should have a time element so it is clear to the reader when the event is taking place. If the event occurred in the recent past and is considered breaking news, for example, Austria Finds Up to 50 Bodies Thought to be Migrants in Truck, you can use the present tense.You likely will not create a headline for an event that happened in the distant past, unless there are new developments in relation to the event. You can use the past tense or the present tense for the headline. For example, Robert Durst Murder Case Reopened in Light of New Evidence or Robert Durst Murder Case Reopens in Light of New Evidence.
Whenever possible, remove articles like “an”, “a”, “the” and connecting terms like “because” or “due to” in the headline. These are considered padding in a headline and are not necessary to get the key points of the article across. For example, The Robert Durst Murder case will be reopened because of new evidence can be shortened to Robert Durst Murder Case Reopens in Light of New Evidence.

, Headline jargon, also referred to as “headlinese”, can be confusing for your reader. Often, headline jargon are also too vague and do not provide the reader with useful information.For example, Syrian head visits Senate. In this headline, “head” is a headlines, as it is not clear if the headline is referring to an actual head of a Syrian or a Syrian who is the head of a department or office.
Similarly, the headline FBI probe expected in hijacking case is confusing as it uses the headline jargon “probe”, but this term does not give the reader any clear information about the actions of the FBI. A stronger headline might be: FBI investigation expected in hijacking case.

, Most news stories on local or world events do not justify a headline that contains humor or a double meaning, such as Austria Finds Up to 50 Bodies Thought to be Migrants in Truck. But some news stories lend themselves to a humorous headline or a headline that contains a pun and it may be appropriate to use a humorous headline for an article that does not involve murder, death, or a catastrophe. Often, optimistic news stories or lighter news stories will use headlines that use humor or double meanings. When it is done properly, a humorous headline can work to draw your reader into the story and give the headline some punch.


For example, a news story on a former environmental disaster zone in Hungary that use reinvented itself as a center for sustainable energy might have a headline like: Town hit by red sludge goes green. This headline works because it is factually accurate, and uses a simple pun (red to green)., Once you have completed your headline, you should run it through the TACT test to confirm it is print ready. The TACT test is Taste-Attractiveness-Clarity-Truth. Ask yourself the following questions in relation to your headline:Is it in good taste? Is there anything possibly offensive in the headline? Can anything in the headline be taken the wrong way?
Is it attractive to the reader? Can it be improved so it is more engaging and interesting, without sacrificing accuracy?
Does it communicate the key points of the article? Is it clear and simple? Does it use the active voice and active verbs? Are there any odd words or double meanings that could confuse the reader?
Is it accurate? Are the proper words or terms from the article used in the headline? Is the headline factually correct?
If you answer no to any of these questions, you will need to rethink the headline and adjust it so it meets the TACT criteria.

, The first word of the headline should always be capitalized, as should all proper nouns in the headline. Some publications capitalize every word of the headline, and some publications do not capitalize every word, just the first word of the headline. You should follow the formatting guidelines for the publication you are writing the headline for.All headlines should be flush to the left and should not take up more than one to two lines in the publication. In general, shorter headlines are best.

, You can start a headline with a number and you do not need to spell out any numbers for most publications.


For example, 3 dead in car crash, or 20 dead in explosion.

, Most headline punctuation follows the standard punctuation rules, with two exceptions: periods and single quotes.Use periods for abbreviations only in headlines. For example, U.S. fights Iranian government.
Use single quotes for any double quotes in the article. For example, Lincoln: ‘The war has begun’, Clinton urges witness to ‘tell the truth’.
You can also use a colon as a substitute for the word “said” in a headline. For example, Lincoln: War inevitable, victory essential.

Figure out what to write about.,
Go to the scene.,
Conduct interviews.,
Transcribe the interviews and speeches.,
Do research on the subject.,
Write a headline.,
Write a byline and place line.,
Use a hard news lead.,
Write the body of your report.,
Include quotes in the news report.,
Always include attributions.,
Write in hard news style.",How to Write a News Report," News reports are about something that is happening now or that just recently happened. Current issues, events, crimes, and investigations are good subjects for news reports. Other styles of journalism are better for things like profiles, advice articles, and opinion pieces.


Ask around for story ideas, especially government officials and public relations representatives.Scan the news to see what is already happening. This could lead to you finding other story ideas that are related.Search your city or county’s website or directory for local events that are coming up.
Attend city council meetings to find out if there are any local issues happening in your area.
Sit in on trials at the courthouse and see if anything interesting happens that you could report on.

, Once you find out what you want to write about, go there. You might need to go to the scene of a crime, a business, the courthouse, or an event. It will be difficult to write about something that you are not present at.


Write down everything you see and everything that takes place.
Record and take notes of any speeches that occur at events. Make sure to get the names of the speakers.

, Who you interview will depend on what you are reporting on. You will want to get a broad range of quotes for your report, so try to interview an array of people. Good people to interview are event coordinators, lawyers, police, business owners, volunteers, participants, and witnesses. If you need to find people to schedule interviews with them, use the internet to find contact information. You can also interview people directly at the scene, depending on your news report topic.


If the story is controversial or political, make sure to get both sides of the issue.
Prepare sample questions, but don’t necessarily stick to them.Think of an interview as a conversation.Record the interview.
Make sure to get the full names (spelled correctly) of anyone you interviewed.

, When you are back at your home or your office, transcribe the interviews and any speeches. Listen to your recordings and type out everything (or at least the most important parts) of the interviews and speeches. This will make finding information for the report and any quotes easier.

, News reports are about what happened in the moment, but it is good to do basic research on the subject. Research any companies, people, or programs that you are reporting on to make sure you have your facts straight. Double check spelling of names, dates, and any information you have gathered to make sure it is correct.

, Your headline should be accurate, clear, and easy to understand. Use key words from the story and keep it straight and plain. Use active and short action verbs in your headline. The headline should accurately lead readers to what the report is about.The headline should be attention grabbing, but not exaggerate or mislead.
Capitalize the first word of the headline and any proper nouns after that.
For example, your headline might read: ""Armed robbery at Portland farmer’s market""

, The byline goes directly underneath the headline. This is where you put your name and clarify who you are. The placeline is where the article takes place and is written in all caps. Use AP Style state abbreviations.


An example of a byline: Sue Smith, Staff Reporter
An example of a placeline: EUGENE, ORE., A news lead (or lede) is the opening paragraph of a report or article and is often considered the most important part. A news report is not the time for a verbose and artful lead. Keep your lead to the point, fitting as much of the basic information as you can into your lead. A lead is only one or maybe two sentences and summarizes the news story; the who, what, when, where, why, and how of you story should be emphasized in the lead.Don't include people's names in the lead (save that information for later), unless everyone knows who they are (i.e. President Obama).
For example: A Seattle man was caught selling stolen cars at his auto shop on Tuesday when a police officer posed as a customer.

, This is going to consist of the facts, but more detailed and specific than in your lead. Use the information you collected and gathered at the scene and in interviews. Write your report in third person and from a neutral perspective. Make sure your story conveys information and not an opinion.

, Quotes can be included in your news report to convey information. Always introduce who you are quoting followed by the exact words that they said. Use their full name the first time you mention them then only use their last name.


For example: Mary Quibble has been the director of the children’s theater for six years. “I love the children and how much they care about these performances,” Quibble said. “There are 76 kids in the programs. They range in age from 7 to 16 years old.”

, Unless the information is common knowledge, always attribute where you got it. You can get in trouble for not giving credit to someone. This is also important in case a fact is wrong, then it will be known who got the fact wrong and that it was not you.


For example: The woman ran out of the house at 11 p.m. when she heard the burglar enter, police said.

, You don’t want to use overly descriptive language when writing a news report. Just stick to the facts and keep the sentences short and concise. Use active language and strong verbs.


Speak in past tense when writing a news report.
Start a new paragraph whenever there is a new thought (this might mean you have paragraphs that are as short as a sentence or two)
Write your news report in AP Style."

Say something positive about their general appearance.,
Compliment them by referring to a vacation or recent time off.,
Focus on their outfit or their sense of style.,
Wait for the person to explain their surgery, if they want to.,
Drop the subject if they do not respond.",How to Compliment Someone Who Had Plastic Surgery1," If you’re worried about offending or upsetting the person, use an indirect compliment instead. Rather than pinpoint a specific body part or area where you think they have had work done, say something positive about their appearance as a whole. Focusing on their general appearance will allow you to compliment them without embarrassing them or putting them on the spot.For example, you may say, “You look great!” or “You are so glowing and vibrant today!”;
, If the person recently went on vacation or took time off, you may focus on that as part of the compliment. This way, the person can give out details as they see fit.


For example, you may say, “You look so refreshed from your vacation!” or “How are your vacation? Looks like you got some much needed relaxation time.”

, Another way to indirectly compliment the person is to focus on their outfit or their overall sense of style. This way, you are complimenting them as a whole, rather than focusing on their plastic surgery.


For example, you may say, ""Love your look today!"" or ""You are looking so put together and confident today!""

, Once you have given the indirect compliment, allow the person to expand on their recent plastic surgery, if they want to. Leave the conversation open to talking about their plastic surgery. Do not pressure them or make them feel they have to tell you more.This may be a good option if you are broaching the subject with someone you do not know well, such as a co-worker or an acquaintance at school. You do not want the person to feel pressured or put on the spot by your compliment.

, If the person appears uncomfortable and is not responsive to your compliment, let it go. Do not try to pursue the conversation or discuss the subject any further. This will only make the person feel more uncomfortable and put you in an awkward position. Instead, apologize to the person for causing them discomfort and move on.Change the subject to something safe, such as a project you are working on at work or an assignment for school. Pick a topic that you know the person will relate to and enjoy talking about more than their plastic surgery.
For example, you may say, “Sorry if my compliment put you on the spot. How’s your day going?” or “Apologies if I made you uncomfortable. Have you completed the assignment for class today?”

If you suspect that the sincerity of the compliment is questionable or the compliment is confusing, you might want to open up an opportunity to explore it.,
Return a compliment later.,
Give credit where credit is due.",How to Take Compliments," If you're uncomfortable receiving compliments, it's likely that you discount compliments and thereby stop the compliments from being made by that person again. The ways of discounting a compliment include: suggesting that it was nothing or that someone else could have done it better, thinking that the person paying you a compliment must be after something from you, being embarrassed and blushing or giving a compliment in return, being sarcastic or insisting that the he or she doesn't mean it. Each of these ways of deflecting a compliment results in putting down both yourself and the giver of the compliment, so they're not actually very giving or kind responses. If you have these problems in relation to accepting compliments, try to see the motivation for discounting compliments in a different light:



Modesty: If you think that you're being modest by deflecting a compliment, think again. Modesty is a virtue, provided it isn't taken to an extreme; like any other trait, it has to exist in moderation. Modesty becomes a noose around your neck when it cripples your style and causes you to overlook what you're good at and the skills that define you. If you feel you need to compare yourself to someone who is always going to be ""better"" than you, then it's time to stop the comparisons, lower the bar of modesty and start respecting the good things about yourself a whole lot more.

Distrust: If you discount a compliment because you lack trust in the motivations of the giver, then you're being aggressive or hostile. You're immediately assuming that this person is being sycophantic and is weaseling their way into your good books just for their own purposes. While there is a possibility from time to time that an occasional person might be telling a white lie, most people are genuine about giving compliments and deciding on whether or not someone is trustworthy on the basis of compliments is a daft approach to life.

Trying to match the compliment: If you feel obliged to give a compliment in return for a compliment, it's likely that you're a people pleaser and that you're trying to self-efface by batting back the compliment. If you think ""I can't keep this compliment, they deserve it more than me!"" and immediately scramble to bat it back to them, then it's possible you're denying the beauty of the compliment you earned based on your own behavior and way of being.;
, An assertive person knows their self worth and appreciates acknowledgement, but neither seeks it out nor rebuffs it when received. More importantly, an assertive response is a recognition that you are worth the compliment and that you are entitled to quell any negative voice that seeks to deflect the compliment.

, In accepting a compliment, you are telling the other person that you trust their judgment, their wisdom and their sense of self. Accepting compliments also tells the other person that you appreciate what they have to say about you. More than anything, focus on receiving the compliment rather than on its content. This helps you to acknowledge the compliment and express appreciation for it being given to you. Most importantly, since giving a compliment is a form of uttering an opinion, stop yourself from disagreeing with it or you risk downplaying someone else's opinion.

, While it's clear that you can deflect or discount a compliment in various ways, you can also respond to a compliment positively in a number of ways. It really depends upon the context that you're in and how you're perceiving the compliment. In particular, you can choose an appropriate response to a compliment depending on whether you'd like to accept the compliment itself at face value, even if you don't agree with it, or if you'd like to accept the compliment's substance and reflect that in your response, perhaps even using it to engage on further conversation.


When accepting the compliment as it is, even if it's not something you agree with, keep the reply simple and stay focused on the fact of receiving the compliment and be appreciative that the person was happy to compliment you. Some examples are:

""Thank you very much"" or just ""thank you"". These are simple, timeless classics that should be easy enough to utter even if the compliment has caught you off guard. If that's all you can think to say, leave it at that.
""Thanks, I appreciate that.""
""Thank you; that's a really lovely thing to say.""
""Thanks - that makes me feel really good.""
""Thanks. That means a lot to me.""
""Thanks, you're a kind person.""


When accepting a compliment in a way that shows that you're appreciative of the substance of the compliment, this can really help to make the person giving the compliment feel that they've hit the right spot. Some examples are:

""Thanks. I'm really glad you noticed that because it's something I'm proud of too.""
""Thanks! I'm so enthusiastic about this project, so it's great to know you're keen too.""
""Thanks. I like it too – that's why I bought it even though I had to save up for ages.""
""Thanks. I had fun making it and it's great to know you like it.""
""Thanks. It has been in my family for generations.""
""Thank you! I tried really hard."" This is a really good response when somebody has praised your effort, as there is never any harm in acknowledging effort and that the outcome wasn't simply a fluke.


It's often good to use the compliment to further conversation. Say something like: ""Thanks! I found it in New Look - it's amazing what you can get there."" That way you've accepted the compliment and moved on to something about which you can both talk.

, When taking a compliment, smiling says a lot without requiring you to say anything. You've probably earned it, so enjoy your moment in the spotlight. Also, pay attention while you're being complimented. If you give a person a half-hearted reply such as ""Whatever"" or ""Mhm,"" don't expect that person to be quick to compliment you again. An expressive ""thank you"" is much better than a dreary ""Uh-huh"".

, This step is absolutely optional because on the whole, this approach is not recommended for the very reason that there is more to be gained from letting insincere compliments float off you unacknowledged than there is by tackling them. Be totally aware that it would be really unfortunate if you have misjudged the compliment and see insincerity where there is none – that could really offend the other person. However, if you feel that you really need to question the compliment, you might approach it like this:


""It just strikes me that you didn't make a sincere compliment then. Are you being open/frank with me when you say that you like what I am wearing/doing/writing/creating, etc? I'd rather know that you're not happy about something I've done/said than to dance around the edges. At least if I know, I can strive to make changes.""

, Remember when a person has complimented you and note that it's nice and courteous to return it in a short space of time. Some people like to compliment straight away, but as discussed above, you do need to be very careful that you're doing this for genuine reasons and not simply as a way of discounting the original compliment made to you. If you're not sure, then don't give a compliment at the time you're given one, but do remember to return a compliment at another opportune moment. In fact, just get into the habit of making regular compliments through seeing the good in others and expressing this openly, as a part of who you are.


Simply say something nice about the person who gave you a compliment. A great way to return the favor is to compliment on something of theirs and smile. Be sure to notice the efforts they put into things; everyone loves having their efforts acknowledged.
If you haven't anything nice to say though, say nothing at all. Keeping your mouth shut is better than conjuring up false reasons to compliment another person.

, Share the compliment with the whole group of friends, family or coworkers. If you couldn't have done something you've been complimented for without them, say so. This is especially important if the person giving the compliment was responsible for your success.

Try to look someone in the eye when you compliment them. This helps show that you mean what you're saying.






Being specific in your compliment will also make that compliment sound more genuine. For example, saying ""That sweater looks nice on you"" isn't nearly as nice sounding as ""Your eyes just sparkle when you wear that color"".

, Make sure what you're saying to someone isn't offensive, even if you ""mean it to be a compliment"". If your compliment is based on their race or their physical appearance, you're venturing into dangerous territory. If your compliment comes with a qualifier (ex. ""You look nice for a...""), you probably should just keep it to yourself.


For example, telling a woman that she looks so pretty when she wears makeup (which implies that she isn't pretty normally). Another example would be racist compliments, such as saying that a guy is ""smart for a black dude"".

, There are some compliments which are inappropriate in certain situations. Make sure you look at the context of what's going on before you compliment someone.


For example, complimenting a female coworker on her appearance after she's just given a presentation is demeaning and belittles the hard work she just put in.
If you're complimenting someone on doing something very well, such as preparing a meal or giving a great presentation, you should try to do it at the time, in front of everyone else. Having witnesses validates the compliment and gives the receiver a feeling of respect.







, Don't turn a compliment towards someone into a conversation about you. This makes you seem self-centered, and like you only complimented them to fish compliments for yourself or make the conversation about you.


For example, don't say something like ""You did such a good job with that thing last week. I couldn't have done that. I'm rubbish at it.""

, The best way to ensure that you sound genuine is to compliment someone when the positive thought comes to you. Basically: speak your mind! If you want to say something nice to someone, just do it instead of planning it out.

, When you're complimenting someone, it's best to focus on complimenting things that are under their control (such as their personality, their accomplishments, etc.). This will help them to feel secure in that positive feedback, rather than creating worry that they might lose the thing that other people find valuable.


For example: ""I love how you interact with little kids. You're so patient!"" or ""You did a great job on that poster! I just can't stop looking at it!""

, You want to actually compliment them, not some inanimate object. For example,""You look fabulous in that sweater!"" is better than, ""I like how that sweater looks on you.""

, If you're trying to come up with something to compliment someone on, try to look at the things that you know they value. Look back on your interactions with them and think about things they talked about, or just pay more attention to this in the future.


For example, if you notice your girlfriend looking sadly at another girl's clothes and saying that she wished she could dress like that, tell her how much you love how she dresses and that you didn't even notice the other girl.

, Another indicator you can look at is what someone struggles with. If they're trying to lose weight, praise their hard work and determination (but not the loss of weight itself). If they put a ton of effort into a report, praise them for the quality.

,


Avoid overly familiar compliments, like compliments about their sexual characteristics.
Compliment things they obviously take pride in, such as a very nice coat, a well-kept car, or a hand-made accessory.
Compliment their actions or something you witness, such as after you see them be very nice to a cashier. This removes most of the creep factor.






Example: ""Thank you for being so kind with that man. It's hard to be patient in that situation. I'm really impressed with how you handled it.""

,


Don't compliment expecting anything in return. Just because you're nice to someone doesn't mean they owe you anything. They don't even owe it to you to be flattered by the compliment.






Compliment them with your actions. In romance, doing something nice for someone can often be more effective than saying something nice to someone.






Sometimes, just telling them how attractive you find them is enough. Especially if they're already dating you.






Example: ""I love it when you smile. It just lights up the whole room.""

,


Keep it appropriate. Awkward work compliments can bring on all sorts of trouble. Use the grandma test: if you wouldn't say it to your grandmother, don't say it to your coworker.






Shoot for compliments on their work. This can also help avoid awkwardness.
Compliment them to or in front of your boss. This shows not only how much you mean it but that you think they are worthy of even higher commendation.
Example: ""Hey, Mr. Banks, did you see how Sally handled that last customer? You would have been so proud. Some of the best customer service I've ever seen.""

Take care not to objectify him.,
Dodge inappropriate topics.,
Watch out for hidden implications.,
Be original.,
Make sure you are certain about the details.",How to Compliment a Guy5," Giving tasteful compliments about a guy's appearance is one thing, but creeping a guy out with rude or suggestive comments about his body is another entirely. Though many guys may be reluctant to show it, their feelings may even by hurt by you objectifying them. Don't make a guy feel like a piece of meat — though this is advice you'll usually hear given to men regarding women, it's just as true the other way around.


Objectification happens when you take a person's appearance as representation of their whole being. This is especially when these attributes should be irrelevant to the situation.Though sparing a guy's feelings should be enough of a reason not to objectify him, there's another reason you shouldn't do it that's more immediate: you can get in trouble. In fact, if your creepy come-ons or unwanted compliments are severe enough, they can constitute harassment, which is a major offense at school or in the workplace and lead to serious repercussions., There are a huge range of topics that are acceptable subjects for compliments, so don't make the mistake of choosing one that's off-limits. In general, you'll want to avoid complimenting guys on things that are very personal or which have strong emotions attached to them, unless you're very close to him.


This advice is especially true if other people are present — while it may sometimes be OK to bring up personal topics in one-on-one settings, you'll almost never want to do it in front of his friends.
Taboo compliments will vary from place to place. It can be considered offensive to compliment a man on his wife., Your compliments should be all about building the guy up, not about subtly tearing him down or making yourself feel better at his expense. Try not to give backhanded compliments — compliments that contain a thinly-veiled insult or a compliment to yourself. Not only are they rude, but also generally quite obvious, so they can easily end up making you look like a jerk in social situations.


Here's an example of a backhanded compliment: ""Hey, did you get a new shirt? It makes you look thinner."" It may seem like you're complimenting him, but you're also saying he normally looks fat.
Research suggests that people are more likely to take these expressions as backhanded when they perceive the person giving the compliment has some insight into what is normal., Don’t use a canned line. Ridiculous pickup lines can be great fun if you're just playing around, but they're terrible if you're genuinely trying to compliment someone. Remember, the best compliments are sincere ones, so, unless this person has really ""been running through your head all day"", you're probably hurting your chances with these sorts of lines.

, Don’t compliment him on something you’re unsure about. If you're wrong about your assumption, you may offend him or hit a sensitive nerve, so it's usually best to play it safe and wait. Here are just a few examples of potentially ""dangerous"" situations where you should tread lightly:


His appearance has recently changed (e.g., he has recently lost a lot of weight in a short time)
You haven't seen him in a long time and aren't sure how his life has changed
You don't know his relationship status
You aren't sure how he feels about current events (e.g. in the field of politics, etc.)

Apologize if they appear offended or uncomfortable.,
Follow the don’t ask, don’t tell rule.",How to Compliment Someone Who Had Plastic Surgery2," Before you compliment the person directly on their plastic surgery, or at all, you may want to consider your relationship to them. Are they good friends of yours? A family member? An acquaintance? If you know the person well, you may feel more comfortable complimenting the person on their plastic surgery directly. If you know them in passing or on a more casual level, complimenting them may not be appropriate or comfortable for either of you.


Consider your comfort level around the person as well as how well you know them. If you think they may be offended by a compliment about their plastic surgery, you may opt to not say anything. If you feel they might appreciate the compliment, you may decide to say something.

, Once you have weighed your relationship with the person, you can decide if a compliment about their plastic surgery is appropriate. Thinking long and hard about your relationship with the person may help you decide that giving them a compliment about their plastic surgery will not offend them.You can try giving the person an indirect compliment that addresses their general appearance, such as ""You are looking great today!"" or ""You look amazing.""

, Not everyone will appreciate a direct compliment, no matter how nicely worded it is. Be okay with someone reacting negatively to your direct compliment, especially if they want to keep their plastic surgery secret. Do not expect the person to respond in kind, especially if you do not know them well and they seem to want to hide their plastic surgery.


Be prepared for a snappy comeback from the person if they do not appreciate your compliment.

, If the person appears upset or uncomfortable by your compliment, apologize. Say ""I'm sorry"" or ""I apologize if my compliment offended you."" Apologize as soon as you realize they are upset or offended. Be sincere when you apologize. Make eye contact with them and speak clearly.


The person may be so offended, they do not respond or acknowledge your apology. Be okay with this. Let the person know you would be willing to make it up to them in some way. Then, move on from the issue. It may take them time to accept your apology.

, If your indirect compliment ended up offending or upsetting the person, you may want to follow the don’t ask, don’t tell rule in the future. Some people do not want their plastic surgery to be obvious or commented on by others. Even if you notice someone has gotten work done, don’t ask unless they instigate the conversation.Often, people who are comfortable discussing their plastic surgery will bring it up first. Waiting for the person to tell you about their surgery can make it more comfortable for you to compliment them and talk about their plastic surgery with them in more detail.

Research your state law’s treatment of non-compete clauses.,
Provide valid consideration.,
Use the clause reasonably.,
List the information covered specifically.,
Include specifics about prohibited activities.,
Describe the interest you want the clause to protect.,
Outline the penalties for violation of the agreement.,
Specify how long the restrictions will last.,
Set different periods for different restrictions in your clause.,
Define the geographic area where restrictions apply.,
Consider creating zones with varying degrees of restriction.",How to Write a Non Compete Clause," Typically, the law where the employee lives will apply.


Courts don’t like non-compete clauses. If your clause is challenged and you’ve included a provision that another state’s law applies, the judge may strike it with regard to the non-compete clause.In some states, such as California, non-compete clauses are illegal. Other states such as Texas have laws that support employees over employers with regard to these clauses.If you’re unsure about the law in your state, consult an attorney first. A business attorney will be up-to-date with any trends in the law and know how courts are handling cases with these contract provisions.;
, Even if non-compete clauses are valid in your jurisdiction, no contract or agreement is legally enforceable without consideration.


If the clause is included in an initial employment contract, the offer of employment typically provides consideration for the entire contract including the clause.
If you’re asking an employee or contractor to sign the clause separately after they’ve already started working, it must have additional consideration such as a raise or promotion., Your non-compete clause does not need to become boilerplate in all of your employment contracts, and should be used sparingly.


Analyze the position of every employee you ask to sign a non-compete clause. Only use the clause for those who actually play a large role in your company and have significant access to valuable information.
General agreements signed by every employee usually won’t hold up in court if challenged.The purpose of the clause should be to protect your information and keep former employees from using it to their personal advantage, not to punish employees for leaving., Non-compete agreements also have a confidentiality component, and keep former employees from using sensitive business information to their own personal benefit or disclosing it to competitors.Non-compete agreements typically include a provision that an employee who leaves the company will promptly return any manuals, customer lists or other documents to the employer., You don’t want to prohibit former employees from engaging in too many types of businesses. Stick to activities that would significantly harm your business.


Some standard prohibited activities include soliciting the company’s clients, attempting to hire the company’s employees or encouraging other employees to leave, or competing with the business directly as the owner of a similar business.For example, if you own a cupcake bakery, you may have your head baker sign a non-compete clause which forbids her from opening her own cupcake bakery across the street from yours using the same recipes she used to bake cupcakes for you.

, Your primary interest should be in protecting the investment you’ve made into researching and developing your processes and client base.


The legitimate purpose of non-compete clauses is to keep someone from taking advantage of your employee training to learn all of your secrets, then open their own shop using those secrets and put you out of business.
Beyond simply identifying key trade secrets you want to protect, emphasize the time and effort you’ve invested in building those assets.

, You will have to go to court to enforce the agreement, but specifying particular remedies in the clause itself may lessen the risk of having your lawsuit thrown out.


Specifying injunctive relief allows you to go to court and have the judge issue an order for the employee to cease whatever activities violate the agreement.
You can also specify particular damages or require the violator to pay your court costs and attorney’s fees., The length of time restrictions last is one of the most important factors for judges in determining whether the clause is reasonable.


Generally, a non-compete clause effective for six months to two years will be considered reasonable.
A judge would look closer at any period longer than two years to determine if it was really necessary.However, reasonable duration depends on the facts of the case, and some circumstances may call for a longer restrictive period. For example, if the goal of your non-compete clause is to protect confidential client lists, your clause should last as long as that information would legitimately have value., Some aspects of your business may have value for a longer term than others, and a clause that reflects that may be more likely to be enforced.


For example, you may restrict former employees from using confidential information for a period of two years, but restrict other activities only for six months.
Keep in mind that in many states, courts will simply void the clause in its entirety rather than modifying it. This means that if a judge thinks the restrictions last too long, he will refuse to enforce the clause at all rather than only enforcing it for a shorter period of time., Courts in every state have held that non-compete agreements are only enforceable if they are limited to a specific geographic location.


Use specific language when describing the geographic scope of your clause’s restrictions. For example, instead of writing that the former employee may not perform certain activities “in this county or any surrounding county,” list the names of the specific counties in which the restriction applies.
Appropriate geographic scope depends to a large extent on what the employee does for you and what she’s likely to do when she leaves.To return to the cupcake shop example, you might restrict your head cupcake baker from opening her own bakery or becoming head baker for a competitor within a few blocks of your cupcake shop. However, a non-compete clause seeking to restrict your cashier from becoming a cashier at another cupcake bakery would likely be void.
Your clause is more likely to be upheld if its geographic scope is as narrow as possible.Courts typically won’t enforce a clause that attempts to prevent former employees from working in locations where you don’t do business., Just as you may want to restrict certain activities for longer periods of time than others, there may be some activities that are less permissible the closer they are to your primary location.

It can be extremely helpful to keep a journal, tracking your feelings as relationships unfold, or to start a journal now to reflect on the past.;
, Do you date people who are distant or indifferent, or do you date people who care about you? What are your feelings before, during, and after relationships breakup? Do you love the people who are good to you, or are you leaving them because you have no feelings for them? Do you feel ""less than"" everyone around you?

, Most people are terribly afraid of vulnerability. To let someone near enough to see your faults, flaws, and failures is a terrifying idea. But you can't protect yourself from rejection or dismissal without also protecting yourself from love and being cherished.

, We are made to build connections with one another and to exchange energy. You can't spend all your time giving to your partner without ever letting them give you love, too. And you can't spend all your time giving love to a partner that is indifferent and distant. And you can't shrink yourself to minimize the effect of your existence.

, Do you find that you make yourself as small as possible in relationships in order to try to maintain a balance? This could show itself in many ways. For example, starving yourself, slouching, speaking less and less, losing your own sense of will and ambition to cater to the other person's will instead. Self-harm and suicidal thoughts can also be a sign that you are trying to lose yourself to make space for others.

, Have you always been certain that your parents, extended family and friends truly loved you, even when you make mistakes or behave in an ""unusual"" way, or were you met with constant criticism every step of the way, and made to believe that you were never enough?

, Being loved unconditionally today will not fix the memories from your childhood of being unwanted or mistreated. Until you can fully deal with the past, and the fears and worries that you've accumulated from it, you will not be able to let anyone love you. You might even seek out relationships where there is no love.

, There are so many lies we're told in our lives that we let ourselves believe without questioning them. And there are so many lies we tell ourselves, too. Maybe you've always believed that you are not enough, or not worth loving. Maybe you think your flaws are too big for anyone to overcome, or that even though you recognize your worth, nobody else will.

, Eventually you will be able to recognize lies and challenge them immediately, but for now, deal with the past and rebuild your understanding of the world.

, Avoid feeling guilty for being cared for and cherished. Put yourself in the position of the people who love you: if your friend needed something from you (care, advice, love, anything) you would give it to them without thinking twice. Try to afford yourself the same generosity.

, Perhaps there is a potential love interest or a close friend whose behavior is unpredictable- one week they love you, the next they are too cool for you. You do not need people like this in your life. You deserve people who cherish you, accept you, appreciate you, and leave space for you to grow.

, There are good relationships, and you need to practice accepting the love that you are freely given. This takes time.

, It is not a favor to be treated like a human being. You deserve to be treated fairly.

, Some days will be better than others, but if you can learn to see every day as another opportunity to open yourself up more to the people who love you, mistakes and bad days won't feel as bad. You are always learning and there is so much room to grow.

When in doubt it is always better to cast a wide net and sort through the responses., The idea here is to show how your interests shape your life instead of just listing everything out. In the main text area provided by the website, write a story in which you weave in details about your personality and hobbies. The more details that you can provide the better.For example, if you enjoy dancing and travel you could describe your ideal salsa dancing date in Spain.

Just avoid using too many exclamation points at the end of your jokes as excess punctuation turns people off., If you are looking for a quick hook-up, be upfront and say so. If you are looking for a long-term commitment, don’t be afraid to let everyone know. This along with including information about your age and occupation gives potential partners a better idea as to whether or not you would be compatible.If you want something long-term it is still best to resist mentioning how many kids you want or how much money you want your partner to make.

You may feel nervous being around someone if you are in a toxic relationship, as you're constantly stressed about setting them off.Are you always anxious in this person's presence? You may feel like you need to walk on eggshells to maintain stability. A toxic person becomes angry or emotional easily.
Do you enjoy spending time with this person? You may find yourself dreading get togethers with this person. You may feel like you have to psych yourself up for a get-together.;
, This is especially important if you're in a romantic relationship. Toxic romantic relationships often involve a lot of control and isolation.Your partner may ignore your requests or make decisions for you. You may feel like your partner has a ""my way or the highway"" mentality. It can be little things, like insisting on choosing restaurants, or larger things, like dictating how you spend your time. A romantic partner may, for example, pressure you into giving up certain hobbies and interests.
You may also feel isolated in a romantic relationship. Your partner may insist you only spend time with him or her. He or she may try to keep you from forming relationships with others or spending time with your family. For example, your romantic partner may say he or she dislikes a certain group of friends, and discourage you from hanging out with them.

, In a toxic relationship, good times can become increasingly difficult to enjoy. As every day is a challenge, you are always fearful of an emotional outburst or argument.For example, you and your boyfriend go to brunch with friends. While he is difficult and moody when getting ready, he's pleasant at the restaurant. Everyone seems to be having a good conversation and enjoying themselves.
However, you find you cannot quite enjoy the moment. You may worry what will happen when you get home. Will your boyfriend be mad about something you said? You also may worry the good moment will not last long. Your boyfriend is the type to get angry quickly, and you're worried a tiny indiscretion may set him off and ruin the good time.

, Toxic relationships can make you feel bad about yourself. When you interact with this person, do you leave the situation feeling bad about yourself?You may feel bad or ashamed about yourself a lot. A toxic person may put you down for small errors and indiscretions.
After spending time with this person, you may feel drained and sad. The person may be very critical of you and your behavior. You may have lingering negative feelings about yourself after spending time with the person.

, When trying to determine if you are in a toxic relationship, it may be helpful to look at what a positive relationship should be like. Try to determine if your relationship has any of these elements. If it lacks them, then it is likely that you are in a toxic relationship. In a good relationship, you should feel:


Valued, loved, and cared about.
Comfortable trusting them and being vulnerable, such as by sharing secrets.
Appreciated for who you are, not just what you do or provide.
Free to communicate honestly and voice your true opinions., In a toxic relationship, a lot of blame is placed on you. The other party's behavior is never his or her fault.The other person may be very manipulative. He or she may blame bad behaviors on you. He or she may say things like, ""You make me jealous and I can't control myself."" The other person may also say you're ""too sensitive"" or that you ""need to lighten up.""
For instance, you stay out late with friends and your girlfriend berates you for hours when you get home. Later, when you explain she hurt your feelings, she does not apologize. Instead, she says, ""You know I've been cheated on in the past. I can't help that I get jealous easily, and you don't pay enough attention to me. If you spent more time with me, I wouldn't be as jealous.""

, Toxic people are unable to manage conflict effectively. While no one conducts themselves perfectly in a relationship, a toxic person will treat your indiscretions with undeserved contempt. Do you feel like this person is particularly insulting or biting with you? If so, you may be in a toxic relationship.

Contempt is a highly destructive form of criticism. Instead of merely saying, ""Your behavior upset me,"" a toxic person will tear you apart. In a toxic relationship, you may be ridiculed or insulted for certain behaviors.
For example, you are late getting to your boyfriend's house after work as you had coffee with a co-worker. Your boyfriend may respond with a great deal of contempt. He may say things like, ""You're unbelievably careless"" or ""You have no respect for me or other people."" While being late can be rude at times, this level of contempt is uncalled for.

, In a toxic relationship, conflict is not dealt with healthily. A toxic person may stonewall you. This means he or she will simply ignore you when angry or upset.Stonewalling can be in the form of physical neglect, the silent treatment, or leaving without saying anything.
For instance, your boyfriend wants you to cuddle with him in the mid-afternoon. You're busy with work, and tell him ""No."" He leaves the house abruptly and does not return your texts or calls throughout the day. This is a form of stonewalling.

, Toxic people are unable to take responsibility for anything, including their own actions and feelings. If you confront a toxic person about his or her behavior, he or she will become defensive and make excuses.In a toxic relationship, bad behavior is rarely acknowledged. The other person may say things like, ""I don't think I did anything wrong."" He or she may also make an excuse rather than offering an apology. For example, ""You know how stressed I get after work. I wasn't myself when I yelled at you.""
In a toxic relationship, you are made responsible for another person's behavior and feelings. A toxic person is unable or unwilling to acknowledge he or she controls his or her own behavior.

, Many of the signs of a toxic relationship can be abusive. Sometimes it can be difficult to spot abuse when you are in the midst of it, but there are some ways to tell.


If you suspect that you are being abused emotionally, verbally, or in other ways, then talk to someone about it and get help to get out of the relationship.

, If you are in a toxic relationship, then you may face some challenging situations as you work to get out of the relationship. A therapist can help you to navigate these challenges. Choose a therapist in your area who has experience helping people with these types of relationships.

, It is important to make your voice heard. You do not want to let a toxic person walk all over you. In the moment, assert yourself to avoid being pushed around.When a bad behavior arises, tell the person how you feel. Use ""I""-statements, which reduce blame. State how you feel, the behavior that leads to that feeling, and why you feel the way you do.
For example, your boyfriend yells at you for returning a text a few hours late as you were out with a friend. When he starts to yell, say, ""It makes me feel isolated when you guilt trip me spending time with others because I need a social life for my emotional well being and I feel you don't respect that.""

, Toxic relationships often don't change over time. Toxic people often fail to recognize their detrimental behavior. If a relationship is continually draining, end it.Be honest with yourself. Do you actually like spending time with this person? Do you feel drained around this person? Do you actually like this person?
You can confront the person directly or send an email or text. Use your words carefully. You can be assertive without being aggressive. For example, ""I'm sorry, but I just don't think we're good for each other as friends. I think it's best if we don't have anymore contact.""
If a relationship is not actually benefitting you, you should end it. You should surround yourself with positive people who genuinely care about you.

, This can help counteract the effects of a toxic relationship. If you have a toxic relationship you can't escape, like one with your boss, this is especially important.Hang out with people who build you up. If you feel energized and good about yourself when you're around a certain friend, spend time with him or her. Get coffee with a co-worker who is consistently positive.
Do not waste your time with people who are not nice to you. You deserve to be around positive people who treat you with respect.

, If you've just ended a toxic relationship, this can help. You should have a lot of hobbies that keep you from ruminating over the relationship.Do things you enjoy. If you love movies, make a point of watching a movie every night. If you like to read, stop by a bookstore and pick up a few new books.
Engage in hobbies. You can try taking up a new hobby, like knitting, in order to stay busy.

Look into the camera.,
Smile!,
Be the only person in your primary profile pic.,
Throw in a few “action” shots.,
Include “social shots” of you out with friends.,
Use only high-quality photos.",How to Write a Good Online Dating Profile2," Eye contact establishes trust and makes you appear more reliable and friendly. The best photos will show you gazing straight ahead and giving your full attention to the camera and, by proxy, to the current profile reader.Sunglasses are a great look for many people, but they also make you appear closed-off and cold. Limit yourself to only one sunglasses shot in your profile.
A natural look is always nice with facial shots. But if you simply feel more comfortable and ""you"" in make-up, then by all means put some on. Just make sure to keep it light and as close to natural looking as possible.

, Polls show that 96% of people respond more positively to a big smile (showing teeth) than to a sexy closed-mouth smirk or pout. Smiling makes you more accessible and it conveys your happiness to others. It is not necessary to include only smiling photos as that may seem odd with action shots, but do try to trend toward the smiley., Your main profile image should be all about you. It will let your potential admirers know how to identify you immediately amongst your other photos. Use a shot that shows off your best physical attributes. The more of your face and body that is visible the better.


It is really tempting to use a selfie, but try to find a photo alternative. Selfies can seem a bit anti-social and the mirror ones often appear staged., Add a few photos of you doing something that you love. Do you love baseball or softball? Show a picture of you in the batting cage. Do you rock climb? Post a pic of you heading up to a peak. These shots will draw in people with similar interests to you.The action shot is a good opportunity to show your whole body as well, which is a near-to requirement for online profiles., Add one or two shots of you with a group of friends or family. Avoid the late-night bar pics and instead post something showcasing your extended social network. This shouldn’t be your first pic, but it is a good middle option.Consider blocking out your friends' faces if you know that they prefer to keep a low profile online. You can do this with free online photo editing tools.

, No one wants to look at a bunch of blurs. Post images that are clear with a good, distinct background. Bright colors and lighting are especially good. They are automatically associated with happiness and summery fun.When asked to compare the people in summertime versus winter pics the summery photo subjects were consistently judged to be more attractive and fun.Professional photos can be a good option as long as they are not awkward or too staged.However, avoid using a professional photo taken with a flash as it can add up to 7 years to your appearance."
"
Focus on the positive.,
Stay honest.,
Be confident, not arrogant.,
Use sexual innuendos sparingly.,
Avoid clichés like the plague.,
Leave nothing blank.",How to Write a Good Online Dating Profile3," Revise your profile and edit out all depressing or downer material. Most people are not looking for a partner in misery. It helps to focus on what you do want, not on the deal breakers. Tell your readers that you “love hiking and being outside” not that you “hate the indoors.”Don’t discuss your ex in your profile. Nothing kills a romantic mood quicker than rehashing the past. These are all conversations that can take place if your relationship progresses.Don’t write about how you are so surprised to be considering online dating. This can come off as dismissive and superior to those folks who are considering it a viable option (which includes you at this point!)., The goal is generally to meet up with someone so if you lie it will eventually catch up to you. Look for someone who accepts you as you are, not some fantasy version of you. Provide an accurate age or age range. Include recent photos on your profile., Posting an online dating profile can make you feel vulnerable and some people respond to this by pushing aside modesty. Try to avoid the appearance of bragging in your profile, especially regarding your personal appearance. Write about your hobbies without overly praising your own abilities too.You might say, “I find that playing the piano is a great way to unwind at the end of the day. I’m actually pretty good at it too.”

, Unless you are after a one-night stand and nothing more, be very cautious about how you employ sexual references. Everything from your online handle to your hobbies could be interpreted the wrong way unless you closely edit them., It is not good if your final profile reads like an old-fashioned dating ad. Even if you like long walks on the beach, you may want to leave that for a later conversation. Focus instead on what makes you stand out from the crowd.Instead of saying that you enjoy eating with friends perhaps mention your favorite restaurant and dish. Or, recount a favorite dining story.

, “I will tell you later” comes across as more lazy than mysterious. Fill all of the blanks in your profile out, even if you have to get a bit creative with your information or approach. This tells profile readers that you are willing to put the time and effort into a potential relationship."

Set up a meeting.,
Show him the changes you've made.,
Let him know that you're available.,
Connect your life with his.,
Ask him to begin seeing you again.,
Be yourself.",How to Win a Guy Back After Being Dumped," Really ask, why? Think about the kind of self-image that he gives you. Does he speak well of multiple traits (at least a few) that you have? If he gives you a bad self image, perhaps you should just move on.


A partner that is a bad influence, encouraging you to drink heavily, ignore your responsibilities and/or make unhealthy choices, is someone better left in the past.
Can he experience happiness with you -- your successes or the little things that add meaning to your life?;
, Reflect on the circumstances of the break-up. How did he act during the break-up? If he was willing to tell you why he broke up with you, then you can easily identify the reason(s) (unless, of course, the break-up was the generic ""it's not you, it's me""); if it was a cut and go break-up, there maybe something that he doesn't feel he can tell you or doesn't want you to know. Either way, figure out what he wasn't getting out of the relationship.


Playing the field is a major reason for cut and go break-ups. Young men often feel that they need to prove their sexual prowess by dating a certain number of women.He could simply be interested in another woman. In this case men will often become unresponsive and lose interest in the things that they had originally found attractive in you.
Simply not having time for each other will cause a break-up also.

, Once you've identified the reason(s) for the break-up, attempt make the changes that need to made. If your partner directly told you the reason for the break-up, great, apply that to how you improve yourself; otherwise make improvements related to why he broke up with you.


Don't make any changes that could negatively affect your life.
Take time improving yourself. You need to properly make the necessary changes to win him back.

, Try contacting him through whichever method of communication was most often used during the relationship (texting, phone calls, email).


To start, convey an interest in his well being. For example, ask him, ""how have you been?""
If you can't get in contact with him, try sending him a letter explaining the changes you've made.

, Find a place that's comfortable for the two of you -- someplace that offers privacy -- so that you can talk about the changes you've made.


Avoid places where you might consume alcohol. You both need to be clear minded.
Don't try to turn this into a date. It needs to be short and to the point.

, Talking to him about the changes that you've made is a great first step -- just make sure that you can follow through.


Use your ability to persuade him into a constructive position where you can talk to him about the relationship problems -- be specific, talk about what you've done and need, and do not rehash negative issues.Don't corner him or make him feel that he has to be with you. Guys hate that.
Anger is self-absorbed and a waste of time. Avoid it at all costs., While you don't want to put him in an awkward position, it's good to show him that you want him back. Being straight forward is good, but don't overwhelm him

, Have some interests like sports, clubbing, etc. that you share with him. Finding shared interests a participating in them is a good way to keep seeing him.


Be willing to try things that he's familiar with, but are new to you.
Sometimes you just won't share particular interests. That's okay, but still take time to support what he cares about.
This is a great way to bridge the gap between talking to him about how you've changed and beginning to see him again.

, You may want to ask this at the beginning or once you've spent time together. It all depends when you feel that you have showed him that you've changed


Again, don't corner him in these type of situations.
Don't get excited and anticipate an immediate yes. Give him time to think.

, While it's important to make changes to yourself, being the person that you're comfortable as is important, also.Expect him to respect that if you want the relationship to work out.

Respect her!,
Listen to what she says.,
If she's going to audition, go with her!,
Bring her little gifts, on ever occasion.,
Hold hands in public, no matter how silly you feel.,
Try something new with her!,
If she sings and you sing, sing a song together at a choir performance or anywhere your allowed to legally sing!,

Make sure the love is true to you and her.",How to Treat Your Girlfriend Like a Celebrity," Show her how much you care by respecting her opinions and not making fun of what she says. If you two have the same likes and dislikes, that's good! But do try to get used to what she likes to do and eventually try it for yourself.;
, Girls do talk a lot about how they feel towards you, friends, family and if she's upset, let her vent to you. Make sure she's comfortable with telling you the bad things and the good things. If she cries, wipe away her tears and hug her while holding her hand. Make her feel safe with you! Not insecure.

, Even if the people make you stand outside of the door while she's waiting or performing, always, always, ALWAYS be there with her. No matter what audition, even if you hate what she's trying out for, stand by her side and protect her.

, Examples? Well, on Valentine's Day, bring her a lovey build a bear. On Halloween bring her some sweet treats. On Christmas, make her feel special by bringing her a little rain deer(Fake of course) from Santa! On her birthday, you cannot forget it's her birthday! She will cry. Bring her a thing she likes!

Decide that you actually respect her.,
Make a separate list of all the things that you respect about this girl.,
Sort the things that you admire or respect into groups so that your letter has some sort of organised body and won't just sound like a list of bullet points.,
Start the letter as you would any other letter.,
Write the body of the letter.,
Write a conclusion.,
Give her the letter.",How to Write a Letter to a Girl Outlining Your Respect for Her," If you don't think that she is worth your respect, then don't write her a phony letter about it.;
, Focus on character traits, not her looks. This list is separate from your letter so that you can refer to it as you write, in case you forget or overlook something while writing.


Things that you respect can be any personal quality or action that is not a physical attribute. Instead of telling her that she has pretty hair or clothes, tell her that you admire her creativity or sense of taste. Instead of telling her that she is a great athlete, tell her you respect her drive and perseverance.

, Examples of categories to include are: personality traits, talents and abilities, and her opinions.

, Tell her who you are, why you are writing, and what you are writing about. Put your personality into it, but don't say anything too serious, like confessing your undying love for her or admitting how much of your day is spent thinking about her. Just stick to what you want her to know, that you respect and admire her, and you want to tell her about it. She will appreciate being seen as an actual person rather than a sought after prize.Image:Write a Letter to a Girl Outlining Your Respect for Her Step 4.jpg
, Take your categories and write one to three sentences for each trait within that category. Give specific examples of her demonstrating these traits, if you can think of any. This will let her know that you pay attention to what she does. If she has ever been particularly nice or helpful to you, or has impacted your life in a major way (not counting losing sleep), this is a good time to mention it. She will be happy that you don't take her for granted.


Do not list examples that may seem stalker-like while you are describing her. Stick to things that are common knowledge, like an achievement that received recognition or something that all of her friends would know. If you admit to knowing something that she doesn't expect you to know, you run the risk of scaring her off.

, The conclusion of your letter should be a short summary of what you respect about her and how it makes you feel. Once again, if your feelings are particularly strong and she does not know it yet, introduce this concept gradually. For the purpose of this letter, downplay strong romantic feeling to ""I like and admire you and want to get to know you better"" status. Finish with a closing like, ""respectfully yours, (your name)"".

, All you have to do now is make sure that she gets the letter. The best way to do this is to hand it to her in person. Actually, that is the only way to make sure that she gets it. If you leave it somewhere for her to find, it make get moved or she may ignore or fail to notice it. If you give it to someone else to give to her, they may read it first or just forget to give it to her. Pluck up your courage and just hand her the thing. Barring that, you could mail it to her in theory, but then you would have to explain why you want her mailing address. Good luck and happy writing.

This is that big milestone talk when both people decide if they are just friends or if they are more than friends-- and if they're more, what they are exactly.It's often impossible to understand where you stand in a romantic relationship unless you talk it through. A DTR gets your feelings out in the open and takes you from ""just friends"" to ""dating"" or an official ""couple.""
It might be time to have a DTR if you are considering dating other people or if you are considering getting physical (or already have).;
, Having a conversation about the state of your relationship is not something to do in text messages or in a group setting. It's best to have important conversations in person so you can gauge the other person's reactions.Sometimes it is ok to have a conversation in writing, for instance if you are very shy or afraid of putting the other person on the spot. In these situations, write out your feelings in a long-hand letter instead of typing or texting it. It will allow you to really convey your feelings in a personal way while still having the advantage of being able to edit your words before you send or deliver your letter.

, Tell the person how you feel about them, and ask them how they feel about you. It is not necessary to ask for a commitment. You can simply ask the person how they are feeling about the time you spend together, and find out if they are interested in you as more than friends.


Avoid being overly dramatic or trying to be especially romantic when you tell someone how you feel for the first time. While it might be cute in a movie, it really puts someone on the spot to have you declare undying love when they thought you were just friends. It's better to be honest but a bit reserved if you think you're falling in love with them.
Try saying something like, ""I love how much time we spend together. Is it just me, or are there some confusing feelings going on here? I think I'm starting to like you as more than just a friend. What about you?""

, If your friend was not aware that you have feelings for him or her, your DTR conversation may have come as a surprise. Give your friend time to process this information and consider their own feelings instead of making them tell you how they feel in the moment.


In some situations, for instance if you've been physically affectionate with this person, it might be ok to ask them to tell you what their intentions are if things are going to continue. But if you've only been friends to this point, they will most likely need some processing time.

, In any relationship, every participant should know what the expectations are in order to avoid feelings of being used or neglected.


If you're dating someone, it is important that both partners are on the same page when it comes to issues like how often you will see each other, how often you'll talk or text, how physically intimate you will be, and whether or not you will date other people.
In marriage and work relationships, it is important to understand each person's role and responsibilities to avoid feelings of resentment or confusion.

, Every relationship can be improved just by improving communication. Unfortunately, most people don't learn how to communicate effectively as they grow up, so it can be difficult to have important conversations or stand up for yourself if you don't make a concerted effort to learn the basics of effective communication.


In a relationship, you should approach conflict and disagreement with the perspective that you are a team. Instead of viewing a disagreement as your chance to prove a point or win an argument, try to think of it as a challenge to come up with a mutually-beneficial solution.
Don't sit on negative feelings for too long without expressing them to your partner. Otherwise, you could become resentful. If you find yourself angry or sad about the relationship, think about why you're feeling that way and then talk to your partner about it. Let them know how you feel and what you think could help.

, We are often taught to put other people before our own needs, and being selfless in a relationship can be a great feature. However, you should not sacrifice your own needs or happiness to satisfy someone else. You'll end up burned out and disappointed.


Take time for yourself to recharge when you need to. It's ok to have a night out with just your friends, or take an evening to read by yourself when you want to.
Don't be afraid to tell your partner what your needs are.

, Relationships of all kinds should make you feel good about yourself and happy that you know the other person. Sometimes, though, relationships become a burden and can even affect your state of mind. If your relationship is dysfunctional, it may be time to sever ties or seek counseling. Watch for these warning signs in any relationship:One person has more power or control than the other, and demands that the other person does what he or she says or wants. This can include limiting who the other person can spend time with, how they spend money, or how physically affectionate they are.
One person (or both) becomes emotionally manipulative and tries to get the other to respond by creating feelings of guilt, pity, or jealousy
One person is a giver and the other person is just a taker. For example, a friend may always expect you to drop your plans for them, get them out of a bind, or be physically affectionate with no commitment.

, As we go through life, we will meet a variety of people and will build complicated, personal relationships with them. There are various types of relationships such as friend, work, romantic, and family relationships.


It is important to remember that relationships are as individual and different as the people who are a part of them. There are different expectations in every relationship. Sometimes, these expectations are made clear by talking about them, but other times they are just unspoken rules that develop as people spend time together.

, Friendships are platonic, meaning there is no sexual interest involved. These relationships fulfill our needs as humans to be around other people who we feel are similar to us and feel valued, secure, and appreciated for who we are.


Some relationships are casual ""acquaintances,"" and include people you might pass in the halls and smile at or say, ""Hello."" Acquaintances help you feel connected to the outside world, but they're generally people you wouldn’t call up to hang out. The only expectation you have of your casual acquaintances is politeness.
Other relationships are casual friends. You may have met by chance (for instance, because you are in the same class) and you may interact on a regular basis based on your shared interest or common schedule. You may chat with these people about surface-level topics, but you probably don't know much about them as individuals.
More intimate friends are the people you trust and choose to be with when you have a choice. These are the people that you feel that you can be yourself around, and you don't have to worry about impressing them. Intimate friendships can require a lot of work to maintain, because you owe each other attention and time as part of your friendship.
Best friends are those intimate friends who have proven to be faithful, loyal, and trustworthy; these are often relationships that have stood the test of time. Best friends feel as if they know each other inside out. Not everybody has or needs best friends, and that's ok too.

, Friends can range from someone you just hang out with to have fun, to someone you confide in when you're having trouble or ask for advice when you need it. True friends are an important part of life because they help you learn more about yourself, help you make good choices, and help you connect with others.


True friends tell each other the truth and keep each other's best interests in mind. You can know if someone is not really your friend if they lie to please you or to trick you, or if they undermine your efforts or don't care about your successes.
Friendships can take a lot of work to maintain. Try to make time every week to call or visit your friends just to stay caught up with their lives and let them know you're thinking about them.

, Like friendships, romantic relationships can vary from casual to more intimate, depending on how well you know one another and how committed you are to one another (in other words, what expectations you have of each other).


Some people enjoy dating casually and spending a lot of time with lots of different people, perhaps even becoming sexually intimate with lots of casual partners. This has the advantage of allowing you to find out what traits you like in a romantic partner, and it gives you a chance to develop your communication and other relationship skills without the pressure of commitment.
Other people prefer to become very emotionally attached and committed to just one person. Eventually, most people hope to find someone they can commit to in a long-term relationship or marriage.

, These are the people who we see every day but are not necessarily close to. These relationships can be very important to your success. If you build good relationships with the people you work with or the people you're in school with, you can show that you are a team player.


Try to treat everyone you work with respect and kindness, even if they are not someone you would want to be friends with on a social basis. Your coworkers all have different life experiences that can be helpful in the workplace, so look for everyone's strengths.
Sometimes work relationships overlap with romantic or friend relationships, which can often be confusing (and in the case of romantic relationships, may sometimes be against your workplace rules). Remember to stay professional whenever you are at work, and treat everyone the same.

, Whether it be dating or marriage, relationships like these can be complicated and hard to understand.


Romantic relationships give people a chance to open their hearts to someone else, and connect on a very intimate level. This person will see the good and bad sides of you, and love you anyway. Communication is key to keeping a romantic relationship healthy and happy.
Because of the intimacy of romantic relationships, they can cause a lot of pain and heartache from misunderstandings, hurt feelings, and disappointment. Choose carefully who you open your heart to, but you also have to be willing to take some risks in the name of love. Otherwise, you might miss out on a great relationship.

, Depth and sincerity should be most important. Have a few good, solid and rewarding relationships rather than focusing on too many people, who slip in and out of your life as they please.

Understand the difference between what love really is and what is platonic love.,
Consider your feelings about the person.,
Do not mistake your love for something more.,
Understand how strong platonic love can be.,
Think about what your idea of friendship is.",How to Understand Platonic Love and Friendship," Love is an emotional attachment with a special person expressed through action, care and affection and it is bond between people. Different types of love exist for different relationships. For example, a mother and daughter have familial love, partners have romantic love.

The love between friends is platonic love. Platonic describes a relationship that is purely spiritual and not physical. If a guy and a girl hang out all the time but aren't boyfriend and girlfriend, they'd describe their friendship as platonic..



 

;
, Do you think of them romantically or erotically? feelings such as these suggest you might have a different love for this person. If you don't have strong feeling about that person and just like to hangout with him, then you most likely have a platonic love for them.

, One of the most common confusions occur when people mistake their affection towards their friends as something deeper. Whether consciously or subconsciously, it is easy to mistake feelings of love.

, It is perfectly normal for people to experience intense feelings for those they care about without the love being of a romantic nature. Very similar to that of actual love, platonic love creates a powerful attachment between people.

, Do you consider acquaintances as friends or do you need to have a profound knowledge of the person before you classify them as a friend? In order to identify the type of love, you must first have a comparison to what your norm for platonic love is.

Make eye contact when talking.,
Allow her to speak.,
Assess your attitude towards girls.,
Mind your manners.",How to Treat Girls With Respect1," When you speak to someone, you make eye contact with them. This shows that you are listening attentively, and that you are focused on the conversation. This rule applies for girls as much as it does for boys. By making eye contact with her, you show her that you respect her., Listen to what girls have to say and avoid dominating the conversation. Conversation between two people is give and take. After you say something, give her a chance to respond. When she is saying something, wait until she finishes speaking to respond. If you are truly listening, your response will be relevant to what she has said and add substance to the conversation. Try to practice active listening, such as by:Using neutral statements to show you are paying attention, such as “yes,” “I see,” and uh-huh.”
Asking probing questions to keep her talking, such as “What happened next? “How did that make you feel?” and “What are you going to do now?”
Restating to ensure you understood what she said, such as by saying, “It sounds like you are saying ____. Is that right?”

, Basically every culture has some version of “The Golden Rule” that basically says “Treat others as you would like to be treated.” Well, this is applies to girls as well. Using degrading and disrespectful slurs (anything from calling her a “gold digger” to implying that boys are smarter than girls) is not an appropriate way to talk to, or about, girls. Take some time to reflect on your attitude towards girls to help you determine what your biases might be.


For example, do you tend to associate women with certain careers? Behaviors? Or social roles? Are you skeptical of women in positions of power? Try making a list of things that you might consider your biases against women.You should also make a point not to condone this behavior out of other people. If a friend is being disrespectful towards girls, point it out and correct them., Avoid obsessive swearing, passing gas, burping, etc. While it’s best practice to avoid this things around any person, girls tend to be less amused by these behaviors than boys. Accidents happen, for example, a burp slips out after dinner, and that’s okay. Say excuse me and move on.Try to practice good manners, such as by saying please and thank you, paying attention during conversations, offering help, and opening doors.
The point is to avoid being deliberately rude, not to be a robot.

Focus more attention on your partner.,
Spend more time together.,
Call just to talk.,
Do new things together.,
Meet each other’s family.,
Tell your friends.,
Keep your own interests.",How to Transition from Dating to Relationship1," In your fast paced world of cell phones, social media, and busy schedules, you may be distracted a lot. When you start a relationship, try to focus more of your attention on your partner. This means you should put your cell phone down and stop texting while you are with your partner.


This will let your partner know that you are in the moment and want to be as present as possible. This will help make your relationship stronger and last longer. ;
, When you are in a relationship, you will be spending more time together than you did when you were just dating. This means you need to make time for each other in your weekly schedule so you can enjoy your new relationship. Your time together doesn’t need to be elaborate or extremely thought out. A relationship means you can do everyday things together as well, like making dinner in and watching a movie on your couch.This doesn’t mean you should be at your partner’s beck and call. Keep a little mystery in your relationship. Don’t agree to every date your partner sets. Instead, switch it up and keep your partner wanting more., When you are in a relationship, you want hear from your partner more often. This means that you may call your partner just to talk. When you are dating, you likely only called if you were trying to set up a date and time to meet. When you transition over to a relationship, you will likely talk much more.


This doesn’t mean you have to be on the phone all the time. It just means that there are times when you want to hear your partner’s voice.
You may also text or message each other more as well., When you enter into a relationship, try new and exciting things together. Go for a long hike in the forest. Take up mountain biking together. Go out dancing in the city. Take a trip across the country together. The great thing about changing to a relationship is that you have another person to do exciting things with.


Compromise on what your activities will be. Relationships are a two way street, where each of your opinions matter equal amounts., When you enter into a relationship, you may want to introduce your partner to your family. If you are close with your family, consider having them over for dinner and introduce your partner to them. This will let your partner know that you care about them enough to meet your family and will also allow your family to get to know who you are in a relationship with.


Your partner may also want to introduce you to your partner’s family. Just be yourself and you’ll be fine.
If you are not close to your family, you don’t have to worry about this step. It only matters if your family is important to you.

, When you are changing over to a relationship, you will want to tell those closest to you. Once you and your partner are an official couple, you should tell your friends. Go to group hang outs as an official couple and tell people that you are in a relationship.


This doesn’t have to be a formal thing, just make it obvious that you and your partner are together., Being in a relationship does not mean that you have to like all the same things. You can do things with your partner you might not necessarily want to do as a compromise, you remember you are your own person too. Foster your own interests and let your partner do the same. This will make you both happier and give you something new to talk about when you are together.


For example. if you don’t want to watch football with your partner and instead want to go to the gym, go to the gym. Your partner will be there when you get back."

Ask for permission before touching another person.,
Understand that “No” does mean no.,
Be mindful of comments that affect her body image.,
Know when to leave a girl alone.",How to Treat Girls With Respect2," This rule applies to everyone: there are no exceptions to who does and does not have the right to give or withhold consent for physical contact. That said, girls' bodies are more notoriously objectified. Show her respect by acknowledging her right to decide who touches her body, and when and how they do it.Note that this does not extend to allowing anyone to decide that you have to touch them. You also have the right to say no if you are not comfortable with the contact.

, Society often seems disconnected from the concept of consent. Most people understand that if consent is not given, then you should not touch, or continue to touch, a girl. Somehow, though, many of these same people also believe that the validity of a girl’s objection to being touched is dependent on a host of other factors (e.g. how she is dressed, how much she likes you, etc.). This is not true. “No,” means no, period.This is not limited to romantic situations. The rule extends to any physical contact.

, You should not compare a girl’s body to other girls' bodies. This can be seen as a direct insult to either, or both, of the girls you are comparing. Even if you are not talking about the girl who’s listening, saying things about other girls’ bodies can imply that you are talking about her body as well.It is okay to compliment a girl on her looks, but be sure to do this in a respectful manner. Saying something like “I think you are beautiful,” is much more respectful than saying “You’re super hot.” Only give these compliments if you know her well enough to know that she is comfortable with it.
Avoid giving compliments or commenting on a girl’s body. Never say anything about her size, shape, movement, etc.

, Sometimes, a girl might not want your attention. In these cases, you should respect her wishes and leave her alone. If she tells you that she would rather be left alone, it is disrespectful to continue to talk to her, compliment her, or otherwise pursue her attention.


If a girl indicates that she wants to be left alone, then you can just say something like, ""Sorry. I'll leave,"" and then walk away. Or you can say, ""Ok, have a good day,"" and then leave.

"
"
Avoid generalizing all girls into the same categories.,
Acknowledge that her emotions are valid.,
Attempt to meet her needs.",How to Treat Girls With Respect3," Each girl is different and has different needs than other girls. It can often be insulting to a girl to assume that she likes certain things just because she’s a girl. This implies that all girls are basically the same, which is not true. You have to understand that every girl has her own unique personality before you will be able to respect her needs and opinions. Think about the assumptions you make regarding girls, and work to overcome them.If a girl’s needs are unclear to you, ask her what she needs.

, You will not always understand the emotions of another person. This often comes to light when boys and girls struggle to understand each other’s perspectives and feelings. Even if she doesn’t feel the way you think she should, or you don’t understand how she came to feel the way she does, you have to acknowledge that it is how she feels. Her feelings are valid and do not need to meet your criteria to be important.Ask her things like “How does this make you feel?” When she answers, listen attentively and avoid any urge to disregard her feelings by saying something like “Well that doesn’t make any sense.”
Try to show empathy and provide emotional validation. For example, you can say something like, ""It sounds like you had a tough day. It must have felt awful to sit through that meeting/class.""

, First of all, when showing a girl respect, understand that she is her own person in charge of her own happiness. Her happiness is not in your hands. That said, when a girl decides to trust you or lean on you, try your best to meet her needs. Be supportive in tough situations, and encourage her every day.Again, you can always ask her what she needs if you are unsure.

"
"
Recognize her opinion as equal to yours.,
Present valid arguments.,
Ask her opinion regularly.",How to Treat Girls With Respect4," If you are debating with facts and figures then those things speak for themselves. When it comes to matters of personal opinion, you absolutely must acknowledge that a girl’s opinion is as valid as your own. The fact that she is a girl does not make her any less intelligent or able to form a coherent opinion. You are allowed to disagree with her, but you also have to respect her point of view., If you disagree with a girl, stick to the facts. Dismissing her opinion by saying something like “Well of course you think that, you’re a girl,” is completely disrespectful. If you have a reason to disagree with her, state that reason with facts (or as your own opinion), but do not belittle her for being a girl.For example, if you think that a Lamborghini is superior to a Ferrari and she disagrees, present the stats for each car. Do not say something like “This just goes to show girls know nothing about cars.”

, If you respect someone, you value their opinion. Ask a girl for her opinion on things regularly to show that you care what she thinks. You can agree or disagree, but you should show genuine interest and consideration in her point of view.For example, you might ask you should ask her where she wants to go on a Friday night rather than assume that she’ll want to do whatever you decide.

Be ready for a commitment.,
Assess how you feel around him.,
Look at your own life.,
Figure out how you feel around your partner.",How to Transition from Dating to Relationship2," When you enter into a relationship, your dating life will become exclusive to that person. This means you will stop dating other people and only see the person you are in the relationship with. Before you decide to be in a relationship, you need to make sure you are at this point.


If you are still interested in dating other people, you are not ready for a committed relationship to one person., When you are thinking about being more serious with your dating partner, you need to make sure he is the right one for you and that it is something that you want. You want to make sure your partner is making your life better and that you will thrive in a new relationship. Ask yourself:


Do I feel better when I’m around my partner?
Do I enjoy our time together?
Do I leave our dates feeling better about myself?
Do I feel respected?, Even though you may really want to be in a relationship, you need to make sure that you are at a good point in your own life to start a relationship. Relationships take up much more time than just casually dating. You will have to make more time to be around your partner and be available when you are needed. This may be difficult in certain circumstances.


Decide if you have extra time in your week to spend with your partner. If you work 50 to 60 hours a week and barely have time to go on the dates you do, moving forward into a relationship may not be the right move.
If you really want to get into a relationship but you are busy, you may need to make time for a relationship if it is important to you., You need to make sure you actually enjoy spending time with your partner before you move from dating to a relationship. Do you feel comfortable around your partner and feel you can be yourself? If you don’t, then you may not be ready for a relationship.


Many of the best relationships feel as if you are with your best friend in addition to being with your partner.
If you find yourself wanting to be alone or away from him for long periods of time, you may not be ready to go to the next step."
"
Assess the state of your relationship.,
Talk to your partner.,
Look for signs you are already in a relationship.,
Do it for the right reasons.",How to Transition from Dating to Relationship3," You need to make sure your relationship is in the right place before you go from dating to a committed relationship. You need to decide if the two of you are ready to go to this next step. There are some criteria that you can look at to see if you are ready for the next step. Questions you can ask yourself are:


Do we hand out on a frequent basis (more than once a week)?
Do we talk to one another outside of our dates?
Do you both initiate conversations and dates?
Do we enjoy being around each other when we are together?
Have you met one another’s friends?, Communication is key to any relationship. Before you make the transition between dating to a relationship, you need to discuss some things with your partner about where the dating is going, if your partner wants to change the status of your interactions as well, and if your partner is ready for the next step.


Try to avoid having a ‘’talk’’, meaning you should try to bring it up lightly or at a comfortable moment. Don’t bombard your partner with a “Where are we going?” speech.
You should also ask what your partner expects out of a relationship so you know if you fulfill the requirements., Sometimes, being in a relationship can sneak up on you without realizing it. This is common if you are comfortable with your partner and just haven’t verbalized it yet. If this is the case, you just need to tell your partner that you want to make things official. Some signs that you are already in a relationship are:


You date each other exclusively
You spend every weekend together without having to ask
Your partner has seen you at your best and worst
You’ve fought and made it through to the other side
You’ve talked honestly about your exes
You’re really good friends with each other’s friends
You stay in more often than you go out on dates, There are many reasons to want to start being in an official relationship with your partner. Feeling ready for the next step, wanting to be with the other person more, and wanting to connect with the other person are common reasons people being a relationship.


You should not begin a relationship, however, if you are feeling pressured into by your partner or because all your friends are doing it.
Also never enter into a relationship to save things between you and your partner.
If you move to this step too early, you may end up ruining your relationship."

Flirt through your body language.,
Say something flirty.,
Flirt through your actions.",How to Turn a Guy On1," If you know how to flirt with a guy without even saying anything, he will be turned on -- fast. If you know how to work your body, you don't even have to say hello to make a guy feel hot and heavy. A few small things you do with your body can make a big difference. Here are a few ways to flirt through your body language:


Hold the guy's gaze -- but not for too long. Look at the guy, lock eyes for just long enough for him to see how sexy you are, and then look away. This will show that you're not afraid to look at him, but that you're also too coy to stare.
Keep your body open. Don't fold your arms over your chest or cross your legs. Your body should be saying, ""Hey, what's up?""
If you're wearing something with a zipper or a necklace, fiddle with the area near your cleavage to get his attention.
Find ways to brush up against the guy. If you're already talking, lightly graze his knee, brush up against his hand, or place a hand on his forearm when you're laughing. Do it for just long enough that he wants more. Don't linger.
Occasionally lick your lips. If he's watching you from across the room, take the time to apply your lip balm.;
, Once you've hooked a guy with your body language and he wants to get to know you, you need to get him even more excited by your words. To say something flirty, you just have to be fun, show that you know how to laugh and tease, and make the guy even more turned on even if you're not saying anything life-shattering. Here's how to do it:


Keep it light. Remember to be fun and playful, and the guy will want you even more. Flirting isn't about being serious, but about showing you're interested and having fun.
Maintain eye contact while you talk. Make the guy feel important. Occasionally break eye contact to look at your feet or blush, and the guy will think you're demure and will be even more attracted to you.
Speak in a soft voice. You don't have to whisper, but you should talk in a lower voice so you sound sexy and make the guy lean in and get closer to you.
Tease the guy. Show that you're comfortable playing around and he'll want to tease you back. Showing that you don't take yourself too seriously will make the guy think you're great in the bedroom.

, Any guy will be turned on if you're able to flirt by acting confident, independent, sexy, and bold. Once the guy has a better sense of who you are from the way you're acting, he'll be absolutely hooked. Here's how to turn a guy on by your actions:


Be confident. Guys are turned on by confident women. If you can act confident when you talk to the guy or share things about yourself, he'll think that you'll be able to take that confidence to the bedroom.
Be independent. Guys are turned on by women who don't need them. Let the guy know about all of the things you love to do by yourself, and tell him about your busy weekend. Guys are not turned on by clingy girls who have nothing better to do than to hang out with them.
Be sexy. You don't have to be trashy to show a little leg or cleavage. Show some skin and don't be afraid to make some raunchy jokes or to make a dirty innuendo if the mood feels right. The guy will be even more excited by your sexiness.
Be bold. Guys are turned on by bold women, whether they're being bold over a cup of coffee or in the middle of a make-out session. Be bold by doing something unexpected, like wearing something hot and outrageous, or getting down on the dance floor in the middle of a wild jam.

Give it time.,
Text her when she will likely be available.,
Keep text messages relatively short.,
Use correct spelling and proper grammar.,
Use emoticons in moderation.,
Text the girl about as often as she texts you.,
Be flirtatious without being overtly sexual.,
Open with a text related to how you met.,
Use what little you know about her to your advantage.,
Try a random conversation starter.,
Send text messages that sound intriguing.,
Send texts that make her laugh.,
View texting as a gateway to spending more time with her in person.,
Strike while the iron is hot.,
Use what you know to choose a time and place.,
Be direct.,
Consider calling instead of texting.",How to Text a Girl You Just Met," You might be tempted to text her as soon as you score those digits, but think twice: texting her while she’s still standing there could signal to her that you don’t trust her to be honest about her number, and may give her the impression that you’re pushy or overbearing.


If you genuinely just want to make sure you copied her number correctly, you can show her or read it back aloud and ask her to confirm its accuracy.
The exception, of course, is if she asks you to send her a text so she can log your number, too, or if she sends you a text first as a way of giving you her number.
While there’s no firm rule about how long to wait before sending that first text, it’s usually a good idea to wait until the following day (or the evening of the same day if you got her number in morning / early afternoon and have long since parted ways). Any sooner makes you seem too eager, but any later makes her wonder if she’s anything more than an afterthought to you.;
, If you want your crush to respond and feel excited about your texts, text her when you know she’s available. For example, if you know she works until 5 p.m., wait until after 7 p.m. to text her when you know she’s relaxing at home.Use context clues from your first meeting to figure out if there are any abnormalities in her schedule. For instance, if she talked about being exhausted after switching to swing shift, you'll know not to call her between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m.
If you don’t know the details of her schedule, it’s usually safe to assume she has a standard schedule. Texting in the evening, from about 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., will be a safe bet for your first text. You can pay attention to when she responds during subsequent texting and adjust your timing as needed.

, Short text messages are more effective at grabbing someone’s attention and keeping them engaged. Short texts also prevent your crush from growing bored while she’s waiting for your responses, and prevent you from seeming too needy as a result of sending long, detailed stories about your life.While this is especially important when texting a girl you just met, it’s a good guideline to follow in the future, too. Texting should usually be reserved for short, lighthearted conversations; save lengthier topics of conversation for after you’ve gotten to know her better, and for phone or in-person chats.

, Writing correctly sends a good first impression, and makes it look as though you value her enough to write well thought-out messages that make sense.On a similar note, avoid using too many acronyms and abbreviations. This can lead to misunderstanding and end your conversation if she doesn’t understand exactly what you’re trying to say. Spell out full words when you’re tempted to use acronyms, and use simple acronyms in moderation, such as ASAP.

, Emoticons are cute and funny at the right moments, but can seem annoying and silly if you use them too often, or at the wrong times. For example, when she shares a story that legitimately has you laughing out loud, share a laughing emoticon to show that you think she’s hilarious.


Use emoticons only when you want to want to emphasize a certain emotion. Most people interpret an emoticon in the same way they would interpret the corresponding real-life facial expression, so emoticons can help you clarify that you're happy, sad, or silly when making a certain remark.On the other hand, a person's facial expression doesn't often change that much every millisecond--so if you litter a text message with a dozen different emoticons, you’ll come across as less sincere and potentially untrustworthy.

, Texting too often, or way more than she texts you, can make you come across as desperate, needy, and less attractive. Maintain her interest by keeping your text ratio close to 1:1.


It's not necessarily a bad thing if you end up starting most text conversations early on, but avoid doing so if she never replied back to a previous text that needed a response. Sending a second or third text if she hasn't replied to your first can make you seem desperate., If the two of you flirted when you met, you can also be flirtatious when you text. Always be polite, though, and tailor your texts based on what she's comfortable with.


To start out, aim to be funny, sweet, or a little cheesy. A good flirtatious text to open with could be along the lines of, ""You were so beautiful last night that I completely forgot my pickup line,""or, ""It's too bad you left so earlier yesterday. I wanted to see way more of your beautiful smile.""
Avoid sending anything rude or overtly sexual. Sending sexy messages and photos to this girl so soon can result in her feeling offended and blocking your number. Wait until you’ve spent more time together before sending texts of an intimate nature, and make sure she’s comfortable with it before sending her something she’d wish she could unsee.

, This is an ideal way to break the ice, and to remind her who you are. Plus, it shows that you remember details about your interaction. For example, if you met her at a study group, ask her if she’s fully prepared for her upcoming test.


Similarly, you could also continue a conversation you had when you met her. If she recommended a certain movie, for example, you might say something like, ""I just watched (movie title) and see what you mean about the (plot/cinematography/characters)."" You can then ask for her opinion about a specific part or detail, or ask if she's seen a similar movie, to keep the conversation going and encourage a reply., Since you just met this girl, it’s true that you may not know much about her--on the other hand, since you managed to get her number, you probably know at least something. Scan back through the conversation you had when you met and find some detail about her you could build a conversation on. Since most people enjoy talking about themselves, asking her to divulge more about herself can encourage conversation.


For example, if she casually mentioned that she enjoys running at the local park, ask her how far she runs, or about her workout routine.
As another example, if she only briefly mentioned that she works with kids, you could ask her what type of childcare work she does, if she enjoys it, and so on.

, If you mentally combed through your initial meeting and you're still stuck for ideas, a random question that piques her curiosity might work. Just make sure you choose something both interesting and lighthearted.


For this method, it's best to skip the standard greeting and jump right into the topic, creating the impression that the thought just suddenly came to you.As an example, you might ask something like, ""Quick! Which is better: gelato or frozen custard? This is super important...""

, Come up with messages you know will trigger an immediate response from this girl due to their mysterious, intriguing nature. For example, tell her you had a crazy dream about her last night. Chances are, she’ll respond shortly to ask you for details about your dream.Keep the tone of your initial meeting in mind when going this route, however. If you met under casual circumstances without a hint of romance in the air, or if she seemed hesitant about giving you her phone number, you might want to go easy on comments about seeing her in your dreams until after some trust and romantic context has been built in person.

, Using humor is an effective way to bond and grow closer with most individuals, including your crush. When in doubt about what to say, share a funny joke or picture that makes her laugh without causing offense.Skip negative or demeaning jokes--even those about yourself--and opt for goofy one-liners built on things like puns and everyday observation.For example, you could try something like, ""I think the brain is the best, most fascinating organ. Then again, look what's telling me that."", The most intimate moments between you and this girl should take place in person--not via text. Try to text her sparingly, and save texting for when you’re breaking the ice or making plans to see one another in person.


Getting a girl’s phone number can be exciting, but don’t get so caught up in that excitement that you forget the endgame. Use texting as a way to stay in touch and create a line of communication that will allow you to see her again.

, Don't drag your feet and procrastinate before asking her out on a date or a casual outing. You may not know this girl well since you just met recently, but since she gave you her number, she's probably already interested in seeing you again.This is especially true if you talked a lot when you met. In this instance, you might even start the conversation by directly asking to meet again: ""I had a great time talking with you the other day. I'd love to meet up again -- how's next Saturday?""
If you didn't talk much when you met or wish to chat some before asking for a date, it's fine to text back and forth a bit beforehand. You should still try to ask her out within a few days; otherwise, she might get the feeling that you're weighing your options or uninterested.

, While not crucial, it often helps to have a time and place in mind when asking a girl for a date. This might seem difficult since you probably don’t know much about a girl you just met, but try to use whatever clues are available to you to come up with possible suggestions.


For instance, if you met at a bar or social outing, there’s a decent chance that time slot is often open on her schedule. You could try asking her out during that same time slot the following week.
If you were talking about a local sports team, ask her if she’d like to go to a game. If you met while volunteering, ask her to attend another event related to the same cause. If you met at a school assembly, ask her if she’d like to meet at the library for a study date.

, No matter when you ask her out, the text requesting the date should be clear, concise, and respectful.Don't make her pry the details out of you or leave her guessing about the nature of the date.


Try to suggest an exact day and time for the date. If she says this doesn't work for her, you could ask her if another time might be better--but let the matter drop for now if she says she isn't sure.
Similarly, don't get rude if she rejects the date completely. It's possible that she simply doesn't have any free time right now; rudeness will ruin your chances at getting a date when she does. Even if she really is brushing you off, though, it's her loss--skip the guilt trip and simply shake off the rejection.

, Nowadays, it’s acceptable in many circumstances to arrange a date via text instead of doing so with a phone call. It might even be more comfortable for both you and her. If you feel up to the challenge, though, consider making an actual phone call and asking her out that way; the little bit of extra effort you show in doing so will demonstrate just how earnest you are about getting to know her better.


You can still use texting to confirm the details of your date later on if you wish to have a written record of the time and place.

Master the French kiss.,
Close the A-frame.,
Kiss him on other parts of his body.,
Don't be afraid to bite.",How to Turn a Guy On2," The French kiss is pretty basic, but if you want to really turn a guy on, you have to be able to do it right. Though you don't have to kiss perfectly the first time, remember that kissing is the gateway to other sexy acts, so if you show him you're a good kisser, he'll be even more turned on because he'll be thinking about what else is in store for him. Here's how to master the French kiss:


Don't be too eager. Gently slip your tongue inside his mouth and explore. Don't go in for the kill with your tongue until it feels right.
Be gentle. Slowly and gently move your tongue around the guy's mouth. Don't slosh it around and leave gobs of spit everywhere.
Don't ignore the rest of your body. Move your hands around his back, shoulders, and neck, and press your chest up against his.
If you get bored with the French kiss, mix it up with a variety of other kisses.


, This is another sexy variation on the traditional French kiss. Stand about a foot or two away from your guy while you're kissing, so that you have to lean in towards each other, and grab each other to get closer.


You'll end up rubbing your hips against your guy's every time you move back in after pulling apart, and he won't be able to keep his hands off of you.

, Kissing ain't just for lips, honey. You'll turn your guy on even more if you maximize your kissing abilities by kissing him all over his body. If you're just making out, then you can kiss him on the neck, upper chest, and even on the bottom of his earlobes.


If you've taken off his shirt, you can try kissing him above his waistband.
Tell him you'll kiss him anywhere -- except his lips. That will turn him on even more.

, Once you've gotten comfortable with your guy, you can take your kissing up a notch by adding some little love nibbles to your routine. Just try some gentle bites on different parts of the guy's body, and he'll be turned on even more. Here are some places where biting will really turn your guy on:


Give him gentle bites on his earlobes.
Try some gentle bites on his neck -- just be careful so you don't leave a mark.
Nibble on his lip in the middle of a kiss.
If his shirt is off, don't be afraid to bite his chest, or even his nipples. Nipples are an erogenous zone for men, too.

Be adventurous.,
Be spontaneous.,
Be a little bit dirty.,
Have fun with some new sex scenarios.,
Make sure he's always thinking of hooking up with you.",How to Turn a Guy On3," To turn him on, you have to show that you're up for hooking up in whatever way feels right. If you want to have sex in the same place and same position every time, then he won't be as turned on as he would be if you showed that you were up for anything. Here's how to be adventurous when you're having sex:


Make love in new places. Pick a new part of your home to make love, check into a hotel, or make love in some secluded or scandalous location. He will be turned on by your adventurous spirit.
Make love in new positions. Though your guy may love it if you're on top the whole time, he'll love it even more if you mix it up and try to have sex in a new position every time you get to the bedroom.
Get sexy in some water. Make love in the shower, or hook up in a pool or a hot tub. Your guy will be more turned on if you can be sexy in almost any scenario.

, If you want to turn on your guy, you should not only show that you're up for anything, but that you're up for anything any time. If you're only adventurous on designated hook up times, then it'll begin to feel like a routine. Here are some hot ways to be more spontaneous:


Hook up whenever you're in the mood, even if you're both just watching TV. Show him what you want and he'll follow you to the bedroom.
If you're out in public and really want to get it on, just whisper it in his ear and go somewhere more private.
Surprise him when he's waking up or getting into the shower. Guys are always open to the possibility of having sex.

, Guys love it if you're comfortable enough with yourself to be a little bit dirty. Whether you're talking dirty, or just doing something raunchy, he'll be turned on before you can rip off his shirt. Here's what to do:


Try some dirty talk in the bedroom. Tell him how much you like what he's doing to you and let him know what else you want.
Tell him your sexual fantasy, no matter how dirty it is. See if he can fulfill it for you.
Tie his hands to the bedposts and have your way with him. Take turns.
Go to the sex store together and find the sexiest lingerie possible as well as a few props. Bring them out whenever you feel like it.

, Any guy is guaranteed to be turned on if you mix things up with some role play or raunchy scenarios. Trying out different scenarios will not only spice up your sex life, but it will let have more fun and explore your bodies and desires in new ways. Here are some fun scenarios to try:


Pretend you're his boss and boss him around until he lets you do whatever you want. Switch roles.
Try having sex with almost all of your clothes on. Or have sex with just one person's clothes on.
Pretend you're in a big fight and have makeup sex.
Put on some raunchy costumes form the sex store and try some role play.
Dress up really formally and pretend that you're going out for a special occasion. Then take each others clothes off and go for it.

, Even when you're not having sex, sleeping with you should never be far from the guy's mind. Whether you're in a different state or sitting across the dinner table from him, you should always keep him turned on and wanting more. Here's how to do it:


Keep looking sexy. Whether you've been hooking up for months or just finished your second hook-up session, make sure to keep looking hot, showing some skin, and taking care of your hygiene so your man always wants more.
Make sure your man is thinking of sex when you're not around. Send him an occasional dirty text, have phone sex, or just call to remind him of something sexy that happened in bed the night before.
Let him know you want him. Tell him this whenever it feels right, even if it's at a moment when you can't possibly have him -- that will make him want you even more.

Use different names in your phone.,
Plan dates at secret meeting spots.,
Spend time with other people.",How to Temporarily Keep Your New Relationship a Secret1," Chances are, you are going to be texting or calling your new partner. However, if you are trying to keep it secret, you may want to use different names in your phone. This way, if someone sees a new text pop up on your lock screen, they won’t see your partner’s real name.The problem with this is that they may ask who this new person you are texting is. You may tell anyone asking that it’s a friend from work or school, or someone you just reconnected with from your past.;
, When keeping your relationship a secret, you can’t just go into town to go to dinner or a movie. Anyone you know may see you. Instead, go to private spots where no one will find you, or go on dates in nearby towns or cities.For example, you may decide to see a movie in the large city near where you live, or decide to drive to a restaurant in a smaller town where neither of you know anyone.
If you live alone, you can have dates where you stay in, order take out, and watch movies. However, if you live near people who know you, they may notice the same car outside your home. They may also recognize your partner’s car in your driveway.

, If you are only hanging out with each other, people are going to suspect that you are together. Instead, hang out with other people at work or school. When you go out to the same places, you should make sure to mingle with other people instead of being obvious by spending time with each other.Don’t spend the entire time staring at your partner or sharing looks with them. This will tip people off that something is going on.
You may want to reduce the temptation to let your feelings show by limiting the amount of time you both go out to the same places or with the same people.

Stay calm.,
Know that she may need a few days to think about it.,
Consider what to do next.,
Congratulate yourself!",How to Tell Your Girl (Friend) You Love Her As a Girl," Find a nice and quiet place to talk whether it's a park, room etc. Choose the time you want to talk to her.


If you have known her for a year or less, it's probably better to pick a semiprivate place, such as a park, beach, mall, or restaurant. Some women (especially those who have had bad experiences with men or are homophobic) feel fear when someone admits to liking them. If the two of you are very comfortable around each other, then private places are also fine.
Avoid bedrooms; your friend may think that you're trying to imply something.;
, Pick out one of your favorite outfits, and consider makeup if you don't usually wear it. There's no need to dress like you're ready for the Oscars, but looking a little extra beautiful will help boost your confidence.

, You'll want to set a serious and compassionate tone to the conversation, so that she feels comfortable.


For example: ""Latisha, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for quite a while. It may take you by surprise, but it's important to me, so may we please talk for a minute?""
""We need to talk"" is usually a bad way to start; it may make her feel intimidated or nervous.

, This is big news, and it'll take her time to sort out her feelings. Tell her that you understand that this is big, and that if she wants to take time to think, you understand that and you're okay with it.


Fishing for a response is likely to elicit a negative reaction.
Don't overanalyze her immediate response. Sometimes, people's gut reaction is very different from how they truly feel. Allow her to think about it, so she can give you a response from the heart.
Be prepared for both the worst response (""I'm straight"") and the best response (""I feel the same way about you!"").

, It's natural to feel nervous, but it's important not to allow it to overcome you, because it will prevent you from listening and having a good discussion.


You can always scream into a pillow or treat yourself to a movie marathon afterwards. (You earned it!)

, Sometimes people need time away to sort out how they really feel. Waiting is tough, but it also means that she's thinking hard—i.e., there's a solid chance that she's gay or bisexual!


If she still hasn't given you a clear answer after a week, then she's probably shy or really struggling. Reach out to her through a note, phone call, or text, letting her know that you're thinking of her and are open to talking if she is.

, This will depend on her answer to you.


If she likes you back, then you can become girlfriends, and start going on dates.
If she feels uncertain, then you may want to continue being friends, and see where it goes from there. Or, you may decide to get over her, because uncertainty is too painful.
If she isn't interested, consider whether you're interested in still being friends. You may continue being friends, take a break for you to get over her, or end the friendship. All of these are okay things to do. You can move on, party, meet new girls, and find someone new who will fall for you.

, Confessing a crush is very difficult, especially when the crush is of the same gender. Treat yourself to something nice (involving your new girlfriend, or all by yourself), and feel proud that you took the initiative to state your feelings. You deserve it.

Avoid changing your relationship status on social media.,
Refrain from posting pictures with the person.,
Keep your phone lock screen and background neutral.",How to Temporarily Keep Your New Relationship a Secret2," If you want to keep your relationship status secret for now, don’t change your status on social media. To the world of social media, you can pretend you are single so people won’t know things have changed.You should also avoid mentioning the person, talking to them too much, or posting on their account.

, Though you may be taking a lot of pictures with your new significant other, you shouldn’t post pictures with the person. Updating Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat with photos of you and your new partner on a date or cuddling will alert others to your new relationship.


You shouldn’t post pictures of yourself with any obvious markers that you are with the other person. For example, don’t post pictures in the person’s house, wearing their clothes, or riding in their cars.

, Many people change their lock screen and phone background to a picture of their partner or of them and their partner. If you are trying to keep your relationship secret, avoid doing this. A picture of your secret partner is an obvious sign you are together.


Consider keeping any photos of you and your significant other on a secret flash drive or in a password protected folder. This way, no one will accidentally catch a glimpse of your partner if you open your camera or gallery.

Choose a time to let others know about your relationship.,
Decide if people have started to figure out your relationship.,
Determine if your partner wants a committed relationship.",How to Temporarily Keep Your New Relationship a Secret3," There are many reasons people keep their relationship secret. However, no matter your reasons, eventually the relationship should become public, especially if you are getting serious. Talk to your partner about finding a time to go public with your relationship.You don’t have to make a huge announcement on social media or turn it into a big deal. You may just let your friends know you’re dating someone or tell your friends you have a new partner.
Instead of telling anyone, you can just start going on dates around town where anyone can see you.

, Despite your best efforts, you may not have been as sneaky as you thought with your relationship. People may suspect that you are together or may have seen you together. If a few people know, more people probably know. This means you should probably go public since the relationship isn’t private anymore.If someone figures it out and asks you, avoid lying if you can. Lying about the relationship can cause a lot of problems and trust issues with family and friends after you go public.

, Sometimes, people want to keep the relationship secret because they don’t want a relationship, they want to use you, or they are interested or with another person. If your partner doesn’t want to go public, even after you have been together for awhile, you should question their motives to make sure you aren’t being taken advantage of.Let your partner know what you need from the relationship. You cannot truly have a fulfilling relationship if you are not part of each other’s lives.
If your partner refuses to go public, consider ending the relationship and finding someone who will want to be part of your life.

On a scale from 1-10 (1 being bad, 10 being great) rate your relationship at the current moment.


Make sure you and your boyfriend are serious, committed partners. Signs that you are a close, intimate couple include, but are not limited to: Shared finances, shared household responsibilities, close sexual intimacy, consistent communication, etc.
If you or your boyfriend show signs that you are interested in other people, the relationship might not be stable enough. If there was an agreement in the beginning that this would be a ""fling"" it might also not be safe to reveal information about your past. In general, you should be monogamous partners who are intimate with one another.
If your relationship is only a few days or weeks old it is generally not the right time yet to reveal something important about your past. You will want your strengths to shine as a couple before you begin to delve into potential weaknesses. Revealing something this early in the relationship might also potentially turn your boyfriend off from being in a relationship with you. While all couples are different, just make sure that the timing is right (at, or around, a few months in).;
, The time you spend with your boyfriend, whether it be in the car or on serious dates, is critical to gauging what type of man he truly is. Use your current knowledge and memory base to discern whether or not he is the best person to tell something to about your past.


Look for signs such as gift giving, kisses, holding hands, consistent text messages/phone calls, etc. These demonstrate that your boyfriend loves and cares about you.
Spend time thinking about what you see for your future. Does your future involve your boyfriend, and do you see yourself getting even more serious with him? A potential long-term partner is someone you will want to share vital information with.
Know who you are talking to. Men vary widely, so it is critical to understand exactly what and who your boyfriend is. Calm, sensitive men are the best to openly engage in a dialogue with. Partners who constantly joke around might not take the conversation seriously. If your partners is abusive, or generally nasty to you, that person might not be the right person for you. Remember, revealing a past experience about yourself should not be a way to help a struggling relationship, but should be a way to build an even stronger one.

, Trust is critical in order for a relationship to be healthy and thriving. Before you begin to dive into your past experiences and emotions, make sure that the relationship is open and honest.


Note whether or not you and your boyfriend consistently engage in deep, interesting conversation. Simply using ""small talk"" (i.e. weather, what did you do today, how is the family), while appreciated, is not necessarily a sign of good communication. If an open, honest dialogue has not yet been performed, try engaging in a discussion concerning likes, dislikes, passions, hobbies, etc. These topics can be a great inroads into making the relationship healthy and open to even deeper levels of conversation.
Gage whether your conversations with your boyfriend usually end in understanding, or argument. Men come in wide varieties, and therefore exhibit many different emotional reactions. Physical contact, eye contact, and verbal cues are generally signs that your boyfriend is listening to what you are saying, and is receptive to deeper engagement.Try to understand your boyfriend's temperaments. An argumentative boyfriend is generally a person not open to further dialogue. Listen to what he says, and try to understand where it is coming from. If you notice that his problems may be similar to your own, that may be a wedge to attempt talking about your own past with him.

, Often times, people want to open up about their past without first internalizing it themselves. Your past represents the person you are today.


Use a quiet space like a bedroom to sit and contemplate your past experiences. Think about the good, the bad, and the ugly. Try to figure out which moments are connected to which other experiences.
Attempt to understand why the events in your past are important to you, and how they have made you into the person you are today. In everyday situations, at work or at home, write down on a sheet of paper when you remember a past experience or memory. Write down why you think this memory came about when it did. Make sure to note whether certain memories or experiences are consistently recurring or are repressed.
Before you talk with your boyfriend it might be a good idea to talk with a relative or friend (at least loosely) about the experiences or memories you wish to share. This is a great way to practice and begin to open up. Some people also find psychiatrists very helpful in beginning to open up since the relationship between the patient and doctor is strictly professional.

, It is important, before you begin the conversation, that you are open and honest with yourself. You want the points you wish to address to be succinct, and yet detailed enough so that your boyfriend understands what you are saying.


Spend time by yourself contemplating your past. Sometimes a great way to do this is to silently sit in a quiet space like your bedroom, or outside in a relatively calm park.
Write down on a sheet of paper some of your past experiences you would like to discuss with your boyfriend. Create a large list, and then go back and cross off things that are off limits at the moment, or will have to wait till further along in the relationship to reveal. Try and expand whatever is left on the list. Write the details down exactly how you want to tell them to your boyfriend.
It is best not to rattle off all your past experiences at once. Intimate communication is best when you are talking concisely, about small matters at a time. A healthy relationship will allow for further conversations in the future where you can reveal even more.

, While the words might be easy to get out when you are by yourself, when the moment comes, they might be hard to get out. You will want to recite, revise, and recite again until what you want to say is mostly on point.


Take your list before and begin to draft it into a longer form. This does not have to be in paragraph form, but make sure to write down as much detail as possible.
A great place to practice is in front of a mirror. First read what you have written down. Then, as you go along, try and look away from the paper and begin to memorize. You do not have to remember word for word, but try and get as close as possible. The mirror will help you get used to talking to someone without anyone else actually being there.
You might also want to try and read what you have written in front of a friend or relative. However, the information you will reveal may be personal and highly sensitive. Your boyfriend will probably also not like it if you have told everyone else but him. Be highly selective to whom you talk to, and make sure that you do not reveal too much.

, When do you wish to have the conversation, where, and why is it important to you? You will not want to do this impromptu; but rather, face to face.


A great place to do this is when you are sitting in a restaurant, sitting at a park, or simply pull him to the side somewhere. Make sure that you come off as urgent, but not pestering. Speak clearly and precisely.
Do not do this over the phone, or in a highly public area. You want to make sure your boyfriend knows you are serious about talking and opening up.
If your boyfriend begins to ask questions, simply let him know that now is not the time to have the conversation. You want to have the whole talk when you are in a much more intimate space.

, After your trust level has been built, and you have practiced what you want to say, you will want to begin talking to your boyfriend about your past. A quiet, solemn setting is a great place to begin talking.


Some places that are great to talk in are: your bedroom, the living room, or in a car when you are not driving. These different settings should be quiet, and should make it easy to see each other face to face.
When people talk about their past, it can sometimes be very scary or sad. Having a pillow around to hold, and tissues available can make the talk easier and flow without interruption.
When the radio or television is on, that can take away from a good, thoughtful conversation. Movie theaters and restaurants can also be noisy, distracting, and generally not suitable for engaging one another. Privacy is also a concern. Sometimes asking a friend to join you can help, but you want to make sure that you and your boyfriend share a moment together as a couple. After all, the goal of the talk is to make your relationship stronger., Sometimes partners are not receptive to what their other partner is telling them. Having a strong voice can do the trick well.


Use your prepared statement as written beforehand, keep your notes close by, or try and remember what your notes said. Going too off script might lead to a long drawn-out conversation that does not accomplish the goal.
Make sure the words you choose are clear, and precise. When your boyfriend gets done listening, he should understand exactly what you have told him.
There is no need to get all the information out at once, especially if it something difficult you wish to talk about. Pace yourself, and remember that your boyfriend is there to first and foremost listen to what you have to say.

, Remember to introduce the topic subtlety and gradually work in the heavier moments. Describe the event, related side effects of your past, and how it effects you and the relationship.


Begin the conversation with a slow introduction. Do not reveal all the details at the beginning. This can turn your boyfriend off to conversation. Take it slow, and work through everything you want to say.
Make sure that there is open communication between yourself and your boyfriend. This is not only about you, but also the relationship as a whole. Stop frequently for your boyfriend to ask questions and comment about what he has heard so far Try your best to look your boyfriend in the eyes, and make sure he is looking to you as well. This is the best way to gage emotional or physical reactions.

, Because you are setting special time aside to tell your boyfriend about your past, it is clear that this information is critical to understanding you as a person. Explain to your boyfriend why this was crucial to reveal, and how it will possibly shape your future.


Consistently remind your boyfriend that talking about the past is important to you. By revealing this secret about your past, you are allowing him insight into who you are as a person. People who are able to do this successfully can work together as a team to not repeat the mistakes of the past.
Give examples of how this event has changed the way you go about your daily life. Forecast into the future any potential problems that may arise if this past experience is not dealt with.

, This should not be a one sided conversation. Allow your partner, especially after you are done telling your story, to open up about his feelings, reactions, etc.


Gage your boyfriend's reaction to what you have told him. If your boyfriend has been well receptive, you may want to open up more and tell him other things about your past. A dialogue is a great way to build a good relationship.
Ask your boyfriend if he wants to tell you something about his past. This is not about blackmailing him, but rather a way to share open and honestly. A related past can help you and him better understand one another.
Be prepared for either a positive or negative reaction. Sometimes a boyfriend may not like what he is hearing you tell him. This is perfectly normal, but something that should be worked on. Continue to follow up, and ask him to listen. Take a break, for both of you to process what you have just revealed.

, You do not want to simply end the dialogue on a depressing tone, or wait to construct reactions later on. Use this time you have to become more open and honest.


Find resolutions to problems. If it was a difficult moment in your past that you shared, work with your boyfriend to find a way forward. This moment does not define you, but it will always be a part of you. Make sure that any future conversations about the topic are solemn and serious.
Perhaps, with your boyfriend, work on a system of visual or physical cues. Every time your boyfriend or yourself relays one of these cues, they will know he or she is referring to this moment/story. That way, in the future, you will know when it is appropriate to reengage the topic of conversation.
If you do not want to reveal all the information at once, find a good stopping point in the story. If the relationship is healthy, there will always be time to come back and tell the rest.
A kiss or a hug is a nice way to tell your partner that you love them and care about what they have said/listened to.

, Days and weeks after, see whether or not you are becoming closer as a couple. Make sure that what you told him is not effecting the relationship in a negative way.


After sharing an intimate moment with one another, often times there is a desire to not reengage the topic right away. This is perfectly natural. However, your boyfriend should always be open to talking again in the future.
Look for any signs such as physical contact, your boyfriend giving you gifts, or the use of sweet, soft language. These can often be signs of a boyfriend who understands what he heard, has taken it to heart, and wants to show you that he cares about you.
Occasionally bring up the topic again in passing. See whether or not your boyfriend is squeamish, or wants to hear what you have to say.

, Sometimes boyfriends are not very emotionally open. This is normal, but something that needs to be worked on.


If you were not able to convince your boyfriend to have a shared moment with you, persist in asking him. It can never hurt to simply keep asking. A healthy relationship is built on openness, so eventually it is critical for you to reveal your past to him.
Some men simply will not listen, or wish to talk. While that might be easy for them, it is not healthy for your relationship. Leaving notes in the home, or in his vehicle can demonstrate how serious this is for you. Talking to someone else, and getting them to ask him to talk with you can also help.

, After a period of time has gone by, talk about your memories a second or third time. With time passing by, it can become easier to release more intimate details or circumstances you would not have before Often times the first time sharing can be very emotional. Shyness, or crying can ensue which might interfere with what you have to say. Reengaging at another point in time should tamper down some of those more obvious emotions/reactions.
Feel free to release more information. The details might not have all been released at the start, or you might have shied away from giving too much away.
As you and your boyfriend create new experiences together as a couple, tell him how your past is shaping your current events/circumstances. If that memory is negatively effecting a present moment, your boyfriend now knows how to help you get out of a bad situation.

, Your first talk may lead to others down the road about completely different subjects. This is a sign of growth in the relationship, and can only help the couple become stronger.


Ask your boyfriend if he wishes to have a talk about his past. Let him know that you are open, just as he was, to intimate discussion. However, do not press to hard, as he may be more afraid or shy about opening up.
Try and create intimate moments without any specific goals in mind. Tell your boyfriend you wish to talk, but are not sure about what. Create a scene, just like before, but let loose about all types of things in your past or your boyfriends past. A constantly fluctuating dialogue can be great, especially for partners that may be nervous.

, Sharing moments from your past should open the relationship up to new possibilities, and create stronger bonds of friendship. If your partner is not receptive, it may be time to reevaluate your relationship.


Revealing something about your past can boost your relationship from the ""friend zone"" to a more rich and understanding partnership. If your partner is not open to any deep, thoughtful communication, your relationship could be stuck in that ""zone"" for a while, if not permanently.Think about whether or not a boyfriend who does not want to hear you out is the best person to have in your life. You not only need a friend, but an emotional partner that can help you overcome any trauma from past experiences.
Judge for yourself about where the relationship is headed. Let your boyfriend know that opening up is important, and if he does not the relationship might be over. Ultimatums are never good for a strong couple, so let your boyfriend come around on his own. However, make sure not to wait to long.

Make sure you're in the right setting.,
Make sure she's in a good mood.,
Know which areas are off-limits.,
Sneak up from behind and surprise her by tickling her sides.,
Tickle under her arms and around her tummy when you are sitting together on the couch.,
Use your lips to tickle her neck or ear.,
Stop if she starts yelling, is having trouble breathing, or if she asks you multiple times.",How to Tickle Your Girlfriend," If you tickle her in front of a bunch of people, it can be embarrassing--both for her and for the people around you. It's best to tickle her somewhere private where you both feel comfortable.;
, Tickling is not always appropriate. If she is very sad, angry, or she's trying to focus on something important, it's probably not a good time to tickle her. It might make you seem insensitive and upset her further.


If she's sad, try giving her a hug instead. You can maybe give her a little tickle around the ribs if she starts feeling better.
Try and remember if she's ever told you that she hates to be tickled. You should take her at her word and know that tickling is not a welcome touch.

, Your girlfriend might not be comfortable being touched in all of her ticklish spots. After all, our most ticklish areas are also the most vulnerable.You may want to do a couple quick tests before trying to tickle her. If she makes any indication that she's uncomfortable, know that spot is off-limits for tickling.


When you are laying down, try running your toes lightly along the bottoms of her feet and see how she reacts.
When her arms are raised or you are hugging her, put your hand near her armpit. Some girls might be worried about sweat and won't want you to touch them there.
Place your hand on her hip or stomach. Notice if she removes your hand or seems to welcome your touch.

, Gently poking or wiggling your fingers (move them like you are typing really fast) up and down her sides will probably make her giggle, especially if you catch her off-guard. Do this for no more than 10 seconds.


When you stop tickling her, you can pull her against you for a sweet hug and kiss.

, This works well if you have just been kissing, since the physical contact won't come out of nowhere. It may also lead to more kissing!


Make sure you aren't tickling her too hard. Tickling can be pleasurable, but only when you use a light touch. Too much pressure and it can become painful., Gently brushing the slope of her neck with your lips or breathing into her ear is a very intimate way to tickle her. It may even cause her to squeal!

, Tickling can be tricky, because she will be laughing when she asks you to stop, and you may think she doesn't really mean it. But the laughter is involuntary, and she might be in pain, getting mad, or feel very uncomfortable and want you to stop.


Only tickling her for a few seconds at a time is a good way to avoid an awkward situation. If she really doesn't like it, you will have only tickled her briefly.
If she tells you she really didn't like being tickled, then you know not to do it again.

Consider some common situations where detachment makes sense.,
Consider the following situations where detachment is critical.,
Try finding some examples in your own life where detachment paid off in a positive or productive way.,
Take closer look at indifference and apathy.,
Consider times when you may have been indifferent.,
Hopefully this has brought clarity, but now lets consider gray areas.,
Consider gray area examples where decisions are not always simple.",How to Tell the Difference Between Detachment and Indifference," For example: When baking a cake it often pays to wait until it's out of the oven and has a chance to cool off before trying to eating it. When at work it's important to take a moment before sending off a potentially offensive email. Another example is not eating that extra portion of food when you are dieting and should be watching your calories.


Obviously these examples are simple because we know that there is a payoff in controlling our temporary emotions, or delaying our gratification but that's to illustrate that detachment makes sense. We can't always think clearly so it pays to be detached at those times.;
, For example a surgeon who is operating on a patient in a life or death situation and doesn't want to make a mistake. Another example is a judge who's decision will affect the outcome of a case and will ultimately effect someone's life for better or worse. A scientist may want to test an experimental drug that will affect possibly millions. Obviously these are extreme situations but it just goes to show detachment is extremely necessary at all levels.

, It could have been something big or small. Maybe you can think of situations where you were too emotionally attached and could have been more detached. The point is not only to see just how necessary it is, but also how beneficial detachment is in our every day lives.

, For example an employee who doesn't perform at their best while at work. They may treat customers rudely or do a poor job on tasks leaving it for someone else to fix. We all have encountered these kind of people. Maybe they just don't seem to care and it effects others negatively. They probably receive lots of complaints before something is done. Why do they do it? Perhaps out of a sense of helplessness or as simple as being in a bad mood in that moment.


A long term example of indifference could be a marriage or relationship which has lost it's joy and vitality. In that sense all parties may have given up on excitement and growth and have generally settled for safety. This is not to say the outcome is ultimately bad, but perhaps loss of hope, and fear of the unknown are keeping people stuck on life support.

, Maybe you were pressured into doing something you didn't want but did it reluctantly anyway. Whatever the case, we all have experienced varying degrees of indifference at times.

, Sometimes it's very necessary to be detached but it's not always clear when or when not to be.


For example if someone asks you or pressures you into an idea you don't feel comfortable with, you may need to say no. However some people may not accept no for an answer. They may attempt to persuade you into agreement by appealing to your emotions. By playing on your guilt, your fear, or your ego they can leverage you into decisions you may not want to make. For this reason it's important to understand the usefulness of detachment.

, That's when detachment could pay off for you. It could be a family member, friend, sales person, charity group or anyone who asks you to give something you don't want to give. In fact that person pressuring you could be you. It's ultimately up to you to make a decision, or not. But your decision may not always be comfortable in the short term.


It could be a situation where you have to wait through negativity before you see positive changes, or it may be walking away from someone who manipulates you. Detachment says, ""I am not deciding on this right now."" ""I am standing by my decision"". ""Let's wait and see."" Indifference says, ""what's the use."" ""who cares."" ""Game over man."" Etc...

Light a couple of candles and invite him over to watch a movie, listen to music, or play a game. Make sure that you have enough time and privacy to have sex. , Some relationship discussions are okay to have while you are out in public, but a discussion about something as personal as your first time together should be had in private and just between the two of you., You may be sending signals that seem obvious to you, but he might not pick up on them. In that case, you might just have to gather your courage and tell him how you feel. Try asking him, ""I am ready to start having sex with you, would you be into that?"" or ""How do you feel about becoming more intimate with me?""
If you don’t like the idea of asking him to have sex, you could simply say, ""I'm ready for us to start having sex, but it's totally cool if you need more time."" Saying something like this provides him with the opportunity to take the next step or decline without too much awkwardness.

, If your boyfriend says he’s not ready, be understanding and don’t push him. He may just need a little more time. It is important to make sure that both of you are ready before you begin having sex. "

Notice if you are codependent.,
See if you exhibit codependent behaviors.,
Ask yourself questions that reflect codependent behaviors.,
Determine if you have feelings caused by codependency.,
Know if you are in a relationship that codependency can affect.,
Determine if your partner fits the other role in a codependent relationship.,
Recognize if your child is also codependent.",How to Tell if You Are Codependent1," Codependency, also known as relationship addiction, is an emotional and behavioral condition that can affect many different people. If you are a codependent person, you may avoid personal uncomfortable or strong emotions in favor of focusing on another person’s needs.


In codependent relationships, you may focus solely on the well-being and needs of the other person in your relationship and completely ignores yourself, often to your own detriment.;
, There are a certain set of behaviors that you will exhibit if you are codependent. Your may notice a few or all of these at one time or another throughout your life. These behaviors include:


A tendency to avoid conflict or uncomfortable emotions, or masking your emotions with passive aggressive expressions of anger or humor
Taking responsibility for other people's actions or overcompensation for a partner’s actions
Misconceptions that love means rescuing another person, which leads to constant thoughts of the other person’s needs
Giving more than your share in the relationship
Tendency to hang on to a relationship no matter what due to your personal feelings of loyalty to your partner, even though the relationship is harmful, usually to avoid feelings of abandonment
Difficulty saying no or having guilt over being assertive
Extreme preoccupation with the opinions of others or valuing their opinions over your ownDifficulty communicating, identifying your own needs, or making decisionsFeeling resentment over lack of acknowledgment for your personal efforts and self-sacrifice, which often lead to feelings of guilt, If you aren't sure you are codependent based on your tendencies or behaviors, there are some questions you can ask yourself that can help reveal it. These questions include:


Does/has the person you live with ever hit or abused you in any way?
Do you have trouble turning people down when they ask for help?
Do you get overwhelmed by how much you have to do, but never take the time to ask for help?
Do you ever doubt your own wants or needs? Or not believe in who you want to become?
Do you go out of your way to avoid an argument?
Do you worry constantly about how others think about you?
Do you think other people's opinions are more important than yours?
Does the person you live with have a drinking or drug problem?
Do you find it hard to adjust to changes in any environment?
Do you get jealous or rejected when your partner spends times with friends/other people?
Do you have a hard time accepting compliments or gifts from others?, If you are or have been in a codependent relationship for a long time, your continual pattern of repressed emotions, your fixation on the other’s needs, and the continual denial of your personal needs can cause lasting effects. It leads to:


Feelings of emptiness
Low self-esteem
Confusion about your personal needs, goals, and feelings, Traditionally, codependency was limited to romantic relationships. However, despite this common misconception, you can suffer from codependency in any type of relationship.


This includes familial and platonic relationships in addition to romantic ones.
Since it is passed down through families, there may be an instance where your entire familial unit exists or did exist in a codependent state, where all the needs of the family unit are put aside for the well-being of one member of the family., There are two categories of people in a codependent relationship. Your role as the codependent individual is known as the ‘’caretaker’’, while the other individual in the relationship, who would be your partner or loved one, is known as the ‘’taker’’.


The takers typically have an excessive need for control of the attention, love, sexual relations, and approval they get and give. They will often get these things through expressions of violence, blame, anger, irritation, criticism, neediness, righteousness, incessant talking, invasive touching, or emotional drama.
The taker individuals will often express these behaviors outside of the codependent relationship, which will affect their children, work relationships, and familial relationships., Codependency can start during childhood, so you might need to look for codependent behaviors in your children. This is especially true if you find that you are codependent yourself. Children will often exhibit similar behaviors as adults, but they may be more subtle because they are still learning the behaviors. Common symptoms of codependent children include:


Inability to make decisions
Extreme worry, stress, and/or anxiety
Low self-esteem
Extreme need to make other people happy
Fear of being alone
Being angry often
Not being assertive in communication with others"

Watch for bashfulness.,

Take note of ""accidental"" touching.,
See whether he makes an effort to be either around you or away from you.,
See whether he makes hanging out a special priority.,
Pay attention to the things you talk about together.,
Look out for flirting.,

Note how he treats other girls.,
Ask friends.,
Ask your guy friend!,
If it turns out that you both like each other, ask him out!",How to Tell if Your Best Guy Friend Likes You," In romantic movies, male leads are often men of fiery passion and debonair confidence. In real life, guys are often shy, nervous, and self-doubting - just like everyone else! If you suspect your guy friend of having a crush on you, looking for the tell-tale signs of bashful shyness is a great place to start. Does your friend seem ever-so-slightly nervous in your company? Does his laugh seem forced or unnatural? Does he seem to make an effort to perpetually laugh and smile around you, even when nothing particularly amusing is happening? These are signs that your friend is worried about what you think about him!


Here are a few other things to look for:

Blushing
Slight awkwardness in conversation
A slight reluctance or hesitation when saying ""goodbye""

;
, People with hardcore crushes have a hard time taking their eyes off of the person their heart is set on. Does your guy friend seem to look you in the eyes more than normal conversation requires? Does he always smile when he sees you looking back? The eyes are said to be the window to the soul - even if your guy friend is too shy to admit his affection, his eyes may give away everything.


People who can't take their eyes off of their crush usually realize it just an instant too late. If you catch your guy friend staring at you and he seems embarrassed or pretends to look away, you may have just caught him in a moment of heartfelt longing!

, A hidden crush can often have a noticeable effect on a guy's thoughts and behavior, subtly and unconsciously changing the way he uses his body. Does your guy friend's body language seem to imply that he's giving you his full, complete attention, whether the situation calls for it or not? In other words, does he make a point to turn and face you when he speaks to you? Does he seem to ""straighten up"" when he notices you? Does he draw his shoulders back or use an arm to prop himself up on a nearby wall when he talks to you? This body language may be betraying secret feelings of affection.

, This is one of the oldest tricks in the book! Many guys with crushes will pounce on any chance to touch the girl of their affections. They'll be extra-generous with hugs, they'll always be the person to hand you something you can't reach, they'll ""accidentally"" bump into you while walking, and so on. If your guy friend suddenly seems to be a little more ""touchy"" than usual, you can be fairly certain he has feelings he's not letting on.


Sometimes, smitten guys will actually go as far as to to contrive situations where they'll have to touch you. If your guy friend, for instance, seems to become extra clumsy around you and develop a habit of dropping things, pay attention to what happens when you pick them up and hand them to him - does he subtly brush your hand?

, Guy friends who secretly adore their female friend usually want to be around her as much as they can. Most of the time, guy friends harboring a secret crush will (consciously or not) gravitate towards her - standing next to her at social occasions, sitting next to her at meals, etc. Sometimes, however, a guy can be especially shy. In this case, even though he longs for his friend, her presence makes him so nervous that he'll actually find ways not to be next to her. Subtly pay attention to your guy friend's habits - if he seems to end up either right next to you or far away from you whenever you hang out in a group of people, you'll know something is up.

, If your guy friend likes you, hanging out with you will become one of his favorite things to do. He'll want to hang out with you as much as he can and will sometimes even cancel his other plans to be able to do so. If your guy friend suddenly seems to be contacting you to see what you're up to and find out whether you're busy every day, you may be dealing with a lovesick guy pal.

, Guys with big crushes on their lady friends will sometimes very subtly allude to their feelings in conversation. They do this in a number of ways. Some try to steer the conversation toward romantic topics, asking questions about who their female friend likes and whether she's looking for someone. Others will want to talk about the practice of dating itself, for instance, joking about how ridiculous most couples seem to be. Keep track of the types of conversations you have with your guy friend - if they mostly seem to be about romance or dating, even if he makes no indication that he's interested in dating you specifically, this may be his way of signalling his interest.


There's an obvious exception to this rule. If your guy friend involves you in his love life by asking you for advice with other girls, it's usually a sign that he thinks of you as a non-romantic friend.

, Some guys are less shy than others. Especially confident guys may even enjoy openly flirting with you. If your guy friend has developed a habit of playfully teasing you, making silly innuendos, or seems to enjoy scandalizing you, this shows that, at the very least, he's thought about you as more than a friend.


Realize that a guy's intentions can be somewhat vague when he flirts. Many guys have a habit of flirting, then playing their flirtation off as a joke if their advances aren't immediately reciprocated. Still others flat out use flirtation and innuendo as a form of goofing off. Persistent, repeated flirtation, however, is almost always a sign of something more.

, Guys who wish they were dating their gal friend sometimes recreate the atmosphere of a date when they're hanging out with her. Keep an eye out for this - when you meet your guy friend for a friendly meal, does he seem a little more ""formal"" than usual? For instance, if he's normally vulgar and loud-mouthed, does he become quieter and more reserved? Does he develop good manners out of nowhere? Does he insist on paying for you? If so, your guy friend may be taking you on a ""fake date"" in an attempt to make the real thing a possibility.


Also, pay attention to where he takes you and how he dresses. If he takes you to fancier, ""nicer"" places than you'd normally go to while hanging out and he ""cleans up"" his appearance, you'll know you're on a fake date.

, This is one of the most important things to look for when trying to figure out whether a guy friend is into you, but it's something that's often overlooked. If you think your guy friend is being especially affectionate with you, before jumping to conclusions, pay attention to the way he interacts with other girls. If he acts the same way around other girls that he does around you, you may be dealing with natural flirt or extrovert, rather than a secret admirer.


Listen when your guy friend talks to you about other girls. As noted above, if he openly asks you for advice on how to attract and win over other girls, he probably doesn't see you as anything more than a friend. However, if he seems unsatisfied with other girls, complaining about how he just can't seem to find the right person, this may be his way of hinting that he's interested in you.

, Finding out whether your guy friend likes you or not doesn't have to be guesswork - one great way to cut right to the heart of the matter is to simply ask someone who's close to him! Most groups of guy friends talk about their crushes with each other. If your guy friend has a crush on you, there's a good chance that one or more of his friends knows about it.


If you can, you may want to find a mutual friend - someone who's close to both you and your guy friend. Not only can this person give you helpful advice and help you plan your next steps, but, since s/he is (hopefully) loyal to you, s/he's less likely to let your secret slip.

On the other hand, asking someone who's friends with your guy friend and not with you can be riskier. There's a good chance with this option that the person you ask will tell your guy friend that you asked about him. This can work in your favor if you want your guy friend to know that you're also interested in him, but, if you don't, it can backfire.



, If you're really confident, the simplest, most direct way to figure out if he likes you is just to ask him to his face. This can be awfully nerve-wracking, but, usually, the temporary stress of speaking openly about your feelings is worth the closure of knowing for sure whether your guy friend likes you or not. When you ask your guy friend whether he likes you, be sure that you're in a private place, as most guys will be too shy to talk about their feelings in front of other people.


Some guys, unfortunately, are also too shy to talk about their feelings in front of you. If you ask your guy friend directly whether he likes you or not and he says no, but he keeps flirting with you and being affectionate, you may have encountered a guy who's too shy to admit his true feelings to anyone. There's not much you can do in this case. Simply live your life and do what you want to do and eventually, this guy either will or won't gain some confidence.

, If you find out that your guy friend likes you from one of his friends or from your guy friend himself and you know that you like him back, you have no reason not to ask him out. This will probably naturally happen anyway once you both know that you like each other. Enjoy your first date - since you're already friends, you'll be able to skip the awkward small talk and enjoy your time together as a new couple!


In our society, there's an unspoken stereotype that guys are supposed to ask girls out and not vice versa. If your guy friend likes you but is too shy to ask you out, don't be afraid to completely ignore this outdated tradition! There's no reason that you should wait to be happy until you're asked out in the ""proper"" way, especially when the ""proper"" way is a relic of an earlier, more formal time.

Text or call to tell him that you want to start having sex.,
Show him instead of telling him.,
Write him a note.,
Wait for a special occasion.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Want to Have Sex2," If you are too nervous to tell you boyfriend in person or you simply want to be able to plan ahead for your first time together, texting or calling him is a good option. If you text him, you can be direct by texting something like ""Wanna have sex later?"" This text will certainly grab his attention but it is casual enough that you can play it off like you were kidding, just in case he says no.
Or you can try something more suggestive, tell him what you're wearing or go with the classic ""What are you wearing?"" This may lead to a steamy sexting session or phone call. When it feels right, ask him to come over and see what happens next.

, The next time that you alone together, use the opportunity to show him that you are ready to have sex. Make sure that you know that he is ready for sex before you do try to seduce him. If he says he is not ready yet, don’t take it personally. Just give him some more time and try again when he tells you he’s ready. , An email or handwritten note may be a perfect solution if you are having a hard time verbalizing the way that you feel. Write honestly about how you feel and keep it lighthearted.Also, make sure that he reads the note in private or in your company and that he either destroys/deletes it or keeps it somewhere very safe after he has read it.

, An upcoming special occasion, like a birthday or holiday, might be a good time to tell him that you want to start having sex. Waiting until a specified date will give you time to prepare yourself and it will also make the occasion more memorable.

Think about what you want.,
Protect yourself.,
Try not to obsess over telling your boyfriend that you want to have sex.,
Talk about your hopes for the relationship.,
Don’t set unrealistic expectations.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Want to Have Sex3," Before you even think about what to say to your boyfriend, make sure that you feel ready for sex in general. If you are considering becoming sexually active and have never had sex before, think about why you want to become sexually active. Consider your emotional readiness, knowledge of birth control and safe sex, your relationship with your boyfriend, and your personal beliefs and values., Whether you have been with other guys or not, your first time with someone should be special. Think about how you’d like the first time to be and make sure that you really want to take this step with him. , Purchase condoms and keep them on hand at all times, so that you are prepared for your first sexual encounter with your boyfriend. Store a couple in your purse and in your nightstand. You should also have a conversation with your boyfriend about contraceptive options, so that you are both taking responsibility for your sexual health.Keep in mind that birth control will only provide protection against pregnancy, but condoms can protect you from STDs and pregnancy. Also, remember that neither method is 100% effective. , Even if it turns out that he doesn’t feel ready to have sex yet, he will most likely appreciate your honesty. Just relax and make a plan to discuss your feelings with him., If you want to make sure he is committed to you before you have sex with him, you should talk to him to gauge his ideas about where the relationship is headed. Just make sure to have this conversation with your boyfriend before you start sleeping together. It will be much easier to discuss your hopes and expectations about your relationship before you have become sexual partners than after.During this conversation, make sure that you listen to his hopes for the relationship and respect what he has to say. You can strike up the conversation by saying:If you don't want to sound like you are trying to talk about your relationship you can ask him, ""So what do you think you'll be doing this time next year?"" If you're part of his vision for the future then he is probably interested in something long term.
If you want to be more direct with him, you can ask him, ""Where do you think we're headed?""
Or if you just want to know if he considers you his girlfriend or not, you can ask him ""So what should I call you if any of my friends asks about us?"", You should have sex with someone only if you want to and are ready to.Don’t have sex with your boyfriend if you are hoping that by becoming sexual partners your boyfriend will want to propose, ask you to move in with him, or start treating you differently. Sex will not fix a relationship, but it may affect it negatively if one or both partners are not ready to become sexually active "

Determine if your family has a history of codependency.,
Consider if you have a history of abuse.,
Recognize common situations that cause codependent relationships.,
Look for divorce in your past.",How to Tell if You Are Codependent2," Codependent behaviors are often passed down through families. This means that somewhere in your past, you were either witness to or part of a codependent relationship. Through these situations, you were taught that it was wrong to express any needs, wants, or emotions.


You may have spent portions of your childhood being called upon to meet the needs of others, which taught you as a child to suppress personal emotional and physical needs as you developed in favor of taking care of a family member.
When you left this family environment, you may have continued this pattern within your own romantic and other relationships, which may then get passed on to your children., Another common situation that leads to codependency is a history of abuse. In these situations, if you have been abused, you may become codependent as a way to deal with the trauma of the situation. You may suppress emotions and needs in these abusive situations in favor of focusing on other’s needs.


This abuse may have happened during your childhood and continued without intervention from your family. This can also happen in codependent familial relationships.
This can be emotional, physical, or sexual abuse., Although codependency issues can occur in any type of relationship or with any person, there are certain types of people that encourage codependent relationships. Codependent relationships often develop between you and a person who needs looking after or taken care of. These types of people include:


Those suffering from addiction
Individuals with mental health disorders
People with chronic illness, Another past experience that may lead to codependency is divorce. In situations with divorce, an opportunity may arise when an eldest child has to step into a parental role to pick up the slack for the absentee parent. In these cases, the parenting of the child may produce behaviors of codependency.You may also not want to discuss these difficulties with the remaining parent so as to not upset them. This leads to the repression of emotions and can lead to codependency.

Discover the root of your codependency.,
Learn to focus on yourself.,
Create personal boundaries.,
Join a support group.",How to Tell if You Are Codependent3," If you find you are codependent, you should see a mental health professional to help determine the root of your condition. Since codependency is often related to childhood dysfunction, you will work with a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional to dig into your past to determine the cause. From there, the mental health professional will help you work through these issues in order to heal your condition.The most common forms of treatment are:


Education about the condition and how it affects you and your relationshipsExperiential group therapy, which uses movements, actions, and activities to work through your condition with therapy activities such as equine therapy, music therapy, and expressive arts therapyIndividual and group talk therapy, which focuses on discussing and talking through your issues and experiences

, Codependent people often forget who they are and what their own wants, needs, and desires are. When you are seeking treatment for codependency, work with your mental health professional to help you relearn who you are and what you want out of life.


Since codependent people spend their lives thinking about others, you may not understand how to determine your own needs, wants, goals, and desires. The mental health professional can help you to discover these things.You may also learn how to perform self-care techniques in order to focus on your own well-being. These include reducing your stress, getting enough sleep, and eating well., In addition to finding the cause and learning about yourself, you need to break from your current tendency for destructive relationship behaviors and patterns. This can be done by building healthy, flexible boundaries in your relationships. This is often very difficult for a codependent person to accomplish at first, so work with your mental health professional to learn about boundaries and how to incorporate them into your life. This can be done by learning how to:


Lovingly detach yourself from others
Release your control of others needs and well-being
Recognize your internal criticisms and personal need for perfection
Accept yourself and any uncomfortable emotions
Become assertive about your personal needs and values, If you want more help or want to talk to others who are going through the same thing, think about joining a support group. There are some organizations that are geared towards codependency, such as Co-Dependents Anonymous and Al-Anon.You can search for group meetings on the Anonymous website.
Meetings for Al-Anon, an organization specifically targeted to codependent individuals who have dealt with alcoholic family relationships, can be found on their website.

Flirt.",How to Tell Your Girlfriend You Want to Be Intimate," It can be difficult and embarrassing talking about sex, but it's important to talk about it and be sure about it before jumping into bed. Having sex is an important step in any relationship and will bring the two of you closer.Reflect on whether or not you're ready before approaching your girlfriend.


If this is your very first time having sex, be confident in your decision. You might want to wait or reconsider if there's a risk you'll get in trouble with your parents, if it's against your religion, or if you feel pressured at all by others.If this is not your first time having sex, but it is your first time with this girlfriend, you still want to be confident in your decision. Sex can make a relationship more serious and you need to be sure you're ready for that.;
, Your girlfriend won't know how you feel about sex and about her unless you tell her. Try to be open and encourage your girlfriend to be open with you as well. Be specific about why you want to have sex with her, as well as any fears or worries you have about how sex will affect your relationship.Start by showing her you love her. You might say, ""I've been enjoying our time together in this relationship, but I want to talk about becoming more intimate with you. I love you and I feel so close with you; I feel like we're ready for sex. What do you think?""
Acknowledge that this might change how you feel about each other. For example, you might say, ""I know that sex is a really important step and can complicate things. I want you to feel comfortable.""Show her that it's not all about the sex. Restate why you want her or what you love about her.Instead of saying, “Do you want to have sex with me tonight?” you can say, “You’re beautiful. I love you and I want to be with you.”

, Your girlfriend may not have an answer for you right away. Give her time to think. Let her know you want to talk about it again when she's ready and that you'll be there for her.Remember that your girlfriend has the right to say ""no"" to you, even if you've been in a committed relationship for awhile, or if she's had sex with other people before. Just because you've been together for a long time does not mean you can pressure her to have sex.You can reassure her so that she doesn't feel pressured. You could say, ""I am nervous, too and don't want to rush you. If you're not ready, that's okay.""
Revisit the conversation if she's not ready or wants to wait, but don't pressure her to talk about sex every day., It’s important that you’re clear that she wants to be intimate and have sex with you. Consent means she agrees and is excited to have sex with you.Remember that:If she is silent or doesn’t answer, that is not consent.
If you have to beg, force, or manipulate her into having sex with you, that is not consent.
Either one of you can withdraw your consent to intimacy and sex at any time during your relationship.
""No"" means ""no.""

, Your girlfriend may agree or want to have sex with you, but it's normal for her to have some concerns to address first. Be open and honest in your answers to her questions. You might have important questions you need answered, too. Talk about:Your previous partners
Any history of STDs or STIs
What your sexual preferences are, such as how you like to be touched or what positions you like

, You and your girlfriend will feel much more comfortable if you have a conversation about safe sex and birth control before you have sex. Be honest with each other about what your preferences and expectations are for safe sex.


Be willing to buy or use your own methods of birth control, such as condoms.
Ask her what birth control methods she is on or prefers. You can ask, ""Are you currently on any birth control? Do you like it or would you prefer doing something else?"", Healthy communication about sex isn’t just about being able to be vulnerable and express your desires. It’s also about being able to ask her what she wants and likes. Try to understand what she wants. You might ask:What are your desires or fantasies?
How do you like to be touched?
Are there certain places you don't want me to touch?

, Sex is an emotional subject, so make sure you pick a good time to talk to your girlfriend. You might be scared or nervous to approach her for fear of hurting her feelings, overwhelming her, scaring her away, or being vulnerable yourself. Make time to talk to her when:You can be alone together.
You haven't just had a fight.
You won't be interrupted by anything else.
You're relaxed, maybe enjoying dinner or wine together.
You're not in the heat of the moment or about to become intimate.

, Before initiating sexual intimacy, spend time together doing something relaxing or enjoyable beforehand. This will give you and your girlfriend a sense of connection and calm.Some ways you can relax together are:


Have a quiet dinner together.
Go on a walk.
Watch the sunset.
Take a shower or bath together.

, If you slowly increase how much you’re touching her, her sexual arousal may increase as well. Touching her is more subtle and could potentially lead to fun, more spontaneous sex.Kiss her.
Give her a gentle shoulder massage.
Hold her hand.
Stroke her arm.
Tickle her.
Always check-in with her as you touch her to avoid making her feel pressured to have sex. You can ask, ""Does this feel good to you?"" or ""How are you feeling?""

, Create a sensual environment to further set the mood for intimacy and sex. You want to make your girlfriend feel comfortable, turned on, and wanted. You’ll also want to make sure you’re in a safe place where you won’t be interrupted. You can:Dim the lights.
Put out candles or light a fire.
Put out soft and clean sheets.
Put on soft jazz or other instrumental music.
Eat sweet fruit or chocolate.

, Be romantic in your relationship on a consistent basis. Women tend to need to feel connected to their partner emotionally before engaging in sex, and romance is a great way to achieve this feeling. Romance shows that you’re thinking of her and makes her feel more secure in the relationship.Some romantic things you can do include:Buy her flowers.
Write her a love note.
Send her a romantic poem.
Spend time talking with her and cuddling in bed.

, It can be difficult to create an intimate moment with your girlfriend if your mind is elsewhere, like on work or future plans, or even on how you are performing or how you look. You and your girlfriend will both enjoy your intimate moments more if you can try to fully be present in them. Instead of focusing on your nerves about sex with your girlfriend, or worrying about what you look like, try to just be with her in the moment. You can:Some ways to be mindful, or in the moment, include focusing on your breathing and hers, noticing the sensation of her skin on yours, paying attention to any sounds she’s making.
Being present in the moment can improve sexual performance, as you are more tuned into cues from your partner. It can also decrease performance anxiety, as you aren't focusing on what might happen or the future, but what you are feeling, doing, and experiencing only in that very moment.Being responsible about sex — such as using contraception and only doing it when you both are ready — can help remove any fears about STD's, pregnancy, or if you're rushing things., Do not rush through your intimate time together. This should be an enjoyable time for you and your girlfriend, so take your time. Your girlfriend may need some time and foreplay. Be playful, touch her, and ask what she likes throughout the process., Your sex life and your level of physical intimacy will thrive if you make time for each other. Prioritize your relationship and focus on strengthening emotional intimacy and connection with your girlfriend. If you make time for her outside of the bedroom, you’ll be more likely to have a happier sex life. Try to:Share meals together.
Take walks and talk together.
Exercise together.
Turn the TV off before bed and cuddle.

, If you’re in a serious relationship with your girlfriend, eventually your sex life may get more mundane and you might not find yourself in the mood as often. To keep this from happening, intentionally try to put yourself in the mood for sex and intimacy. Learn what turns you on and try to focus on that, then initiate with your girlfriend later.To put yourself in the mood, you might try to:Read something erotic or romantic.
Listen to a sexy song.
Wear lingerie.
Think about the last time you had sex with your girlfriend.

, To spice up your intimate moments, be adventurous and try new things with your girlfriend. Try not to stay in the same routine to keep intimacy alive and fun. Always remember to be safe and get your girlfriend’s interest and permission before your try anything new. You might consider:Trying a different location or room, not just your bedroom.
Trying to be intimate at a different time of day than normal.
Trying new positions.
Buying her new lingerie.
Using sex toys.

, Once you’ve been with your girlfriend for a while, it may be difficult to keep your chemistry alive. Try to flirt with your girlfriend like you did when you first started dating. You might send her a sexy text message during the day, or dress up a little to catch her attention."

Give him your undivided attention.,
Arrange to run into him at event.,
Smile and give him eye contact.,
Buy him a gift.",How to Tell a Man You Like Him1," One of the first steps in letting a man know you’re attracted to him is showing a genuine interest in what he says or does. Whether you’re hanging out together or as part of a group, you’ll have the perfect opportunity to show him that you like him.

If you happen to score one-on-one time with him, ask him questions to learn more about him. Try not to pepper him with questions like you’re conducting an interview. Allow the questions to flow naturally while you’re having a conversation. You could start off asking, “So, what do you like to do for fun?” Or if you’re out at a bar or some other kind of venue, “Do you come out here often?” Ask him specific questions as opposed to saying, “Tell me about yourself.” And focus on light topics or simple things. Ask him about his job, his taste in music, or his favorite foods or sports team.
If you’re in a group, show him more attention than everyone else. While you don’t want to make things awkward by acting as if the rest of the group doesn’t exist, show him he has your attention by hanging out in a spot near him and by positioning your body toward his. Remain active in the group’s conversation, but make an effort to respond when he says something interesting and laugh at his jokes.;
, If you’ve managed to have a decent conversation with him and asked good questions, then you should know enough about his interests to figure out where he may hang out. Does he play in a band or participate in a sport? Do you know who his favorite team is? What bar does he like going to on the weekend?


If he mentions he attends local sports games, grab a friend and arrange to run into him at a game.
Add him as a friend on Facebook or follow him on Twitter to keep up with his social calendar. Attend a couple events you think you may also enjoy, so you won’t feel out of place.
Get close to his friends to find out what they often do as a group. When you find out their plans for an evening, suggest you and a few of your friends attend. By making plans this way, it won’t seem so obvious that you’re intentionally trying to arrange quality time with the man you like.

, If you’re across the room from him, allow him to catch you looking at him. When he does, smile at him for a couple seconds while looking into his eyes, and then look away. Likewise, whenever you catch him looking your way, show you appreciate his attention by smiling.

, Get him a gift that lets him know you’ve been thinking of him. You don’t have to spend a lot of money, or any money at all, if you’re crafty. Choose a gift that you feel reflects his interests or is a reminder of some memorable moment the two of you may have shared. You could buy the bobble-head figure of his favorite sports player. Get him tickets to a concert you’ll both enjoy. If you like making crafts, you could decorate a picture frame and include a cute picture of the two of you, or create a collage of your favorite moments together.

Gauge your relationship.,
Make sure he knows you like him.,
Put a little planning into your confession.,
Have no expectations.",How to Tell Him You Love Him1," Before professing love for someone else, it is important to determine how the other person feels about you and how your relationship is going. The ""L word"" can create some strong emotions, so you want to be careful about who you say it to. Try to reserve it for people you have an intimate, enjoyable relationship with. If the relationship is fairly new, it might not be the best time to jump into ""I love you's.""


When gauging your relationship, actions will tell you more than words can. Does he always seem to want to be around you? Do you feel like things are just more fun when you're with him? Would you give the world for him? These are all signs that love may be appropriate to bring up.;
, An ""I love you"" confession shouldn't be an absolute surprise. Make sure the person you're smitten with at least knows that you like him. In other words, you should already have some sort of romantic connection. Subtle but romantic hints like cuddling during a late night movie, kissing his forehead, and locking eyes when he's telling you about his day are good signs of affection to start with. If he's comfortable with these, discussing love may be out of the question.


Like the acts of affection above, you'll usually want to reserve ""love"" for your boyfriend or significant other. While some relationships start with a profession of love between two people that aren't in a relationship, this is less common.

, Make sure it'll be somehow where you're both alone. Other people being around will only increase your anxiety. You don't have to plan to be at a cheesy ""rom-com"" setting like an ocean cliff, but it shouldn't be in a dirty alleyway either. Someplace reasonably romantic, like a private spot at a scenic park, should do.


Make sure you're completely sober ahead of time so there are no Freudian slips.

, when it comes to love, there are no rules. Each relationship is unique. Some couples can say they love each other within hours of meeting. For others it may take years. No one knows you, your partner and the relationship better than you do. Use your best judgment and plan to speak from the heart. Once you've made up your mind, try to think of the consequences — good or bad. If it goes well, great. If it doesn't, at least you got it off your chest.


Here is a good rule of thumb for figuring out whether you have too high of expectations: Imagine that you confessed your love and he told you he didn't love you back. Would you still want to have said it? If you wouldn't, then you may not be ready to utter those three little words.

List your needs.,
Figure out your priorities.,
Practice the talk.,
Choose the right time and place.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Your Wants and Needs1," You should list your needs before you talk to your partner. This helps you be clear about what you want so you can communicate them to your partner. You may want to start with what you need for physical affection and intimacy. This may include sex, romance, physical touching, and emotional sharing. You should also think about what you need in regard to children and a family, finances, and outside friendship, along with cooking, cleaning, and running the household.You should realize that wants and needs are two different things. Needs are things that should be met because they are essential for your happiness, safety, and well-being. Wants are things you prefer to have happen because it causes you pleasure.For example, you may need your partner to work and make a certain salary to complement your salary so all the bills are paid. You may need your partner to let you know that they care and love you.;
, Your partner won’t know how to meet your wants and needs if you don’t know what they are. You have to figure out your priorities before you can communicate it to your partner. This may be your priorities from every part of your life. Once you identify your priorities, you can figure out what you need in your relationship, which can help to better your relationship.Figure out what priorities are important to you because this will help you determine your needs. For example, your top priorities may be intimacy, family, and financial stability.
Order your needs from most to least important to help you decide which ones to communicate first and which ones can wait. This will help to ensure that you are telling your partner what needs are most important to you. It may also help to prevent you from feeling overwhelmed by all of the things you need.

, You should practice talking to your partner before you talk to them in person. Start by writing notes or listing important points you want to make. Speak your wants and needs out loud to yourself to get comfortable with them. You may even practice in a mirror.


If you need help, you can ask a trusted friend to listen to you and help you practice.

, You should choose an appropriate time to address your needs and wants. Choose a time when both you and your partner have time to discuss the issues. You should make sure neither of you have anything pressing to do for hours when you choose to talk.


You should talk in a private place where you won’t be disturbed. Don’t go to a restaurant or coffee shop.
If you have kids, see if someone can keep the children for a few hours so you can talk privately.

Flirt using your body language.,
Maintain eye contact during conversation.,
Dress to impress.,
Flirt by giving him compliments.,
Flirt via text.",How to Tell a Man You Like Him2," Flirting is a fun and obvious way to let a man know that you like him. It’s best to use this method in conjunction with another. You want to send a clear message that you’re attracted to him and not simply flirting for fun.When you’re talking, face him and lean your body towards his. This lets him know you have his full attention, and will stroke his ego a bit if other guys are around.
Casually and lightly touch him to seem more sensual or playful during conversation. If neither of you moves in for a hug when you say hello, lightly touch his arm. You can touch his hand to add excitement to your conversation.
Let’s say you have something incredible to tell him. Lean forward excitedly, and while touching his hand exclaim, “And you won’t believe what happened next!” You can also touch him on his shoulder or knee while being playful or teasing him. Lightly push his shoulder with your fingertips while saying, “You’re so silly.” Or touch his knee while telling him how funny he is.

, Looking into someone’s eyes for an extended period of time is an immediate way to forge a connection. But it takes confidence to hold someone’s gaze for longer than a couple seconds. It’s easier to look into someone’s eyes while you’re having a conversation. Stare into his eyes for at least 7 seconds at a time when you’re talking to him or when he’s talking to you. You can glance away here and there, but you don’t want to spoil the moment by looking down at your phone or across the room while he’s telling a story about his childhood pet.

, Flirting is about grabbing his attention and enticing his eyes. You don’t need to revamp your entire wardrobe. Simply make more of an effort to look nice when you’re around him. You can wear more form fitting clothes to accentuate your features. Take your outfit a step further by applying makeup to emphasize your looks. But don’t overdo it. You want to highlight, not hide your true appearance. Wear a bold lip color, like red, which is a sensual color. And apply mascara and eye shadow to make your eyes pop.

, Generic compliments can come off cheesy and seem half-hearted. To compliment him in a way that shows that you like him, pinpoint something specific about him that you can praise. A couple examples: “That shirt looks really nice on you.” “You’re a great drummer. I loved watching you play.” To make your compliments sound flirty, move closer to him and lower your voice as you talk.

, Send him texts that let him know you’re thinking about him. Depending on how well you know each other and the type of person he is, you don’t want to annoy him by sending several texts throughout the day. Keep it light by texting him good morning and telling him you hope he enjoys his day. You can text him a joke or something intriguing you might have heard that’s related to his interests. And you can also compliment him. If you just saw each other the evening before, you could say: “I had fun last night” or “You look nice in blue.”

Ask him if he’s single.,
Tell him directly how you feel.,
Ask him out on a date.,
Text him your feelings.,
Tell one of his friends how you feel, and let the friend deliver the message.",How to Tell a Man You Like Him3," Naturally, he’ll wonder why you’re asking. And if you’ve been showing him a lot of attention or flirting before throwing out this question, it will be obvious you’re asking because you like him. Even if you already know he’s single (because you may have asked his friends), you can still ask. Look at it as just another way to let him know you’re interested.


You can bring it up casually during conversation after you’ve talked for a while. If you’ve flirted with him and noticed him responding to you, you can be upfront and ask earlier. Especially if you sense the feeling may be mutual. You could ask him directly: “Are you single?” “Do you have a girlfriend?” Or you could ask in a more playful manner: “So where’s your girlfriend?” “Are you here alone?”
Be prepared with a follow-up response once he answers. If he says he is single, you can reply by saying “Good” and smile. Or if you’re feeling bold, you can lean towards him and say in a low voice, “I’m in luck then.” If he says he’s in a relationship, it’s best to be respectful and back away at this point. Instead of ending the conversation abruptly, and to keep the moment light, you can tease him by saying, “Darn it! I’m too late.”

, Rather than beating around the bush or throwing out hints, hoping he gets the picture, gather up the courage to let him know that you like him. Arrange a moment where the two of you can have time to talk privately. You can make this moment as serious or as lighthearted as you feel. What you say and how you say it all depends on how much you like him.


If you’re bold, be straightforward and say, “Hey, I like you. I'd like to be more than friends.” You’re essentially pinning him in a corner with this method. But you’ll know rather quickly if he also likes you or not.
Tell him you think he’s cute and suggest you both should hang out more. While this is also a direct way to let a man know you like him, it’s also a more casual way to express your feelings. It takes the pressure off of him to respond appropriately since you’re only suggesting you have more fun together. Try saying, “I think you’re cute and a lot of fun. We should hang out more.”

, If you’re confident, but still don’t want to directly express your feelings, ask him out on a date. You can do this either in person, over the phone, or via text. Let him know you really enjoy his company and would like to spend more time getting to know him better. You could say, “I’ve had a really great time with you lately. You’re a lot of fun. I’d love to spend more time with you. Just the two of us. Would you like to go out sometime?” Have an outing already in mind before you ask. You’re asking him out. You don’t want to turn the tables on him and have him do all the planning.

, Maybe you can’t yet muster up the courage to tell him face to face. Or maybe you fumble over your words when you’re nervous. That’s okay because texting is fine.


You can send him a text message expressing your feelings as if you were standing in front him. You can make your message either serious or lighthearted, depending on how much you like him. Here’s an example of lighthearted message: “I think you’re really hot. Want to go out sometime?” If you’re feelings are a little more intense, try this: “I have a confession: I can’t stop thinking about you. I think you’re really cute and funny. Maybe you feel the same? If so, let’s go out sometime to get to know each other better.”
If his feelings aren’t the same, he has the unfortunate ability to ignore your text all together, pretending he never got it. Be prepared for this possibility. And also be prepared for the awkward moments that may follow if you happen to run into him later. You may have to pretend as if you never sent it, or you’ll have to muster up the courage and confront him in person about the text message and your feelings.

, If you’re close to his friends, you can pick one to confide in about your feelings. They’ll likely be able to tell you if your friend may feel the same. And they definitely won’t hesitate to pass on the message for you."
"
Stay calm and confident.,
Wait for an appropriate moment.,
Say it.,
Wait for his response.,
Accept his reaction.",How to Tell Him You Love Him2," The behavior of the person saying ""I love you"" sets the tone for the conversation. If you are nervous and meander by saying things like, ""I've got something to tell you but I don't know how,"" or ""I'm not sure if I should tell you this,"" it makes the discussion more ""serious."" Instead, things should flow smoothly and casually into the topic. Butterflies in your stomach are normal, but doing your best to stay cool will make things much easier.


If you have decided to say ""I love you,"" say it like you mean it. There is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about. He should respect you for being open and honest.

, Blurting out ""I love you"" in the middle of a conversation puts the other person on the spot and forces him to react in the heat of the moment. The guy you're talking to should not feel pressured to respond. Remember that you are looking for an honest exchange.


Instead of expressing your love abruptly like in the example above, wait until you're both happy — for instance, after you share a laugh at a nice joke together. Then, say something like, ""Hey, listen, I have something to tell you,"" and briefly preface your confession with a description of how you feel.

, This is the big moment. Say that you love this person to his face. Look directly into their eyes when you tell him and keep a straight face he knows that you're being serious.


Substitutions for face-to-face conversation won't do here. No texting him it when he's in another room or getting a friend to tell him for you. Don't even do it over the phone.

, Understand that a confession like this can be a lot to take in at once. Don't start panicking and having a nervous breakdown if he doesn't say ""I love you too"" instantly. He may need a few minutes to take a deep breath and let this new information sink in. Be patient. Respect the difficulty of the conversation as you allow him to gather his thoughts.


Know that he may not come to a decision in front of you. If he's obviously having trouble, let him take some time on his own to think about it. He may say he loves you too ten minutes later. On the other hand, he may say it a week later.

, Eventually, your special guy will have a response for you. Respect his choice here — even if it's not exactly what you had in mind. No matter what, you were courageous for speaking your heart.


If you got the response you wanted, beware — it may be followed by a heavy make-out session.
On the other hand, if you get a ""No,"" a ""I just want to be friends,"" or something similar, don't worry. There are plenty of fish in the sea and there is going to be someone out who will love you. It's just not this person.

Learn how to communicate assertively.,
Listen actively.,
Be specific.,
Ask for one thing at a time.,
Let your partner know your boundaries.,
Avoid blame.,
Accept your partner’s differences.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Your Wants and Needs2," If you are feeling like your needs are not being met in your relationship, then this might be partially due to a lack of assertive communication. To ensure that you are communicating with your partner as effectively as possible, try to develop some assertive communication skills.

If something is not going the way you want, say it right then instead of waiting or silently dealing with your frustration. For example, if your partner gives a short answer when you ask about his or her day after work, then you might say, ""When I ask you about your day, I'd love to know all the details even if you think they're boring. I'm still interested.""

, You should listen to what your partner says. This is important when they are responding to your wants and needs and telling you what they need. Your partner may believe they have been meeting your wants and needs, or have a different way of approaching things. Listen to what your partner says with an open mind and respectful attitude.Don’t get mad if your partner doesn’t agree with you or understand right away. Be open to listening to their point of views so you can come to a compromise.

, When you tell your partner about your wants and needs, make sure to be specific and clear. Being vague or speaking in general terms may only create confusion. Your partner may not know exactly what you mean, or their interpretation of the general statement may be different than yours.For example, if you say, “I need more intimacy,” your partner may get the general idea but not know exactly what you need. Their version of intimacy may be different than yours. Instead, be specific. You might say, “I need you to kiss me more often and talk to me about your day.”

, If you have never told your partner what you want or need, you may have many things you want to ask for. However, try not to overwhelm your partner by asking for too much at one time. This might make it seem like your partner is doing everything wrong or cause unneeded stress in your relationship. Instead, ask for one thing at a time.Start with the most important thing that you need from your partner. Once the two of you have worked on it, you can move on to another want.

, Telling your partner about your wants and needs doesn’t just include things you want to happen. It also can include things you don’t want to happen. You should tell your partner know what your boundaries are so they can give you want you want and need.For example, you should tell your partner where your privacy boundaries are. If there are things, boxes, or boxes that are private and off-limits, explain this to your partner.
If you have sexual boundaries, you should explain these clearly to your partner. There may be some negotiation where your sexual needs and wants are concerned, but if there are things you are unwilling to do, let your partner know.
Try saying, ""I don't feel comfortable fulfilling all of your fantasies. However, I am willing to try a few new things that you want to.""

, If there are needs or wants that may stem from a conflict, try not to blame your partner. Instead, use “I” statements and keep things factual and calm. Blaming or being dramatic will not do anything to solve the conflict or get your needs met.


For example, if you feel the house is a mess, you may want to say, “You never do anything to help around the house!” or “The house looks like a tornado hit it!” Instead, be factual and say, “The house is messy right now” or “Things are not as neat as they could be.”
Keep the statements about you instead of your partner. For example, don’t say, “You are being clingy.” Instead, say, “I miss spending time with my friends.”

, You and your partner come from different backgrounds, even if you grew up in similar areas. This means that the way you and your partner approach certain things may differ. You may solve problems differently, have different levels of communication, or show affection different ways.As you think about what you want and need, you should consider the way your partner handles things. If you need your partner to show affection, they may be showing affection in their way. You need to figure out how your partner may be meeting your needs in their own unique way.
This doesn’t mean you can’t ask for your partner to do things you need, but your partner may think they are already meeting your needs.
You might say, ""I understand that you think sitting side by side on the couch is spending quality time together. However, I would like you to touch me and talk to me in the evenings instead of just watching television. We can talk for half an hour and then watch a television program.""

Know that your partner can’t meet all your needs.,
Be open to your partner’s wants and needs.,
Compromise and negotiate to meet each other’s wants.,
Keep the lines of communication open.,
Evaluate your progress.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Your Wants and Needs3," Your partner is your equal and the person you are building your life with. However, your partner can’t meet all of your needs. Some of your needs and wants will need to be met in other ways and through other relationships.For example, your need for companionship may not be able to be only met by your partner. You may need to have this need met by family and friends as well.

, Being in a relationship means giving as much as you are getting. Because of this, your partner may have some wants and needs of their own that they need met. You should be open to meeting their needs as much as they are open to meeting yours.The two of you should work together to come up with ways to meet both of your needs, especially if your needs are different.
You may not understand your partner’s needs, but you should respect them. For example, you may not understand why your partner needs you to go home with them every few months. Your partner explains they need your support, so you respect their wants and go with them.
For example, you may say, ""I am not going to give up my Wednesday night book club so you can join a Wednesday night intramural sports league. However, I will gladly watch the kids on another night of the week so you can join a Tuesday or Thursday night sports league.""

, There may wants or needs that you or your partner needs that you may not be willing to meet in the way your partner wants. You may find yourself demanding something you want and not thinking about what your partner needs. If this is the case, you both should negotiate and compromise to come to an agreement you are both comfortable with.For example, you may need your partner to be more social and outgoing, but your partner is a shy, introverted person. You both compromise that your partner will go to social gatherings held in smaller groups. You can say, ""Large groups make me uncomfortable, so I do not want to go to large parties or bars with you. However, if you want to get together with a few couples at someone's house, I would be willing to do that.""

, As you and your partner work towards fulfilling each other's wants and needs, be open to communicating with each other. You should continue talking about your wants and needs.


Make sure that you let your partner know when they fulfill your wants and needs effectively. Letting your partner know that you appreciate their efforts and that they are doing what you need can help strengthen your relationship and make your partner feel good about themselves and their place in the relationship.

, Every so often, you and your partner should sit down to evaluate the progress of your relationship. Take the time to discuss if both of you feel that your needs and wants are being met. If there are additional things you'd like to discuss at this time, let your partner know.


During these talks, you should let your partner know when things are going well. Don't just make these progress talks about negative things. It is really important to give your partner positive reinforcement and let them know what they are doing right. Show your appreciation to your partner.

Forget about lines.",How to Talk to a Girl in a Group," Not every group is going to be appropriate to approach. Is this a group of girls commiserating over a group member's break up? Are they talking about work or is a family member sick? Listen in without seeming obvious for cues.


If it is a serious topic you're best not to talk to her. If it is light-hearted, then you're probably safe to proceed.;
, The first part of talking to any group is blending in without making it too obvious. Look for a natural opening in a group, or wait until you overhear something good, so you don't just butt into a conversation. Make yourself seem like you're part of the group without invading the group's space.


It is okay to jump in as long as you do it in a nice manner. Ask her questions relating to the subject. Say, ""I'm lost here, what are we talking about. Gimme the spoiler?""
Don't just walk up to a group of people you don't know and start standing there and listening. That'll be a big creepy turn-off.

, Listen to what the group is talking about, and start contributing to whatever they're talking about. Use the subjects the group is talking about to your advantage.


Introduce yourself if necessary. If the group is talking about a recent movie, join the conversation and share your impressions.
Talk to the entire group of girls. Don't try to single out the girl you're trying to talk to immediately. Depending on the girl, should could be worried about offending her friends, or feel bad that they aren't being given the same amount of attention.

, After starting the conversation relating to what the group is talking about, slowly transition into just talking to the girl you want to talk to. Turn toward her and make eye contact. Address the things you say to her, instead of the group.


Start making little side comments that other people won't be able to hear. Keeping her interested in what you are saying will make her distracted from the rest of the group, and eventually, focusing more on you.

, Eventually, the group might leave you two alone to talk, and it'll be a lot easier to carry on a one-on-one conversation in private. Ask her lots of questions and continue making eye contact to make her feel like you're talking to her specifically.


If you they don't leave, make sure to include the other members of her group in the conversation so they won't be left out. However, make sure you are still fun of the conversation so that you are also getting a chance to talk to the girl while having fun. Most girls think it's nice when guys are nice to their friends.

, Sometimes, the best tactic is to chat for a while and then move elsewhere. Keep making eye-contact with the girl you were trying to talk to. This can be a great way of seeing if she's interested in talking more with you. If she leaves the group and goes to find you? Good sign.


If you never meet back up, wait unit the end of the night. When her group is leaving, pull her aside quickly and tell her what a great time you've had. Tell her you'd love to meet her for coffee or a drink sometime.

, What is this group interested in? What do they like? Are are they like? If this group could be a kind of dessert, what would she be? Just find fun and light things to chat about to see what she, and the rest of the group, are interested in. Here are some good group questions, if you're not familiar with the group:


How do you all know each other?
How often do you all hang out?
What are you all drinking? Who has the best one?

, Conversation is about finding doors and opening them. Listen to what they're talking about and respond to the subject positively and kindly with something of your own. If the group is taking about a movie, ask what everyone thought. If someone says, ""Boring,"" say, ""Oh really? What movies do you like?"" Keep the conversation flowing and positive, to show that you're an interesting person that this girl should want to talk to.


The follow up is the most important part of a conversation. Nobody knows how to talk to a stranger without listening to what they say and responding.

, If one member of the group is giving her opinion about a particular topic, turn to the girl you want to talk to and say, ""What do you think?"" This is an excellent way of contributing to the break in the conversation and including her in it as well. It also signals to everyone that you're interested in talking to her specifically.

, If you know she's in a particular club, likes a certain band, or is particularity interested in something, focus your conversation by asking her about it. Ask how long she's been interested in that hobby, why she likes it, and let it lead to finding out more about her and seeing what you guys have in common.

, Conversation is give and take. If you only talk about her, she might feel like you're prying. So, after asking her about herself, think about something that has to do with what she says, and then respond.


At the same time, don't only talk about yourself. Self-absorbmant is a pretty big turn-off.

, While you're talking to a group, try to keep things light and positive. Encourage others in their opinions and laugh at their jokes. Don't interrupt anyone or dissent from the group at first, until you're sure of the dynamics.


Lots of ""pick-up artist"" schemes recommend subtle insults as a way of getting a girl to be attracted. While this has mixed results, it's always a terrible idea to try in a group full of girls.
Little jokes can work fine. But there's a difference between saying something teasing and flirty like, ""I can't believe you hated Iron Man. Have you no soul? Prove to me you have a soul"" and telling a girl that her perspective on birth control is ""childish.""

, Don't try to make yourself into someone else to get her attention or pretend to be interested into things you don't like. If you end up not having much in common, that's okay. Go look for other groups and other conversations.

, Start by introducing yourself and shaking her hand, than everyone else's hand. Ask if you can sit down with them. Talk to everyone equally and be genuinely interested in what they are saying. That's how a conversation should get started with a group, not with, ""Are those space pants?""


Don't try to show off as part of a group. Jokes and gimmicks are more likely to get you a drink in the face than an invitation to coffee.

Do your research.,
Recognize normal sexual behavior.,
Identify regular displays of affection.",How to Tell a Guy Is Sex Obsessed1," Before forming an opinion, you want to make sure that you know the facts. If you think someone has a serious issue, it is a good idea to make sure that you actually understand the condition. Go to the library or ask a doctor for some good resources.


Avoid sites that have a particular religious or political bias.
Rely on objective sites such as Sex Help.Objective sites will include plenty of objective, scientific evidence and psychological research for their claims.;
, Thinking about sex a lot or frequently engaging in sexual activities doesn’t necessarily mean that a guy is obsessed with sex. In fact, sexual thoughts and actions are a normal part of life.This is true for boys going through puberty as well as for young and older men.


Remind yourself that both men and women of all ages have sexual urges and thoughts. It’s the way these thoughts and feelings are handled that distinguish normal behavior and sex obsession.
For instance, a guy may want to have sex several times a week with his partner. This could be considered normal sexual behavior, not a sign of sex obsession. It is also normal if you do not want to have sex this much. The difference in the amount that he wants to have sex versus the amount you want to have sex may just be an indication that you are not compatible.

, Sometimes guys, just like girls, want to display and receive affection and it may not have anything to do with sex. They may just want comfort and physical contact. It is perfectly normal for a guy to display affection without sex ever entering his mind. For example, a guy may just want to sit and cuddle with you and it may not have anything to do with sex.

, Most public and private organizations that issue grants for research or other projects will have a list of eligibility requirements. You must meet these requirements and let the organization in question know that you meet those requirements, as well.


Instead of dedicating an entire paragraph to explaining how you meet each requirement, weave this information into the body of your letter.

Pay attention to how he treats you.,
Listen to what he says.,
Pay attention to his interactions with others.,
Ask about past relationships.",How to Tell a Guy Is Sex Obsessed2," One of the best ways to tell if a guy is obsessed with sex is to examine how he acts when he’s with you. Behavior such as frequently trying to initiate sexual acts or bring a sexual element into situations that really aren’t sexual may be an indicator that he’s focused on sex.


For instance, if he always wants to watch movies or TV shows that have lots of nudity or sex scenes, you might take it as a sign that he is sex obsessed.Or, for example, if every time you’re together he wants to do sexual things, he may be obsessed with sex. Physical affection does not always need to lead to sex, and if he expects physical affection to always lead to sex, then this could be a clue about his attitude towards sex.

, The things that guys talk about with their friends, partners, and other people close to them can tell you a lot about them. Pay attention to how frequently you hear or hear about conversations that he has that are sexual in nature. While some sex talk is normal for everyone, if you rarely hear him talking about anything other than sex, he might be sex obsessed.


Does he, for example, add a sexual comment or joke to conversations that have nothing to do with sex?

, You can tell if a guy is obsessed with sex by watching how flirtatious and sexual he acts around others. Most people flirt occasionally or include sexual innuendos every now and then. But, if he seems to always be flirting or continually bringing a sexual component into his interactions, he may have a sex obsession.


For example, if the first kinds of comments he makes about people are of a sexual nature, or if his value of people is based primarily on their sexual desirability, then this could be another clue.

, Often guys that are obsessed with sex have trouble maintaining relationships because of their focus on sex. They may ruin long-term relationships by cheating or end them because they feel they need more sex. The more you know about why a guy’s past relationships ended, the easier it may be for you to tell if a guy is sex obsessed.


Ask him directly why his previous relationships ended. You might say, “Can you tell me about your other relationships? Did you have any problems with infidelity?”

Look out for lying.,
Watch for sexual risk-taking.,
Find out if sex is interfering with obligations.,
Be aware of the risks to you.,
Find help for the guy.,
Make sure your emotional needs are met.,
Try counseling.",How to Tell a Guy Is Sex Obsessed3," One of the first signs you may get that a guy has a sexual addiction is that he is dishonest with you. Sexual addicts often have to lie in order to cover up their obsession and their behavior.While you don't have to dissect everything the guy says, you should be alert for blatant dishonesty or inconsistencies that you notice.


For example, if a guy tells you he spent the weekend doing work, but you find tickets to a strip club in the trash, it definitely suggests he isn’t being honest with you. However, keep in mind that it is rare to find this kind of obvious confirmation about a person’s lies. You may notice more subtle things, such as him spending lots of money and not having a good explanation about where it went. Or, you might find he is not where he said he would be when you go to check up on him.

, Sex addicts often do things that put themselves and others at risk for physical, emotional, and other problems because of their obsession with sex. Although it includes several different behaviors, taking sexual risks on a regular basis may be a clear sign that a guy has a sex addiction. Check to see if he has a criminal record, such as for hiring prostitutes, as a way to determine if he engages in risky sexual behavior.

, For guys that have a sexual addiction, their thoughts about sex and efforts to engage in it may result in them neglecting other responsibilities and obligations.Pay attention to how well the guy is addressing other areas of his life to get an indication of whether he is a sex addict.


For example, has the guy been neglecting or missing school or work for seemingly no good reason? Or has he been fired from his job?
Or, for instance, a guy may neglect bills and other financial obligations because of money they are spending on their obsession with sex.

, If you’re in a relationship with a guy that is a sex addict, you have to realize that his addiction doesn't just affect him. Because sexual addicts often engage in risky behavior, it puts you at risk for stress, emotional strain, financial problems, health issues, and more. Make sure you’re taking proper precautions in all areas of your life.For example, you should make efforts to avoid unprotected sex with a guy who you think has a sex addiction. It is perfectly acceptable to request that a sexual partner provide documentation that they have recently had an STD screening.
You may want to make it harder for him to access money, credit cards, or your other financial information.
Avoid putting yourself in sexual situations, or being alone with a guy that seems aggressive in addition to showing signs of a sexual addiction.

, If you do know a guy who shows many of the signs of sexual addiction, you should support him in getting help. In some cases, the guy may not see his behavior as a problem and may not want help. In other cases, though, your support could help the guy address his problems and treat his addiction.


For example, you might tell your new boyfriend, “Based on several things I’ve noticed, I think you have a sexual addiction. Can we talk about it and about getting you help?”
You might suggest he review the information about treatment for sexual addiction provided by Psychcentral.Keep in mind that you might have to have a series of conversations about your concerns as he opens up to the idea of having a problem. He may be very defensive about it at first. Give him time to process what you have to say and see if this changes.

, It can be easy to become focused on someone else's issues. But if you are in any type of relationship with this person, it's important to make sure that your feelings are a priority, too. Whether you are friends or in a romantic relationship, remember that you matter in this relationship, too.


If you feel ignored, anxious, or have difficulties expressing your feelings, your needs are probably not being met.Try setting some boundaries. Don't be afraid to say, ""I need to take some time to focus on myself.""

, If you are in a romantic relationship with someone who is sex obsessed, you might find yourself feeling frustrated or even angry. Ask your partner if he is willing to try couples counseling with you. This can be a great way to find solutions to relationship problems.If your partner doesn't want to seek counseling, you can go on your own. You might find it very helpful to talk through the issues in your relationship.
Help is also available through Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA). This organization is open to people with addiction and their partners.

Depending on the nature of your business, you may need to produce a series of manuals, each of which focus on a particular area, with a master manual having sections composed of the individual manuals.;
, Organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) produce standards for areas such as risk management and food safety management. These standards provide a starting place for company safety manuals in these areas.

, Government organizations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) may require safety manuals for certain practices and procedures and may also stipulate what, at a minimum, the manual must cover. Failure to follow these regulations, let alone not having a manual where one is required, may expose companies to lawsuits and in some cases, criminal charges.

, While the actual writing may be contracted to a technical writer experienced in writing safety manuals, it will be more accepted within the company if management and employees are involved in its adoption. Upper management should inform employees of the need for the manual, and employees themselves can assist in identifying content for the manual.

However, there are three basic sections that should always be included in a test plan: Test Coverage, Test Methods, and Test Responsibilities.


Test coverage defines what you will be testing and what you will not.
Test methods define how you will be testing each part defined in the “coverage” section.
Test responsibilities assign tasks and responsibilities to different parties. This section should also include what data each party will record and how it will be stored and reported.;
, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) publishes international standards for testing and documenting software and system development.To hold your test plan to the highest standard, consult with the IEEE publications below:

The North Carolina Office of Information Technology Services offers an annotated test plan template, based on IEEE 829 standards, here.
Dublin City University also offers a free test plan template, based on IEEE 829 standards.

, Your introduction functions as the “executive summary” of the test plan: its goals, its scope, and its schedule. This should be kept brief, as you will go into further detail in subsequent sections of the test plan.


Your goals and scope statements should define, in general terms, the methods that will be used in the testing process and the projected results. The scope statement should also include the most critical performance measures, as well as a list of what the test plan will not address, and why.A schedule details the increments of time in which each phase of the test will be completed.
Related documents include any peripheral material that is relevant to the current project, such as lists of specifications.

, Your test plan should clearly define what you will test and why you will test it. These should always be based on industry standards.Determine what the scope of the test is. What scenarios will be tested?

Be aware of any vague or unclear requirements. Users often lack the expertise to understand technical language or procedures, so user misunderstanding could pose a risk.
Use your past “bug” history to help you identify areas for concern and extra testing.

, List what new aspects you will be testing and what old aspects you will be re-testing. Make sure to detail the purpose for each test.You can use software application inventories, IEEE guidelines, and other sources to help you determine this list.
This section also represents your “deliverables,” or what data you will deliver to the client once the testing is complete.

, List any features that will not be tested during the current project.Reasons not to test features include:


The feature will not be included in this version of the software
The feature is low-risk or has been used before without issue

, This section outlines the overall test strategy for your test plan. It will specify the rules and processes that will apply to the tests outlined above.


Include information on tools to be used, what metrics will be collected and at what level, how many configurations will be tested, and whether there are any special requirements or procedures for testing.

, These criteria will guide your testing staff so that they know whether testing objectives have been achieved. This section can also include “exit criteria,” so that your staff know when it is acceptable to stop testing a certain feature.You should also include a list of suspension criteria and resumption requirements. This information tells testers when to pause tests and what the acceptable level of defect is to resume them.

, Also known as “deliverables,” these documents are the data, reports, scripts, and results that will be produced by testing.It’s a good idea to assign these deliverables to “owners” who are responsible for their delivery. Assign deadlines by which they are due., Outline all the goals that you hope to achieve during the testing process. Detail who is in charge of final approvals.

Consider what you’re comfortable writing.,
Keep your audience in mind.Who will be reading the story in which your romance scene occurs?,
Think about the relationship between the characters.Every romance scene is unique because they occur between two specific characters at a particular time in their lives.,
Set the stakes for the scene.The reader wants the scene to be more than a purely physical interaction.,
Consider how the scene fits into the surrounding story.,
Describe the setting.The setting can almost be a third character in a romance scene.,
Choose the point of view, if necessary.,
Include realistic details.When writing any scene — but especially a romantic scene — you should always think about similar experiences in your life.,
Don’t oversell the interaction.,
Build tension with pacing.The romantic scene should begin before the characters ever touch each other.,
Avoid clichéd language.The best way to avoid cliched writing is to be able to recognize it.,
Use dialogue to develop the scene.In the movies, you might see a romantic scene with no dialogue.,
Develop emotion over physical sequence.You might think readers want to read about the physical kissing and touching, but what they really respond to is the emotion of the moment.",How to Write a Romantic Scene," If you’re putting your name on your work, you should think carefully about what you put out into the world. Remember that once a story is out of your hands, anyone can read it. Especially if you’re a younger writer, your parents may be upset if they find out you’ve written a steamy romance scene. Even if you’re an adult, you may still wish to protect your friends or children from steamier romance scenes.;
, Romance scenes can range from innocent first kisses to raunchy eroticism. Whenever you write a romance scene, you have to imagine how your reader will respond to it. If you’re writing a YA (young adult) story for teenagers, you need to consider how comfortable your readers will be with explicit sexuality. Even adult readers may prefer more romance than raunchiness. On the other hand, if you’re writing for an audience who’s come to the story for the bodice-ripping, then you want to give them what they expect from the genre.


Many romance publishers have specific guidelines for how ""steamy"" a romance scene can be, depending on the imprint for which you're writing. For example, romance publisher Entangled has a ""Bliss"" line that focuses on romance but does not show sex scenes at all, but their ""Brazen"" line focuses heavily on sex scenes and allows for more graphic writing.If you aren't sure about the appropriate ""steam"" level, read your publisher's submission guidelines. If you don't have a publisher yet, having a look at guidelines is still helpful, as it will help you gauge your book toward current market trends.

, Even if you're writing fanfiction about well-known characters from a book or movie, you are placing them into a world of your creation. Spend a long time thinking about these characters and their relationship. What is the baggage in their relationship? How will each of them have imagined this scene before it happened?


The more time you spend thinking about how your characters will feel in the moment, the more realistic the scene will be when you write it.
Think about how the characters feel about this scene. Are they tense? About to explode from anticipation? Shy?, It also has to have some sort of consequence on the plot of the story. Why does this interaction matter to these characters? What will change for them?


Are one or both of the characters already entangled in a different relationship?
Do they know that they will be separated soon? Does the reader know they will be before the characters know?
Should the reader the feeling that the characters will regret this romantic interaction?
Is this interaction a way to express feelings that the person isn't otherwise able to voice?, You shouldn’t write a romantic scene just for the sake of writing a romantic scene. It should further the development of the plot in a meaningful way. Now that you've considered what's at stake in the scene, spend some time thinking about what will happen after the scene. Consider if there are any details you want to foreshadow in this scene that will make the reader have a stronger emotional reaction later in the story.For example, in many romance novels the romance scenes provide the conflict and ways for characters to grow. A cop who has trust issues might learn to become more vulnerable in the bedroom, or a timid schoolteacher might learn to take charge of what she wants in the romantic interactions., If you can give the reader a clear sense of what's around these characters, you bring the scene to life for them. Before you even begin writing the interaction, spend some time brainstorming the setting. Think about what details the characters may notice before, during, and after their romantic interaction. Consider including a few details that might mirror the romantic mood, but don't get too cliched. In fact, some decidedly non-romantic details might make the scene more realistic.


Romantic details might include the soft light at dawn or dusk, the sound of a babbling creek, or the scent of a lavender candle.
Less expected, non-romantic details might include the the sound of a child crying in another room, complete darkness that keeps the characters from seeing each other, or the smell of dinner burning in the kitchen.
You may want to consider your setting in terms of what is realistic for your characters. Most people don't have time to light candles and get soft background music playing unless it's a really special occasion., Your story may be told entirely from the point of view of a single character or narrator. In that case, you don't have a decision to make. But if your story jumps back and forth between different characters' points of view, you have to decide who gets to tell this part of the story. What's important is that you give a full, thorough telling of the experience. For that reason, it's best to focus on a single character's experience, even if you have an omniscient narrator.Jumping back and forth between what your two characters and thinking and feeling can feel clunky and confusing.Present one character's full experience of the scene. If you want, you can show the other character reflecting on the experience in a later scene.
Some publishers may require that romantic scenes be presented from both your protagonists' points of view.If this is the case, don't repeat the same actions or events from both POVS. Instead, for example, you can switch from someone doing an action to the other character reacting to it.

, Even if you've never been in a situation like this, there are little details from different experiences that could bring your scene to life. For example, even if you've only been kissed once, what details were you paying attention to? If you remember worrying about your palms sweating, or that this was a bad song to have a first kiss to, maybe your character can think that too.


Readers want to see a scene that they can relate to. If you write something purely imaginative and idealized, it won't feel attainable or realistic to them.
If you have no romantic experience, don't fret! Ask your friends about their experience, or re-read and watch your favorite romantic scenes.
Use ""exaggerated awareness"" when considering the scene. The characters should experience the scene in a heightened way so that the readers can, too. Don't forget to use senses other than sight! What smells, sounds, and physical sensations do your characters feel?, Romantic scenes can get out of hand pretty quickly. It's okay to want your characters to be heavily invested in the scene. But if every detail of the kiss is bursting with superlatives (the sweetest kiss, fire running through your veins), there can be no building of tension. Your scene should be like real life: there's a lot of buildup to the moment of greatest tension. Your heroin's bosom shouldn't start heaving the moment the hero enters the room. Maybe she just feels the light heat of flushing skin.


If you have multiple romantic scenes in the story, remember that every kiss can’t be earth-shattering. The reader will no longer respond to the description if it’s repeated too often.
Just like in real life, there should be many types of kisses: quick goodbye kisses, sweet kisses to the top of the head, lingering kisses, and, yes, earth-shattering kisses every once in a while.

, You should begin layering the levels of romantic tension before the reader even realizes that this scene will turn romantic.


Begin by describing the characters' moods. Even if they're not feeling particularly romantic, the mood adds to the character of the romantic interaction. For example, an angry protagonist will kiss differently from a sad protagonist.
Think about how the dialogue will lead to the climax of the scene. What do the characters say to each other that ends up with them locking lips?
What setting details might add to the romantic tension? Bring in some of those details you brainstormed earlier.

, To recognize it, you have to read a lot. Unfortunately, this can't be done quickly. For good writers, reading is part of everyday life year after year after year. Once you've read enough romance scenes, you'll be able to pick up on the language that seems overly familiar. ""Earth-shattering,"" ""heaving,"" ""fire,"" ""tingling"" — these are all examples of language that a well-versed romance reader will yawn over. You want to present this scene in a way the reader has never seen before. If a description comes to you too easily, there's a chance it's because you've heard it before. Be ruthless! Always look for the most original language.


Part of the problem with cliche language is that it's not concrete. Readers want to be able to imagine themselves in the romance scene. Specific, descriptive language is much better than vague, meaningless cliches.
For example, ""His kiss was earth-shattering"" doesn't really say anything about how the kiss feels. Compare to this: ""He slid his hands into her hair, sending a spark of electricity down her spine. As their lips met, she sank into the warmth of the kiss with a sigh."" See how much more evocative that is of what the character is experiencing?

, But on the screen, the screenwriter has actors giving emotion to everything that’s implied on the page. Without a skilled actor to give body to your intentions, you need dialogue to help the reader imagine what’s going on. The dialogue helps nudge the scene along — it should always serve a purpose.


Feel free to write grammatically incorrect sentences. Even if your English teacher would mark it in red, nobody speaks perfectly correctly — especially when emotional.
Speak the dialogue out loud, maybe with a friend playing the other character. If the dialogue feels stilted and unnatural, keep tweaking it until it feels realistic., The physicality of a romance scene should develop in the service of the emotional arc. Details about what a character’s hands are doing are wonderful, but they should only be included to lead to how they make the other character feel. What are the emotional connotations of rough hands versus soft ones? Kissing a person’s lips versus biting them? Always follow physical descriptions with their emotional repercussions.


A good love scene will not be a play-by-play of ""then he touched her there, and then she touched him, and then...and then...and then."" You want the actions to flow together, but you don't need to narrate every tiny detail. Focus on how the interaction feels to get the biggest impact.

Write for the people who will read the safety manual regularly.,
Prioritize the issues the manual should cover.,
Format the text according to the type of information presented.,
Lay out the manual to be easily read and understood.",How to Write a Safety Manual2," While outside regulators may examine the manual to ensure all appropriate regulations are covered, they will not read it day-in and day-out as will the employees who must follow the practices it contains. The manual should be written so they can easily understand and follow it.


Use short sentences and short paragraphs with simple words.
Write in the active voice.
Avoid jargon. Use any necessary technical terms correctly, defining them in context where possible, and with simple, clear definitions otherwise.
Explain acronyms. You can either have an introductory section listing all acronyms with their definitions, or introduce them in the text with the full term followed by its acronym in parentheses and using the acronym thereafter.
Explain symbols. As with acronyms, you can have an introductory section or explain the symbols as they appear throughout the manual.

, The most critical safety issues should serve as the manual's focus. Preliminary issues should be included, presented prior to the main issues, while related issues that are not prerequisites should be covered after the main issues.

,


Use blocks of text to present general information and explanations.
Use bulleted lists to present information that can be broken into individual points.
Use numbered lists for step-by-step procedures, with the steps in the order they should be followed.

, The layout should help the reader focus on the most important concepts and should be consistent throughout the manual.


Provide sufficient margins and white space between text blocks.
Use headings and subheadings to introduce topics, identify subtopics, and group text blocks.
Include a table of contents and index.
Place drawings and the text that relates to them on the same page when possible.
Use a readable font style and point size. For printed body text, 10- to 12-point size is best, with a somewhat larger point size for headings. Subheadings can be the same point size as the body text, but set off in boldface, italics, or both.
Use black text on a white paper for the best contrast between text and background. Shaded text boxes may be appropriate for callouts and sidebars as long as there is still sufficient contrast between the text and background.

Respond to your parents.It is important to share how you feel about your parents’ perspective.,
Stay calm.,
Don’t let your family make you feel guilty.",How to Talk to Your Parents About Interracial Relationships," If they’ve experienced a similar situation, they might even be able to offer advice.


For instance, say, “I’m worried about what my parents will think of us,” or “I wonder if my mom and dad will be upset we’re dating.”
Let your partner know that no matter what your parents think, you will still love them and don’t care what their race is. Say, “I won’t let my parents’ opinions affect how I feel for you.”
Don’t let yourself be dissuaded from sharing your situation by the thought that your partner will feel you’re blaming them for your familial problems. Since your partner loves and respects you, they will appreciate your being open and honest with them, even about this difficult issue.;
, If you have friends who also had questions or concerns about your interracial relationship, think about how you broached the subject with them. Did you wait for them to bring it up? Did you ask them directly what they thought?


You could also use your friends’ experiences or the experience of your partner to think about how to approach the topic with your own parents. Talk with them about how they dealt with their parents’ concerns, if there were any.For instance, ask your friends, “Did you have trouble telling your parents about your interracial relationship?”
You can also consider what you already know about your parents' views on race and reasons why they might be against interracial relationships. For example, perhaps your parents have a friend who was in a dysfunctional relationship and their partner happened to be a different race. They might be basing their ideas on this friend's experiences.

, Talk to a trusted friend, family member, therapist, or faith leader in order to accurately gauge your own feelings and comfort level. If you’re comfortable talking to your partner about these issues, you might choose to talk to them as well (or instead).


For instance, you could ask a friend, “How do you know when you’re with the right person?” or “I feel like I don’t quite belong with my partner. Have you ever felt that way in a relationship?” Listen carefully to their answer.
Ask relevant follow-up questions like “Do you think these feelings will pass?”

, Find free time when you and your parents can both devote serious time to talking about interracial dating.


The best time to try talking to your parents is probably during the weekend or evening.
Do not try talking to your parents about interracial dating when they are in the middle of work, or watching a TV program. Mornings are also a bad time to talk to your parents in an extended way (about anything), since you will all probably be rushing about eating breakfast, showering, and making other preparations before school or work.
Don’t bring up interracial dating right after your parents make an inflammatory comment about race, or do anything else that offends you.

, If you talk in public, you might not get a straight answer from them. Usually, talking to your parents directly when you’re at home is the best way to talk to them.


If you can’t talk to them face-to-face, call them at a time when they are at home. You could ask them directly when they will be home so you know when to call. Evening hours from 7:00-9:00 are probably best.

, Share with your parents all the good things about your partner. How do they show you they love you? What do you love about them?


For instance, you could say, “I really love my partner. They are so generous and helpful.”
You might also explain, “Being with my partner is great because they are very intelligent. They always open my eyes to new and interesting things.”
If your partner provided you with a great gift, you might show it to your parents and say “Look at this great gift my partner bought me. I really like it.”
When your parents see that you’re in a loving relationship, they will be pleased and alleviate any concerns they have about interracial dating.

, To find out why your parents feel the way that they do, ask questions about their perspectives on race and interracial relationships. Try to be patient and respectful as you ask these questions. Some questions you might ask include:


What are your thoughts on other races and interracial relationships?
Why do you think about them this way?
Did something happen that caused you to think this way?
What do you think would have to happen to change the way you think about other races and interracial relationships?

, In all cases, listen actively by nodding and making eye contact. Use your pre-talk planning period to think about specific points that your parents might be concerned about. Try to be patient as you answer your parents' questions. These questions may seem offensive, but they are coming from a place of ignorance and fear. Specific questions your parents might have include:


How will you raise children?
Won’t it be more difficult to date someone of a different race than someone of our own?
Are you worried about what others will think?

, When you and your partner begin a relationship, you shouldn’t hide it from your parents (or anyone else).


If you pretend that you aren’t in a relationship when you actually are, your parents might find out from someone else and feel hurt.
Likewise, don’t pretend to your partner that you’ve talked to your parents about them if you really haven’t.

, If your parents disapprove of interracial dating, let them know that you wish they were more open-minded.


Some parents may have legitimate concerns about the cultural compatibility of you and your partner.Listen closely to what your parents have to say and answer thoughtfully.
Ensure your parents that you have and will continue to think about their point of view. Explain to them, “Thank you for your opinion. I appreciate your honesty and I will carefully consider what you’ve said.”
Remind them that every relationship has challenges, and that you and your partner love each other and are willing to work through any issues that arise.
Remind racist parents of all the good things about your partner. Say, for instance, “I care deeply for my partner. Their race does not define them. I’m sorry you can’t see that.”

, Avoid emotional outbursts.It’s okay to be angry or frustrated if your parents are unwilling to accept you dating outside your race. However, it is important to keep the discourse civil. Be patient and avoid yelling, name-calling, and violence.


If you feel your temper rising, breathe in slowly through your nose for three seconds, then exhale through your mouth for five seconds. This simple breathing exercise will help you relax.
Sometimes it’s best to be patient and allow your parents time to process the information that you’re dating outside your race. Excuse yourself or end the conversation politely if you feel it is not productive. You can always come back to the topic with your parents later. Say, “I’m going to excuse myself from this conversation for the moment. Perhaps we can resume at a later time.”

, Your parents might ask, “What will people think about me if you’re in an interracial relationship?”They might also suggest that you should be dating within your own race, or that you’re doing something wrong by dating someone of another race.Stand up against these insinuations and old-fashioned attitudes by reminding them that there are many wonderful people of all races. Explain that the important thing to do when looking for a partner is identifying how the person acts and treats you.


For instance, you could say, “I know and love my partner, and they treat me well. These things are important. My partner’s race is not.”
Don’t let your parents use other people’s attitudes (or their own) to make you feel guilty about your relationship. If they are worried that their friends or neighbors will shame them because of your dating preferences, suggest that they ditch those friends.
Assure your parents that your interracial relationship is not intended to hurt them, and is not an act of rebellion.Say, “My relationship is only intended to enrich my life and the life of my partner. It is not meant as a slight against you.”

Finalize your advert for errors.,
TEST!",How to Write Ads," Choose a great headline to get your reader's attention. Study adverts that industry experts deem highly successful, making note of similar industries to your own. You can look towards magazines, websites, and even newspapers for headline ideas. Write down 10 or 15 headlines for the advert you will be placing. Let them ""rest"" overnight, come back the next day and pick the one that pulls most at your attention.;
, - After you've created a headline that will capture attention, you will have to get your prospects interested in what you are offering. One rule of thumb often used is ""what's in it for me?"" If your reader cannot easily tell how they tie into the advert, they will pass it by. There are many ways to do this--state a fact, a quote, a solution to a problem.

, Once you have obtained and retained the attention of your prospect, you have created a relationship between your reader and the ad that will cause them to desire more information. By creating an emotional attachment in this scenario, you not only create desire for more information, your reader may desire your product and/or services. The desire you have created could be to save money, have better relationships, move ahead in a job -- any tangible feeling or emotion that your readers would have a connection to.

, Now is the the time to pounce! Tell them what Action you want them to take to obtain the desired product/service. It could be make a phone call, click on a website link, buy a product, or obtain a free offer. Be specific, not misleading here.

, Include all pertinent information in your ads--company name, product or service offered, all contact info--website, phone, fax, address, logo.

, Look over your advert one final time, possibly get other colleagues involved for their input. Successful ads typically have simple fonts with lots of white space that are easy to read, with vivid graphics or pictures. Proofreading for spelling and grammar errors is a must. Get feedback on your ad from coworkers, friends, even strangers. Keep your brand identity consistent in all ads, using a style guide (if published) for all out-of-office communications. If your company logo is blue & green, an orange and purple ad is confusing.

, Test your ad! Don't commit to a year's worth of advertising space until you know your advert does get attention and create clients. Measure ROI (return on investment) for all of your marketing activities.

, Access your email client’s calendar to check your schedule. You can browse through your schedules and find the time slot for your meeting.

, Once you’ve found a good slot, open the calendar entry. There should be a lot of functions available to help you set your meeting invitation. One good function is a scheduling assistant that shows you everyone’s availabilities to help you find a common time for your meeting. There are also predefined fields available for the relevant meeting information, like invitees with their emails, subject, location, and date and time., Just like any email, you need to enter a subject line. Don’t leave this blank so that it won’t be ignored. Make the subject line short and relevant to your meeting.

, If your invitees do not know you, introduce yourself first. State your name, team or department, and role. You need to let everyone know that you’re in the position to call this meeting and that you’re not just a random bored person wanting a meet-and-greet.

, Include the purpose and objectives of the meeting. Why are you setting it in the first place? What do you want to achieve out of it?

, This is important. You cannot set a meeting without setting the date and time. Be very specific, and make sure this is a good common time for everyone. Respect everyone’s time, and only allot the required time for your meeting. Do not set a 3-hour invitation for just a 1-hour meeting.

, This is also important. Be specific in stating the location for your meeting. If it’s a venue not common to everyone, add the address as well. You may also want to note instructions on how to get there. If you’re doing a virtual meeting, include the conference and dial-in numbers.

, Invite only who are required to your meeting. It won’t be productive if you have a lot of irrelevant people. If you’re opening your meeting to optional attendees, make sure that you clearly identify the required participants. You don’t want a required invitee to think his presence is only optional.

, You can also share in your meeting invitation the agenda so that people will know how your meeting will flow.

Decide what your creepy pasta will be about.,
Develop your characters and your setting.,
Start writing the plot.,
Edit, edit, edit!,
Publish it, whether on your website, another website or even a creepypasta wiki.

",How to Write Creepypasta," This is the first step to creating any piece of art, especially stories. A good indicator of vision is when the phrase ""what if"" is used. Some good examples are: What if someone hides outside your room every night waiting for the perfect chance to kill you? What if there's a demon that is possessing your loved ones and killing them off? The possibilities for your stories are limitless.
, Think of what scares you, and why it scares you. Being alone, darkness, imminent danger, and things that seem normal but are somewhat off tend to be scary things. But why do these things scare you? It tends to be that it's our natural response to things that could be dangerous (in relation to surviving in the wilderness). We are never completely sure if something is hiding in the darkness. Being alone means that you don't have the power of being in numbers to fight predators. Knowing there's imminent danger is a more obvious example, and when you know something is off, you simply can't trust it to be safe. Knowing what scares you and why it does will allow you to write great creepypasta., An abandoned building? A meme, like Slender Man or Zalgo? A failed experiment? A ghostly serial killer? A crazy person? There are many great topics for creepy pasta, and the possibilities are endless.

, Remember that this is not a novel, so you don't have to be too in-depth.

, For creepy pasta, a first-person narrative is usually the most effective. How will it begin? A dark, tall man lurking in the woods? A series of entries from a failed government project? A person going and purchasing a demonic doll that happens to like mutilating children? Usually, a more morbid beginning is better, but remember, there may be kids out there reading your pasta.

, Most first drafts aren't perfect. If you want your pasta to be successful, then editing is a must. Edit them once a day, re-read them and repeat the following day. Remember to look out for nasty grammar and spelling errors!

If your potential buyers identify with a particular group or culture, they're more likely to buy a product that also identifies with that group or culture. Think about who you're trying to target with your product description.Common characteristics to consider when trying to determine the target audience include age, gender, income level, buying habits, occupation, marital status, family status, location, education level, ethnic group, political affiliations, hobbies, and interests.If the company for which you are writing the description has an online presence, there are tools you can use to identify their demographic, such as Google Analytics. This can help you gather information on the type of person who frequents the company's website. The company sales team may also be able to provide you with this information.
Say you're selling a new brand of flavored coffee for a local shop. The kinds of consumers who crave flavored coffee might be professionals or family-oriented people who prioritize taste over coffee purity or origin.
Try to connect your coffee to the target customer's lifestyle. Business people will relate to someone enjoying a coffee before a busy day of work or as a break. Family-oriented people will respond to descriptions of someone enjoying coffee with their spouse or as their children get ready for school.;
, Consumers generally go for products that provide them specific benefits. When writing a product description, ask yourself, ""What would a customer gain from my product?"" Ultimately, consumers want to buy something that has an inherent benefit to them.Make a list of the features of your product. From there, try to link these features to a benefit for customers. This will help you get a sense of what to focus on as you write your description.
For the coffee example, try connecting the coffee's origin, tasting notes, caffeine content, or another quality of the coffee to its benefits (good flavor, a pleasant drinking experience, caffeine boost, feeling of helping a community/farmers, etc.).
Find a way to stress your product's exceptional flavor. Why specifically is your ideal customer seeking flavored coffee? What's wrong with existing flavored and unflavored coffees?

, Specifics are important when selling a product. If you can create sensory details, your readers will feel like they're experiencing the product secondhand. This may make them more likely to purchase it. Try to describe the experience of enjoying your product, using as many senses and images as possible.Returning to the flavored coffee example, try to imagine waking up to a pot of vanilla flavored coffee. What smells would you experience? What sights? How does the smell of a vanilla birthday cake make a person feel?
You could write something like, ""Imagine waking up to a subtle vanilla scent wafting into your bedroom, then sitting down to enjoy a cup of coffee with the sweet taste of a childhood birthday cake. Revel in the memories of grade school parties as you take a sip of the silky, creamy flavor of our coffee."" Here, you create an experience for your reader. The reader imagines waking up, smelling coffee, tasting coffee, and having that coffee spark pleasant memories.

, You do not want to use average words to describe your product. Vivid language can really make your product sound great to potential buyers. Avoid neutral or common words when describing your product. To start brainstorming, make a list of words that remind you of your product and find ways to make these words pop.Imagine that the coffee from the previous example is flavored like birthday cake. The first words that may come to mind may be things like sweet, tasty, and flavorful.
Are there any ways you can make those words more specific? What kind of cake does the coffee taste like? Maybe it has a vanilla flavor. Instead of using terms like ""sweet"" and ""tasty,"" you could find something more specific. For example, you could say the coffee has a ""silky, creamy vanilla flavor.""

, Consumers are bombarded with many ads every day. When writing a product description, you have a limited amount of time to get a consumer's attention. Use that time wisely. It is essential that you lead with a statement or question that grabs the reader's attention.Try appealing to the senses right away. In the coffee example, you could say something like, ""Wake up in the morning to the subtle scent of rich and creamy vanilla.""
You can also ask your readers to imagine. For example, say something like, ""Imagine there was a coffee that tasted as good as your favorite desserts.""
You can also try to appeal to the reader's identity initially. Try something like, ""When you're drinking a cup of coffee, do you still get that same level of joy you felt when you started to drink coffee?""

, Tone is important when it comes to product descriptions. Different readers will respond to different tones. As you write, make sure you adopt a tone appropriate for the audience at hand.Think about your company's brand. Are you trying to come off as cheeky, fun, and a little sarcastic to appeal to a certain audience? Or are you a more serious business trying to attract customers who are also quite serious?
The tone of any coffee advertisement could be one of lighthearted enjoyment, describing the pleasure or life improvement brought by the flavor and caffeine in the coffee.
However, a more serious coffee company could focus on bean quality, origin, having a high caffeine content, or being ready quickly for the busy professional.

, Remember, you want to cover the product as fast as you can. Readers may scroll by if a product is long and wordy. Strive for a few brief and vivid sentences over lengthy descriptions.Things like bullet points can be particularly helpful, if you're able to use them. For example, instead of saying, ""Our coffee has a smooth, creamy vanilla flavor that will make your house smell like a birthday party"" you could break down these sentiments into a series of bullet points: ""Silky smooth vanilla flavor!"", ""Fills your house with the scent of a birthday party!"", ""Instant relaxation first thing in the morning!""

, Many people read ads on a mobile phone these days. You want to make sure the bulk of your product description, if not all of it, will show up on a mobile phone screen. Short and simple is more memorable than long and complicated.


You should also keep images in mind. If this description is being posted alongside an image, the image will take up space on the phone's screen as well. Do not just account for the text.

, You want to be unique in your description. Advertising is a competitive world and it's vital to stand out. As you read over the description you wrote, cut out any phrases that sound cliche. When you're reading your description, imagine how you would feel reading it as a consumer. If there are any phrases that make you think, ""Yeah, yeah, that's what everyone says,"" these are phrases to cut out.Think of ways you can rewrite cliche or stock phrases to make them more unique to your product. For example, you may find a phrase like ""high quality"" in your description of your coffee. High quality is a largely meaningless term, as everyone wants buyers to believe their products are quality. What does high quality mean for this product and how can you convey that?
For the coffee example, ""high quality"" would be best swapped out for words like, ""organic"" or ""locally grown."" These are the traits your target audience associates with quality.

, A good product description only works if it can reach readers. If your product is more likely to show up on a Google search engine, it's far more likely to sell. Make sure you use keywords that a consumer looking for this type of product will search for online. Do some research on search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure you are choosing keywords that will drive shoppers to your product.Keywords can sometimes be self-explanatory. If you're selling formal dress shoes, your customers will search for this; however, if you're selling an accessory to another product, keywords can be trickier. Think about what the product will be used for, and work that use into the description. For example, a wine rack should be called a ""wine rack"" specifically and not a ""rack.""
Some products have different names. For example, soft drinks are referred to differently in different parts of the country. If you're selling a soft drink dispenser to be used in restaurants, you may want to add a small blurb on the bottom saying something like, ""Also known as a pop dispenser, soda dispenser, or a coke dispenser.""
Do not overuse keywords, however, as this can make your description sound clunky.

, Revision is important when it comes to a product description. You'll want to write a few different drafts until you hit a statement that works.Play around with words and structure. Swap non-specific words for words that pack a bigger punch. You can also switch the order of sentences to make the ad read smoother. Get rid of unnecessarily long sentences by cutting out unneeded words.
Have a friend or family member read over the statement. Ask them to give you an honest assessment of whether it makes them want to buy the product.

, You do not want to send a product description into the world if it contains errors. Before submitting your description, proofread carefully.Print out the statement as this makes it easier to catch errors.
Take a break from the description for a day or so, as you'll be more likely to catch errors after gaining some space.
Have a friend read over the description as well.

Don't info dump in your dialogue.,
Add subtext.,
Mix it up.,
Read your dialogue out loud.,
Punctuate your speech correctly.,
Cut out any unnecessary words or phrases.,
Use dialect carefully.",How to Write Dialogue," Listen to the way people talk to one another and use those conversations and patterns in your dialogue to make it sound authentic. You'll notice that people talk differently when they're with different people, so make sure that you include that when you're writing dialogue.


Disregard parts of the conversation that will not translate well when written down. For example, every ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" does not need to be written. Some of your dialogue might start with a ""Did you do 'this'?"" or ""Why did you do 'this'?"";
, To get a good feel for the balance that you need in your dialogue between realistic speech and book speech you need to read good dialogue in books and in movies. Look at books and scripts and see what works and what doesn't and try to figure out why.A few writers to check out for their dialogue are Douglas Adams, Toni Morrison, and Judy Blume (these are only a few; there are lots!). Their dialogue tends to be realistic, layered, and vivid.
Checking out and practicing writing dialogue for screenplays and radio plays is really useful in developing dialogue, since those are both very dependent on dialogue. Douglas Adams, from the above writers, got his start in writing radio plays which is one reason for his fantastic dialogue.

, You will need to completely understand your characters before you can make them talk. You'll need to know things like whether they're taciturn and monosyllabic, or whether they love to use lots of big words to impress people, and so on.Things like age, gender, education level, region where they're from, tone of voice, will all make a difference in how a character talks. For example, a poor American teen girl is going to talk very differently from a rich, old, British guy.
Give each character a distinct voice. Not all of your characters are going to use the same vocabulary, tone or method of speech. Make sure each character sounds different.

, Stilted dialogue might not completely kill a story, but it can definitely jerk a reader out of the story, which as a writer, is something you're trying not to do. Occasionally stilted dialogue does work, but only with the most specific kind of story.Stilted dialogue is dialogue that only works on the obvious levels and in language no one would use. For example: ""Hello, Jane, you look sad today,"" said Charles. ""Yes, Charles, I am sad today. Would you like to know why?"" ""Yes, Jane, I would like to know why you are sad today."" ""I am sad because my dog is sick and it reminds me of the death of my father two years ago under mysterious circumstances.""
How the dialogue above should have gone: ""Jane, is something wrong?"" asked Charles. Jane shrugged, keeping her gaze fixed on something out the window. ""My dog's sick. They don't know what's wrong."" ""That's terrible, but, Jane...well, he is old. Maybe that's all it is."" Her hands clenched on the windowsill. ""It's just, it's just, you'd think the doctors would know."" ""You mean the vet?"" Charles frowned. ""Yeah. Whatever.""
The reason the second one works better, is that it doesn't come right out and say that Jane is thinking of her deceased father, but it does lean towards that interpretation, especially with her using the word ""doctors"" instead of ""vet."" It also flows better.
An example where stilted dialogue works is Lord of the Rings. The dialogue isn't always stilted, especially when it's the hobbits talking, but can get very grand and eloquent (and unrealistic). The only reason this works (and many people don't agree that it does work!) is that the story is supposed to be in the style of old epics like Beowulf or The Mabinogion.

, Use ""he said"" or ""she answered"" instead of lofty terms like ""he protested"" or ""she exclaimed."" You do not want to take away from the dialogue between characters with unusual words or tags. ""Said"" is one of those invisible words that won't distract the reader.Occasionally it's okay to break up the ""said"" and ""answered"" or ""responded"" where it's appropriate. For example, you could use ""interrupted"" or ""shouted"" or ""whispered"" but only where it's appropriate for the story and only occasionally.

, It should provide information to the reader about the story or the characters. Dialogue is a great way to prove character development or character information that your reader might not otherwise get.


Don't do small talk about the weather or how each character is doing, even if that's something that comes up a lot in real conversations. Now, a way in which small talk would be well used is to build up tension. For example, a character really needs certain information from another character, but the second character insists upon the ritual of small talk, your reader and your character will be biting their nails in waiting to get to the good stuff.
All your dialogue should have a purpose. As you're writing dialogue, ask yourself, ""what does this add to the story?"" ""What am I trying to tell the reader about the character or the story?"" If you don't have an answer to those questions, scrap the dialogue.

, This is a big one that a lot of people have the tendency to do. You think, what better way to get information across to my reader than by having my characters discuss it at length? Hold it right there! Background information needs to be added sporadically throughout the story.


For example of what not to do: Jane turned to Charles and said, ""Oh Charles, remember when my father died a mysterious death and my family was turned out of our home by my evil aunt Agatha?"" ""I do remember that, Jane. You were only 12-years-old and you had to drop out of school to help out your family.""
A better version of the above might go something like: Jane turned to Charles, her lips set in a grim line. ""I heard from aunt Agatha today."" Charles was taken aback. ""But she was the one that kicked your family out of your house. What did she want?"" ""Who knows, but she started hinted things about my dad's death."" ""Things?"" Charles raised an eyebrow. ""She seemed to think his death wasn't natural.""

, Conversations, especially in stories, are layered affairs. There's usually more than one thing going on in them, so you want to make sure that you capture the subtext of each situation.


There are lots of ways to say things. So, if you have a character that you want to say something like ""I need you,"" try having them say as much, without actually saying it. For example: Charles started for his car. Jane placed a hand on his arm; she was chewing at her lip. ""Charles, I...do you really have to go so soon?"" she asked, withdrawing her hand. ""We still haven't figured out what we're going to do.""
Don't have your characters say everything they're feeling or thinking. That will give away too much and won't allow for any suspense, or nuance.

, You want your dialogue to be interesting and to keep your reader engaged in the story. This means skimming over background conversations, like people at the bus stop discussing the weather, and getting into the meaty conversations, like Jane's confrontation with treacherous Aunt Agatha.


Engage your characters in arguments or have them say surprising things, as long as these things are in character for them. Dialogue should be interesting. If everyone is agreeing or asking and answering basic questions, the dialogue will get boring.
Intersperse your dialogue with action. When people are having conversations they fiddle with things, laugh, wash the dishes, trip over things, and so on. Adding these things to the dialogue will make it come alive.
For example: ""You don't think a healthy specimen like your daddy would've just sickened and died,"" Aunt Agatha said with a cackle. Jane clung to the shreds of her temper, replying ""Sometimes people get sick."" ""And sometimes they get a little help from their friends."" Aunt Agatha sounded so smug Jane wanted to reach through the phone and wring her neck. ""if someone killed him, Aunt Agatha, do you know who?"" ""Oh, I've got a few notions, but I'll let you decide on your own.""

, This will give you an opportunity to hear how it sounds. You can make changes based on what you hear as well as what you read. Allow a little time to go by after you've written the dialogue to read it, otherwise your brain will fill in what you were going for rather than what is actually on the page.


Have a trusted friend or family member go over your dialogue. A fresh pair of eyes can tell you whether your dialogue is natural sounding, or needs work.

, There is nothing more irritating to a reader (including and especially, publishers and agents) than punctuation that is being abused, especially in dialogue.


There should be a comma after the end of the dialogue and the closing quotation mark. For example: ""Hello. I'm Jane,"" said Jane.
If you add action to the middle of a piece of dialogue, you'll either capitalize the second half of the dialogue, or not. For example: ""I can't believe he killed my father,"" Jane said, her eyes filling with tears. ""It's just not like him."" or ""I can't believe he killed my father,"" Jane said, her eyes filling with tears, ""since it's just not like him.""
If there's no said, only an action, then there's a period in place of a comma in the closing quotation mark. For example: ""Goodbye, Aunt Agatha."" Jane slammed the phone down.

, Sometimes, less dialogue is more. When people talk, they are not overly verbose. They say things in short, simple ways and you'll want to reflect that in your dialogue.


For example, instead of ""I cannot believe that all these many years, it was Uncle Red that put the poison in my father's evening cocktail and murdered him,"" said Jane, you might say ""I can't believe Uncle Red poisoned my father!""

, Each character should have her own sound and voice, but too much of an accent or a drawl will become annoying to readers. Also, using a dialect you aren't familiar with can end up employing stereotypes and being incredibly offensive to the natural speakers of the dialect.


Establish where characters come from in other ways. For example, use regional terms such as ""soda"" versus ""pop"" to establish geography. Make sure if you're writing a character from a specific geographic area (like England or America) that you use the appropriate slang and terminology (pants in England, underwear in America, for example).

But not all of them are good. So ask friends with a good sense of humor to recommend their favorite stand up specials or sketches. Look at comedians who are popular right now, as well as legendary comedians of the past. Some examples may be:


Robin Williams was an American comedian and actor skilled at physical comedy and the ability to breath incredible energy into even the most straightforward jokes. Williams was also highly skilled at improvisation and impressions that require a lot of nerve and confidence to pull off in front of a crowd.Louis C.K. is an American comedian with several highly successful stand up specials. His jokes are known for their dry, dirty humor and smart commentary on everyday life. He also writes, directs, and produces “Louie”, a show that blends sketch comedy with the tragedy and pathos of being a divorced comedian and father in New York City.George Carlin is considered one of comedy’s greatest performers, using infection and tone to add punch to a joke. At his prime, Carlin was able to tease out the nuances and ironies of middle class America, combining big laughs with philosophical truths about the world.Roseanne Barr is a stand up comedian and actress best known for her groundbreaking sitcom “Roseanne”. Her stand up specials are known for their hilarious approach to blue collar humor and Barr’s blunt, entertaining stage presence plays off of her smart, nuanced material.;
, Seek out the comedy night at your local bar or amateur stand up at a local venue. Expose yourself to the material of other comedians just starting out.Watching and listening to other comedians will affect how you write and perform comedy. If anything, you will learn what jokes worked well on an audience and which ones flopped.

, Another great resource for your own comedy writing is looking at the successful comedy shows that have come before you. Don’t limit yourself to American comedy shows or only the prime time shows. Look at successful sketch comedies from overseas and online series, also known as web series.


“Mr. Show” is a sketch comedy from the mid 90’s that introduced major comedic talents like former SNL writer Bob Odenkirk, stand up comedian David Cross, and comedic actor Jack Black. The show’s ability to push boundaries and take on taboo subject matter distinguished it from more traditional sketch comedy shows.“Chapelle’s Show” is the brainchild of comedian Dave Chapelle, and each episode is packed with memorable sketches that riff on everything from the persona of Rick James to a blind black white supremacists. Chapelle never shies away from exposing the ironies and cruelties of modern life during the three excellent seasons of his show. Beyond their social commentary, his sketches also showcase a wicked sense of humor.“Saturday Night Live” is a live sketch show that airs every Saturday night. Now in its 40th year, SNL has launched the careers of many of the biggest comedy stars and given viewers some of the most memorable sketches ever on air.“Funny or Die” is a comedy website that creates hilarious and inventive sketches that become viral videos overnight. Taking on topics ranging from racism in America to frat culture to singles dating culture, Funny or Die is one of the top sites for web comedy today.“Broad City” began as a web series starring comedians Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer, both veterans of the improv scene. It gained a cult following online and developed into a full fledge sketch comedy show on Comedy Central, currently in its third season. The two “broads” of the title, Abbi and IIana, navigate friendship, feminism, dating, and the elusive search for a decent NY apartment in a bold new way., Now that you’ve split your sides watching the incredible comedic talents of other performers, look closely at each stand up routine and each sketch.Focus on the characters, the setting, the tone, and the punch line of each joke or sketch. Does the joke use a simple, common setting or a more absurd setting? Is the focus of the sketch on one particular character or a cast of characters interacting with each other?
Do the characters begin with a punchline or work their way up to the punchline?
Look at how the comedians use comedic timing to get a laugh. Each comedian may have a different approach to timing. They may pause before the punchline or speed up their voice. Another major aspect of successful comedy is comedy that is well written and performed well. Robin William’s timing, for example, will be different than Roseanne Barr’s timing. Yet both performers manage to get big laughs from their audience.

, Carry a notebook around with you and write down anything you see or hear that makes you chuckle, cringe, or smile. Take notes on your interactions with friends and family or sit in a crowded area with strangers and observe their behavior.This will help you avoid the dreaded blank white page. It’s much easier to write jokes if you start from a place of ideas, rather than empty pages.
Write down punchlines or one-liners. Write down situations and moments you find funny or amusing.

, Every joke can be distilled down into three parts. They are:The Setup: establishes the premise of the joke by providing the audience with the necessary background information. The setup should be as short and tight as possible. You want to establish the context for the joke without rambling on too long.
The Punchline: This is the big laugh line. The setup should lead the audience to one direction, and then you should surprise them by going off in a different direction. The twist, or element of surprise, is a key part of the punchline.
Tags: also known as toppers, tags are additional punchlines. Sometimes they build on the original punchline. Sometimes they take the punchline into a surprising new direction or observation. Good comedians can come up with many tags to a joke.

, Pay attention to the language you use in each sentence of the set up. It could be as simple as “I was walking down the street the other day…” or more complex, such as “I was stuck on a train the other day with my mother and…”.


For example, Jerry Seinfeld, of “Seinfeld” fame, breaks down a joke about Pop Tarts that took him 2 years to write.He pays close attention to the language he uses to set up the joke so he opens the joke with funny moments right away. Rather than say: “I love Pop Tarts and let me tell you why,” Seinfeld starts with: “When I was a kid and they invented the Pop Tart, the back of my head blew right off.” This opening line works because it establishes the time frame (Seinfeld as a kid), it establishes the subject of the joke (the Pop Tart), and it has a unique, specific detail that engages the audience (the back of his head blew right off).
The next sentence of the set up then pushes the audience towards the punchline and keeps them laughing with specific, funny details. “When the Pop Tart suddenly appeared in the supermarket, we just stared at it like an alien spacecraft, we were like chimps in the dirt playing with sticks.” The inclusion of details like “chimps in the dirt playing with sticks” keeps the set up entertaining and interesting for the audience.

, All comedy is based on reversals, where you take the audience’s expectations and challenge them. Work against the audience’s expectations so they are surprised by the punchline and will laugh.To generate some reversals, choose a problem or issue you’d like to address. Think about illogical ways to address this problem or issue. Maybe you want to talk about the time you broke your leg. Start at the end of the alphabet and list one illogical way for each letter.This could be: In a ZEBRA stampede, slipping on nonfat YOGURT, in a XYLOPHONE accident, WEARING pantyhose that were too tight, etc.
For example, take this one-liner from the comedian B.J. Novak: “Battered women: delicious.”Novak introduces the concept of battered women, a common term. He then reverses a common concept with one word: “delicious”. In one word, Novak takes the audience’s expectations and works against them. The term “battered women” now has a completely different meaning in the context of the joke.

, The rule of threes is a powerful rule in comedy. In a longer joke, you can establish a pattern by having two attempts or tries in one sketch. The audience will then start to make assumptions on what will happen next. The third attempt or try should break that assumption and cause the audience to laugh.


For example, a simple rule of three joke could be: “When people find out that I’m an Indian, people think I practice Yoga, I meditate, and I’m poor… (pause). The third one is correct!”This joke is funny because it sets up three common assumptions people have about Indians and then uses a comedic pause to great effect before the punchline.
Create your own rule of threes joke by looking at your list of words and phrases. Choose three words or phrases that relate to each other and see if you can come up with a way to use an assumption about one of the terms and challenge it.

, Irony is the gap between intention and expression, or intention and results. It is one of the most common reversal techniques used by comedians to get a laugh.So don’t be afraid to use irony in a joke whenever possible to create a great punchline.


For example, an ironic joke might be a dentist who wakes up to discover he lost a front tooth during a wild night out. Or a highly OCD character who ends up in a pile of vomit at a party. Take a character’s worst case scenario and make it a reality in the sketch.

, This seems obvious, but it can be difficult to write a punchline that is as good as your setup. A good punchline will challenge the audience in a new way. Your audience should leave the joke with a new take on the subject in your setup. Avoid obvious jokes or familiar punchlines.For example, the punchline of Jerry Seinfeld’s Pop Tart joke involves a small joke, followed by the big, final joke: “Once the Pop Tart came into the world, I didn’t understand why we were eating other kinds of food. Two Pop Tarts in the packet, two slots in the toaster. Why two? One’s not enough and three is too many, and they can’t go stale because they were never fresh.”Seinfeld works off the set up to move into a smart, funny remark and then ends with a conclusion to the joke that is both true and funny. The audience is left with a new outlook on Pop Tarts. In five sentences, Seinfeld explores his obsession with the Pop Tart and challenges the audience’s assumptions of the Pop Tart.

, It takes most comedy writers about 10 attempts at a joke to create the funniest punchline possible. In other words, it takes time to find the punchline to a joke. It took Jerry Seinfeld, a seasoned comedian, two years to come up with the best punchline for a joke about a Pop Tart! The more you practice writing jokes, the better you will get at identifying the reversal in a setup. You can then write towards the punchline of the joke and find the line that will get the biggest laugh.You can also use the rule of 10 for brainstorming ideas for jokes. Practice coming up with 10 good joke ideas a day or a week. Focus on developing 10 one liners a month.

, Carry a notebook around with you and write down anything you see or hear that makes you chuckle, cringe, or smile.Pick three words or phrases from the list and write down everything you can think of about those words.
For example, you may choose children, sandwiches, and divorce. Think about any funny or bizarre moments with your children or other people’s children. Consider your favorite sandwich and why it is your favorite. Think about how your relationship with your partner would be affected by a divorce, or if you are single, how divorce affects other couples.
Once you have filled a page on each topic, look over your notes and decide which one is the strongest idea. Place this idea on the top of the pile and use it as your main topic.

, The barfly who frequents your local watering hole, the driving instructor who falls asleep on the job, or even the old woman who lives alone in your building could all be good real life examples of sketch characters.Focus on individuals who seem original or interesting to you. Then, write down how you imagine their day to day like to be, based on your observations of them.

, Avoid common set-ups like the emergency room or a bar, unless you have something groundbreaking to say about these familiar settings. Look for more original settings like the top of a mountain, the bottom of the ocean, or the President’s secret bedroom in the White House.


Use only one central location for the sketch. This will allow you to maximize all the possibilities of one location for the sketch.

, Start by creating a two minute sketch with 1 to 3 characters. This will ensure the sketch isn’t too long and too complicated.


If you are looking to sell your material to a network or studio, avoid including expensive props like a helicopter or a mechanical shark. Even if you are writing the sketch for a web series, you will likely not have the budget for expensive props or settings.

, There is no one way to write a comedy sketch, but there are several tried and tested formats, such as:Escalation: A seemingly simple, funny idea starts small and gets bigger and bigger, ending in a chaos of absurd proportions. A good example of this would be the Mr. Show sketch about a pre taped call in show.The set up is simple but it soon escalates into a more and more ridiculous scene as the sketch goes on.
Lists: A sketch where most of the dialogue is a long list of funny items. A good example of this is the “Cheese Shop” sketch by Monty Python, a groundbreaking British sketch comedy troupe.A Fake Commercial: SNL does many fake commercial sketches, where they take a common product like Tampons or yogurt and create a parody of the standard commercial format. For example, their parody of medication commercials.A Character sketch: The sketch centers on the persona of a persona or character, such as Steve Martin’s “Wild and Crazy Guy”, Bill Murray’s “Nick the Lounge Singer”, and Alex Borstein’s “Ms Swan” character from MADtv.An Intellectual sketch: Take a historical figure and create a comedy sketch that imagines certain moments in history, such as the “Das Negroes” sketch by the comedy duo Key & Peele.Or a sketch that sheds a different light on the audience’s assumptions about a historical character, such as Steve Martin’s “Socrates” sketch.

, A simple premise allows you to escalate and explore the situation throughout the sketch. It’s also a good idea to start simple if you are writing sketches for the first time.If you decide to write a character sketch, avoid starting your sketch with the character’s catch phrase. This may come across as forced and you may end up with a one joke character. Try to create a multifaceted character who has several catchphrases. This way the audience is surprised by the character throughout the sketch.

, It can be difficult to write a comedy sketch on your own. Many successful comedy writers work with a writing partner or a room of other writers to come up with the best setups and punchlines possible.If you and another writer make each other laugh, share a similar sense of humor and can support each other’s idea, you could make good writing partners.
If you end up working with a writing partner, make sure you agree who is the head writer and who is the co-writer for a particular sketch.

, All sketches should have a strong finish. So think about the punchline first, before you write the beginning or middle of the sketch. If you can’t think of a good punchline for a sketch idea after ten minutes, there may not be a good punchline and it may not be an idea worth pursuing.Once you have a funny ending to the sketch, work on how to get there. Write the line immediately before the funny end line. Once you have the last ten seconds of the sketch, work on the beginning of the sketch.

, Say the lines out loud as you write them. Or read the sketch and act it out with your writing partner. Listen to how the character voices sound. Note where a pause or a physical action could amp up the laugh factor.


Don’t be afraid to have the characters riff off of each other in a setting, especially in the early drafts of the sketch. Playing around with the character interactions and voices can lead to funny moments and make the sketch better., Look over the completed sketch. Make sure there is a strong line in the first several lines of dialogue. Or an action that will get a laugh in the first 15 seconds of the sketch.Put the sketch aside and then return to it the following day. Does it still read as funny as you thought it did last night? If not, rework it. Use the actions of the characters to escalate the sketch to an even more absurd punchlines. Or use the catch phrases of a character to keep the sketch punchy and funny.

Carefully review your EOI before submitting.",How to Write an Expression of Interest for a Visa," In general, most host countries prefer to give work visas to people with high-skill, high-demand occupations. This is to ensure that people entering are providing a net benefit to the host country that couldn't necessarily be provided by a native citizen. For this reason, some countries will only award work visas to people in certain professions. Before beginning the process of filling out an EOI, double-check to make sure your occupation


This information will usually be available from the relevant immigration agencies in your host country. For instance, in Australia, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection publishes an online list of visa-eligible occupations called the Skilled Occupation List (SOL).;
, The visa application process can be a long, drawn-out, and tricky one. You definitely don't want to accidentally waste time and effort applying for a visa that won't provide the sort of protection that you and your family need to live and work in your host country. If you're even a little unsure of which visa you should apply for, don't begin without making sure.


Usually, your host country will publish easy-to-understand visa information for visa applicants online. For instance, the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection's website offers a ""Find a Visa"" utility that allows you to easily input your personal information to find the visa(s) you should apply for.Alternatively, try contacting the nearest embassy or consulate of your host country directly.

, For some countries, the EOI serves only as an initial screening step to the visa application process, so you won't need any sort of official documentation to complete your EOI. For other countries ,however, you may need to include this sort of documentation as part of your EOI. In this case, be sure to have any needed documents before starting. Things like birth certificates, employment records, and so on can take time to obtain, so request them as early as possible to help keep your EOI writing process relatively quick.


Usually, you'll be able to find this information either on the EOI form itself or from online government sources. For example, the Australian government occasionally publishes changes to documentation requirements on its official blog., Unfortunately, many (if not nearly all) EOI forms will require the applicant to pay a processing fee to submit the form. These can vary greatly depending on which visa you're applying for, how big your family is, where you currently live and what your occupation is. Be sure to have this money ready by the time you finish your EOI — usually, processing won't begin until you pay the fee.


If you can't find the application fee on your EOI document, most immigration agencies will publish this online. For instance, the government of New Zealand offers an online utility that allows visitors to find exactly where they'll need to submit their forms and how much they'll need to pay by inputting their personal information.As an example of the wide range of fees you may be asked to pay, a skilled migrant applying for resident status in New Zealand will need to pay about NZ$1,550 if he is from Australia or the pacific. However, if he is from the rest of the world, he may need to pay about NZ$2,400., Nearly all EOI forms will require you to supply a wide range of personal details. For instance, in addition to basic information like your name and address, you'll probably be asked for your marital status, your salary, your level of application, your tax obligations, and more. Supply this information as thoroughly and as accurately as you can as you fill out the form.


In addition, be prepared to provide extensive information on anyone who might come to the host country with you, including your family and/or spouse.

Never lie or neglect to disclose important information on your EOI on purpose. Knowingly deceiving your host country's government can immediately disqualify you from visa eligibility, seriously hindering your ability to work there in the future.

, Beyond basic personal information, much of what you'll be asked to supply in your EOI will have to do with your current job and any past work history. Supply this information to the best of your information as requested. It can be very helpful to use a recent resume, curriculum vitae, or tax return to help you with this process. Don't be afraid to contact old employers to get any necessary information if needed.


Because visas are preferentially given to migrants with high-skill occupations, in general, you'll want to emphasize skills and work experience that are in short supply in your host country. For this reason, your chances of getting a visa are usually best if you currently work in one of these sorts of positions and have a good amount of relevant experience in your field.
For instance, here are just a few of the occupations listed on Australia's Skilled Occupation List (SOL): actuary, chemical engineer, surveyor, naval architect, medical radiation therapist, sonographer, dental specialist, systems analyst, and social worker., Eventually, many EOIs will ask you write a brief description of why, exactly, you're such a valuable candidate. Keep in mind that your ultimate goal with an EOI is to paint yourself as someone whose skills are in high demand — someone who can do a job that there aren't enough native citizens to fill. With this in mind, clearly and succinctly explain how your particular occupation requires lots of training or specialized knowledge and is something that there is a great demand for.


For example, the EOI form for New Zealand asks applicants to ""explain how job is skilled give a detailed reason in support of their claim...""In this case, in addition to the strategies above, it can be useful to consult supporting documents (like, for New Zealand, the Skilled Migrant Category EOI Guide)to find the host country's official definition of what a skilled occupation is. Then, on the EOI form, use this information to give specific examples of how your job is a skilled one.

, Nearly all EOI forms will ask you for detailed information on your family and/or spouse. In addition to supplying this information yourself, your family members will often need to fill out their own supplemental forms for the EOI application to be considered complete. If they're too young to do so, you may still need to fill out a form for them. Unfortunately, these additional forms can sometimes have their own application fees.


For example, visa applicants to New Zealand who wish to apply as parent of an adult New Zealand resident (rather than as skilled migrants) must fill out a separate form called the Parent Category EOI., If you're applying for a visa to an English-speaking country, there's a reasonable chance that you don't yet have full knowledge of the language. If you're not a good enough reader and writer of English to fill your own form out, it's usually acceptable to get help from a fluent English speaker or translator to help you. Often, you'll need to disclose this person's identifying information on your EOI form.


For instance, visa applicants to Australia who get a translator outside Australia to help them must provide their translator's name, address, contact information, and give their qualifications as a translator. If the translator is from inside Australia, this person must be accredited by the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters., When you're done with your EOI, give it a thorough check for errors, misspellings, and omitted information before submitting. Filling out your form incorrectly can can lead to it not being accepted, costing you even more time and money during your application process as you re-apply.


Usually, your EOI form will contain information about where exactly to mail it. For instance, EOIs for visas to New Zealand must be sent to the official Immigration offices in the capital of Auckland."

Keep your dates short.,
Keep in mind that you can use two digits each for the month and day or just one.,
Use short and informal dates for fast communications.,
Write out the month but not the day for slightly more formal situations.",How to Write Dates1," When writing informally, shortened forms of the date are fine. You can use dashes or backslashes between the date, like so: 8-2-2011 or 8/2/2011.


Another alternative that isn’t used as often is using periods or underscores, sometimes done in coding or file names. For example: 8.2.2011 or 8_2_2011.;
, This would be written either as 08/02/2011 or as 8/2/2011. The extra digit in front of the eight and two does help clarify the month, but it’s not necessary.

, This method works well in emails, memos, notes, and the like.

, For example, you would write: August 2, 2011. This method works fine for resumes and formal academic papers.


Sometimes, writers add in the day of the week as well “Saturday, August 2, 2011.”
Use this method on letters, more formal emails, essays, and so on.

"
"
Write out all the numbers, as well as the month for very formal events.,
Decide when a formal date is needed.,
Remember that other countries don’t always write the date the same way.",How to Write Dates2," For instance, you would write out “We request your presence on the second of August in the year two-thousand and fourteen.”

, Formal dates are generally only needed for formal invitations or letters, such as for a wedding or graduation.

, For instance, many European countries put the day first. So for August 2, 2011, they would write “2/8/2011” or “2 August 2011.”


The Big Endian method is used in some Asian countries, and it puts the year first: “2011 August 2.”

Generate fresh ideas.,
Pick a fresh idea to write about.,
Write to communicate, not to impress.,
Be descriptive.,
Pick the right tone and writing style.,
Be creative and original.,
Let your personality shine.,
Don't forget the facts and figures.,
Quote and cite reference sources.",How to Write Compelling Articles in a Professional Manner," This is the very first step. At this early stage, don't be too concerned about the story. Your goal here is to generate as many fresh ideas as you can. Don't worry too much about the quality of the ideas. An idea that appears good now may turn out to be a really bad idea later on. Write your ideas down so that you can go back and pick one to write on later.;
, For content to be interesting, you need to pick a topic that is fresh. Everyone likes novelty. It's easier to create interesting content when you are writing about a cool mobile gadget that is about to be launched in the near future. You can, of course, with good writing skills, turn a mundane topic into something interesting. But that requires more effort and skill. Imagine having to write about doing the dishes. How interesting do you think your article will be?

, Too many writers try to impress their readers. As a result, they use flowery words or jargon that very few people can understand. Having a wide vocabulary is great. But misusing that range is never a good idea. Always strive to communicate your ideas clearly. This applies to all forms of writing - press releases, blogs, and even novels.

, If you want your writing to come to life, be as descriptive as you can. Being descriptive is especially useful for fiction writers. Having all those little details simply allow the reader to paint a more vivid image in his or her mind.

, Be clear about your target audience. Who are you writing for? If your writing is meant for the general public, then make it easy for everyone to understand. Use short sentences and simple words. If you are promoting your corporate website using a press release, write in a formal style.

, Nobody likes to read stale content. If you are having difficulty having original ideas, start by stating your own opinions.

, There are often opportunities for a writer to let the reader get a sense of who you are. Let your writing reflect your personality.

, If you are making an argument in your article, try to back up your argument with facts and figures. Concrete statistics can help bring credibility to your writing.

, If you are borrowing content or ideas from an external source, be sure to cite all sources at the end of the article. It's about respecting the rights of other writers. Being respectful makes the Internet a much nicer space for everyone.

Pick out the main ideas from each section of your paper.,
Take the main idea from each section of your paper and turn it into a heading.,
Consider using funny titles for more lighthearted topics.,
Keep it simple.,
Know that some papers will have main sections assigned for you.",How to Write and Place Main Section Headings1," If you have an outline of your paper, you should have the key ideas for each section. If you wrote your paper without an outline, go through your paper and pick out the main ideas. What is each section of your paper mainly about?


When dividing up your paper, put like ideas together. The sections should be mostly evenly divided. In a long paper, a main section could be chapter-sized. In a shorter paper, a main section could be two to three pages long; it all depends on how you want to structure your paper.
Keep in mind that you can also create subheadings if you need to do so, to help create more structure.;
, Pick the most important idea from a particular section and turn it into a heading. The best headings are descriptive and help the reader to understand what they are about to ready about.


To illustrate this using an example, imagine the section you need to compose a heading for is on Joan of Arc, her visions, and her early life. You could compose a title that is something along the lines of “Joan of Arc’s Early Life and Theological Visions.”
If you want, you can make it more interesting: “What She Saw: Joan of Arc’s Early Life and Theological Visions.”

, Funny titles are appropriate in some papers, such as ones with more lighthearted topics. For instance, if you’re writing on the nutritional value of beets, you can make puns on the word ‘Beet’:


“The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body.”

, When writing your headings, save the jargon for the paper where you can explain it. In the heading, try to keep the words you use easier for the reader to understand.


Don’t worry if your headings don’t tell every detail. That is what the section is for—to elaborate upon the idea you present in your heading.
However, don’t be misleading. Make sure your heading represents what you are going to say.

, For instance, in scientific studies, the main headings are generally “Literature Review,” “Methodology,” “Experiment,” and “Results,” or something to that effect.

What do you want your writing to accomplish? Who is your audience? How will you know that you have met your goal?If you’re working on an assigned project, you may want to determine your thesis or argument here.
If you’re working on a creative project, you may want to be more flexible, but set yourself a goal such as certain number of words or a type of product (short story, novel, poem, etc.).
You may also need to consider deadlines in this step. This will help you in planning, particularly if this is an assigned project.;
, Collaborative writing can take place entirely in-person; this is often the case for peer reviews and other classroom activities. It can also take place entirely online; you may find an online writing group that operates this way. Much collaborative writing falls somewhere in the middle.


You may also decide that you want to do certain things, such as planning and editing, together. Then each writer can write on his or her own and bring back material for the group to work on.
If you’re meeting in-person, make sure to collate everyone’s schedules so that you can arrange meetings that work for everyone. A tool like NeedtoMeetor SurveyMonkeycan help you learn when everyone is free.

, In the most basic form of collaborative writing, everyone has equal access to writing, information, and role-sharing. A wiki is a good example of this type of writing, because everyone can write and change others’ writing. Most collaborative writing has more defined roles. Particularly if you’re writing for a project or a grade, it’s important to determine upfront who will play what role.You can break the work up by parallel tasks. For example, each member conducts a particular type of research, and then each member writes a particular element. This can be helpful if you’re rushed for time because all tasks can be done at the same time.You can also assign tasks by role. Common roles include researcher, primary author, commentator, and editor. You can also assign multiple roles to each person depending on their strengths. You may even have multiple people filling each role.The researcher may not write anything used in the final draft. S/he is responsible for researching and fact-checking the chosen topic. Other roles will turn this material into the project.
The primary author is usually the person who writes the bulk of the material. This person may “jump-start” the project by writing a first draft, or s/he may wait until other roles have generated material and pull together a draft from that.
The commentator can read drafts and offer suggestions. S/he may suggest places where the writing is unclear, or where more research is needed.
The editor takes suggestions from the commentator and other collaborators, as well as making his or her own. S/he will pull the material together into a polished final draft.

, For some work or class projects, you may have a platform recommended or assigned to you. If you aren’t sure what to use, you have some options.Google Docs is a popular collaborative writing tool because it’s free, easy to navigate, and is open to everyone who has a Google account.
There are also a variety of online platforms designed specifically for collaborative writing, especially creative writing. MixedInk, Penflip, and Protagonizeare popular platforms.
You can swap manuscripts with a word processor like Microsoft Word. Just make sure you have the “track changes” feature enabled so everyone can see what’s altered.
You can also use good old-fashioned pen and paper, especially if you’re meeting in person., Whatever platform you choose, make sure that everyone can access and edit the material. For this reason, it’s a good idea to confirm with everyone that they will be able to use your chosen platform before proceeding.


Keep in mind that people may not want to pay for software or services. They may also have different versions of word processing software. Make your platform as easy for everyone to access as possible.

, It’s important to talk with each other about what’s going on with the project. This is especially important if you’re working mostly on your own and coming together only to plan or revise. Stay in touch with updates.Without communication, your writing will fall apart.You can do this in a variety of ways. You can leave comments in a Google Doc, use a chat or messenger, or even write email updates.
Offer your own updates and ask for updates from others. Use these consultations to verify that you’re on track with the project goal, check information, offer strategy, or consider audience.It’s helpful to have a record of these communications. Save chat or messenger logs, or use the “CC” function on emails to make sure everyone can access them.

, Technology is very helpful for collaboration, but experts recommend that you meet in person at least once. Communication involves many things other than words, such as body language, tone of voice, and gestures, that you will miss out on if you do all your work online or via text.If you can’t meet physically in-person, try a conference call, Google Video Hangout, or Skype conference. This will ensure every member of the group gets a “voice” in the communication.

, If you’re writing on your own, it’s crucial that you stay in your assigned role. If you’ve been assigned to write a literature review and you go off on a tangent, it isn’t helpful to the final product (and can end up offending your collaborators).


If you find some juicy information or a cool direction that doesn’t fit into your role, share it with the group! You don’t have to actually write everything to be a contributor.

, Writing together means that everyone depends on one another to do their parts. If you are late with your work or you don’t do your fair share, you may alienate your collaborators.


If you know that you won’t make a deadline, let your collaborators know. Offer a brief explanation and how you will make up for it.

, It’s very important to have a way to keep track of changes you make to your collaborative product. Don’t just delete something you don’t like or find unnecessary; others in your group may have a different opinion. It’s a good idea to use features like comment boxes, color-coding, and “track changes” features if you have them.

, Rather than simply making comments like “Delete this” or “Reword,” offer explanations to explain your thought process. Remember that you’re working with others, who may have different ideas and opinions than you do.


Explaining why you see things a certain way will offer your collaborators insight into how you approach the project. It also keeps you from sounding too bossy.
The same thing goes for common comments such as “Show, don’t tell.” Ironically, this comment often tells rather than shows! If you think something needs more explanation or more vivid writing, offer an example of how the change could be made.
For example: “She felt happy” tells, rather than shows. It is boring. “She waited until the elevator doors closed and then pumped her fist in the air and squealed with delight” shows what’s going on rather than simply telling about it. This is more engaging for the reader., Particularly if you have a large number of collaborators, it can be helpful to ask one person to make sure that the goals you agreed on are updated as necessary. When collaborators distribute new versions of the project or additions, ask the goalkeeper to update the goals and the project summary to reflect these changes.


You may find that keeping a separate spreadsheet or document is helpful. Each person can check in with what s/he has contributed, and the goalkeeper can collate this information to provide an overall picture of where you’re at.

, If each of you wrote your piece separately, merge all your work into a single document before reading it. This way, you’ll be able to focus on creating a coherent project without getting distracted by smaller concerns, such as style and proofreading.Coherence involves elements such as structure and flow. Make sure that the document makes sense, feels logical (or at least appropriate, if you’re writing creatively), and flows smoothly from one section to the next.
After you’ve achieved coherence, you can worry about minor issues such as smoothing out different writing styles and correcting grammatical and proofreading errors.

, No matter what you’re writing, when it comes time to read and review the work, keep your audience and their needs in mind. There are several ways to do this.Read as a “Common Reader.” This is where you read and track your personal responses to the work. What parts do you find interesting or boring? Are there places where you’re confused? Is there language that you find unclear, or that you find really beautiful?
Read as an “Expert Reader.” For many projects, you can assume that your audience has a base level of knowledge about your topic. For example, if you’re collaborating on a lab report for a college science class, you can assume that your professor has a level of knowledge about your subject that the common reader would not. This doesn’t mean you should leave gaps or important concepts unexplained, but you can write to show that you understand what you’re writing about, as opposed to focusing solely on what the layman reader might need.
Read as a “Diagnostic Reader.” This type of reading is good for figuring out where problems are in the text. For example, if it’s an argument, does it have a clear thesis statement? If it’s a story, are the characters’ motivations clear? Does the writing flow smoothly, or are things like transitions lacking?

, Sometimes, critique can hurt people’s feelings, especially if it only focuses on what needs improvement. You can help encourage your collaborators and show your appreciation for their work by also noting what’s going well, too.

, Even if you have an assigned editor, it’s a good idea to have a few other group members work with him or her. Editing is time-consuming when done properly, and leaving it all to one person could leave him or her overwhelmed.One strategy is to have your assigned editor do a “first-pass” edit, and then have the other group members review that revision. This will allow for other eyes to catch any mistakes.

At the center of all these sub-genres is the age group of your target audience. Knowing whether you want to appeal to young adult readers or readers in elementary school may be the difference between writing a story that will become a short novel instead of a story for a picture book., The best way to familiarize yourself with the style of any genre of writing is to read as much as you can from that genre. Read different sub-genres of children's literature, and read a variety of different authors. Not only will you get a feel for the style and pacing of children's books, but you might get some ideas of your own., Once you've read a substantial amount of children's literature, it's important to familiarize yourself with the market. Read whatever you can find at your local library or online about publishing children's literature. Familiarize yourself with the process of publication, and consider attending conferences or workshops on publishing children's literature.Different publishers in children's literature are interested in different types of stories. Once you know what kinds of stories you're interested in telling, learn about which publishers would best fit your writing style and interests.A good place to start would be to read through some of the listings in reference books for writers. Visit your library or a book store and read through the listings for children's literature publishers in a book like Writer's Market or the Writer's & Illustrator's Guide to Children's Book Publishers and Agents., Some writers prefer to figure things out on the fly, but if you're new to writing, it may be helpful to have an outline. The advantage of an outline is that when the time comes to actually write your narrative, you'll have a good idea of how things fit together. A typical outline will lay out the following:


the basic premise of your storythe protagonist (the main character)the antagonist, if you have one (the person or people who will serve as adversaries to the protagonist)the situation(s) that will arise in your storythe source(s) of conflictthe basic series of events that will resolve the conflict you create., These scenes should fit together in a logical way and should work toward your characters identifying and resolving the conflict within your story.When sketching out the setting(s) for your story, bear in mind the ways in which your characters will fit in and interact with those settings., Some authors suggest beginning a story's plot just before things begin to change or get complicated for the protagonist. Think about classic story starting points in children's books: the story begins at the start of a new school year, the beginning of a day that will challenge the protagonist, the beginning of some type of journey or travel episode, and so forth.For some strong examples of how these types of introductions work, look to the beginnings of classic fairy tales: a family runs out of money, the protagonist is forced to leave home for some reason, the protagonist is born with some unusual trait or characteristic, or the protagonist is given special powers or some type of magical gift. These simple beginnings build the jumping off point for classic stories that challenge the moral integrity of each character by placing those characters at odds with an evil antagonist or an uncaring world., It's difficult to keep a reader of any age interested in a story from start to finish, but it's particularly difficult when it comes to young readers. That's why building suspense is so important. Suspense doesn't necessarily have to equate to crazy plot twists; start with a compelling, likable character who is interesting and real, and who faces realistic challenges. If you do this well, there's a good chance readers young and old will want to find out how your character navigates the ups and downs of his life.Another tried and true way to build suspense is to let the main character drive the action of the story. Whether the protagonist is battling against the antagonist, or simply finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time, an interesting and strongly-written protagonist is often capable of driving the narrative of a story or book., Every scene and every chapter should work together to drive the plot. Something should be happening, or at least setting things up to happen in the next chapter or scene. It's important to be concise and clear in your writing, as you do not want to risk losing your audience's interest., It doesn't have to be a slap-stick comedy, but recognize that children enjoy a clever, entertaining story as much as adults do. Just don't try to ""dumb down"" the humor for children; if the story is strong and the cleverness of your characters comes through, then your audience will probably find it highly entertaining., Allow your audience to imagine the things your characters are seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling. When writing the narrative to a children's story, it's best to keep sentences relatively short and use strong, descriptive language., To make a story really great, you may have to revise it several times over. Do not be discouraged by this, as all great writers of every genre go through the process of revising and rewriting. It's how you refine the gems in your premise into a well-polished masterpiece.


One of the best ways to revise your work is to have other impartial readers evaluate and critique it. This can be a trusted friend whose input you value, or strangers in a writing workshop. Whoever reads your work, it's important that the reader understands that you want useful feedback, not simple praise or approval. Ask what works well in the story, and most importantly, what doesn't work or gets confusing., If you're writing a picture book about animals, you can keep it simple by naming each character by the animal that it is. But if you're writing about human characters, you'll want to give each character a name. Just be sure that the names are easy to remember and will not get easily mixed up. No two names should sound alike, as this may confuse young readers., Your characters should be given clear ages, even if those ages are merely suggested by environmental factors, like being in the fifth grade vs. being in high school. You should also establish what time period the story takes place in, as this will influence the language that your characters use, and may influence how the characters behave.As you define your time period, remember to incorporate realistic elements. It's not unusual for children to have cellphones and mp3 players in this century, so don't be afraid to incorporate those elements into the story, if they are relevant., Young readers might get confused if the dynamics between characters gets too complex. If you're writing for early readers, it may be best to stick with basic relationships like parent/child, brother/sister, and friends from school., It can be simple or complex, and can make the characters likable or dislikable, but every character should have some kind of backstory in your mind. Even if those stories don't explicitly make it into the final manuscript, they will still influence how you develop your characters and what personality traits come through in the story.Keep in mind what each character's strengths and weaknesses are. These can be useful in developing a character's personality, and could also be important in building the plot. Perhaps a fearful character must overcome his anxieties in order to rescue his family, for example. Or a happy-go-lucky character has her patience tested by a bully at school. Whatever you decide, be consistent, and let each character's qualities be influenced by their back stories.

, Dialogue should reveal a lot about a character. Is he polite or rude? Friendly or off-putting? Does his dialect reflect the region in which he lives? All of these factors come through in the words your characters use and the ways in which they speak to one another., If you see yourself making a career out of writing children's books, you may want to think about hiring an agent. It is not crucial to have an agent, and in fact some authors prefer to cut out the middle man and pitch story and book ideas directly to publishers. But some publishing companies only work with agents, and it may be worthwhile to look into the logistics of hiring an agent., Most publishers select an illustrator to work on a given book. Unless you're packaging your own illustrations with your story, don't worry about finding an illustrator or putting images with your words. Focus on the writing instead., If you're working with short stories, you should look at literary journals and magazines that publish children's literature. You can find a listing of literary journals and magazines online by searching for young adult literary journals or children's literature magazines in a search engine.


Always look at the submission requirements for each literary journal you send your work to. Every journal has different tastes in terms of what stories they are looking for, and may have different requirements for how a piece of writing is formatted and submitted. If you're ever unsure and the website doesn't specify, email the editors and ask.

, Most book publishers do not have the time to read every single book that gets pitched to their press. That's why sending a query letter is important. It lets the agents at a publishing press know who you are and what kind of story you're interested in telling. This is your chance to pitch your work, so be thorough in how you describe your story and explain why you believe it's an important story for children to read. If the publisher is interested in your work, he or she will ask you to send a sample of your book.A good query letter should make the publisher want to read your story. Read some sample query letters online to get a feel for the language and style used in this type of correspondence. You can find a good example of a successful query letter at http://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/how-to-write-the-perfect-query-letter.

, If you get a positive response to your query letter, or if you're entering a publication contest through a literary press, send your work. It's crucial at this step to follow the submission guidelines of each publisher very closely. Different publishers ask for different things in a submission portfolio, and failing to adhere to a given publisher's guidelines could be the difference between an acceptance and a rejection.Include with your manuscript a self-addressed, stamped envelope (SASE) to make it easier for the publisher to respond to your work. You may also want to include a brief cover letter, letting the publisher know what previous publications you've had (if any), why you're interested in writing this book, and anything else that may be relevant for the publisher to know about your work. Keep the cover letter as short as possible so that it does not distract from your manuscript.Save every letter or email of correspondence that you have with a given publisher. It's important to have a written record of any offers the publisher has made, and to maintain a timeline of your interactions., It can be very difficult to get a piece of writing published, and it only gets more difficult the more a market is saturated with authors. It can take years to get a book published, and the process of submission and rejection can be daunting. But if you have a passion for telling stories, and you believe that yours is a story that children would benefit from reading, then it's worth sticking through. You may not make a lot of money - especially at first - but the best children's literature tends to come from authors who have a passion for writing stories for children. Be patient and something should come along sooner or later."

Place the headings above each new section.,
Format and place main section headings using APA.,
Format and place main section headings using Chicago style.,
Format and place main section headings using MLA style.",How to Write and Place Main Section Headings2," Headings should start each section. They should go before you introduce the section. Usually, you do not start a new page for a new section.


Remember to follow the format for the required style guidelines given to you by your professor.

, Level one (main section) headings should be centered, bolded, and written in title case. Title case is where you capitalize the first and last word and other important words. You do not, however, capitalize articles, conjunctions, or prepositions. For example:


The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body

, Level one headings should be centered, boldface or italic, and written in title case. For example:


The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body
Or: The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body


, Section headings should be numbered, followed by a period, a space, and the title of the section. For example:


1. The Beet Goes On: How Beets Fuel the Body

Create interesting characters.,
Begin by making a character page for each of your characters.,
Move on to your character’s backstory.,
Think about quirks and character traits that could make your characters more engaging.,
Dig a little deeper with each character, especially the main character.,
Study real life people to make character traits believable.",How to Write Compelling Fiction1," One of the main driving forces in a novel is the characters. People want to read about characters they can make a connection with, especially ones that have flaws just like themselves.;
, Start with his or her physical characteristics. Don’t forget to include diverse characteristics—your characters should reflect the diversity of real life.


What does she look like?
What is his hair like?
What color are her eyes?
Does she have an interesting scar? ‘
How tall is he?

, Again, don’t forget to include diversity. In order to be compelling, you want your readers to be able to relate to and engage with your characters.


What’s his family like?
Where does she work?
What’s his favorite food?
What does she like to watch at night?
Does he read a lot of books?
What’s her favorite cup of coffee?

, These little details help fill out a character and make him or her more relatable. While thinking about these little details, begin to consider why each character has these little quirks; this will come into play later. For example:


What weird things does he do with his foods?
What makes her crazy?
Does he always leave his socks on the floor?
Does she forget to load the dishwasher?
Maybe she goes crazy when she can’t have her favorite beef jerky.
Maybe he tries to fix everything, but it breaks instead.
Maybe she can’t stand to be in the passenger seat of a car.

, These questions address how your character is doing psychologically. Just like real people, characters should have problems that they don’t know how to deal with. Flaws are important for a character because the make them believable. People in real life are flawed, period, so characters need to reflect that.


What keeps her up at night?
What causes his skin to crawl?
What is traumatic about her past?
What kind of childhood did he have?
What keeps her heart beating?
What makes his breath catch?

, Taking details from real life will make your characters more believable in a book.


What does your roommate do that makes you crazy?
What does a co-worker do that’s a bit out of the ordinary?

Choose between a topic outline and sentence outline.,
Most outlines use an alpha-numerical structure.,
Note capitalization issues.,
Keep matters of length in mind.,
Familiarize yourself with a one-level outline.,
Move onto a two-level outline.,
Progress to a three-level outline.,
Use a four-level outline, when necessary.,
Use parallelism.,
Coordinate your information.,
Employ effective subordination.,
Practice division.,
Identify the research problem.,
Identify your main categories.,
Consider the order.,
Establish your major headings.,
Know what to include in your Introduction.,
Understand what the body of your outline will consist of.,
Arrange the Conclusions section.",How to Write an Outline for a Research Paper," With a topic outline, the headings and subpoints are all given in single words or short phrases. With a sentence outline, all of the headings and subpoints are provided in complete sentences.


Topic outlines are usually used when your research deals with many different issues that can be arranged in different ways.
Sentence outlines are usually used if your research focuses on complex issues.
Some instructors will insist that you must not combine these two forms. Many others, however, offer one exception to this guideline by allowing the main section headings to be short phrases while the remaining subpoints are written as full sentences.

, This structure uses a series of letters and numbers to identify and arrange section levels.


The first level is represented by Roman numerals (I, II, II, IV, etc.), the second level is represented by capital letters (A, B, C, D, etc.), the third level is represented by numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.), and the fourth level is represented by lowercase letters (a, b, c, d, etc.).

, In sentence outlines, headings and subpoints are almost always written with correct sentence capitalization rules. This is not always the case with topic outlines, though.


One school of thought indicates that first level headings should be written in all capital letters while all remaining headings use standard sentence capitalization rules.
Another school of thought suggests that the first level headings should only have the first letter of each word capitalized, rather than the entire word. The remaining headings, again, use standard sentence capitalization rules.

, Your outline should run no longer than one-quarter to one-fifth the total estimated size of your final research paper.


For a four to five page paper, you only need a single page outline.
For a 15 to 20 page paper, your outline will usually run no longer than four pages., A one-level outline only uses major headings and no subheadings. These headings are labeled with Roman numerals.
Note that you would not usually use this outline for a research paper, as it is not very specific or detailed. It can still be a good idea to start with this outline level, however, since you can use it to provide yourself with a general direction for your paper and expand upon it as the information flows in.

, Two-level outlines are a little more common for research papers. You utilize major headings and one level of subheadings.


In other words, your Roman numeral and capital letter sections are both present.
Each second-level subheading should discuss a primary supporting argument for the main idea it falls under.

, A three-level outline is even more complex, but if done right, it can help you to structure your research paper even more thoroughly.


You use Roman numerals, capital letters, and standard numbers for this version.
Next to each third-level subsection, you should address the topic of a paragraph that falls under the corresponding second-level section or main idea above it.

, These outlines are about the most complex you would expect to need for a research paper, and if you choose this structure, you will use Roman numerals, capital letters, standard numbers, and lowercase letters for your levels.


The fourth-level subheadings should address supporting statements, citations, or ideas within each paragraph listed in the third-level sections.

, Every heading and subheading should maintain a structure that is parallel to the other headings within its level.This refers most obviously to the usage of ""topic"" versus ""sentence"" outline formats, as described in the ""structure and type"" section of the article.
Parallelism also refers to parts of speech and tense. If a heading starts with a verb, then the other headings must also start with a verb. Moreover, that verb must also be in the same tense (usually present tense).

, The information provided by your first major heading should be equal in importance to the information offered in your second major heading. The same can be said of sentences in subheadings, as well.


Your major headings should identify major tasks or ideas.
Your subheadings should elaborate on the points addressed in your major headings.

, The information in your headings should be general and the subheadings should be more specific.


For instance, if you were writing about memorable experiences from your childhood, ""Memorable Childhood Experiences"" would be the heading and the subheadings might look something like, ""Vacation at 8 years old,"" ""Favorite birthday party,"" and ""Family trips to the park.""

, Each major heading should be divided into two or more parts. In other words, you should have at least two subheadings for every major heading.


There is no limit on subheadings, but once you start forming a dozen or so subheadings under a single heading, you might find your outline looking cluttered and messy.

, As you prepare to write your outline, you need to specifically identify the research problem you are trying to address. This will guide the entire formation of your outline and your paper.


From this research problem, you will derive your thesis statement. A thesis statement is a single sentence that sums up the entire purpose or argument of your research paper.
This thesis statement will usually be written above the outline itself or within the first ""Introduction"" heading of the outline.
Your research problem can also help you figure out a title.

, You also need to figure out what main points you plan on covering. All of these main points will be listed in your introduction and listed as part or all of you major headings for the body part of your paper.


The main points are details that support or address your research paper. They should be very general in nature.

, Take a look at your research topic and determine the best possible order to deliver information. You might end up using a chronological arrangement or a spatial arrangement, but as a general rule, you will go from general ideas to specific ones.


Chronological arrangements generally only work if you have a topic that has some chronological history to it. For example, if you were researching the history of modern medicine, it would make sense that your paper and outline follow a chronological order.
If your research topic does not have a history, though, you will probably end up using a spatial structure. For instance, if you are researching the effects of television and video games on the adolescent brain, you probably would not follow the chronology of the research. Instead, you might describe the different contemporary schools of thought on the issue or otherwise follow some other spatial arrangement of ideas.

, Your first and last headings will be your ""Introduction"" and ""Conclusions"" sections, respectively. The other major headings will be represented by the main or major categories of your paper.Some instructors will insist that you do not use the terms ""Introduction"" and ""Conclusions,"" however. In these instances, you can usually skip these two sections altogether, but you will need to write your thesis statement separately and above the outline.

, Your ""Introduction"" heading will need to include your thesis, at minimum. You might also want to briefly list your main points and your hook.


Note that these elements will usually be listed as subpoints, not as major headings. The major heading for the section will be ""Introduction.""

, Each main heading within the body portion of your outline will be labeled by a short phrase or sentence addressing a main category of your research paper.


As with the actual paper itself, this portion of your outline will hold all the significant content.
The main headings will correspond to the main categories briefly listed under a subheading of your “Introduction” section.
You can include only the main ideas and supporting details of those ideas (a two-level outline, as noted in the “Outline Levels” section of the article) or you could include information about specific paragraphs and supporting details within those paragraphs (three-level and four-level outlines, respectively).

, This section will not contain much information, but you still need to provide at least two subpoints under the main heading.


Restate and rephrase your thesis.
If you drew any additional conclusions based on your research, list them here. Keep in mind that none of this information should be “new,” and all of it should have been addressed elsewhere in the paper.
If your research demands a “call to action”—a response that a reader should have in response or an action that should be done in response—include that under this section, as well. This will usually be your final point within the outline.

Follow up.",How to Write an Opinion Piece," Your op-ed should discuss a topic that relates to current events, trends, or opinions of others. Timeliness is absolutely essential when it comes to submitting op-eds to newspapers. Newsroom editors are going to be much more interested in a piece that relates to an ongoing debate, or discusses an event that just happened, rather than a piece that focuses on something that happened a few months ago.


Scour the paper for compelling topics to respond to. If your op-ed piggybacks on work the newspaper published recently, your piece is instantly more interesting to the editors and will have more of a chance of getting published, if you want to submit it.If your local library is slated to close in the next week, you could write an op-ed about the merits of the library and why it is an absolutely essential part of your community.;
, Opinion articles needs to contain a really strong opinion. If you aren’t passionate about the topic you’ve picked, you should probably consider picking a different topic. When you’ve settled on something that you have an opinion about, boil your argument down to its simplest form. Try to make one single point clearly in one or two sentences. If you can do this, you've got a good topic for an opinion piece.Let’s continue on with the library example. Your argument could be: The library is historically a hub of learning and community. It should not be closed so that a fast food restaurant can be built on the site.

, In order to be persuasive, you will have to know what you are talking about. In order to really know what you are talking about, you’re going to need to do some research. Op-eds that are filled with valid, fact-based points that support your argument are much stronger than op-eds that only state your point of view. Run internet searches, look through archives, talk to people directly involved, and organize your own first-hand information.Why is the library closing? What is the history of the library? How many people check-out books from the library each day? What activities go on in the library each day? What community events are hosted in the library?

, Good op-eds shouldn't be open and shut cases that are easily proven or disproven. There's no reason to read an opinion about something that's obvious, like whether or not heroin is healthy. Whether or not heroin addicts should be treated or incarcerated? That's more controversial. List out the different facets and main ideas of an argument to make sure it's complicated enough to warrant an op-ed. For the library piece, your outline might be something like:


The library is a beacon of learning and togetherness in a town that lacks a community center and only has one small all-grades school.
You might have a personal connection to the library, and could incorporate a personal story that also brings in the present day events and community activities.
Explore possible alternatives to closing the library, how the community can keep the library open. Include suggestions for the local city planners.

, Unlike essays, op-eds put the argument right out there in the first couple of lines. From there, organize your arguing points, make the reader care about your cause, and sum up what you think should be done about the topic.Try something like this:


""In the winters of my youth, when days were short and walking was done in bundled layers, my sister and I would make the short trek to the library. Afternoons were spent in art classes, and among the bookshelves of that historic building. Sadly, next month the library is slated to meet the same fate as many of our other now closed community buildings. For me, this is the last straw.""

, Readers tend to remember interesting details rather than dry facts. While your op-ed should not completely dismiss solid facts, use bright and fascinating details to make sure your op-ed lingers in your reader’s mind. Give real examples to make the reader see that this is a topic worth reading about and remembering.The library op-ed might draw on details like the fact that the library was founded by President Wilson because he felt the town needed a place to read and discuss. You might discuss a specific librarian who has worked there for 60 years and has read every book of fiction in the collection.

, If readers feel like the topic you are writing about doesn’t actually affect them, they will be less likely to read your op-ed. Make it personal for your readers. Explain why your topic, and the recommendations you suggest about your topic, will affect your readers’ lives.For example:


The closing of the library will displace 130,000 books and movies, forcing citizens of the town to travel 40 miles (64 km) to the next nearest library, bookstore, or movie rental business. Readers’ children will have access to half as many books, as the school always sends the kids to the library to rent their textbooks for the year. Etc.

, This means using your own voice to convey your message, and giving personal examples that will drive home your point. Reveal your humanity through your writing to make your readers engage with you by reading your op-ed. Show them that you are a real person who feels really strongly about this topic.To continue the library example: You might use a personal story about how the first book you ever read from cover to cover was in that library; or how you developed a relationship with the old lady who runs the check-out counter; or how the library was your refuge from your bad living situation.

, Your op-ed is calling your readers to become informed on the topic and do something about, not asking them to consider trying to think about the topic. Use active voice when you write. Also keep in mind that you don’t want to scare away readers with technical jargon that could come across as pretentious or just plain confusing.


Example of passive voice: “It is hoped that the local government will reconsider its plans to close the library.”
Example of active voice: “I hope that the local government sees what this wonderful library means to the community, and will reconsider its horrible decision to close this hub of learning and community-building.

, Select a date and time and have flyers printed inviting the community to discuss the future of the library. You could also invite a reporter to record people's opinions and have photos taken to bring awareness., Doing so will make your piece seem more appealing and respectful (even if you feel like the other side is comprised of idiots). Acknowledge the ways in which your opposition is correct.For example:


To be sure, those that wish to close the library down are correct in thinking that our local economy is struggling. Businesses are closing left and right because people are not buying their goods. But to think that closing the library will solve the problem of our economy is surely a misguided notion.

, An op-ed that simply rants and does not recommend solutions (or at least steps towards a solution) is less likely to be published than an op-ed that finds alternatives and solutions. This is where you get to discuss the improvements and other steps you think involved parties can take to reach what you believe to be the best outcome.


For example: If we come together as a community, there is a serious chance that we can save our library. Through fundraising and petitioning, I think it will become clear to the local government that they need reconsider the closing of this historical and vibrant library. If the government were to instead allocate some of the funds they are planning on pouring into the new mega-mall to the upkeep of the library, this beautiful landmark would not have to close.

, To round off your op-ed, you’ll need a solid final paragraph to reiterate your argument and bring your piece to a good conclusion that will remain with the reader after they have put down the paper.For example:


Our town’s library is not only a house for the brilliant works of authors from around the world, it is also a place where the community can come together to learn, discuss, appreciate, and inspire. If the library closes as planned, our community will lose a beautiful testament to our town’s history, and a hub for the curious minds of our young and old alike.

, In general, keep your sentences and paragraphs short and sweet. In general, you will want to rely on short and simple declarative sentences to get your point across in your op-ed. Each newspaper is different, but most have a maximum word count of 750 that you cannot exceed in your op-ed.Newspapers will almost always edit, but will usually preserve the voice, style, and viewpoint of your piece. This doesn’t mean, however, that you can send a lengthy piece and count on them to cut it down to their liking. Papers will often skip over a piece that does not generally correspond to their specified word count.

, Newspapers will create a headline for your op-ed, regardless of whether or not you send one along with your piece. Because of this, there is no need to spend much time worrying about your headline.

, You should submit a short bio about yourself that links you to the topic you are writing about and builds your credibility. You should also add your phone number, email address, and mailing address.Example of brief bio related to library op-ed: John Smith is an avid reader with a PhD in Creative Writing and Political Science. He has lived in Library town, MA his entire life.

, Historically, op-ed pages had very few pictures. Now, with newspapers turning into online publications, photos, videos, and other media that go along with your op-ed are widely accepted. In your initial email, mention that you have graphics that go along with your op-ed or scan them in and send them along with your piece.

, Each newspaper will have their own requirements and guidelines for how to submit your work and what information you should send along with it. Check the newspaper’s website or, if you have a hard copy, look for submission information on the Opinions page. More often than not, you will submit your op-ed to an email address., Don’t be discouraged if you don’t hear back from the paper immediately. Make sure that you send a follow-up email or place a follow-up call within a week of sending off your piece. Editorial Page editors are notoriously busy and, if they received your letter at an inopportune time, they may have missed it. Calling or emailing also gives you the chance to establish contact with the editor, giving you a leg up on the competition.

Move on to the plot.,
Create an outline for your plot.,
Figure out the conflict.,
Decide how the conflict will eventually be resolved.,
Don’t forget to include a few surprise twists and turns.",How to Write Compelling Fiction2," The plot is the story. It’s what your readers latch into. The plot should be compelling and keep them turning the pages.

, You need to have some idea of where the story is going, though of course, the story is going to take some unexpected turns (even for you). If you are having trouble coming up with a story, read newspapers and watch the news. Sometimes truth is more interesting than what you can make up.


Use real life stories as inspiration for coming up with a plot. Of course, you’ll want to change some details, but it gives you a starting point.

, What is going to be the driving force of the story? Compelling fiction has conflict. Conflict can be a messed up relationship, a murder, a person who needs to figure something out for him or herself, or any number of other things. However, every story needs conflict; otherwise, it’s like living in Mayberry or some other 1950s utopia television show.

, This resolution should happen just after the climax of the story. The climax is the high point of the action just before the end. The climax is where the conflict comes to head—where it must be resolved somehow.

, Your reader should be surprised by your fiction for it to be compelling fiction. For instance, maybe your character figures out a way to take the job and stay together with her girlfriend at the same time without having to make a choice between the two, which has been the driving narrative of the book. Maybe the murderer ends up being the sweet old lady next door that no one saw coming.


One common idiom is “No surprise for the writer, no surprise for the reader,” and it’s true, meaning if you don’t surprise yourself a bit, you won’t surprise your reader, either.

Have friends and family read your story and consider cutting out any parts that are considered ‘boring’.",How to Write Compelling Fiction3," Create the setting, introduce the main characters, and introduce the conflict. Remember that the setting sets the mood for the story, so think carefully about what you want to use.

, All characters should be introduced in the first third of the book.

, What happens to create further conflict? Maybe the main character runs into obstacles, such as not being able to see his significant other for various reasons. Maybe another person enters the relationship, creating a love triangle. How do other characters help or hurt the main character’s journey?

, Is she taking a trip to figure things out? Is she trying to get in contact with her significant other? Is she searching for clues to solve a murder mystery?

, The story should be mainly action or dialogue, for the most part. The setting is important, but it can drag down the story if you include too much about it in your writing.

, Decide how you will transition to it. The conflict should be coming to a head; that is, it is moving to the forefront of the novel.


Maybe the protagonist has to choose between staying with her significant other or moving on to start a new life for herself because her significant other has set an ultimatum.
Maybe the protagonist is on a high speed chase trying to catch a murderer.

, The resolution is how the conflict is resolved. The story doesn’t need to have all the loose ends tied up (some writers like leaving a bit of ambiguity), but you do need to have some resolution by the end of the story.

, Look for typos, grammatical errors, and awkward sentences. Also look for plot holes (places where there are mistakes in the plot), awkward transitions, and boring parts. Try to fix as much as you can.

, Ask for feedback, and take it to heart. If several people say one part is boring, you may need to cut it, even if it’s your favorite part.


Of course, in the end, it’s your decision, but usually, if several people say something is wrong, you need to do something to fix it.

Write to images or visuals.",How to Write Children's Short Stories," There are strict industry standards for word count in books for children. There are several types of children’s stories, including:Picture books: These books are made for children up to age eight and average 500-1000 words. Picture books contain an image on every page and are published in larger trim sizes, 8.5” x 11”. These books can be written at a higher reading level than the age of the intended audience, as they are often read to a child by an adult.
Easy reader books: These books are made for children ages five to nine and are usually 50-2500 words. The word count will depend on the publisher and the reading level of the intended reader.
Chapter books: These are short novels for children ages seven to ten and are typically 10,000-12,000 words.
Middle grade novels: These books are made for children ages eight to twelve and hover around 20,000-25,000 words.
Young adult novels: These books are made for children ages twelve and up and are usually 35,000 to 45,000 words.;
, Focus on examples of children’s stories that are at the reading level you would like to write for. If you’re interested in creating picture books, head to your local library and go through the picture books section for possible examples and models. Easy reader books and middle grade novels are often written in a series, with multiple titles that revolve around a main character. Some good examples of children’s stories include:



Where the Wild Things Are, by Maurice Sendak. This 1963 picture book is one of the most well known and beloved children’s stories.

Eloise in Moscow, by Kay Thompson. This easy reader book is the fourth in a series about the adventures of six-year old Eloise.Charlotte’s Web, by E.B. White. A classic chapter book that touches on major themes like grief and the wonders of friendship.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by Roald Dahl. A classic middle grade novel with a cast of eccentric characters and an engaging plot.The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins. A well known young adult series, comprised of three novels that follow the trials and tribulations of Katniss Everdeen., Choose one to two examples of books that are written in your chosen reading level. As you read through them, ask yourself several questions:


Does the book effectively use its reading level to its advantage? For example, in Where the Wild Things Are, Sendak creates a story that is enjoyable for adults and children to read. This works well as picture books are often read by adults to children. Sendak uses the reading level to appeal to a variety of readers.What genre does the book fall into? The Hunger Games would be considered a dystopian young adult novel, which is part of the science fiction genre. In dystopian novels, the setting is a futuristic universe where an oppressive societal control and the illusion of a perfect society are maintained through totalitarian control.In The Hunger Games, this is the Capitol, led by the oppressive Professor Snow, which is opposed by Katniss.
Is there a positive message, theme, or moral in the book? In Charlotte's Web, the moral of the book centers on the friendship between the spider, Charlotte and the pig Wilbur. Loyalty is also a big theme of the book, as Charlotte and Fern try to figure out a way to save Wilbur from being slaughtered.How does the writer make the main character interesting and engaging for readers? In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the main character, Charlie Bucket is a sympathetic protagonist. He is unassuming and respectful towards the other characters, lives a poor and undernourished life, and seems deserving of a golden ticket to Mr. Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory.
Is there an unexpected twist or payoff at the end of the book? In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the unexpected twist at the end of the books occurs when Charlie is the last child standing after a day in Mr. Wonka’s factory. It is then revealed the entire visit has been a test to find Mr. Wonka’s successor as the owner of the factory.How does the writer use word choice and simple language in the book? Compare a picture book, such as Where the Wild Things Are, to a young adult book, such as The Hunger Games. Note how the picture book uses an image on each page, as well as only one or two sentences per a page, to tell a story. A young adult book has no images, and uses long blocks of text, broken up by dialogue, and separated into chapters. As well, a picture book will only use very simple words and terms for a pre-school reading level, while a young adult novel will use marginally complex words and terms for a grade 10-12 reading level.

, There are many types of fiction, from fairytale to fantasy to historical fiction to horror to humor. Some writers begin with a story idea or a character first, rather than a genre. But it can help to pick your genre before outlining your story idea. Popular genres for children’s stories include:Fables, which are stories that have a moral ending. Many fables for children use animals and inanimate objects to portray a theme or moral. For example, The Thomas the Tank Engine book series.
Folktales, which are stories about commonplace events and characters that seek to explain things in life like nature, or the human condition. There may be make believe elements, like talking animals or natural elements like trees or rivers, as well as supernatural elements. For example, Dragonology: The Complete Book of Dragons.Historical fiction, which are stories that portray a time period or historical event. For example, a young adult novel about the life of Abraham Lincoln called Chasing Lincoln’s Killer.Modern fantasy, which are imaginative tales that require young readers to accept elements and story lines that clearly cannot be true. They require readers to suspend their disbelief and engage with talking animals, elements of science fiction or the supernatural. For example, Charlotte’s Web or Alice in Wonderland.
Dystopian tales, which are a form of science fiction that uses an exaggerated worst-case scenario to critique a current trend, societal norm, or political system. For example, The Hunger Games or The Divergent series.
Realistic fiction, which are books written around contemporary issues or real-world situations. This genre is similar to historical fiction, but it is based in current events. For example, a young adult novel about terrorism in America or race issues in the deep South.

, Often, the setting of your story will inform the details of your main character and the genre you are writing for. Think about an area you know well, such as your town or city, or a geographical area you would like to learn more about. You will then need to research certain elements of the setting to ensure it seems believable and clear to your reader.If you are writing historical fiction for children set in a certain time period, you will need to do some research about that time period. If you are writing dystopian fiction or a folktale, you can use your imagination to create a unique and slightly futuristic or supernatural setting.
In children’s stories, there is no limit to setting. From a spaceship on Mars to a pirate ship in the Caribbean, all these settings can be used for your story.

, Your protagonist, or main character, is going to act as a guide for your reader as they read your story. Your main character should be interesting and endearing enough that your reader cares what happens to her. Main characters in children’s stories are often the same age as the readers, and are typically other kids or animals. Rarely, adults or inanimate objects are also used as main characters in children’s stories.Consider how you can make your main character unique. For example, maybe they have a special ability or power, such as a photographic memory like Encyclopedia Brown of the Encyclopedia Brown chapter book series, or a strong and powerful personality, like Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games.

, What is the positive message the story is trying to convey to the reader? This could come down to simple morals, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the power of friendship, doing unto others as you would want for yourself, or doing the right thing means sacrifice and hard work. Many children’s stories use a simple moral to structure the story and place the main character in a situation that causes them to realize the moral or theme.


Many main characters use their skill or ability to get out of a potentially bad or tricky situation, such as a dystopian government. You may also use an imaginative setting to show the reader a moral or theme, such as the value of punishment and the value of dreams for the main character, Max, in Where the Wild Things Are., A satisfying ending acts as an unexpected surprise that completes the child’s reading experience. Think of it as the cherry on top of a good story. A twist or payoff should occur at the end of the story and be surprising to the reader.For example, in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Dahl keeps the reader entertained with unique characters, a strange and interesting setting, and situations where characters meet their demise in intriguing ways. By the time the other children have been eliminated through their own greed and gluttony, the reader and Charlie both realize there is only one child left. The payoff then occurs when we find out Mr. Wonka was using the visit to the factory as a test to find his successor and the future owner of the chocolate factory.

, Make those first several sentences count. Begin with action, dialogue, or a description that sets the mood of the story. Start as close as possible to the story’s catalyst, or the aha moment for the main character. This is the moment where your main character’s life shifts from ordinary to extraordinary and the plot of the story takes off.For example, on the first page of the picture book Imogene’s Antlers, the first sentence starts right in conflict: “On Thursday, when Imogene woke up, she found she had grown antlers.”
Imogene’s matter of fact reaction, placed next to the illustrations in the book, create an intriguing image to begin the story.

, Part of creating tension and interest in a story is letting your main character make a mistake or get in trouble. This will allow your character to change or shift by the end of the story and keep your reader engaged.Gauge how much trouble your character should get into based on the age group you are writing for. A four year old boy atoning for not eating his vegetables by being forced by his mother to fight to the death? Probably not an appropriate level of trouble. But a 16 year old girl living in a dystopian future where she is forced to fight to the death for her family? More of an age appropriate level of trouble for your main character.

, When writing for children, one big mistake writers make is allowing adults to come in a solve all the kid’s problems for them. Most child readers want to have a child protagonist who can solve their own issues or use adults only when necessary. Though parents can be involved, they should remain in the background or the peripheral of the main story. Let your main character work out the problem for themselves and don’t rely on authority figures to solve all the issues or provide the answers.


Having strong children characters will be empowering for young readers. It tells children that if the child character could work out a solution to a problem, maybe they can too.

, Descriptions should show how your protagonist operates within the setting or how they feel about the other characters. Try to interpret all the details of a setting or scene through the eyes of your main character.For example, in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the narrative is in the third person, but it stays very close to Charlie’s perspective. The narrative describes Charlie’s walk home past the chocolate factory as “every day, as came near to it, he would lift his small pointed nose high in the air and sniff the wonderful sweet smell of melting chocolate.”This tells the reader about Charlie’s appreciation of the factory, gives some physical description of Charlie, and shows Charlie’s isolation from the factory, as he can only smell the wonderful chocolate rather than eat it himself.

, The dialogue in your story should also match the age and perspective of your main character. If you are writing from the perspective of a seven year old girl, for example, you likely will not be using terms like “utilize” “pontificate” and “summarize”. Instead, you may use basic terms that are easy for a seven year old reader to understand and which seem more likely to come out of a seven year old’s mouth.


In Where The Wild Things Are, Sendak gives the monsters a unique voice, and uses punctuation, such as exclamation marks, to mark their speech. However, the monster still use simple terms that are easy for children and adults to understand. For example, “Let the wild rumpus begin!” and “Oh, please don’t go-we’ll eat you up, we love you so!”

, A few adjectives and adverbs are fine for children’s books written for a higher age level, from chapter books to young adult. But avoid packing your sentences with modifiers, as strong verbs can often work better than lots of adjectives and adverbs. In children’s stories, especially chapter books and young adult books, writers often use strong verbs to convey physical and emotional qualities of the characters or of a setting or scene.For example, in a passage from The Hunger Games, Collins uses strong verbs to convey a sense of action and tension.“A boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs, splattering my face with blood. I stagger back, repulsed by the warm, sticky spray. Then the boy slips to the ground.”
Using verbs like “reaches” “grapple” “stagger” “slips” creates a strong image in the reader’s mind, without confusing them or jolting them out of the story. However, notice that Collins does not use any adverbs, but still creates strong sentences. She appeals to the reading level, without sacrificing any tension in the story.

, Remember that most children’s stories, particularly picture books and easy reader books, are illustrated. Keep the visuals of the book in mind as you create the story. In many picture books, the illustrations must be just as effective as the words on the page and their should be a strong connection between the images and text.For example, Where the Wild Things Are is known as much for the text and the story as it is for the illustrations, which bring the monsters of Max’s imagination to life for the reader.

Find relevant reading materials.,
Read as a writer.,
Consider a childhood development class.",How to Write Children's Books1," If you're interested in writing children's literature professionally, you should strive to understand your options. Children's books come in a variety of forms and sub-genres, so take some to learn about children's lit in order to understand what types of books you might be interested in writing.


For very young children, there are board books, easy picture books, and standard picture books. Board books are generally concept books with very little text that teach things like words, animals, shapes, and rhymes and may include various pop-up devices and different colors and textures. These books are typically around 12 to 16 pages. Easy picture books are elaborations on board books, usually around 32 pages, and usually contain the same fun textures and pop-ups but strive to tell a basic narrative using only about 500 words. Picture books, for children from 4 to 8, stick to illustrations on each page but contain about 500 to 800 words of text outlining a simple narrative plot that addresses childhood emotions.Easy readers and transition books are for children just beginning to learn to read independent of adult supervision. Easy reader series are broken down by grade level, starting in kindergarten and moving up to third grade. Much like a picture book, colored illustrations are found on each page but the reading level is a little more advanced. There is more text, about 200 and 1500 words, and the stories are told mostly through action and dialogue. Easy readers are typically 32 to 64 pages long. Transition books serve as a transition between easy reader books and chapter books. These books are broken down into 2 or 3 chapters and around 30 pages long. Illustrations are less prevalent, usually black and white illustrations showing up every few pages.Early chapter books, for children ages 7 to 10, are generally 45 to 60 pages long and broken down into 3 or 4 chapters. While paragraphs remain short, sentences are often more complex. Middle school books, written for children 8 to 12, are generally around 100 to 150 pages long. Stories tend to be more complex, introducing secondary characters and subplots, and genres range from fiction, nonfiction, fantasy, sci-fi, and other genres typical of adult literature.Young adult books are for ages 12 and up, and manuscripts are usually between 150 and 225 pages long. Characters are older, usually 13 and up, and themes generally revolve around the struggles of modern teenagers.;
, If you want to write children's books, you need to read a lot in your chosen genre. Seek to find relevant reading materials to familiarize yourself with the common language, themes, and characters of your chosen genre. There are a variety of ways to find good reading materials.


Talk to a librarian. Explain to a local librarian what genre of children's literature you're interested in writing and ask her for recommendations of current, popular books, authors, and series. You can also ask a clerk at a bookstore or a friend you have who has young children.Browse book review websites and see what children's books are getting the best reviews. Sites like Goodreads can provide an overview of what's being read and reviewed in the current market.Pay attention to awards, like Newberry Medals and Children's and Teen Choice Book Awards. This will give you an overview of what the most acclaimed writers and books are in your chosen field., Once you've got a variety of books together, you should sit down and read. When reading children's books, you need to read as a potential writer. Look for ways for you to learn the craft while reading through a variety of books.


Look for how the writer builds the story. When do we first meet the main character? How is he or she introduced? Do we get to know his or her personality through dialogue, action, description? What makes you root for this character? Why?How is the plot introduced? When is the central problem of the story made apparent? How is this problem solved? How is the solution proposed? What are the characters trying to accomplish? Do characters feel fully fleshed out and believable? If so, why?Pay attention to logistics as well. About how long are paragraphs? Sentences? If you're reading a chapter book, how long are chapters? Are pictures included? If so, where? Pay attention to the names of illustrators. If you want to write children's books, you might need to network with an illustrator if you're not familiar with drawing yourself. Be aware of who the best known illustrators in your chosen genre are., If you're serious about writing children books, some background information in childhood development might be a good idea. This can help you gauge what appropriate reading levels are and what kind of topics children best respond to at different age groups. Many colleges offer courses online and you might also be able to enroll in a single course at a local college or university. Check the requirements on a variety of college websites for information on how to apply.

Make time to write.,
Find a niche.,
Pay attention to what children want.,
Join a writer's group.",How to Write Children's Books2," You get better at writing through practice. There is no secret way to improve your use of language beyond simple hard work. Make time every day to sit down and work on your project.


Depending on your project, you should have some set goal every day. If you're working in young adult literature and want to have a 150 to 200 page manuscript, a word count of, say, 1,000 to 2,000 words a day can be helpful. Most electronic word processors allow you to easily track word count. If you're working on books for young children, word count may not be as important as works will be shorter. Try to write, maybe, a story or two a day if you're doing short picture books.
Have a particular time and place each day to write. You can clear off a space for yourself at the kitchen counter or set up a desk in your bedroom. Sit down and write every day at a particular time. You could, for example, strive to write after dinner each night or just before bed.
It may be difficult to stay on a schedule at first, especially if you're new to writing itself. Try to remember things will get easier with practice and before long writing will feel routine, just like brushing your teeth or doing the dishes.

, Look into the world of children's literature and ask yourself what's missing. Publishers are always looking for books that expand on current trends. There may be a million young adult vampire novels, for example, but if you can find a fun new spin on the genre this will set you apart.


There is almost always a gap when it comes to genre. In the historical fiction genre, for example, you might notice there are very few books about female soldiers and warriors. A story of a female soldier fighting in the Middle East during one of the recent wars might be something a publisher would be interested in over a story of a male soldier.Don't just be aware of what's popular in the current moment. Publishers are always looking for innovators, who are aware of what will be popular in the next year or next month. Study the history of children's literature and see what kinds of books are popular for a given time period and whether this correlates to anything going on in the world or to current parenting styles. See if you can make a reliable prediction on what might come next.If you have children or have friends or family members with young children, talk to the kids themselves. Ask them what kind of books they wish were available that are not currently widely published.

, One of the most important things to do to successfully write children's books is to pay attention to what children want. As an author, you'll need to know your audience.


Browse children's websites and forums to see how and why kids respond to particular types of books. If you're aiming to write for very young children, you might only be seeing parents' responses but most parents will have a sense of what books their children responded to best.You might want to volunteer for an organization that works with children, especially regarding reading and writing. You could volunteer to read to kids at a library or tutor early readers as part of a back to school program., Writing can be a lonely experience as it's such a solitary act. Joining a writer's group to get feedback and experience from other writers can help you stay on track with your work. You can find groups online, through websites like MeetUp, or you can look for ads at local colleges, coffee shops, and bookstores."

Learn manuscript format and publisher's guidelines.,
Be patient.",How to Write Children's Books3," Once you have a manuscript ready, you need to shop it around to publishers. Before you do so, however, you need to have a sense of what's out there. Learn about a variety of publishers to find a publishing house that's a good fit for your work.


Do research on a variety of publishers. Books In Print is a database available through libraries and online that lists a variety of publishers and the kind of work they generally look for. The Children's Books Council publishes an annotated list of children's publishers each year and the Writer's Market has many books available detailing where to find a publisher.Remember, many publishers do not take unsolicited submissions. Finding an agent may be your best option to submit to some of the bigger publishing houses., There are a variety of organizations you can join that will give you an edge in the children's book community. You can network with other professionals and have access to valuable resources that can help you successfully publish your book.


The Society of Children's Books Writers and Illustrators helps writers find critique groups and offers many national and international conferencing events that allow you to network with other writers.Many online events, such as National Novel Writing Month (NANO), encourage writers to network via social media. Agents and publishers occasionally pay attention to events and competitions sponsored by online communities, so strive to get involved via the digital realm., An agent is probably the best means to get attention for your manuscript. In order to get an agent, you'll have to write a query letter detailing the book you're writing or planning to write.


A query letter should be fun and creative. Start off with a picturesque outline of your novel's basic plot or what makes it stand apart from the pack. Write, revise, and proofread a variety of query letters and have other writers look over your work and give you honest feedback.Much like publishers, look for agents relevant to your interest. A good way to find agents is to look up the authors whose work you admire and see who represents them., Before you send your manuscript out to anyone, make sure you're following standards. Improper formatting or loose adherence to standards may result in your manuscript being tossed aside.


Follow all protocol regarding contacting a publisher. If the guidelines say no unsolicited submissions, it's probably best not to send your manuscript in. If the guidelines say you cannot contact editors with questions, do not call or email editors while your manuscript is being reviewed.Manuscript format varies from publisher to publisher. Some publishers expect certain margin sizes, a particular types of paper, a specific font, and other guidelines. Make sure you know manuscript format thoroughly before submitting your manuscript to a publisher., It can take a long time for things to get moving in the publishing world. It may be months or even up to a year before you hear back from a publisher. Use this time wisely, focusing on sending out more manuscripts and producing new work."

Octave: a group of eight lines

Sestet: a group of six lines.;
, The ""meter"" in ""pentameter"" refers to the rhythm of sets of two to three syllables in a line of poetry. These sets of syllables are known as “feet.” Italian sonnets are written in iambic pentameter, so they have lines of five (penta) feet. An iamb is a foot of two syllables, with the first syllable unstressed (de-emphasized) and the second syllable stressed (emphasized). The rhythm of an iamb is often written out like a heartbeat: “da-DUM.” An iamb can stretch across two words or take place in one. To understand the difference between stressed and unstressed syllables, try saying these examples of iambs slowly and out loud:

The couch

She stopped

Arise

Release

Employ
Keep in mind that one-syllable nouns and verbs are usually stressed. Here’s a famous line of iambic pentameter by John Milton (10 syllables total):

""When I consider how my light is spent.""

, A rhyme scheme is a pattern of rhyming lines. In a sonnet, rhyming lines have similar (rhyming) sounds at the end of each line. The first eight lines of an Italian sonnet (the octave) follow the rhyme scheme A-B-B-A A-B-B-A, with each letter representing a different line. The sestet can follow multiple rhyme schemes (more below). Rhyming lines are grouped by the same letter. For example, the last word of the first “A” line must rhyme with the last words of all other “A” lines.
Consider these rhymes in the famous Italian sonnet “On His Blindness” by John Milton:
(A) When I consider how my light is spent(B) Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,(B) And that one talent which is death to hide,(A) Lodg'd with me useless, though my soul more bent(A) To serve therewith my Maker, and present(B) My true account, lest he returning chide,(B) ""Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?""(A) I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent(C) That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need(D) Either man’s work or his own gifts. Who best(E) Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state(C) Is kingly, thousands at his bidding speed,(D) And post o’er land and ocean without rest;(E) They also serve who only stand and wait.”


Note that the last six lines of the sonnet (the sestet) can follow multiple possible rhyme schemes. Some standard examples include:
C-D-E-C-D-E
C-D-C-D-C-D
C-D-C-D-E-E
, Italian sonnets develop a theme in the first eight lines (the octave). Developing a theme might involve posing a problem, presenting a situation or raising a question. For example, Milton’s “On His Blindness” develops a theme inspired by real events. John Milton began losing vision in his 30s, and wrote “On His Blindness” after going completely blind at the age of 44. In the octave of the sonnet, Milton (a religious man) questions how someone without vision can best serve God. This theme is most clearly expressed in line seven, towards the end of the octave:
""Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?""


Notice how Milton wraps up his theme with an explicit question, asking whether work (“day labor”) is demanded (“exact”ed) by the heavens from those who are blind (with “light denied”). This line is an example of how you might present a question or concept in your sonnet in need of a response.
Brainstorm a few ideas for your sonnet’s theme on a piece of paper, and choose one theme to write on. When choosing your theme, keep in mind that you will be developing a response to your theme in your sonnet's sestet.

, After the octave, start off the first line of your sestet with a turn: a point at which an Italian sonnet starts responding to its theme. The sestet might resolve a problem, comment on a situation or answer a question. “On His Blindness” literally responds to itself in the first line of the sestet, with Patience (a figure representing patience) answering Milton’s question:
That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need
Either man’s work or his own gifts. Who best
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state
Is kingly, thousands at his bidding speed,
And post o’er land and ocean without rest;
They also serve who only stand and wait.”


Notice the specific use of the word “replies” in the first line of the sestet. In this sestet, Milton describes the response to his question: that he does not need to move nations to serve God. To wait attentively is enough.
Brainstorm a few ideas for your sonnet’s response on a piece of paper, and choose one to write on. You should pick the response that works best with your theme.

, Now that you’ve created a theme and response for your first sonnet, it's time to write! Don’t worry too much about the exact content of your rough draft. Do try to use iambic pentameter and correctly follow the rhyme scheme. Look back to “On His Blindness” for reference on the rules of an Italian sonnet. For help specifically with rhyming, read How to Find Rhyming Words for Poetry.

, You will likely need to change and cut out some words you had in mind to fit the sonnet’s tight structure. Here are some tricks you can use to fit the format of an Italian sonnet:

You can often choose how many syllables you want a word to have in your sonnet. For example, the word “several” has three syllables, but adding an apostrophe to turn “several” into “sev’ral” takes off a syllable. Milton uses this technique in line thirteen of ""On His Blindness,"" turning the two-syllable “over” into the one-syllable “o’er”:
“And post o’er land and ocean without rest;""



You can swap around the elements of sentences in your sonnet to fit your rhyme scheme or to maintain iambic pentameter. For example, instead of writing “She drove her car,” you can write “Her car she drove.” Don't be afraid to sound old-fashioned in a sonnet! Milton freely switches around sentence structure in “On His Blindness,” including in line fourteen. In this line, Milton could have flatly written that “Those who only stand and wait also serve” (stressed syllables bolded). But as we can see, this line would not have satisfied the rules of iambic pentameter. Instead, Milton writes:
“They also serve who only stand and wait.”



You can freely leave out English articles (a, an, the) to save syllables or to maintain iambic pentameter. For example, instead of writing “through the bright window (stressed syllables bolded), you might write ”through window bright.” Going back to line thirteen, you can see that Milton does not use the article “the” to refer to either “land” or “ocean”:
“And post o’er land and ocean without rest;""




, Pay attention to each syllable. Reading your sonnet slowly and out loud will help you make sure you’ve followed the proper structure. While you read, make sure that your Italian sonnet:


Has 10 syllables per line
Is written in iambic pentameter
Follows a proper rhyme scheme
Turns from theme to response at line nine (the beginning of the sestet).

, Now that you’ve had experience writing an Italian sonnet in proper form, it’s time to start adjusting the content of your sonnet. It’s a good sign when every word in your sonnet has a clear purpose you could explain to someone else. Also think about whether the mood of your sonnet matches its content. For example, if the theme of your sonnet is joy, low-energy or gloomy phrases would drag down the mood.
The tone of “On His Blindness” matches Milton’s sad and reflective theme, especially in the octave. Consider how the following phrases set the mood of the sonnet:

“this dark world and wide”
""one Talent which is death to hide""
“Lodged with me useless""
Each of these phrases helps create the sonnet’s mood. If Milton had written “this shining world and wide,” he would have written a very different sonnet.

, To take your Italian sonnet to the next level, try using literary devices in your work. A literary device is any method a writer uses to get a message across to the reader. You can use literary devices in many ways, including stirring your readers’ imagination by using words and expressions in non-literal ways. For example, someone “feeling blue” is someone feeling sad, not literally blue. Consider these examples of literary devices used in “On His Blindness”:


Metaphor: A metaphor is a literary device that identifies one thing as being the same as another, even when the two “things” being compared are unrelated. In line one of “On His Blindness,” Milton uses metaphor when he identifies his lost vision as “light” that is now “spent.”


Personification: Personification involves attaching human characteristics with anything from natural phenomena to inanimate objects. For example, the phrase “the raging hurricane” personifies the hurricane by giving it the human emotion of rage. In line eight of “On His Blindness,” Milton personifies patience, giving it a capitalized name and a voice.


Alliteration: Alliteration is a stylistic literary device involving grouping together words starting with the same letter or a similar sound. The tongue-twister ”She Sells Seashells By the Seashore” features multiple examples of alliteration. The second line of ""On His Blindness” features alliteration in the phrase ""days in this dark world and wide.""

For help specifically with writing metaphors, read How to Write a Metaphor.
To learn more about literary devices, try browsing through a long list of literary devices.


, Showing your sonnet to people you trust is a great way to express yourself and get constructive feedback on your work. The more constructive feedback you receive, the more you’ll understand what you’re doing well and what you might consider trying in your next piece. No one, including John Milton, was born knowing how to write sonnets. While sonnets follow a strict and precise form, they reward your patience with song-like (""sonnetto"") poetry. The more you practice writing Italian sonnets, the easier it will become

If the event is professional, you’ll likely want to include business associates on your list. Graduation parties and other academic celebrations may include your mentors or favorite teachers. Weddings and other celebrations with multiple hosts need to take into consideration inviting those people who are important to each party., Once you have the basic list, compare that to the maximum number of people your party or gathering can accommodate. At this point, you can begin adding further removed family members and friends who you are not as close to. If you end up with fewer people than the maximum, that’s okay, but try not to go over this number., If you're going to allow your invitees to bring a guest, you'll need to factor this in when determining the final guest list. Additionally, you may want to include parameters for the plus one. For instance, if you are not including children in your event, you may want to include a polite notes reminding your guest that their plus one should not be younger than a certain age.


You could say something like, ""Mr. Tom Smith and guest are cordially invited to attend my wedding reception. We ask that all guests be over the age of eighteen."", Make sure you haven’t left anyone out. Ask a close friend or family member to take a look at the list for you, and make any suggestions for addition or subtraction from the list. Keep the maximum number of guests in mind and avoid inviting too many people. However, if you believe some of your guests will be unable to attend, you may want to send a few extras.


If you’re concerned you may have some cancellations or regrets from those you invite, consider sending an initial set of invitations early. Then, send out a second round of invites if many people are unable to attend., You can design and print an invitation in Microsoft Word, the Adobe Design Suite, or other open access word processing or design software options. If you or a friend have great handwriting, you can even hand letter the invitations. Use high-quality paper that feels like a card or has an interesting texture.


You can also create weight by layering your invitations. Starting with a standard card-sized printed invitation, you can add a thicker, colored sheet of card stock that is slightly larger to the back with a small amount of glue or double sided tape.If you want to personalize your invitations and save time, consider using custom stamps. You have a personalized note or a picture turned into a rubber stamp. Then, you can quickly replicate each card for your guest., If you want to save some time compared with DIY invitations, you can order personalized invitations. Prices vary dramatically based on the style, paper type, printing in color or black and white, and other variables, so have an idea of the look you want in order to get an accurate price quote.


Party City, Target, Staples, Office Max, and local stationers or artisans will all offer custom invitation printing.
Most shipping companies like UPS and FedEx also offer custom invitations.
Online providers like VistaPrint and Shutter Fly make and send customized invitations as well., If your guests are more modern or your event is less formal, invitation applications like iTunes, Evite, or even Facebook can make inviting everyone on your guest list quick and easy. Most programs allow you to upload your own custom designs or use a standard template, so you can streamline your invitation process. In addition to making the design process go more quickly, you'll also be able to send the invites immediately via digital file and receive RSVPs right away, which is great for tight timelines., Make sure your note includes the occasion of the event, the date, location, and the time. You should also let your invitee know whether or not they’re encouraged to bring a guest. Additionally, request that your invitees RSVP using an enclosed card, email address, RSVP application, or by phone depending on your preference. Keep it short and sweet, but make sure you include polite request phrases like “Please attend,” or “We request your attendance,” to make sure your invitees feel welcome.


For instance, try something like: ""Please come to my birthday party. The event is on October sixteen at my home. The party will take place from 3 o'clock to 4:30. Please RSVP as soon as possible using the included RSVP card, my email, or calling me on the phone.""
You should also include any special directions to your event or instructions such as dress code or other relevant information., The most important thing to keep in mind is the intention. Your intention is to show respect to your guests, so do your utmost to remember and include these details. If you’re inviting a single woman who is unmarried, you’ll want to use “Miss” or “Ms.,” or if the invite is addressed to a single man, “Mr.” If you’re inviting a married couple, you’ll use “Mr.” and “Mrs.” However, things become more complicated, if you’re inviting friends or relatives who have special titles like “Dr.” or “Esq.”


If you do mistakenly address an invitation, apologize over the phone, in person, or in writing. This is more than adequate atonement for your faux pas., In the top right hand corner of the envelope, you’ll need to include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the center of the envelope, include the same information for your invitee. You may also want to include your contact information inside the invitation either on the invitation itself or on an RSVP card. That way, if your invitee misplaces the envelope, they still have access to your contact information., Your closing line or valediction and signature should be specifically catered to your audience. For instance, if you’re inviting your boss, a polite “sincerely” is likely the best valedictory. If you’re closing out the invitation to your parents, “love” may be more appropriate. This is a great opportunity to quickly and easily include a personalized touch to your invitation notes that doesn’t take up too much time.


Use an inside joke to make the invitation personal. For instance, “Thanks for always buying my drinks, Rob.” Will be a very personal message you can quickly write to a college roommate on your wedding invitation. This would likely not be appropriate on your parents’ invitation., You can find a wide array of decorative flourishes as simple as a borderline to more complicated vines, roses, or pumpkins. If you have a friend or family member who’s an artist, you can even ask them to custom design your invitation. This is yet another great opportunity to include your personal style in the invitation making process. However, ensure your design fits the event. For instance, the skull and crossbones may be a fun decoration for a Halloween party invite, but it is unlikely to fit your wedding invitation., If you’ve instructed your invitees to respond using an included card or to call, it may be easiest to create a manual RSVP list. This can be as simple as a printed guest list with check marks to indicate attendance or ‘X’s to indicate those who are unable to attend. Conversely, you can create a more advanced manual tracking system using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or online spreadsheet tool to tally the total number of RSVPs, plus ones, the number of adults or children, type of meal, and other predetermined factors., If you determined digital invitations are the best solution for your event, you will more than likely be given access to a digital RSVP tracking program. This is one of many reasons people choose digital invites. However, if you choose traditional paper invites, you can still plug your invitation list and RSVP information into digital tracking systems to streamline the RSVP process. Eventbrite, Evite, and other similar RSVP resources are available at minimal or no cost to use., Once you have a good idea how many of your guests can attend the event, make sure your venue, food vendor, and other accommodations will meet the needs of your guests. Double check the number of meals you’ve ordered, any maximum occupancies in buildings, and other possible concerns to make sure you’re providing for your guests’ needs to the best of your abilities., Whether or not you receive gifts from those in attendance, it’s important to let them know you appreciated them taking time out of their schedules for your event. Use a guest sign in sheet or have someone at the door keeping track of who was in attendance. Then, send thank you notes.


Thank you notes can be as simple as, “Thank you for attending my birthday party!”
If you do receive a gift, make sure to include a specific reference within your note by saying something like, “Thank you so much for attending my graduation reception. I look forward to putting the pen set you gifted me to good use in my future career!”
Like the invitations themselves, these can be digital or traditionally printed depending on your unique situation."

Tell a small story.,
Bridge into the topic.,
State your thesis.",How to Write an Introduction Paragraph1," The story can be humorous, serious, or shocking, but regardless of its nature, it should directly address or relate to the topic of your paper.Anecdotes can be true or fictional. They can also be personal or about someone else.
The story should be short enough to tell in a few sentences.;
, After you tell the story, briefly explain why you told it and why the reader should care.


You may end up introducing the main ideas of your essay during this portion of your introduction.

, In a single sentence, come up with a thesis that focuses the topic and tells the reader what to expect about the paper to come.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
The connection between your thesis statement and the anecdote you used should be obvious to the reader. If the thesis statement does not fit into the introduction as it currently stands, you may need to use more supporting evidence to lead into the thesis or change the anecdote you use.

Determine if a historical review could be helpful.,
Provide factual and historical context about the the topic.,
Narrow your thoughts down to a thesis statement.",How to Write an Introduction Paragraph2," There are many papers for which no historical context is needed, but if historical context can help clarify things to the reader, a historical review introduction can be very helpful.


These introductions are usually used for papers written about a historical time period or topic, a historical critique of a piece of literature, or a long-standing problem that people throughout the ages have tried to address.

, Outline or review a few key historical facts that offer the reader any essential information he or she might need in order to understand the topic of the paper.


These pieces of information should not only provide context about the topic, but should also indirectly present the general topic itself. In doing this, you will demonstrate the the reader how your topic fits into the historical account you present in your introduction.

, The information provided thus far will be fairly general, so you need to focus the end of your paragraph on a single thesis statement that you will use to define the rest of your paper.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
With this type of introduction, your thesis statement should cause the reader to view the historical facts you just presented in a specific light or through a specific lens. In effect, your thesis statement should tell the reader why the facts you presented before it are important to keep in mind.

Briefly summarize the literary work you are writing about.,
Draw out a general theme from the work.,
Hint at the main sections of your essay.,
Come out with your thesis statement.",How to Write an Introduction Paragraph3," Introduce the key bibliographic facts of the literary work and summarize the main plot or purpose of the work.


In the case of a story, you do not need to focus on specific details or give away the ending. You simply need to introduce the basic, overall theme of the story and provide information about the conflict the main character faces.

, Most literary works have multiple themes that can be addressed, but for the same of your paper, you will need to focus on one theme that relates directly to your thesis.


Connect your summary to the theme in a naturally, sensible manner. For instance, if writing an essay about a coming-of-age story, you should introduce the coming-of-age theme with something like, “The broken friendships and family drama Jimmy has to go through serve as his passage into adulthood.”

, Lead into your thesis by briefly mentioning the main ideas of your essay, which exist to support your thesis.


In a sense, you will be narrowing down your broad topic into a more focused, specific thought by slowly presenting ideas that narrow the reader's field of vision until all that reader sees about that literary work are the ideas presented in your paper.

, Finish the introduction with a focused, single-sentence statement about the thesis of your essay.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
With this type of introduction, you need to choose a thesis that makes sense within the context of your summary and supporting evidence. If the thesis still seems out of place, go back and rewrite your supporting evidence until the connection your thesis has to the summary of the literary work makes sense.

Ask the reader a question he or she can related to.,
Consider backing up your initial question with two others.,
Hint at any answer and discuss how your essay will address the answer.,
State your thesis in a single sentence.",How to Write an Introduction Paragraph4," Address the reader directly by posing a question that is relevant to the topic of the paper. The question should also be something that will catch the attention of most people, thereby painting the topic in terms that a reader can relate to.


When choosing a question, you can ask something universal, surprising, or rhetorical.

, This is only optional, but if you want to continue narrowing down your topic, you can also provide two questions that “back up” your initial question and further clarify the issue at hand.


The additional questions you ask should gradually narrow the topic down into something smaller and more specific.
For example, start with the question, “Why does the grass always seem greener on the other side?” After that, you can ask, “What is it about the human mind that perceives what one does not have as something more desirable than what one does have?” Your final question could then be, “Is this state of being a societal, psychological, or spiritual problem?”

, You do not need to state the answer in clear terms, but you should use the main points of your paper to guide the reader in a specific direction.


Doing this also clues the reader into the approach you intend to take on the question or questions at hand.

, Your thesis statement will be the closest you get to providing a direct answer to your initial question. It should state what, specifically, you plan to write about.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
You do not need to give the reader a clear, definite answer to the question you ask, but if you narrowed your topic down using the three-question method, you should consider using terms or ideas from the final question in your thesis.

Offer a relevant quotation.,
Provide context for the quotation while bridging into the topic.,
State your thesis.",How to Write an Introduction Paragraph5," The quotation can be famous, insightful, or unexpected, but regardless of the content or type you choose, the quotation must have direct relevance to your topic.


The quotation can be a famous saying, words from someone famous, a snippet from song lyrics, or a short poem.
Do not insert a hanging quote. A “hanging quote” refers to a quotation that has no introduction or no explanation after it. In other words, the sentence with your quotation in it must contain other content aside from the quotation itself.

, Context can who spoke or wrote the words originally, what the words are referring to, the time period the quotation came from, or how the quotation addresses your topic.


Note that unless the quotation is anonymous, you must always state who is responsible for it.
This context will also introduce the topic of your paper and lead into supporting details that can introduce your thesis.

, Come out with a single statement that defines, in clear terms, what your paper is about.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
The thesis statement for this type of introduction will need to make sense in regards to the quotation you used. You should not use a general quotation that touches on the overall, broad topic but has nothing to do with the specifics of your thesis.

Mention something that people mistakenly believe.Occasionally, an essay addresses a topic that a paper's readership might often misunderstand or have inaccurate beliefs about.,
State your correction.,
Elaborate slightly on the truth.,
Wrap things up with a relevant thesis statement.",How to Write an Introduction Paragraph6," If this is the case, you can directly call out this mistaken belief in the first line of your introduction paragraph.


When you state this mistaken belief, make sure to clarify that this belief is inaccurate.

, As soon as you state what the wrong belief is, you need to follow your statement with a sentence about the corrected version or truth of the situation.


This sentence should introduce the general topic of the paper and open the path for your thesis statement.

, Provide supporting evidence or facts about your correction to further cement the truth of it in the reader's mind.


These pieces of supporting evidence usually correspond to the main ideas you will cover in the body paragraphs of your essay.

, With the general topic introduced and supporting evidence provided, you can now make a definitive thesis statement about what you will cover in your essay.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
In some ways, your thesis statement will be like a direct foil or mirror image of the misconception you are addressing. The two will be directly connected yet directly opposite one another.

Submit your short story to contests.",How to Write an Award Winning Short Story," If you are writing a short story with the intent of submitting it to a particular contest, you should always read the guidelines for the contest before you dive into the writing. Note if the contest has a specific theme, such as stories about loss or stories about cultural identity. You should try to submit a story that will fit the theme in some way, as this will increase your chances of winning the contest.You should also check if the contest is called a “literature contest”, as this means they are often interested in stories that use language in an interesting way with compelling characters. The judges of this type of contest may not be as interested in a plot driven story.
If the contest is labeled a “writing competition”, the judges may be looking for popular fiction, where there is a clear plot and a strong opening line.

, You can practice the craft of writing by doing writing exercises at least once a day. Writing exercises can be a good way to generate ideas and get your mind set for writing an award winning short story. You can do a free write to writing prompts found online or create your own writing prompts.


You can find the 10 Best Creative Writing Prompts on WritetoDone.com.
To do a freewrite to a writing prompt, set a timer for 10-15 minutes and use the writing prompt as a guide. Do not lift your pen from the paper for the entirety of the freewrite or read over what you have written until after the freewrite is over.

, To get a better sense of what others are writing, you should read published short stories that have won awards. You may look at short stories in a particular genre that are award winning, such as award winning science fiction stories or award winning fantasy stories. You may also look at award winning short stories written by writers from your country, such as the Best American Short Stories anthology.


You can also look at short stories that have won a specific award, such as the Pushcart Prize award or the Science Fiction short story of the year award.
Search for award winning short stories online or in print form at your local bookstore or library.

, To start your story, you should focus on a main character who is complex and unique. You may use the first person “I” to channel the perspective of your main character and play around with how the main character will sound and act in the story. Having a complex main character in your short story will often catch the eye of contest judges and allow your story to feel more developed and detailed.Try to give your main character specific qualities that will separate them from a crowd. For example, rather than have a main character who goes to high school in a small town, you may be more specific and create a main character that goes to a private all girls catholic school in Lincoln, Nebraska. This gives the reader a more detailed picture of your main character.
Because you are writing a short story and you want to keep it concise, you should try to avoid having more than three to four characters in the story. Your main character should dominate the narrative, with one to three supporting characters who also appear in the story.

, Your short story should have a central conflict or issue that your main character is trying to address or deal with. This conflict will help to propel the story forward and keep your reader (and the contest judges) engaged. The conflict should have an external element, such as an event that happens to the main character, and an internal element, such as how the main character processes the event.For example, you may have a main character who finds out her biological mother is alive and wants to see her. This is the external conflict or issue in the story. The internal conflict or issue will then be how the main character deals with meeting her biological mother.

, Though your short story does not need to be plot driven necessarily, it should nevertheless have a plot of some kind. The plot will help your story move forward and let things happen to your main character or the supporting characters. You may use a plot diagram to create the plot outline or the snowflake method.


Your plot diagram should include exposition, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution.
If you use the snowflake method, you should create a one sentence summary of your story, followed by a one paragraph summary, character synopses, and a spreadsheet of scenes.

, Your short story can catch the eye of the contest judges by having a narrative voice that is compelling and engaging. You may use your main character’s voice to narrate the story using first person “I”, or you may try the third person voice, where you use “He/she/they” to narrate the story. You can also try using the second person “you” to narrate the story, though this may be more difficult to do and some contest judges can be put off by the second person.No matter which narrative perspective you use in your story, make sure it is unique and compelling to read. This means using language and description in interesting ways. Make sure you use sensory detail when you describe something, where you tap into how something or someone smells, tastes, sounds, looks, or feels.

, Your short story should answer the four W’s: Who, What, Where, and When. The “who” means the main character and supporting characters in your story, as well as the antagonist in your story, if there is one. The “what” is the central conflict of the story that the main character must address. The “where” and the “when” are the setting of the story, such as where it takes place and when it takes place.Try starting with the “who” first, such as a character voice, or a “what”, such as the main conflict, in the first line of your story. Then, gradually shift into the “where” and “when” in the following paragraphs so your reader knows where they are and what time period they are in.
Put your reader in a setting within the first few paragraphs of the story. Use sensory detail to situate your reader so they are not confused or thrown off.
Avoid overly descriptive passages and aim for precision instead. You do not want to bore your reader with sentences about the weather or the color of the sky. Instead, focus on descriptions that show the reader just enough to keep them reading.

, The dialogue in your short story should always serve two purposes: to develop character and to move the action of the story forward. If the dialogue is not doing both things at once, it may need to be cut or revised so it is stronger.Avoid dialogue like “Hi, how are you?” or “How was your day?” This type of casual dialogue may be useful in real life, but in fiction it can come off as mundane and dry.
Instead, write dialogue that feels snappy and tight. Give your main character a certain way of talking or expressing themselves. Then, let the dialogue reflect their voice and mannerisms. Try to do this for all of your characters so the dialogue feels unique and specific in your story.

, There should be tension on every page that builds up to the climax of the story or the resolution of your main character’s conflict. Make sure your characters are always dealing with the main conflict of the story in some way. This will help your story feel gripping and exciting.


You may put obstacles in the way of your characters to make it more difficult for them to achieve their goal or to resolve their conflict. Doing this can add to the overall tension of the story.
For example, for your story about your character’s meeting with their biological mother, you may have an obstacle like your character’s relationship with her adopted parents. Or you may give the biological mother problems of her own that create obstacles for your main character.

, Award-winning short stories will be well-structured and polished. A big part of a well-structured story is a solid ending. The ending of your story should bring the story full circle and leave the reader with a distinct feeling or emotion. Though you do not need to resolve all the conflicts or issues, the ending should bring the story to some kind of close.You may have an ending that makes the story feel unified, where themes or elements of the story come together and overlap or bounce off of each other. You may also try to give your main character what they want or allow them to achieve some part or all of their goal.
Try to have an ending that leaves the reader with a certain feeling or emotion. Maybe you have a twist ending that leaves the reader unsettled or disturbed. Perhaps you have an ending that leaves the reader cautiously happy for the main character. Often, unsettling endings can be more effective than happy ones.

, Once you have completed a draft of your short story, you should polish it well before you submit it to any writing contests. Read it over to yourself and out loud. Listen to how the words sound on the page. You may also allow a friend or a writing group read over the story and get feedback from them so you can make it better.You should then revise the story using feedback from others and your own notes. Look for any awkward sentences or passages and adjust them. Make sure the narrative voice feels consistent and compelling throughout. Check that the reader is grounded in setting and time from the beginning to the end of the story.
You should also proofread the story for any spelling or grammar errors. Do not depend on the spellcheck function on your computer. Read the story backwards so you can check each word to make sure it is grammatically correct.

, You should also make sure the story falls within the required word count for any contests you are submitting it to. Submitting a 2,500 word story for a contest that only accepts entries that are 1,500 words will mean your story will likely never be read by the judges.You may need to revise and cut certain passages in your story to meet the required word count for a contest. Be assured that doing this will likely only make your short story stronger, as you should strive for precision and compression in your short stories.

, Make sure your short story has an eye-catching title, as this could make it more memorable to the judges. The title should fit the themes or ideas in your story and also say something about your story as a whole. Avoid titles that give too much away to the reader or titles that are long-winded and complex. Keep it simple, short, and engaging., You should double check that your story is formatted to the guidelines of the contest you are submitting to. If there is a specific font and line spacing noted in the guidelines, make sure you follow them. For example, the guidelines may ask for Times New Roman font in 12 pt, double spaced.Do not forget to include page numbers in your story. Place them at the bottom right corner so they are easy to spot but do not get in the way of your prose.
Many short story contests are judged blind so you should avoid placing your name or any other identifiers on the story itself. A title and page numbers are often the only formatting you need to have in your story if you are submitting it to contests.

, Once you have published and formatted your short story, it may be time to submit it to contests for review. Look for writing contests run through a university, a school, a literary magazine, or a government agency. Avoid writing contests that do not have clear guidelines or any contact information listed on their call for submissions. Try to submit your story to multiple contests at a time so it has a higher chance of winning an award.


You can find a list of reputable short story contests online through websites like Poets&Writers.com. You can also ask your writing teachers to refer you to any short story writing contests.
If you have any favorite magazines or literary publications, subscribe to their newsletter so you can get updates on any call for submissions for writing competitions they may have in the future.

Think about why you're a better choice than other applicants.,

Ensure you're using proper formatting.,
Proofread for spelling and grammar before submitting.",How to Write an Expression of Interest," Before you start writing, take a few moments to write down the work experience you've gained in your career that's relevant to the position you're applying for as well as any skills you have that make you an attractive candidate. Don't waste time with skills or experiences that aren't relevant to the position — you're trying to show why you're a good choice for this job specifically, not any random job.


For instance, let’s say that we’re applying for a government job in an IT position. If we have past experience in computer/technology-related positions, we’ll definitely include this. We probably won’t want to include unrelated work, like the summer’s worth of experience we got from working on a fishing barge. In addition, we’ll want to include any proprietary skills we have that might aid in our job, like knowledge of basic programming languages.;
, Most sources agree that EOIs should be as clear and concise as possible.To make the task of keeping your EOI brief easier, it can be useful to boil the point of your EOI down to a single sentence (as you might do for your thesis statement when writing an essay for school). Since it can seem a little blunt or mercenary to simply write, ""I want this letter to get me a job,"" try to focus on what the job means to personally and professionally and how you can excel in the position.


For instance, in our IT position example, we might whittle our EOI's purpose down to something like the following: ""The purpose of this letter is to demonstrate how I can use my unique skills and experience in a high-demand IT role."" You probably wouldn't want to be so cavalier as to say, ""The purpose of this letter is to show that I'm the best and that I should get the job.""

, Theoretically, someone applying for a job opening may have many other choices. Just as your EOI should tell your employer why you are a good fit for the job, it should also tell why the job is a good fit for you, What about this job makes it more appealing than other ones? How does it match up with your personal and professional goals? Employers love hearing why their job is more attractive to you than other ones because it makes you seem loyal from the get-go.


Don't be overly-frank here, but don't be entirely dishonest either. For instance, if you're mostly taking the job for the money, don't outright say this because most employers will be hesitant to hire someone with no loyalty to anything other than their paycheck. Instead, try focusing on the other things that make the job appealing to you, even if they're minor — the hourly flexibility, the valuable experience it will give you, the opportunities you'll have in the position, and so on.
For instance, if we're applying for the government IT position described above, we might want to talk about how a job with the government gives us a chance to use our skills to serve the greater good of the community; We probably wouldn't just say, ""I want this job for the salary and the cushy benefits.""

, Ultimately, your EOI should prove to your potential employer that you're the best choice out of all the people applying for the position. Spend some time thinking about why you as a person may be a better choice than a hypothetical applicant with exactly the same experience as you. Think about the intangibles you bring to the position. Some things you may want to consider are:


Your personality. Someone who's otherwise well-qualified for a certain position may not get it simply because they aren't the right ""fit"" for the workplace. For instance, in a retail position, an open, communicative personality is a must.
Your availability. Different jobs demand different hourly commitments — some are standard nine-to-fives, while others have odd hours or may require work on evenings or weekends.
Your career path. Employers are more likely to hire people for whom the job being offered is a logical career move — in other words, it can be unattractive to an employer to hire someone for whom the job represents a major ""change of course"" in their career because it's less certain that they'll stay with the job long term.

, Expressions of interest are formal business documents, so you should be sure to keep a dignified tone from the get-go. For instance, even your salutation (the ""Dear So-and-So"" greeting at the top of the letter) deserves some scrutiny. First impressions are key, so start off on the right foot by erring on the side of formality. Here, the best choice is usually to address your letter to the specific person in charge of reviewing applicants — usually the department head or HR manager — with a simple ""Dear Mr./Ms. (Surname),"". If you don't know who this person is, you can either call the company/organization to ask or use a general greeting like ""Dear Hiring Professional,"".


Another satisfactory option is simply to begin with a subject line and leave the salutation out altogether.Not that most business resources now recommend against using ""To Whom it May Concern,"" saying that this can come across as impersonal or disinterested., After your salutation, don't waste time — immediately begin to explain who you are, what your background is, and why you're writing. This introductory section can usually be contained to one paragraph no more than a few sentences long. Remember, the hiring team will probably have to read dozens of EOIs, so the quicker they're able to get a sense for who you are, the more likely they'll be to make it to the important info: your work history, skills, personality, and so on.


For instance, if we're applying for the government IT job described above, the following might be a perfectly fine introductory section — it tells who you are and why you're writing in just three sentences:



""My name is Jane Smith. I am writing in response to ""IT Professional Wanted"" posting on your website. As a veteran in the IT industry with over ten years of experience and someone for whom IT work is a personal passion, I would be a great fit in this position.""





, Next, dive right into your qualifications for the job. Start with your work history, especially if it's impressive. You don't need to be as detailed here as you would on your resume — it's usually enough to say something like, ""For five years I worked at Company X in a managerial role,"" rather than methodically listing your start and end dates and specific duties like you would on a resume. As always, try to keep things brief — keep this info in a single short paragraph whenever possible.


If you don't have any relevant work history (like, for instance, if you're applying for an entry-level position), don't worry. Focus instead on your skills, personality, work ethic, and any sorts of activities you've taken part in that might give you some sort of advantage. For instance, if you're applying for your first-ever job as a line cook in a local restaurant, you might describe your culinary background (including any cooking classes or culinary school) as well as non-cooking work you've done in restaurants (like serving, hosting, etc.).

, Your work experience isn't everything — sometimes, specific high-value skills can make you a much more attractive candidate than the amount of time you spent working in related positions. Mention any sort of specialized knowledge or expertise you have that might make you more effective in your role. There are a huge range of things you might conceivably put here — just a few are listed below:


Language skills. Are you fluent or conversational in another language? This can be a big plus for international organizations.
Tech skills. Do you have basic programming knowledge? Are you an Excel master? Do you know web design? For tech companies and startups, these skills are often in high demand.
Special certifications. Are you licensed to operate a forklift? Weld? Drive a semi truck? Handle food? For skilled labor jobs, these sorts of certifications are essential.

, Near the end of your EOI, it's usually worth it to spend just a few sentences talking about why you are a good fit for the job as a person. Unless you already know about the culture at the company or organization you're applying to, don't say that you're a perfect match for the culture or that you'd instantly be everyone's best friend. Instead, focus on the traits that would make you a valuable worker. Below are the kinds of things you may want to bring up:


Personality. Are you friendly and honest? Have you generally gotten along with your coworkers in the past? Employers like hiring team players — people who will keep a positive attitude at work and keep company morale high.
Social preferences. Are you a talkative, gregarious extrovert? Are you a quiet, focused introvert? Your habits for interacting with other people can have a serious effect on your job performance — some jobs demand great talkers while others don't.
Goals and Passions. Is this job something you love to do? Can it help you make achievements you've been dreaming of? Employers like hiring people with intense personal motivations for taking the job.

, When you've said everything you need to say to paint your self as an amply qualified candidate and a great fit, you're done, so end the letter as succinctly as you can while remaining polite. Don't waste time on long or dramatic goodbyes — a potential employer is more likely to be irked at having to read more than necessary than to be flattered by your flowery prose.


For instance, in the IT example described above, we might conclude as follows:



""Feel free to contact me via phone or email at (contact info). I look forward to hearing from you! Thank you for taking the time to read.
Sincerely,
Jane Smith""





, As frequently noted above, EOIs should be lean, succinct documents. To get your EOI as streamlined as possible, you'll need to be a merciless editor. When you've finished your first draft, take the opportunity to read it over at least one more time, looking for any unneeded content. Whenever you see a sentence that goes on longer than needed to get its point across, shorten it. Whenever you see a complicated word that could easily be replaced with a shorter one, do so. Your EOI is a functional document, not a chance to exhibit your writing ability, so keep it simple.


If you have time, take a quick break between when you complete your EOI and when you start proofreading. Most writer's resources will recommend this because it gives you a healthy degree of ""distance"" from what you've just written, making it much easier to see mistakes., EOIs should always be written with the sort of formal, dignified voice that normal business writing demands. Avoid using slang, colloquialisms, or humor. Keep in mind that the people reading your EOI have never met you before, so they won't have any reason to assume that you're including these things with good intentions rather than out of disrespect. A good general rule recommended by many writer's resources is to write as if you're giving an important speech, rather than talking to a friend of family member.As an obvious example, if we're talking our work history, the sentence ""From 2002 to 2006, I worked as a freelance consultant for several personal contacts"" sounds much more dignified than ""From 2002 to 2006, I did a little freelance work for a couple of guys I know"", even though it has almost the same meaning.

, When you've finished the content of your letter, take a moment to ensure that it's formatted in a way that shows respect for formal business writing conventions and makes it as easy as possible to read. Typically, this will be very similar to that for a cover letter or similar document. Below are just a few formatting issues that are common sources of confusion:Headings: In the top left corner of the letter, provide your name, address, phone number, and email address (each on a separate line. Leave a space between your heading and salutation.
Spacing: Keep the text in the paragraphs single-spaced. Leave a space between each new paragraph.
Indents: Either indent the first sentence of each paragraph or leave them aligned with the left side of the page. Many sources recommend against indenting if you skip lines between paragraphs.Closings: Leave three spaces between your closing (e.g., ""Sincerely,"") and your name.

, When you think your EOI is ready to send, be sure to give it one final once-over to look for any minor errors that may have slipped your notice. Keep an eye out for misspellings, inappropriate word use, grammar errors, and unnecessary content Below are just a few general tips for proofreading:Work from a printed page, not a computer screen. Seeing your work in a different format lets you view how it appears on the page and can help cure a case of ""glazed-over eyes"" from looking at a computer screen for hours.
Read out loud. Hearing your text with your ears in addition to seeing it with your eyes gives you an extra way to detect any errors. This is especially good for spotting run-on sentences that might otherwise escape you.
Get a friend to help. Someone who's never seen the text before may be able to see errors that you can't. Often, spending a long time writing a document can make you ""blind"" to errors in it that you've gotten used to seeing.

Write about a topic that scares you.,
Choose a topic that you find amusing or entertaining.,
Have a unique take on a common theme.,
Read published poems for ideas on a theme.,

Use a rhyming form.,
Go for a shorter poetic form.,
Use imagery.,
Add metaphors and similes.,
Use personification.,
Try other literary devices.,
Go for unfamiliar word choices.,
Set a specific tone or mood.,
Structure the lines of the poem.,
Listen to how the poem sounds.",How to Write an Effective Poem," Some of the best poetry is about difficult subject matter or topics that might seem taboo to the poet, and to the reader. You may decide to explore a topic that scares you or disturbs you in your poem as a healthy way to explore the topic. Addressing a topic that freaks you out can give your poem tension, passion, and excitement. These elements can then help make your poem more effective for readers.For example, maybe you have a fear of spiders. You may then write a poem about your fear of spiders, focusing on a specific moment in your childhood or adulthood where your fear of spiders became extreme and intense.
You may also choose a topic that you find disturbing, like murder or the death of a loved one. You could then explore your feelings and thoughts around the disturbing topic in your poem.

, You may strive to write a poem that is on the lighter side, with the goal of amusing and entertaining your reader. You can brainstorm topics that you think are funny, engaging, and amusing. You may then choose one of these topics and explore it more fully in your poem.For example, maybe you have a funny situation that happened to you recently. You may then focus on the details of the situation from your perspective and write a poem about the situation from beginning to end.

, The theme of your poem is the purpose of the poem. Many poems will take a common theme and put a unique take or spin on it. This allows the poet to address the human experience and make the experience personal to them. You may brainstorm a few universal themes that speak to you and then try to approach one theme from a unique angle.For example, you may decide to explore a common theme like “love” or “death” from your unique perspective. You may think about when you experience the most amount or the least amount of love from a person, a pet, or even an object. You could then focus on your specific experience of that love in your poem.
In “The Raven” by Edgar Allan Poe, Poe explores themes like loss, grief, and devotion to an experience in the past. He then approaches these common themes by using the personification of the raven and the unsettled mindset of the narrator to create a unique take on the theme.

, You can also get ideas on themes and topics for your poetry by reading published works. You may read several published poems that have strong, clear themes or topics that have been approached in unique ways, including:


“The Raven” by Edgar Allan Poe.“Fame is a Fickle Food” by Emily Dickinson.“Dirty Face” by Shel Silverstein.“One Art” by Elizabeth Bishop.""Interpretation of a Poem by Frost"" by Thylia Moss.""3 Poems"" by Wendy Xu., A narrative poem tells a story. It should have the elements of a story, including a narrator, character(s), a setting, a plot, and dialogue. The poem should explore a plot using these elements to take the reader on a journey. Often, narrative poems are longer and may be broken into sections or parts.You can write a narrative poem by focusing on a story that has a beginning, middle, and end. You should try to start with a problem or issue that your narrator or characters must then deal with throughout the poem. There may be a change or shift at the end of the poem for the narrator or the characters.
“The Raven” by Edgar Allan Poeis a famous narrative poem that puts the reader in the perspective of a narrator who goes on a journey full of mystery and horror.

, A free verse poem gives you a lot of freedom as a poet as you do not need to follow a specific rhyme scheme or pattern. You can make the poem flow as you see fit. However, you should still use elements of strong poetry, such as a unique topic or theme, literary devices, and strong description.Known examples of free verse poetry include “I Hear America Singing” by Walt Whitmanand “Having a Coke with You” by Frank O’Hara., Many poems use some element of rhyme, as rhyming can be pleasing to the ear when it is done right. Rhyming can also help to deepen the meaning of your poem by connecting certain words or lines together. A rhyming form can give your poem a certain rhythm and melody, which can make it more memorable to your reader.You could have end rhymes in your poem, where the end words of the poem rhyme. You can also have internal rhymes in your poem, where the middle of a line of the poem rhyme with each other. “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge is a good example of end rhyme and internal rhyme.You may use the sonnet form, which uses a particular rhyming pattern. Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 18” is a famous example of this form., You can also try a poetic form that is shorter if you are trying to write an effective poem quickly. You may select a form that creates a shorter structure you can follow and explore to its maximum effect.



Try a shape poem. You can write a short shape poem using a shape that is small and contained. Shape poems are a fun way to explore a subject or object visually on the page.
You may also try writing a haiku. Haikus are a Japanese poetic form that use the scheme 5-7-5 to create short, three line poems. They can be good for writing about a particular subject or object, particularly an object or subject in nature.

, You should always use imagery in your poem to paint a picture in the reader’s mind. You can use sensory details to create strong imagery, such as how does the subject of the poem smell, sound, taste, feel, and look. Using imagery will help your reader experience the topic or theme of the poem more fully.Avoid using vague or general imagery in your poems. This will not engage your reader and will weaken your poem.
For example, in “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the speaker describes the Ancient Mariner as having a “long grey beard and glittering eye.”This image paints a strong picture in the reader’s mind using only a few key adjectives.

, You should also use literary devices like metaphor and simile to add creativity and interest to your poem. These devices will create stronger imagery in your poem and help your reader get a mental picture of the events or moments in the poem.A metaphor is the comparison of one thing to another. The two things may seem unrelated, but in fact, they may share common characteristics that only make sense once they are placed side by side.A simile uses “like “or “as” to make a comparison between two objects or subjects. The comparison is direct in a simile, unlike the more hidden comparison in a metaphor., You can also use personification to add detail and description to your poem. Personification occurs when an idea, object, or animal is given human attributes. It can help your reader connect to inanimate objects on a more personal, human level.For example, the line: “The fire consumed the house” is personification because it attributes a human element to an object, “the fire.”

, There are many different literary devices that you can apply to your poetry to make it stronger. You may experiment with different literary devices and see which ones help to give your poem more interest and meaning.


You may use alliteration, where words with the same first consonant sound occur close together in the poem. For example, “The snake sucked the sound out of the air.”You may also try using assonance in your poem. This is where two or more words close to one another repeat the same vowel sound. The words may start with a different consonant sound. For example, “I go and mow the grass” or “She felt depressed and oppressed.”, You should always try to avoid cliches and familiar wording in your poem. Cliches are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning. You should use unfamiliar word choices and come up with your own take on a cliche. This will give your poem a more unique sound and rhythm.For example, rather than use the cliche “What comes around goes around” you may put your own spin on it using a unique word choice. You may also try to avoid cliches completely by using words that you find interesting to describe a moment or an experience.

, You should also try to strike a certain tone or mood in your poem. This will give the poem intent and create a certain feeling or emotion in your reader. Maybe you are going for a more lighthearted tone with a poem that is funny and silly. Or maybe you are aiming for a more spooky mood to the poem, where your reader might be disturbed, unsettled, or just plain freaked out.Elements like word choice, description, and literary devices can all contribute to the overall mood or tone of the poem. You may also want to give the speaker of your poem a certain attitude or perspective to contribute to the mood.
For example, in “The Raven” by Edgar Allan Poe, the speaker becomes more paranoid and disturbed as the poem progresses. This creates an unsettling mood and a foreboding tone in the poem.

, You should consider how you structure the lines of the poem, as they can do so much more than simply run parallel across the page. You may decide to indent certain lines in the poem to emphasize them or break up the poem into short lines down the page. Think of the lines of your poem as building blocks and then consider how you would like to build your poem on the page.You may write your poem first and then go back and section it off. It may help to read the poem out loud and consider if breaking up the poem in a certain way might add to the overall meaning of the poem.
You may decide to slow down certain sections of the poem by indenting a line or two lines. You may also decide to speed up certain sections by having several lines jammed together across the page.
You can also organize the poem by stanzas, where four to five lines are placed together to paint a certain picture or to create a specific meaning.

, Poetry is often most effective when it is read out loud. You should read your poem out loud several times and listen to how it sounds. Does it have a certain rhythm, style, or pattern? Does the poem create a certain tone or mood when it is read out loud? You should listen for all of these elements in the poem as you read it out loud.You may decide to revise the poem after you have read it out loud several times. Adjust any awkward wording or familiar phrasing in the poem. Indent or section off certain lines to add meaning to the poem when it is read aloud. Making changes to the poem so it is pleasing to the ear will make it more effective and memorable for your reader.

Write about the general topic immediately.With this type of introduction, you begin writing about your topic from the start without any lead in or hook.,
Never state what your essay is about in direct terms.,
State your thesis.,
Use this introduction with caution.",How to Write an Introduction Paragraph7,"


Introduce the topic in your first sentence.
In the sentences that follow, elaborate on the topic by introducing facts or ideas that you intend to use as main points or major sections of your essay.

, Even though this type of introduction requires you to introduce your topic right away, you should never issue a direct statement that states the topic in precise, specific terms.


Phrases to avoid include:

“In this essay, I will write about...”
“This essay will discuss...”
“In this essay, you will learn about...”


Stating your topic in such precise terms creates a stiff, unnatural flow of words. You should strive to make the tone of your introduction professional yet conversational so that the reader can fall into your writing more naturally.

, After you introduce the overall topic, you should conclude the introduction paragraph with a single statement that acts as your thesis.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
The portion of your introduction leading to the thesis will often narrow down the topic gradually until you can naturally introduce your specific thesis.

, While this type of introduction can be effective, it can often be boring and is not generally recommended.


The only time that this type of introduction tends to work is when the writer is writing for an audience already interested in the topic. If the topic is strictly factual and not open to much subjective interpretation, then a declarative introduction might be proper.

As you get to the end of the introduction, move more towards specifics.,
Lead into your first chapter.,
Use scholarly language for a scholarly book.,

Consider the context.",How to Write an Introduction to a Book," If you have an outline, pull it out to use in your introduction. If you don’t have an outline, go chapter by chapter and write a short, paragraph-long summary of each chapter as your outline.


Think about your main ideas as you are writing notes for your introduction. Sketch out the overall themes of your book, so you have them ready.;
, You want to pull your readers in from the very first paragraph. Try using a funny story or a joke, or just use an interesting fact.


For instance, if you are writing a book on birds, you could begin by telling a childhood story about how you tried to save a stuffed animal bird once by using office tape.
Or you could talk about how many birds are in the world as a way of introducing them.

, Usually, the introduction will provide a general idea of what the book is about. Include your main purpose in writing the book.


What’s the point of talking about birds? Why is this book important? Why would someone want to read it?
If you can answer those questions in a couple of paragraphs, you’ve got a good start on your introduction.

, You are welcome to use some statistics once you get into the middle of your introduction, but anecdotes from your own life would work just as well, especially if it is a personal book.

, Why did you see a need for this specific book? Did your passion drive you? Did you promise your dying grandmother? Your reader will appreciate knowing why you felt the need to write it.

, Is it a classroom textbook? A personal book to help someone through their journey? A small guide to look up the birds on the back porch?


Any person picking up the book should be able to determine whether it fits what they need it for, so you should go over the intended purpose of the book in the introduction.

, Will the information be scientific or more for the general population? Is it geared at Christians or atheists? Is it meant for a general audience?


Basically, you want the right reader for your book, and telling your readers who the audience is will help them figure it out. You don’t have to use the word “audience” in your introduction. Just give an idea of who the book is meant for, such as:
“This book use scientific language, but every term is explained thoroughly. As long as you are willing to learn, you should find this guide helpful even if you don’t have a background in biology.”
In those two sentences, you’ve told the reader that they might encounter scientific words they don't know, but that you will give them an idea of what these words mean; you’ve also told them that maybe they should find another book if they don’t want to dig through scientific jargon.
However, make sure you follow through on what your promise; that is, if you say you are going to define your scientific words, make sure you do.

, Tell your readers exactly what the book will cover. Are you looking at one species of birds or a wide variety? Are you covering anatomy or just the behavior of birds?


Consider providing a summary of each chapter. Not every introduction does this, but it does give your readers an idea of what to expect, which certainly isn’t a bad thing.
Since you’ve already made a summary of each chapter for the outline above, read through them to make sure they are appropriate for your readers, and then insert them at the end of your introduction. Try to keep the summaries short, a paragraph or less.

, At the end of your introduction, provide a transition into your first chapter by telling the reader what is coming next, such as: “Now that we have the introductions out of the way, continue onto the first chapter to start learning about scissor-tailed flycatchers!”

, If you are writing an introduction to a scholarly work, your introduction should reflect that. Make sure to make the language appropriate to the setting. That is, your audience is scholarly, so feel free to use scholarly language.


Make your introduction straightforward and to the point, as your readers will be expecting an introduction that progresses in a logical line.

, If you are writing an introduction for a collection of short stories, you have a little more leeway to be more interesting. That is, you can meander a bit through the introduction or even turn it into a story of its own, as long as it still provides an introduction to the book.

, However,the style of your introduction really depends on the context. If the book is for students, it will need to be more straightforward and provide background information on the texts included in the book. It should also include how the collection was brought together and for what purpose.


You can often have a bit more freedom when introducing a book of poetry. In fact, it can be more poetic. However, like an anthology of stories, it really depends on the context.
If you are just writing an introduction for an old friend’s book, it can be more poetic and playful, but for a book in an academic setting, it may need to be more informational.

, Write your article keeping in mind the kind of people attracted to the publication. Remember, many of them may be experts in your chosen topic. Choose your subject and vocabulary suited to the audience demographics.

, You should have professional/personal experience or knowledge of the topic. You needn’t be a pro in the subject. You only need to know it well. E.g. If you were once in clinical depression and overcame it, you could write an article on how to recognise symptoms of suicide. You might provide a personal angle, unlike a psychologist. If you have loads of experience in dating, you could share tips with less lucky folks.

, All facts and figures need to be accurate, especially while writing technical articles. It is advisable to carry out background research for personal articles too.

, People are interested in people. If your story is filled with facts and figures alone, readers will simply shut the magazine and go facebooking. Sprinkle analogies and anecdotes wisely. Never too little, never too many!

, Sift through words and sentences; arrange and rearrange paragraphs. Think like a photographer: 'How can I present this article in a fascinating new angle?'

, Maintain a notepad and divide it into sections for ideas, research, statistics and references.

, Editors are hard-pressed for space and it is distressing to see a laborious article brutally cut down to fill space.

, It will start you in the right direction and you will come across as a knowledgeable person.

, The introductory paragraph should be attention-grabbing. It should contain the gist of the article. (You may break this rule when you want to entrap the reader into a mystery, in which case, you don't declare the subject of your article outright. But beware! You need to be sufficiently skilled to use this device.)Your article should have a logical flow and rhythm. The concluding paragraph should sum up the matter and leave the reader satisfied and even provoked for further thought and action.

, It may be full of errors. Never mind! That is why it is called the first draft. It is better to write slightly longer than the required length. One can edit in the next stage. If your first draft is shorter than the requisite length, it is tough to think up new ideas, especially while facing deadlines.

, Yes, it is important to have distance between your 1st and 2nd drafts so that you do not get emotionally attached to your work. In the editing stage, you no longer assume the role of a free-flowing writer but that of the brutal editor.

, Turn your article into a compact piece that informs and entertains in minimal words. However, avoid going to the other extreme and being too terse. Add and subtract points as you deem fit.

, Does it match the needs of your target audience as well as those of your publication?

, Are the grammar, spelling and punctuation error-free?

,, Take care of margins. Avoid fancy fonts: Arial or Times New Roman are good enough.

, In case of rejection, look for publications that accept similar pieces.

,, Who knows when those trophies might come home with added bucks?

Check if the celebrity does autographs TTM.,
Look on the celebrity’s fan page or contact page.,
Contact the celebrity’s publicist.,
Check the celebrity’s social media.,
Handwrite the letter.,
Introduce yourself.,
Detail how you discovered the celebrity’s work.,
End on a polite note.,
Request no more than two autographs in your letter.,
Include a self addressed stamped envelope with the letter.,
Wait patiently for the autograph.",How to Write an Autograph Request Letter," Though you may have your heart set on an autograph from a certain celebrity, keep in mind not all celebrities are willing to respond to autograph requests through the mail. To determine if the celebrity does through the mail autographs, do a search on an online autograph databaseto confirm others have received autographs back from the celebrity in the past.Some celebrities may specify on their website that they do not do autograph requests. Respect their policy by not sending a letter to a celebrity who specifies no through the mail autograph requests., Many celebrities have fan pages or an official website with contact information. Depending on the celebrity, they may provide an address specifically for fan letters and autograph requests, or a general address through their public relations agency.Search for the celebrity’s official website online to locate their contact page, or do a google search for the celebrity’s fan club or online page.

, If a celebrity does not list a contact address for fan mail, you may want to reach out to the celebrity’s public relations contact by email. You can then request a mailing address for autograph requests from the celebrity’s publicist., In today’s digital age, celebrities tend to use their social media profiles as a way to connect and interact with their fans. Look at the celebrity’s Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook account and send a request for a mailing address through their social media.Many celebrities, such as Taylor Swift, have fan forums where fans can comment and share their thoughts on Swift’s music. You may want to join the forum and ask members if they know how to request an autograph from the celebrity, as many of them have likely requested autographs before.

, A handwritten letter, rather than a typed letter, will show the celebrity that you care enough to sit down and put pen to paper. If you have penmanship that is hard to read, you may consider typing the letter and then hand signing it. But if your penmanship is clear, try to hand write the letter to add a personal touch to your request. The letter itself should be brief and to the point, but still personable and engaging. Keep the letter under one page in length and break the letter into three main paragraphs:A short, friendly introduction that provides your name and where you live.
A body paragraph that states why you are a fan of the celebrity and what an autograph will mean to you.
A conclusion thanking the celebrity for their time, and noting the enclosed self addressed envelope (SASE) for the autograph.

, Start the letter with Dear Mr. or Ms. . State your name and where you’re from.


For example, if you are writing a letter to Taylor Swift, you may begin with Dear Ms. Swift, My name is Nicki Minaj and I’m from Los Angeles, California.

, In your body paragraph, you should be specific about how you first encountered the celebrity’s work and why you appreciate the celebrity. Show the celebrity why you are a genuine fan of their work and how they affected you personally.For example, in your autograph request letter to Taylor Swift, you may write: “My sister first introduced me to your music during your Fearless tour in 2008 and ever since then, I’ve been a die hard fan. I have all your albums, have traveled across the country to see you live five times in the past four years, and your song “Mine” was my first dance song with my partner when we married in 2010. It would mean to world to me to get your autograph so I can add it to my (ongoing) collection of your albums and tour memorabilia.”

, Finish the letter with one to two sentences thanking the celebrity from reading your letter and a positive sign off. You should also hand sign the letter, especially if it is typed.To end your letter to Taylor Swift, you may write: “Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to read my letter. I know how devoted you are to your fans and I appreciate all that you do for us. Sincerely,”

, It’s important to show the celebrity you are not asking for the autograph to then turn around and sell it online. Asking for no more than two autographs in your letter will show you are requesting the autograph for your personal use only and not for profit.Keep in mind some celebrities are already hesitant about sending autographs for free, so don’t turn your chosen celebrity off by requesting too many autographs in your letter.

, Make it easy for the celebrity to grant your autograph request by including a SASE. Put your address on the front of the empty envelope and the necessary postage for the letter to get back to you. If you are including a photograph or other paper item for the celebrity to sign, include a piece of cardboard that is the size of the item to prevent it from being damaged in the mail.If you would like to send other memorabilia to be autographed, be sure to protect it with packaging and tape to prevent it from being damaged. However, avoid over-packing the item or taping it too tightly, as this can make it hard for the celebrity to access and may lead to no autographs or damage to the items.
You may be writing a letter to a celebrity who lives overseas or in a different country or continent. Your SASE should include enough postage to cover the cost of the return shipping. Buy U.S. stamps if your celebrity lives in the U.S. or include an international postage voucher that can be used as postage by the celebrity if they live overseas.

, Keep in mind celebrities often receive hundreds of fan letters a week, and it may take time for the celebrity to respond. Some celebrities may respond within one to two months, and some may respond within a year or several years, especially if they have a busy schedule."

Remember to take the plan with you when you leave to deliver your baby.",How to Write Your Own Personal Birth Plan4," You are telling the staff exactly what you want, not asking if it is OK. Start your sentences with “I would like” rather than phrase it as “I would prefer”

, Keep in mind that what you deem to be minimal treatment may not necessarily be what your provider considers minimal treatment. Phrases such as “kept at a minimal” are not specific enough. Instead use phrases such as “every 20 minutes if all is well”.

, This is your plan and it should clearly communicate your personal desires. Write your plan keeping in mind that you are expecting your desires to be carried out. Make sure that you understand exactly what you are requesting.

, Do you already know that you want to rely on pain medication or do you prefer to take a wait-and-see approach?

, Do you want to place a limit on the number of vaginal exams you would like to receive? Are you okay with constant fetal monitoring or would you prefer only intermittent monitoring?

, Think everything through and come up with a plan that includes all of your basic desires.

,


Include your preferences for how to handle a difficult delivery. Do you wish to have an epistolary if necessary? If so, do you a want local anesthetic applied?
Include your choices for simple requests. Do you wish to be able to position yourself for productive pushing?
Include your desire for dad to cut the cord and whether or not you would like to save the cord blood. Try to be as thorough as possible without being overbearing.

, Do you want skin to skin contact immediately after baby is born? Do you want the baby placed on your chest? Would you like to be able to breastfeed immediately?

, List the type of incision that you prefer and the type of sutures that you would like to be used. Add your desire for a Douala in the room if you have one. Keep in mind that if an emergency arises, the hospital staff will do their best to follow your birth plan and meet your specific requests, although sometimes they may have to deviate from the plan for safety reasons.

, Do you want to have your baby remain in the room with you around the clock? Do you want your baby to be given any bottles or will he be strictly breastfed only? Do you want a pacifier given to your baby?

, This verifies that they are clearly aware of and understand your specific desires.

, A well-designed birth plan is useless if you forget to bring it to the hospital with you. Take precautions to ensure that you remember to bring your birth plan with you to the hospital.


It would be wise to make a few copies of your plan. Keep one in your car, one in your purse and one in your overnight bag. Sometimes, things do not go as planned. Having your birth plan readily available in the case of unexpected circumstances will be appreciated if things drift from the norm.
Keep in mind that emergencies arise and situations occur that may require different health options and care than you requested.

Know your purpose for writing your own eulogy.,
Write down your priorities in life.,
List the various roles you played over your lifetime.,
Define your legacy.",How to Write Your Own Eulogy1," People choose to write their own eulogy for a variety of reasons, such as ensuring accuracy, relieving the burden on their family, or creating a lasting impression of who they are. Knowing your reasons will help you figure out what you want people to remember about you.;
, Think about what is most important to you. Many people will include things like family, their hobbies, and their religion if they have one. Your list will be unique to you and should reflect what’s most important to you.Ask yourself, “What do I want people to say about me after I pass?” You may want them to talk about how well you played the piano, or how many dogs you took in from the local shelter. You may realize that your priorities included sharing music with others and helping animals.
If you’re having trouble figuring out your priorities, consider how much time you spent doing particular activities.
Don’t criticize yourself for not spending as much time on a priority as you would have liked.

, You may have been a parent, spouse, friend, boss, entrepreneur, photographer, teacher, counselor, caregiver, scout leader, musician, or groupie. From your list, choose the roles that you want to be your legacy.Consider how each of your roles fits in with your priorities to help you decide what you want to focus on in your eulogy.
Don’t worry about focusing on too many or too few roles. For example, some people may have focused their lives on encompassing one role, such as parent or entrepreneur. Others, on the other hand, may have moved through various roles at different stages of their lives.

, Think about what you’ll leave behind, whether it’s a large extended family, a thriving business, or the best recipe for cherry pie your town has ever eaten. Write down a few sentences about your contribution to the world, and how you hope it’ll continue."
"
Make a list of your defining qualities.,
List your accomplishments.,
Ask family members and friends to share a favorite memory of you.,
Write down a few of your favorite stories about yourself.,
Incorporate humor.",How to Write Your Own Eulogy2," Based on how you want to be remembered, choose a few words that you could use to describe yourself. For example, you may choose to define yourself as compassionate, generous, and a talented pianist. Answer the question “Who is ?”Start by writing down the first five things you think of when you think about yourself.Group your characteristics into categories to help you condense them into meaningful references in your eulogy.

, Think about your major accomplishments in life and how they fit into the overall picture of yourself that you’re creating in your eulogy. If you want people to remember something that you’ve done, note it so that you can include it; however, it’s unlikely that you’ll have room to include every accomplishment that you’ve made in life.


Prioritize the accomplishments that are the most meaningful to you, such as graduating college, having your children, or writing a book.
If you’re having trouble deciding what to include, go back to your list of life priorities and roles. Choose the accomplishments that reflect what you value most.

, Even though you’re writing your eulogy yourself, that doesn’t mean that you can’t include the ideas of others. Those closest to you often have a different perspective on you and on your memories together. How you impacted their lives will be an important piece of your legacy, so reach out to them for their stories.If you find out that several people share the same favorite memory, then consider including that in your eulogy.
This is a great opportunity to share warm moments with friends and family, remembering good times together.

, After you’ve talked to your family and friends, think about what you remember. You want to include several stories in your eulogy that show who you were as a person, so focus on finding stories that illustrate your defining characteristics and reflect your priorities.Is there a story that all of your friends have heard you tell so many times that they can finish your sentences? Think of the stories about yourself that you tell most often and how you can weave them into your eulogy.
Plan to add some lesser told stories as well.

, Don’t be afraid to make people laugh. While your passing is sad, your life held happy moments that your friends and family can hold on to. Eulogies should remind people of those good times and how much you meant to them, so include stories that will make them smile."
"
Plan for the reading of your eulogy to take 5-10 minutes.,
Choose a tone.,
Create an outline.,
Write your introduction.,
Write the body.,
Write your conclusion.,
Edit your eulogy.",How to Write Your Own Eulogy3," While an obituary is short, a eulogy provides enough time for a well-developed narrative about your life. As you write, remember that you can always trim it down during editing if it gets too long., While it’s normal for a eulogy to have a somber tone, how you want to be remembered will shape the tone you choose for your own eulogy. If you’re fun-loving and lived a full life, then it makes sense to choose a light-hearted tone. If you have always been a serious person, then you may feel that keeping your eulogy serious is the best way to reflect who you are.Consider incorporating more than one tone at different points in the eulogy to capture the feeling of what you’re sharing in a particular story or accomplishment.
Think about who will be delivering your eulogy when choosing your tone. Some people may feel uncomfortable with or unable to convey a particular tone.

, Your eulogy should include an introduction, body, and conclusion. Using the lists and notes you created, fill in your outline with what you’ll include in each part of the speech. The bulk of your information should fit in the body of your eulogy., Provide a brief biography of yourself and establish how you want to be remembered, using your defining characteristics, priorities, and roles. Set the tone of your eulogy, but know that you can shift the tone later if that’s your desire.When you provide your biography, remember your audience, which will likely include those closest to you. They likely know a lot about you already, so focus on filling in the gaps about what they don’t know, such as where you spent your childhood or the nickname that your parents called you when you were growing up.

, The body of your eulogy will contain most of your stories and accomplishments.Plan to incorporate at least 3-4 stories that illustrate who you are.

, Remind the audience of how you want them to remember you, and cap off your eulogy with something that you’d like to stick with them, such as a favorite quote, a lesson you exemplified, or a call to action based on your life., After you finish writing your eulogy, set it aside for a day or two. Then reread it, making any changes that you think it needs. Time it to see how long it takes to read aloud, and make sure that it fits into the 5-10 minute window. When you’re satisfied with your eulogy, pass it on to those who you’ll entrust with it.Consider getting someone to read over your eulogy and help you with editing. If you know who you want to read the eulogy, it's a good idea to have them look it over. That way, they can provide some advice on what to change or ask questions if they aren't sure what something means.

Outline your writing.,
Do some bad writing.,
Start where your passion is.,
Reward yourself for being productive.,
Do some freewriting.",How to Write When You Don't Feel Like Writing1," If you’re having trouble getting yourself to buckle down and write, devote some time to outlining what you intend to put down once you begin. A good outline can make writing significantly easier and may help get you excited about the writing itself.


Jot down the important things you want to address in your writing. This will ensure you cover each of them once you begin while also giving you a chance to regain your enthusiasm for the subject.The outline will make the writing process faster once you begin and help you make sure the elements of your piece are organized appropriately and in an order that supports the flow and tone of your piece.;
, Putting pen to paper or fingers to keyboard can get your creative juices flowing, even if what you’re putting down isn’t your best writing. Give yourself an opportunity to get your ideas on paper, then revise your work until it’s strong writing. Don’t be critical of yourself as your write your first draft. Remove the anxiety that may be ruining your motivation., If you already know how you’d like to conclude the piece, start there. Maybe there’s a portion of the story you know will be fun to write but you haven’t reached it yet; begin writing there. The enthusiasm you feel for that portion of the piece will help your motivation return and allow you to begin writing the other portions once you’re going again.

, Decide on something that would be a good reward for your hard work if you can get through the piece or portion you need to get done today, and don’t allow yourself to take that reward unless you achieve that goal.


Make sure the reward is personal and something you will really enjoy. It needs to be something that will motivate you to push through your lack of motivation.
The reward must be something you can enjoy immediately after you complete your writing. This will help you build a subconscious connection between your efforts and the reward. It’s like tricking your mind into wanting to work.
The reward must be something you wouldn’t normally give yourself otherwise. If you choose a reward you indulge in regularly it won’t serve as a strong motivator. Once you choose a reward, don’t allow yourself to do whatever it is unless as a reward for your writing., Give yourself a few minutes to write about anything you want. Allow it to be totally random and don’t focus on being productive. The point isn’t to create something you can use in your piece, but rather to get your creative juices flowing so you’ll get your motivation to write back.Try using one of these writing prompts to get you started:


Write a letter to your past or future self.
Jot down what you see right outside your window, and go wherever that takes you.
Write a short story about your favorite characters from books, TV or movies.
Take a trip down memory lane and write about the earliest thing you can remember.
Write a short story about where you wish you were right now."
"
Let yourself take a break.,
Do some snacking.,
Take a nap.,
Get moving.,
Get help from your friends.",How to Write When You Don't Feel Like Writing2," Do you just feel burned out? Then give yourself a break. Your brain can grow fatigued like any other muscle, and occasionally you need to give it some time to recover.Allow yourself a few minutes to watch your favorite TV show or to listen to your favorite song. Just make sure you give yourself a deadline to return to your work and stick to it. When you return you’ll feel refreshed and ready to devote your energy to your work.Don't use your break to check e-mail, update social media or read text messages. Research suggests that doing these things during a break can serve to increase stress, the opposite of what you're looking for., Eating something you enjoy will release endorphins in your brain and improve your overall mood. Being hungry can make it very difficult to concentrate or to form coherent arguments. Take a few minutes to eat a snack, but don’t go overboard or you may find yourself napping instead of writing.Being hungry can affect your decision-making skills and alter your mood. You may not be able to do your best writing on an empty stomach.It can be hard to focus on what you're writing about when a part of your brain is more concerned with having something to eat. In fact, when you're hungry you are more likely to identify food related words than you are any other. Unless your essay is about cooking, this might not come in handy., Being sleep deprived can reduce your coordination and reasoning ability in a way that's comparable to drinking alcohol. If you're too tired to keep your eyes open, take a power nap.Limit your nap to under thirty minutes. Studies show that it's the optimal length for a nap during your day to increase productivity.A short nap can provide a 34% increase in performance and 100% increase in alertness.A ten-minute nap may be the best to improve how you feel. Naps lasting over thirty minutes can result in ""sleep inertia"" or a feeling of grogginess., Move away from the computer or notebook for a few minutes and get your blood pumping. Getting a little exercise will improve your mood, increase your alertness, and make you feel good about yourself. It also provides your brain a break from the stress of writing. Go for a walk, dance around the room, or hit the gym. Just make sure you return to your work when you’re done.Getting some exercise can reverse the affects stress has on your brain. The serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine released through physical activity releases tension and makes you feel better.Exercising can release the key chemicals in your brain responsible for your memory, concentration and mental acuity, and the benefit compounds through frequent bouts of physical activity., Give a friend a call and ask if you can bounce some ideas off of them. Sometimes just talking about the subject you’re writing about is enough to create ideas that you won’t be able to wait to get down on paper. Your friend may have some great insights that send you in new directions you had never thought of before; two heads really can be better than one!"

Make an appointment with yourself.,
Establish a routine.,
Develop your writing skills.",How to Write When You Don't Feel Like Writing3," It’s easy to feel too busy to write. You have social, academic and professional obligations that are always jockeying for your time, so you may be tempted to push your writing back in order to address things that seem more pressing at the time.


Set aside times that you are going to write and stick to your commitments.
Treat the appointment with yourself as though it’s an important meeting and don’t allow other obligations to interfere with it., Set aside some space in your house, dorm or office that you use specifically for getting work done and sit in it during the times you set aside for your writing. If you make writing a priority regularly, you will begin to accept it as one and not feel anxious about setting aside time for it. Make it a part of your morning or evening ritual and be consistent with your choices. Using Pavlovian Conditioning, you’ll come to feel like it’s time to get to work when you sit down at your desk.Many of the most successful creators and scientists aided their creative methods with routines. It helps you establish good habits and focus on your work.Incorporate other important elements into your routine, like eating healthy meals and getting exercise.
Some common elements of a successful routine include keeping a clean and organized work space, going for walks, establishing a way to hold yourself accountable for your progress., Producing good quality writing requires a great deal of focus and effort. Develop your brain-muscle by training it like an athlete would train their body.Practice free writing regularly to give your mind and body an opportunity to get used to the writing process as well as to get your ideas down on paper.
Become a natural observer. Focus on the things going on around you and how they relate to the larger world. Becoming conscious of the things that seem trivial in your daily life can help you better appreciate and write detail.Say yes to new experiences. Developing a mental library of experiences to pull from can help make you a stronger writer, and provide you with insights into subjects you may not otherwise have had. That doesn't mean you have to travel the globe; try to train yourself to be a student of the world (and its experiences) around you."

Figure out the format your company wants.,

Stay positive and honest at all times.,
Show, don't tell.",How to Write Your Own Performance Review," Performance reviews can vary depending on the business. Some companies may send out an electronic performance review. Others will have policies that outline very specific categories that they want you to discuss.


Use the format desired by the company, if there is one. Be careful to follow any templates the company provides carefully so you don’t miss anything or look sloppy. Sometimes the company will just ask you to fill out a form. In other cases, you will need to turn in a fully written review.It’s even better if you figure out what your company wants well before the performance review is due. That way, you can keep track of accomplishments that fit the required categories throughout the year. You can also make sure you fine-tune your performance to meet performance review categories., This needs to highlight your best work, so make sure the review is typo and grammar-error free. It’s a good idea to have more than one draft, and to work ahead on it.


Remember that this review will end up part of your permanent employment record, so take it very seriously. If anything ever happens to your employment, and you want to contest it, the performance reviews in the file could be critical.
It’s critical that you use professional language in the review. Be concise also. To be concise, single out a handful of things you did best during the year to discuss more thoroughly. You can keep the performance review on a couple of pages. You do not need to inundate your bosses with too many details about every single thing. Focus on the highlights, while backing them up with some specific evidence. But learn how to self-edit. No one wants to read a 30-page performance review., Before you write the review, you should gather key documents that will make the writing easier. It’s a great idea to collect these throughout the course of the year.You may want to include examples of your work, if the company’s format allows this with the performance review. Choose the samples carefully; they need to highlight your absolute best work. Gather any objectives that were set in the previous review.
Gather any performance notes you took or progress reviews your boss gave you mid-year (if you have such things). Any personal work notes you took during the year might help you with the writing process also. Such year-round journals will help you make your review more specific and meaningful.

, It’s a great idea to get these in writing. What exactly does your company expect of you? If you aren’t clear what these are, ask. It’s very important to link your performance evaluation to the company’s goals for you.


You could deconstruct your job description. Keep in mind that it might be out-of-date and doesn’t include some unstated expectations, though. But it can help you organize your thoughts.
Break down each job responsibility listed and decide how you’ve met it in a practical sense. You have a right to receive clear expectations from your company. If you don't have any, it can be too easy for subjective, unfair criticisms to creep into a review., Don’t be too modest. A performance review is your opportunity to single out those things you did that are most worthy. Tout them. Be proud of them.


Focus the report around the things you did best during the year that had the most impact on the company. You want to choose things you did that most closely matched the company's mission and that were specifically mentioned in your last performance review. You don't need to discuss everything you did during a year.
Do show diplomacy and professionalism in how you highlight your own accomplishments, though. Stay positive, and don’t insult or put down colleagues. Stay focused on the merits of your own work.
Don’t forget to mention the achievements you made early on in the performance period. Sometimes people focus on the things they did toward the end., Anyone can write a report filled with a bunch of platitudes and generalities. If you back up what you say with evidence, it’s more persuasive.


Fill your performance review with facts, figures, and specific dates. For example, let’s say your job is to run social media accounts for a company. It would be a good idea to include metrics with your review (new likes achieved, engagement, things like that.) Figure out what metric you can use to add some credibility to your claims.
Compare your results back to the company’s goals and overall mission. That way, you are demonstrating your value as an employee.

, The review should be very specific when it comes to listing performance goals that you want to accomplish during the next year. You should also talk about developmental goals, which are things you strive to accomplish.


Explain how you will accomplish those goals. Include an assessment of the specific performance goals outlined at the beginning of the review period, and how well you met them.
If you were also asked to do work outside your job description or showed initiative to go above and beyond the call of duty, it’s good to mention that too.

, Most likely, your company has a set of core competencies that it expects you to meet on the job. You should outline those, and discuss them in some depth.


Focus on how you demonstrated the competencies expected specifically and mention how you went above and beyond the expectations.
Using the words of the company’s own competencies is important because it will concretely link your achievements back to the company’s expectations. So speak the company’s lingo.

, Some performance reviews will ask you to rate yourself. You should understand very clearly what the ratings you are choosing mean.


A 5 rating usually means you showed leadership and are a change agent at the company. A 4 rating usually means you exhibited behavior that has exceeded the company’s standards and provided role modeling.
A 3 rating means you have met the behaviors expected (generally). But you should check with your company to make sure how the company defines and perceives each rating score. To some companies, a 3 rating might mean average and not perceived as good enough. A 1 or 2 would be a poor self-review, which is not going to get you very far.

, Sometimes companies will ask for the review in a pre-set order. If they don’t, the way you organize the review can be very important.


Start with a very strong, positive opening statement. This statement should provide the bottom line summary of your year.List your accomplishments next, including the details to back them up. For every accomplishment, ask yourself “so what”? This helps you focus on evidence that shows how your contribution was relevant or valuable. You would never want to start a performance review with a negative.
If there is a goal you didn’t meet or an area you acknowledge you need to improve, don’t put it at the end of the report either. That’s because you want to start with a positive and end with a positive. The ending matters because it’s sometimes what people remember most. Put the things you need to improve in the middle.

, This sounds obvious; after all, you’re being asked to appraise yourself. However, sometimes people make the mistake of going negative and bringing up others.


Don’t use defensive language in the review. Stay as positive as you can. For example, you could write ""I respect others' time and schedule my meetings in accordance with the schedules of my teammates, colleagues, and clients when possible."" The time of the example is positive and presents you in a good light.
And keep other people out of it. Now is not the time to criticize other people's work or personalities.
It’s also not a good idea to compare yourself to other people in the review when highlighting an achievement. You can highlight what you've done without denigrating colleagues who didn't achieve the same thing.

, If a performance review is filled with only over-the-top superlatives, it’s not going to sound very realistic. However, acknowledging mistakes should be done very cautiously.


You want to write the criticism sections so that they give the sense you are actively working on the issue. For example, you might write, ""Because I am intensely focused on the my assigned tasks, and a perfectionist when performing them at times, I can sometimes be perceived as blunt toward some of my colleagues. I am working on the way I communicate in such circumstances."" This statement gives a positive sense of the writer (being a perfectionist with intense focus can also be a good thing on the job) in addition to acknowledging a weakness.
Identify some areas where you need to improve. However, don’t fill the entire review with them. Make the review mostly about your accomplishments, while providing a couple acknowledgements of places you are working to improve or develop. However, do not be overly critical of yourself for too long or you will sound like you lack confidence.One good way to do this is to focus on the positive by introducing a suggestion for the improvement. Always stay positive and action-oriented. Use developmental language. Instead of saying you failed at something, say that this is an area you want to work on, and explain how you plan to do so., If you are seeking more training or to be included in meetings, a performance review is a place where you can outline these things. However, don’t use a performance review to negotiate compensation.


You could also present any thoughts you have for innovative projects that will help the company. Find out how your boss will use the performance review. Determine whether it will be shared with others, whether it will be used to give out bonuses, and so forth.

, Sometimes people dump their notes into a performance review, and it can sound very sloppy. You don’t want your review to sound like your abridged notes.


For example, don’t use a phrase like “content revisions” that is too short. It’s better to use a complete sentence in which you elaborate on the point. You could use bullets to organize information.
Keep in mind that your direct supervisor might not be the only person who will read the performance review. It might go up the chain to even higher level managers, so it needs to explain information in a clear and detailed manner, rather than assuming that everyone knows what you did or mean., Even when you’re mentioning an area needing improvement, you can spin it into the future. Focus on the future, not any failures of the past.


You don’t want to sound negative, carping, angry, or arrogant. You want to stay positive, sound like a team player, and highlight your accomplishments with dignified tone.
If there’s something you don’t like about the company, this is not really the place to unload. This is your chance to highlight why you are needed by the company.

, It's very important that you provide specifics when you write a performance review. Don't just provide general statements.


For example, rather than saying, ""I can always be depended upon to perform my job. My punctuality daily and at meetings and attendance is good,"" you could provide exact attendance figures and give specific examples that demonstrate your dependability.
Backing up general statements with evidence (including numbers) will make your review more meaningful and credible.

Proofread.",How to Write an Article Review," An article review is written for an audience who is knowledgeable in the subject matter instead of a general audience.When writing an article review, you will summarize the main ideas, arguments, positions, and findings, and then critique the article's contributions to the field and overall effectiveness.


Article reviews present more than just an opinion. You will engage with the text to create a response to the scholarly writer's ideas. You will respond to and use ideas, theories, and research from your own studies. Your critique of the article will be based on proof and your own thoughtful reasoning.
An article review only responds to the author's research. It does not provide any new research.An article review both summarizes and evaluates the article.;
, Before you even begin reading the article you will review, you need to understand how your article review will be set up. This will help you understand how to read the article so that you can write an effective review. Your review will be set up in the following parts:


Summarize the article. Focus on the important points, claims, and information.
Discuss the positive aspects of the article. Think about what the author does well, good points she makes, and insightful observations.
Identify contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies in the text.Determine if there is enough data or research included to support the author's claims. Find any unanswered questions left in the article.

, Begin by looking at the title, abstract, introduction, headings, opening sentences of each paragraph, and the conclusion. Then read the first few paragraphs, followed by the conclusion.These steps should help you start to identify the author's arguments and main points. Then read the article in its entirety. When you read the first time, just read for the big picture – that is, look for the overall argument and point the article is making.


Make note of words or issues you don't understand and questions you have.
Look up terms or concepts you are unfamiliar with so you can fully understand the article.

, Read the article a second and third time. Use a highlighter or pen to make notes or highlight important sections. Highlight the main points and the supporting facts.Don't: highlight every paragraph — just the central points.Do: supplement the most important points with notes or cross-references.


Connect what you read in the article to your existing knowledge of the topic. Think about things you have discussed in class or other articles you have read. Does the article agree or disagree with your previous knowledge? Does it build on other knowledge from the field? Determine how the article you are reviewing is similar and different from other texts you've read on the subject.
Pay careful attention to the meaning of the article. Make sure you fully understand the article. The only way to write a good article review is to understand the article.

, You can do this as a freewritten paragraph or as an outline. Start by putting the article in your own words. Focus on the argument, research, and claims the article makes. Make sure to include all the important points. It is pivotal that you are accurate.

Don't: spend time on editing or phrasing. This is just for your own benefit.Do: write in a clear, logical structure to test your understanding.


With either method, make an outline of the main points made in the article and the supporting research or arguments. It is strictly a restatement of the main points of the article and does not include your opinions.
After putting the article in your own words, decide which parts of the article you want to discuss in your review. You can focus on the theoretical approach, the content, the presentation or interpretation of evidence, or the style. You will always discuss the main issues of the article, but you can sometimes also focus on certain aspects. This comes in handy if you want to focus the review towards the content of a course.Review the summary outline to eliminate unnecessary items. Erase or cross out the less important arguments or supplemental information.

, Review each item in the article summary to determine whether the author was accurate and clear. Write down all instances of effective writing, new contributions to the field, as well as areas of the article that need improvement. Create a list of strengths and weaknesses. The strength of the article may be that it presents a clear summation of a particular issue. Its weakness may be that it does not offer any new information or solutions. Use specific examples and references. For example, the article might have incorrectly reported the facts of a popular study. Jot down this observation in your outline and look up the facts of the study to confirm your observation. Think about the following questions to help you critique and engage with the article:


What does the article set out to do?
What is the theoretical framework or assumptions?
Are the central concepts clearly defined?
How adequate is the evidence?
How does the article fit into the literature and field?
Does it advance the knowledge of the subject?
How clear is the author's writing?Don't: include superficial opinions or your personal reaction.Do: pay attention to your own biases, so you can overcome them.


, This title should reflect the focus of your review. Decide between a declarative title, descriptive title, or interrogative title., Under the title, place a complete citation of the article in the proper style.Go to the next line to begin your essay. Don't skip a line between the citation and first sentence.


For example, in MLA, a citation may look like: Duvall, John N. ""The (Super)Marketplace of Images: Television as Unmediated Mediation in DeLillo's White Noise."" Arizona Quarterly 50.3 (1994): 127-53. Print.

, Start your review by referring to the title and author of the article, the title of the journal, and the year of publication in the first paragraph.


For example: The article, ""Condom use will increase the spread of AIDS,"" was written by Anthony Zimmerman, a Catholic priest.

, The introduction of the article review will have the identification sentence. It will also mention the central themes of the article and the arguments and claims of the author. You also need to state the author's thesis. Sometimes, the thesis has multiple points. The thesis may not be clearly stated in the article, so you may have to determine the thesis yourself.Don't: make statements in the first person (""I"").Do: give an overall impression of the article using the third person and a formal, academic style.


Your introduction should only be 10-25% of your review.End the introduction with your thesis. Your thesis should address the above issues. For example: Although the author has some good points, his article is biased and contains some misinterpretation of data from others’ analysis of the effectiveness of the condom., Express the main points, arguments, and findings of the article in your own words, referring to your summary for assistance. Show how the article supports its claims. Make sure to include the article's conclusions. This may be done in several paragraphs, although the length will depend on requirements established by your instructor or publisher.

Don't: cover specific examples, statistics, or background information familiar to experts in the field.Do: capture the main points of each section, as space allows.


Use direct quotes from the author sparingly.
Review the summary you have written. Read over your summary several times to ensure that your words are an accurate description of the author's article.

, Use your outline of opinions to write several paragraphs explaining how well the author addressed the topic. Express your opinion about whether the article was a clear, thorough, and useful explanation of the subject. This is the core of your article review. Evaluate the article's contribution to the field and the importance to the field.Evaluate the main points and arguments in the article. Decide if the author's points help her argument. Identify any biases. Decide if you agree with the writer, then provide sufficient support as to why or why not. End by suggesting which audiences would benefit from reading the article.

Don't: fill your review with a long list of unrelated critiques.Do: tie your grievances and praise together into a coherent argument, forming your own thesis.


Support your critique with evidence from the article or other texts.
The summary portion is very important for your critique. You must make the author's argument clear in the summary section for your evaluation to make sense.Remember, this is not where you say if you liked the article or not. You are assessing the significance and relevance of the article.Use a topic sentence and supportive arguments for each opinion. For example, you might address a particular strength in the first sentence of the opinion section, followed by several sentences elaborating on the significance of the point.

, In a paragraph, summarize the main points of the article, as well as your opinions about its significance, accuracy, and clarity. If relevant, also comment on implications for further research or discussion in the field.


This should only be about 10% of your overall essay.
For example: This critical review has evaluated the article ""Condom use will increase the spread of AIDS"" by Anthony Zimmerman. The arguments in the article show the presence of bias, prejudice, argumentative writing without supporting details, and misinformation. These points weaken the author’s arguments and reduce his credibility., Reread the review. Look for grammar, mechanics, and usage mistakes. Make sure to cut any extra, unneeded information.


Make sure you have identified and discussed the 3-4 key issues in the article."

Understand the purpose of your author assessment.,
Read the piece you are being asked to assess.,
Take notes on your first impressions, once you have finished reading it once.,
Return to the work and read it a second time.",How to Write an Author Assessment1," Your assessment should never try to change the author's style toward your own style. However, you may have different goals based on the reason you are assessing the author.


If you are being asked by an unpublished writer to critique their work, you must focus on giving positive critiques as well as identifying areas that need work. If the assessment is being done in a teaching capacity, make the assessment a careful critique that encourages the writer to take a certain direction in their next draft.
If you are assessing an author and their work for a publishing company or other professional pursuit, you must focus on what is marketable about the work. Audience and initial reactions may have more importance in your assessment.
If you are editing the work for publication, then you may be able to be more critical based on your publications standards. Request a written copy of the style sheet before beginning your assessment.
If you are assessing the validity of a source or fact checking, you should pay extra attention to details that are inconsistent and make the author unreliable. Follow up your assessment with facts that need to be proven before using or publishing the work.;
, This time, you will want to read it all the way through as you would with any published work, so that you are looking at it as a whole work, rather than its pieces.

, Try to write down what you think the thesis or deeper meaning is, as well as any poignant or flat areas. This will help the author to see if you have understood what they were trying to accomplish, or not.

, This time, you should read more slowly and thoughtfully, looking at each sentence and paragraph individually. Take notes on the following items:


Grammar mistakes. If the author has made a number of spelling and grammatical errors, they should be noted and corrected for the author's benefit.
Continuity. Look for contradictions in the plot and in the characters. Decide if there are any areas where the author needs to edit further to ensure the story or thesis is consistent. If this assessment is being done of an already published source, these details may be a sign of errors in research or a lack of fact-checking.
Overuse. Many authors lose the ability to see if the words and concepts are used too often. Mark any instances where nouns, verbs and phrases are used in a way that distracts the reader from the story or argument.
Look for biases in the writing. If you are critiquing a journal or persuasive piece, you should look out for places where other arguments are ignored, or the writing is not well-rounded. Persuasive essays should handle objections near the end, if not before.

Decide how you will format your critique.,
Ensure you do a thorough critique.,

If you are writing an author assessment for school or work, find out if there is a form you should use. Some companies have a form that has questions that need to be answered for all considered work.
Use Microsoft word or Adobe Acrobat to attach comments in a digital format. Click on the ""Tools"" menu and scroll to ""Track Changes."" Highlight the areas you are referring to and write comments about your suggested changes.
Write a separate document on a word processor or by hand that addresses the work from your initial reactions, to positive encouragement and then to suggested changes.

, Include the following items in your author assessment.


Include your initial reactions and what you learned in the introductory paragraph. Offer your opinions about what the scope of the work is. This paragraph should explain the work to someone who has not read it.
Add a paragraph about what the author has done well. Include examples or references to pages, if possible.
Address grammatical errors on the copy of the work itself. These are given for editing purposes and do not need to be explained in prose.
Outline your constructive criticism about the work. Include comments about the plot, structure, scope and specific sentences or points. Include concrete examples, but do not rewrite sentences themselves, unless you are an editor.
Include a section about why you think this work would be marketable and who would enjoy it. If you are doing a book review or a manuscript assessment, this is essential to advise future readers.

, Remove any sections that try to change the voice or writing style of the author. Add any further helpful comments and proof for spelling and grammar errors.

, The selection of genre will influence the type of story you tell and the amount of attention you give to characters, prose, and setting, respectively.Literary fiction. Authors of literary fiction are seeking first and foremost to create a work of art. Multi-dimensional characters and the quality of prose are of primary importance, with plot sometimes a secondary consideration. Richard Russo’s Empire Falls or The Gold Finch by Donna Tartt are excellent examples of literary fiction with sparkling prose and complex characters.
Genre fiction. While genre fiction can achieve the status of art, books in these genres are generally seen as more commercial. It is divided into many categories to help readers find the sort of books they like to read.


Mysteries – Books about a crime, usually a murder. While a well-plotted mystery is important, it is often the characters that really make a mystery memorable. Think Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, or Mma Precious Ramotswe from The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency.

Thrillers – Books designed to make the reader’s pulse race and to keep him or her turning pages. Lee Child’s Jack Reacher books are a good example. Like mysteries, they are plot and character driven. They often feature a race against time, as in Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code.

Romance – Books about love and romance, usually following two characters and the obstacles that keep them apart. The most successful romance writers, like Nicholas Sparks and Nora Roberts, combine interesting characters with richly detailed settings that draw the reader in.

Fantasy – Books about imaginary worlds, usually involving magic. Setting is of primary importance. The goal, as in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings or George R.R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire series, is to create a richly detailed world that readers want to return to again and again.

Science Fiction – Books that imagine alternate realities or worlds based on science as opposed to magic. As with fantasy, setting is key. Books like Frank Herbert’s Dune or Isaac Asimov’s Foundation create richly imagined worlds, complete with their own climate, politics, religion, food, and technology.

Historical – Books that are set in the past, combining elements of fiction with accurate details of the time period. They tend to emphasize plot and setting. The best historical fiction – like Robert Graves’ I, Claudius or Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall – recreates the past so convincingly, the reader forgets they are reading fiction.

Horror – Books that create a feeling of terror or dread in the reader, often incorporating supernatural elements. These books emphasize plot and tone. Stephen King’s books are the gold standard.

Young Adult – Books that are for and about teenagers and pre-teens (12-18 years old). They are usually combined with another genre, often romance or fantasy. This field has grown rapidly of late, with series like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games transcending the genre to become bestsellers.



, The more familiar you are with a genre, the easier it will be for you to conform to (or strategically break) the rules that define it.

, Coming up with a good idea is a process, not an event. There is rarely an “ah-ha” moment. The best way to develop an idea is to start somewhere – a place, character, even a great title – and start writing. What makes and idea good is putting in the time necessary to develop the characters, plot, and setting.J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is a good example of a wonderful idea that was built over time, rather than conceived all at once. The basic idea – an eleven year old boy is invited to attend a magical school for wizards, where he must confront the evil that killed his parents – is fine, but there is nothing great about it. What makes the book work is the details that grew from that idea: Hogwarts with its talking pictures and moving staircases; owls delivering mail; Quidditch; Bertie Bott’s every flavor beans… One could go on and on.

, What-if statements are great story generators. What if the capitol was bombed during the State of the Union Address? What if you learned you were adopted? What if the young couple living next door were actually Russian spies? Start by creating a long list of what-ifs, then flesh out the ones with the most promise.

, If you are writing literary fiction, you might want to start with your central character. What does he or she do? What is his or her personality? What is the conflict they are facing? If you are doing fantasy or sci-fi, think about the world you want to create. If you are doing an historical work, think about the period, event, or character you want to build your story around. If you are writing a mystery, think about the crime.

, Stories like Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park started as a piece of news. Human struggle, invention, and quirky characters abound in the real world. The news is one good place to find them.

, That vacant lot you pass every day on the way to work might be the start of a story. What if you found a suitcase full of cash there? Or think up a story to explain why the couple at the next table is sitting in stony silence.

, Perhaps you have traveled somewhere that you think would be a great setting for a story, or met someone who would make an interesting character. Maybe you do an interesting job. Or perhaps you have been through a powerful experience – war, cancer, a break up – that could provide the basis for a story.

, Take a small, relatively unimportant scene from a favorite film or novel, and then imagine it as the opening scene to your story. Be sure to change the characters; the goal is to give you a starting point, not to plagiarize., Take the plot summary of a story you know and change it one bit at a time until you have your own story idea to flesh out.Try Casablanca. Here’s the summary from imbd.com: “Set in unoccupied Africa during the early days of World War II: An American expatriate meets a former lover, with unforeseen complications.” What if you changed the setting to Saigon during the early years of the Vietnam war? What if you made the lead character a woman? And she had ties to the Viet Cong, instead of the French Resistance?

, Maybe you have a best friend from grade school, high school or college you haven’t spoken to in years. Or a worst enemy. Imagine the life they have led since., There are dozens of lists out there on sites like Writer’s Digest or Creative Writing Now. Remember: it doesn’t matter where you start; what matters is where you take the idea.

, That way if you get any ideas, you have a fast and easy to way to jot them all down before you forget.

, Even if you are writing fantasy (especially then!), you will need to do research before you start writing.

, If you are writing an historical novel using real characters, then you will need to research their lives. The more famous the character, the more research you will need to do. But even if your characters are fictional, you’ll still need to do creative research.


Give your characters a personality. Pick their virtues and flaws. Are they funny? Easily angered? Smart? Sly? A compulsive gambler? What are their mannerisms? Remember, the most interesting characters are rounded – not 100% good or bad.Think of Sherlock Holmes – brilliant, but also an egotistical drug addict. Or Elizabeth Bennet from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice – smart, independent minded, and funny, but also proud and condescending.
Work on your character’s appearance. You’ll need to know their body type, eye color, skin and hair color, the shape of their face, and if they have any distinguishing birthmarks or scars. Don’t forget less obvious features, too, like long, delicate fingers or impossibly skinny legs with knobby knees. Remember, it is often effective to create a character who’s appearance belies their personality.Hilary Mantel is a master of character description. Take her Cardinal Wolsey from Wolf Hall: “The cardinal, at fifty-five, is still as handsome as he was in his prime. Tonight, he is dressed not in his everyday scarlet, but in blackish purple and fine white lace: like a humble bishop. His height impresses; his belly, which in justice should belong to a more sedentary man, is merely another princely aspect of his being, and on it, confidingly, he often rests a large, white, beringed hand. A large head—surely designed by God to support the papal tiara—is carried superbly on broad shoulders: shoulders upon which rest (though not at this moment) the great chain of Lord Chancellor of England.”
Pick a name. You can pick any name you want, but if you are writing historical fiction, you may want to check the Medieval Names Archive (which also covers pre-medieval names) to make sure your names are historically accurate.
Flesh out your characters. Think of their hobbies, profession, background, and upraising. How do they relate to their friends? Their family? Do they like their job? What kind of clothes do they wear? How do they talk? Are they clumsy or graceful?Remember that character development is an ongoing process. You’ll want to research your characters before you start writing, but they probably won’t really come to life until you are well into your story.

, If you have a place in mind, use it. If not, you’ll need to pick a place that is appropriate to the story you are trying to tell. If your setting is fictional, that means even more work.You’ll have to create an interesting, believable world. One good way to do so is to borrow details from real world settings. George R.R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire does this masterfully, combining elements of medieval Nordic and English culture, with bits from Mongolia, China, Spain, and beyond.


Where do you see your story? A city or town? Urban or rural? Arctic or tropical? Is it embedded in a particular culture, like feudal Japan or revolutionary France? Don’t just set your book anywhere; make the setting a vital part of the novel.Research places that fit that description.
Fill in the details. Once you know where your story will be set, you’ll want to know things like the location's history, its climate, the style of architecture, and the local culture and religion. Do enough work up front to get started, but don’t overdo it. You can look up more details as needed while you write.A rich setting can serve almost as another character, as in Graham Swift’s atmospheric novel Waterland: “We lived in a lock-keeper’s cottage by the River Leem, which flows out of Norfolk into the Great Ouse. And no one needs telling that the land in that part of the world is flat. Flat, with an unrelieved and monotonous flatness, enough of itself, some might say, to drive a man to unquiet and sleep-defeating thoughts. From the raised banks of the Leem, it stretched away to the horizon, its uniform color, peat-black, varied only by the crops that grew upon it – grey-green potato leaves, blue-green beet leaves, yellow-green wheat; its uniform levelness broken only by the furrowed and dead-straight lines of ditches and drains, which, depending on the state of the sky and the angle of the sun, ran like silver, copper or golden wires across the fields, and which, when you stood and looked at them, made you shut one eye and fall prey to fruitless meditations on the laws of perspective.”

, Set aside time – preferably in at least two hour chunks – when you will write. Stick to your schedule. This is the easiest way to ensure you finish your project.


Don’t worry about daily or weekly page or word quotas. Failing to meet you quota can leave you upset and not wanting to write.
Remember: some days you will write a lot; others you will write very little. In both cases, you are doing work. Just put in the time, and you’ll get there!

, An extremely detailed outline can make writing easier, but some writers feel it limits their creativity. Here are a few types of outline:


A synopsis – A good synopsis covers the major plot points of a novel without going into too much detail regarding the setting, characters or dialogue.Writing a synopsis is good practice for novelists and screenwriters alike, as synopses are often used to pitch new book or movie ideas to editors and producers.
Chapter by chapter or scene by scene – Write one or two sentences for each chapter or scene in the book or screenplay you are writing. This can be particularly helpful in keeping your story from becoming too long.
A collection of scenes – Write out the key scenes in your story: pivotal plot points or character developments. When it comes time to write the story, you can use these key scenes as guideposts, writing from one to the next., The goal of the first draft is to finish. You’re just trying to get the basic plot in place and find your character’s voices. It does not need to be perfect., Every writer gets stuck from time to time. Maybe you can’t find a way to move a scene forward, or feel like your writing is poor that day. Waiting for inspiration is not the answer. Here are some effective ways to overcome writer’s block:


Take a short break. Take a walk, grab some coffee, or read. A few minutes thinking about something else can really help.
Switch between computer and pen and paper. Sometimes changing the medium you are writing in will help get you started.
Write in outline form, focusing only on blocking and dialogue. Not worrying about your prose will leave you free to concentrate on character and plot. You can then flesh out the prose later.Freewrite. Sit down and write everything you can think of about your story and character. Even if you don’t fix the scene you are currently working on, you will be doing useful work.Write what you are excited about. If you are stuck, simply move on. Pick another part of the story that excites you and start there., It is hard to nail down your plot, character development, overarching themes, and prose all at the same time. Trying to do too much is a key source of writer’s block. Take it easy on yourself and try writing at least three drafts, preferably four.Draft 1 – Focus on getting to “The End”. Plot should be your major concern. Don’t waste time trying to perfect everything; instead, make a list of changes you want to make for draft 2.
Draft 2 – Apply your list of changes and nail down the plot. This is a good time to make a reverse outline: working off your first draft, write a sentence or two for each scene or chapter. It will help you identify slow points, dead weight, or problems in overall structure.Draft 3 – Focus on your characters and overarching themes. It takes time to find your characters; voice. Now is the time to make certain that voice is consistent.
Draft 4 – Polish your prose. There is no sense dong this in the early drafts, because you will end up cutting much of what you write. So save the polishing until you are satisfied with your plot and characters. And don’t forget these four key editing tips:Make sure your descriptions are vibrant (“she had emerald eyes and smooth, golden skin the color of the desert sands,” not “she was beautiful”).
Show, don’t tell (“his jaw clinched,” not “he was angry).
Be wary of adverbs; they are rarely necessary (“she sauntered” instead of “she walked slowly).
Avoid clichés.



, You can seek feedback in a number of ways: friends and family, automated critique software, posting the manuscript on a fiction website or a critique website, joining a writing group, or doing a writing course..

Chances are, you should throw out your first idea, because if it's what you thought of first, it's probably what everyone else thought of first too. Try to think of something that would seem different and original to judges.
Write it at the top of your paper, if it's not already written there. This will keep it in your mind while you think.;
, Sit for a few minutes-but not too long-and think of what to write about. Once you have a general plot worked out, think of details and dialogue to go along with it.


Just because everyone else starts writing immediately doesn't mean you have to. You have a good amount of time to finish and the time you lose thinking of an original plot will probably be made up for in points that others didn't get for stale narratives.

, Writing a short story is like writing a regular story, just quicker. A good narrative should have an introduction, dialogue, rising action, climax, and resolution-just like your favorite book.


Pay attention to the time. A good rule of thumb is that you should be about the the rising action or climax by the time half your limit is up. If not, you should probably write faster.
If you get done early, don't just sit there. Reread your narrative and double check your spelling and punctuation. If you come across an adjective that could be a bit more descriptive, then neatly replace it.

Consider e-publication.",How to Write Your First Book," Writing a book is a significant undertaking that will require a lot of time and energy. Choosing a subject you know and care about will help propel you through the daunting process. Explore your passions and interests when choosing a topic and make sure you have something important to express on the matter.Choose a genre that you love to read and have explored in depth, whether it’s horror, romance, or political intrigue.
If you’re writing non-fiction, make sure that you have a level of expertise and credibility on the subject.;
, You should read other similar books within your genre both before and during your writing process. Read these books with a critical perspective, noting which aspects of the author’s style you like and which you would do differently. Doing this will keep you connected to the reader’s perspective throughout your writing. It will also keep you aware of what has already been said on the subject so you can produce an original work of your own., The plot of your book will likely change as you go through the writing process. Still, it’s good to begin with a rough outline of the major events and points of interest you wish to emphasize. Focus on how your content can be organized to best achieve your book’s purpose, whether it’s to entertain, inform, or titillate your reader. You can take note of valuable plot sub-points, methods of describing imagery, or how the dialogue is developed.Don’t focus too heavily on chronology or dividing the content into chapters with your initial outline. You can consider these aspects before writing but a general plot outline should come first.For non-fiction books, outline the core concepts you are trying to express in the book and fit specific examples and plot devices underneath them as subpoints.

, If you are writing a fiction novel, your characters will be critical to conveying the story. Start by outlining their function in the story, whether they are protagonists, antagonists, neutral, supporting, or ancillary to the main plot. Then develop more specific characteristics pertaining to their function in the story like their personalities.Developing backstories for your characters, even if those stories don’t factor into the actual content of the book, will help you conceptualize how they might react to plot points or interact with each other.
Try to make your characters realistic so they will be relatable, even if your book does not take place in a realistic setting. If you do have a mythical-type setting, like a world with dragons, try to consider how real people would react in that environment., Writing a book will take time, especially when it’s your first. Don’t expect to complete it all in a few sittings or to consistently churn out a large quantity of pages each time you write. Set aside a regular amount of time to work on your book on a daily or weekly basis so you stay on track.If you feel like you’re on a roll and churning out a lot of material at a given time, try to make the most of it and write as much as you possibly can.
Try to set up a specific place to do your writing that is free from distractions including other work.
Set a daily or weekly goal. You could start with 300 words per day or one chapter per week.
Take a notepad with you wherever you go. If you are engrossed in the writing process, it’s likely that new ideas will come to you at random and unexpected times and you’ll want to jot them down.

, Try to imagine that you’re speaking with your reader and seeing their reaction. Focus on making your writing understandable and interesting from their perspective and keep this in mind throughout the writing process.It’s important to express your writing in your own unique voice. Your readers should feel like they know you personally after reading it., It may be tempting to describe characters, scenes, and events with excessively flowery language and ancillary details. With everything you describe in your writing, ask yourself how it furthers the reader’s understanding of the content and what information you’re trying to convey.Be especially careful to avoid using flowery descriptions as filler material to add more pages. If you’re finding yourself short on content, go back to your outline and see if you can develop the plot more instead.

, Ask someone you trust to review your writing as often as possible. You shouldn’t feel as if you need to wait until you’re completely done with the book to get feedback but you should show them a completed chapter or section rather than just a few pages.Try to find several readers who might have diverse perspectives. For example, find another person who often reads books in your genre and one who does not so you can get a comprehensive idea of how the book is experienced by readers.

, Finding a publisher can take a long time, especially when you’re a novice writer. If you’re determined to get your book published, you’ll want to research what companies might be open to publishing a novice author in your particular genre.Send proposal letters to publishers outlining your idea. You can include a chapter or a few pages with this as a sample.

, When you apply for publication, you’ll need more than simply a finished book. Publishers are interested in how your book can make money for them and thus will want to understand who would buy it and how it would be marketed.


The structure of a publishing marketing plan will vary significantly based on the kind of book you’re writing but you should start by researching what other publishing marketing proposals look like online.

Creating a social media page and supporting graphic material is a great way to demonstrate your marketing strategy in your proposal and create some buzz around the publication before you make your proposal., Websites like Amazon, Lulu, CreateSpace, and BookSurge offer e-publication options, some of which are free of charge. E-publication is ideal for first time authors because it will involve minimal overhead and marketing.E-publication will require special formatting of your manuscript. The formatting standards will depend on which platform you use so make sure you look for those requirements.
Note that e-publication usually reaches a smaller audience, achieves lower sales, and will not afford your book the prestige of print publication. You also won’t have a publishing company to market your book.

Study tap vocabulary.,
Find a dance journal and stick to it.,
Know the formula.,
Do the combination while you write it down.,
Practice.",How to Write Tap Steps," There are so many different words for every step in tap. If you only know shuffle and flap, it will be very tricky to put steps into words for the paper.;
, Writing down dances on various sheets of copy paper rarely comes in handy when you're trying to remember something. Find a journal or binder to organize combinations and dances in and stick with it.

, The universal code in tap writing is that steps done on the left foot are in all caps, and steps done on the right foot are lowercase. So if you were to write down a buffalo going to the right, you would write ""step SHUFFLE JUMP toe.""

, If you just try to write down a dance while sitting, chances are you'll forget a part or get something wrong. Write the combination while it's fresh on your mind, and write it while dancing it.

, Even if you know all the tricks, sometimes, it just takes practice to get familiar with writing down your dances.

Start with an abstract.,
Write an introduction.,
Decide what your expected results should be.,
Formulate your hypothesis correctly.,
Designate a section in your report for explaining your research design.,
Describe all the materials needed to conduct the experiment.,
Describe the exact procedure you used.,
Designate a section of your report for your results.,
Include a discussion section.,
Write a conclusion.,
Make sure you have citations.",How to Write up a Science Experiment," The abstract is a very short summary of the paper, usually no more than 200 words. This will allow the reader to see in short form what the results of the experiment were and its significance. The purpose of this short summary is to provide the reader with enough information on the experiment, so they can see if they want or need to read the entire report.
One of the first things researchers do is to do a quick search of similar research projects. Abstracts make it possible to determine which reports or articles are relevant.
The structure of an abstract very closely follows the structure of the report itself.
Devote a sentence to describing the purpose of the project and its significance.
Then very briefly describe the materials and methods used.
Follow up with a one to two sentence description of the results of the experiment.;
, This should outline what the experiment is, why it was done, and why it is important. The introduction of a lab report or scientific paper is to provide the reader with two key pieces of information: what is the question the experiment is supposed to answer and why is answering this question important.This usually begins with short outline or review of literature or other experiments that are related to the subject. You should outline or summarize the theoretical background to the issue as well.
You should also include a statement about the problem or question that this research has raised.
Summarize the project briefly and discuss how it addresses the problem or question.
Briefly explain what your experiment is and how you are going to conduct it, but save the details of this for the materials and methods or analysis section of your paper.
You should also explain what you expect the results of the experiment to be in this section.

, This is an educated and well articulated explanation of expected results of your research known as a hypothesis. Your hypothesis should go into your introduction, near the end.
A research hypothesis should be a brief statement that pares down your problem that you described in your introduction into something that is testable and falsifiable.
Scientists must create a hypothesis from which an experiment can reasonably be designed and carried out.
A hypothesis is never proved in an experiment, only ""verified"" or ""supported"".

, You should start with a general statement about your expected results and build upon it to make it testable. For example ""Fertilizer affects how tall a plant will grow"".
Then expand upon the idea to give it more directionality. For example ""Plants grow faster and taller when they are given fertilizer"".
Finally, add enough detail to explain your ideas and make your hypothesis testable. ""Plants which are given a solution with 1ml of fertilizer grow faster than plants without fertilizer because they are given more nutrients.""

, Sometimes this is titled ""Procedure"" or ""Materials and Methods"". The purpose of this section is to provide your reader with exactly how you conducted your experiment.
You should detail all of the materials used and the exact procedure used during the experiment.
The goal here is to make your procedure clear and followable. Someone should be able to repeat your experiment exactly from reading this section.
This section is an extremely crucial documentation of your methods of analysis.

, This can simply be a list or a few paragraphs of description. Describe any lab equipment used such as the size, brand, and type.
Explain what you used as your research material.
For example, if you were testing how fertilizer affected plant growth, you would want to state what brand of fertilizer you used, what species of plant you used and brand of seed.
If is often helpful to include a diagram of how these materials were set up.
Make sure you include the quantity of all objects used in the experiment.

, Write this in terms of detailed steps. Remember all experiments involve controls and variables. Describe these here.
Write down, step by step, a set of detailed instructions on how you did the experiment.
Include descriptions of all measurements made and how/when they were recorded.
Describe any steps you took to reduce experimental uncertainty. This could be the use of extra controls or restrictions, or precautions.
If you used a published laboratory method, be sure to provide a reference for the original method.
Remember the goal of this section is so the reader can repeat exactly what you did in your experiment. No detail should be left out.

, This will be the bulk of your report. In this section you should describe the results of both qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis.
Quantitative data is anything that expressed in terms numerical forms such as percentages or statistics. Qualitative data is derived from broad question and is expressed in the form of word responses from study participants.
Include any statistical tests and their results in this section.
Make sure data is both graphed or diagrammed as well as described. All graphs and diagrams should have a number and title.
For example, if if you are testing the effect of fertilizer on plant growth you would want a graph showing the average growth of plants given fertilizer vs. those without.
You would also want to describe the result. For example ""Plants which were given a concentration of 1ml of fertilizer grew an average of 4 cm taller than those that were not given fertilizer.""
As you go along, narrate your results. Tell the reader why a result is significant to the experiment or problem. This will allow the reader to follow your thinking process.
Compare your results to your original hypothesis. State whether or not your hypothesis was supported or not by your experiment.

, This is where you discuss the meanings of your results in depth. Address whether or not your expectations were met in the experiment.
In this section, the author can address other questions such as: ""why did we get an unexpected result?"" or ""what would happen if one aspect of the procedure was altered?"".
You can also address why your results did not verify your hypothesis.
This section can also serve for the author to present or compare their results to those of other studies or to suggest further avenues of research into the problem addressed in the experiment.

, This summarizes the experiment and what your results told you about the problem the experiment addressed. Explain what the experiment told you.
Summarize the problem the experiment addressed and the researched questions which framed the analysis.
Briefly describe any pitfalls or challenges that occurred during the process and suggestions for further research.
Be sure to link back to the introduction and whether or not the experiment addressed the goals of your analysis.

, If you have referenced any research or ideas other than your own, make sure they are properly referenced.


You can do this in text with a mention of year and author in parentheses.
Include full bibliographic reference in a works cited section at the end of the document.
You can use software such as EndNote to help you cite and build a properly referenced bibliography.

Start thinking about what you would like to write about.,
Begin planning and research.,
Structure your dissertation.,
Edit for content and style.,
Provide your references.",How to Write the Perfect Dissertation," Consult as soon as possible with your supervisor for advice on the expected scope of your dissertation. Remember that you will not simply be writing about “IT in Primary Education”, but instead will be focusing on specific aspects, perhaps trying to solve a problem, querying currently held beliefs, or arguing a particular case or “thesis”. Your final title may instead be something like: A computer for every pupil? A critical analysis of the over-reliance on Information Technology in current UK primary education. This title will therefore probably need to be refined over the weeks before you agree the final version with your supervisor.;
, Your dissertation is a major commitment and will be a long way to deciding your final award. It is obviously very important, therefore, to plan meticulously. Work out a timetable and stick to it. You really have no excuse to leave things to the last minute. There will always be problems: difficulties in obtaining books or materials; delays in receiving replies to letters or questionnaires; temperamental printers and floppy disks; mysterious dissertation-eating dogs. You must allow for these, however: none is an excuse for not handing in your work on time. In consultation with your supervisor, draw up an initial reading list, making sure that this is wide-ranging, relevant and as up-to-date as possible. Approach this reading with specific questions in mind; if not, you will waste a lot of valuable time reading irrelevant information. If you’re going to include some sort of survey or questionnaire, make this as wide as possible, but remember that companies and organizations are swamped with this sort of thing and the response rate will probably be very disappointing. Most of your writing will probably need redrafting several times, and you must carefully proofread everything you write, or perhaps get someone else to do this for you. Any revisions needed, will of course take time, as will the binding of your finished dissertation, if this is necessary.

, As stated, you must check with your supervisor and with course literature what the required structure is, as there are many variations. A basic framework would be:


Title page: Title, your name, course name, date, name of supervisor
Abstract: One paragraph summarizing the whole dissertation
Acknowledgments: Thanks to those who have assisted you.
Table of contents: Chapters and/or sections & sub-sections with page numbers
Table of figures, if appropriate:
Introduction: A presentation of your question/problem/thesis, with a brief outline of the structure of your work
Main body/discussion: The facts, evidence, analysis, evaluation and discussion. All very well structured: arts/social sciences tending towards paragraphs; sciences/engineering towards sections; business a mixture of the two.
Conclusion: Where you bring it all together, stating very clearly your answer to your central question and if appropriate making recommendations, suggestions etc.
Bibliography: A complete list of your sources, correctly formatted.
Appendices: Any information not central to your main text or too large to be included: for example, complete questionnaires, copies of letters, maps etc.
Other sections you may be asked to include could be terms of reference, procedure, methodology, executive summary, literature review or recommendations.Avoid footnotes, unless you’re using a numerical referencing system. Avoid too many brackets. Use bold and italics sparingly and consistently. Avoid underlining. Avoid using “etc.”

, Your dissertation is a piece of academic work; an intellectual achievement. You are not expected to produce something completely original, but instead, to should show understanding of key issues and theories; evidence of thought and insight; critical analysis and evaluation, and a demonstration that you have been able to research a topic within your professional domain and present your findings appropriately. Simple description is not enough, and will result in a low mark. You should write in an appropriate academic style, avoiding colloquialisms, contractions, phrasal verbs and vagueness. You do not need, however, to use long, over-formal vocabulary: you should aim at all times for clear and concise expression. You should normally avoid too much personal language (“I”, “my” etc), although opinions on this vary. As a rule of thumb, only use it when you are describing what you actually did and when you are expressing personal opinions, probably in your conclusion. Don’t refer to yourself as “we” unless you are describing some sort of group work, and don’t refer to yourself as “the author”: it’s pompous and confusing. Avoid using “he/she”, “her/his” etc. The best way to avoid this and still be non-sexist is to make the subject plural whenever possible. (For example, “Teachers should always be in control of their class”.) In your conclusion, don’t start undermining your work by apologizing for poor results or complaining about lack of time. Always be positive. If there were problems, analyze these objectively in an appropriate place. Any research has weaknesses; they’re part of the process. Sentences should be well-punctuated, complete but not over-long. Paragraphs should be adequately developed, with normally at least five or six sentences. You should use linking words or phrases to guide your reader through your writing. Make sure all figures are integrated into your text and referred to. And remember to consistently and correctly make references to your sources.

, Acknowledgment of your sources is a vital and integral part of the academic process. If you do not do this, particularly at dissertation/postgraduate level, you could be accused of plagiarism. By the time you do your dissertation you should be very clear on how to do this. If not, check with course tutors or in course literature what the preferred method is (normally at UCE it is the “Harvard Method”) and make sure you know how to use it. It can be a complicated area, but there are many guides and staff to help you (us, for example). Little or no referencing and a short bibliography indicate little research carried out, a generally un-academic approach and maybe even copying from source material. Extensive referencing and bibliography indicate wide research, a correct approach and the use of these sources as evidence to back up the student’s argument.

Determine what information needs to be included.,
Decide how much of the documentation should be within the program code and how much should be separate from it.,
Choose the appropriate documentation tool.",How to Write Software Documentation1," Software specification documents serve as reference manuals for designers of the user interface, programmers who write the code, and testers who verify that the software works as intended. The exact information depends on the program in question but may include any of the following:

Key files within the application. This may include files created by the development team, databases accessed during the program's operation, and third-party utility programs.
Functions and subroutines. This includes an explanation of what each function or subroutine does, including its range of input values and output values.
Program variables and constants, and how they're used in the application.
The overall program structure. For a disc-based application, this may mean describing the program's individual modules and libraries, while for a Web application, this may mean describing which pages use which files.;
, The more technical documentation is developed within the program's source code to begin with, the easier it will be to update and maintain along with the code, as well as to document various versions of the original application. At a minimum, documentation within the source code needs to explain the purpose of functions, subroutines, variables, and constants.

If the source code is particularly lengthy, it can be documented in the form of a help file, which can be indexed or searched with keywords. This is a particular advantage for applications where the program logic is fragmented over many pages and includes a number of supplemental files, as with certain Web applications.
Some programming languages, such as Java and the .NET Framework (Visual Basic.NET, C #), have their own standards for documenting code. In these cases, follow the standards as to how much of the documentation should be included with the source code.

, To some extent, this is determined by the language the code is written in, be it C++, C#, Visual Basic, Java, or PHP, as specific tools exist for these and other languages. In other cases, the tool to use is determined by the type of documentation required.

Word-processing programs for Microsoft Word are adequate for creating separate text files of documentation, as long as the documentation is fairly short and simple. For long, complex text files, many technical writers prefer a documentation tool such as Adobe FrameMaker.
Help files for documenting source code can be produced with any help authoring tool, such as RoboHelp, Help and Manual, Doc-To-Help, MadCap Flare, or HelpLogix.

"
"
Determine the business reasons for your documentation.,
Understand the audience you're writing the documentation for.,
Determine the appropriate format(s) for the documentation.,
Decide what form(s) the documentation should take.,
Choose the appropriate documentation tool.",How to Write Software Documentation2," Although the functional reason for documenting software is to help users understand how to use the application, there are other reasons as well, such as assisting in marketing the software, enhancing the company image, and most notably, reducing technical support costs. In some cases, documentation is necessary to comply with certain regulations or other legal requirements.

In no case, however, should software documentation substitute for poor interface design. If an application screen requires reams of documentation to explain it, better to change the screen design to something more intuitive.

, In most cases, software users have little knowledge of computers outside of the tasks the applications they use enable them to do. There are several ways to determine how to address their needs with your documentation.

Look at the job titles your prospective users hold. A system administrator is likely expert with a number of software applications, while a data entry clerk is more likely to know only the application he or she currently uses to enter data.
Look at the users themselves. Although job titles generally indicate what people do, there can be considerable variation in how certain titles are used within a given organization. By interviewing prospective users, you can get a feel for whether your impressions of what their job title indicates are accurate or not.
Look at existing documentation. Documentation for previous versions of software, as well as functional specifications, provide some indication as to what the user will need to know to use the program. Keep in mind, however, that end users are not as interested in how the program works as they are in what it can do for them.
Identify the tasks needed to do the job, and what tasks need to be done before those tasks can be done.

, Software documentation can be structured in 1 of 2 formats, the reference manual and the user guide. Sometimes, a combination of formats is the best approach.

A reference manual format is devoted to explaining the individual features of a software application (button, tab, field, and dialog box) and how they work. Many help files are written in this format, particularly context-sensitive help that displays a relevant topic whenever a user clicks the Help button on a particular screen.
A user guide format explains how to use the software to perform a particular task. User guides are often formatted as printed guides or PDFs, although some help files include topics on how to perform particular tasks. (These help topics are usually not context-sensitive, although they may be hyperlinked to from topics that are.) User guides often take the form of tutorials, with a summary of the tasks to be performed in the introduction and instructions given in numbered steps.

, Software documentation for end users can take 1 or several of many forms: printed manuals, PDF documents, help files, or online help. Each form is designed to show the user how to use each of the program's functions, whether in the form of a walkthrough or a tutorial; in the case of help files and online help, this may include demonstration videos as well as text and still graphics.

Help files and online help should be indexed and keyword-searchable to allow users to quickly find the information they're looking for. Although help file authoring tools can generate indexes automatically, it is often better to create the index manually, using terms users are likely to search for.

, Printed or PDF user manuals can be written with a word-processing program like Word or a sophisticated text editor like FrameMaker, depending on their length and complexity. Help files can be written with a help authoring tool like RoboHelp, Help and Manual, Doc-To-Help, Flare, HelpLogix, or HelpServer."

Decide what you want to achieve with your writing while you travel.,
Prepare your writing materials.,
Consider setting up a blog before you leave.,
Take a longer trip if you need to fit in work.",How to Write While Traveling1," For instance, a travel writer may need to jot down ideas during travel, a business person may need to gather data from a meeting and write a report, and a traveler may want to journal to keep track of all the things on the trip.;
, If you plan to journal, consider buying a sleek, lightweight journal with a ringed binder, so that it can sit flat in a bag or on a table. If you are traveling professionally, consider bringing a laptop computer with the right plugs for the countries to which you plan to travel.


In case of a lack of electricity to charge an electronic device, always bring a backup journal where you can write. Bring plenty of pens, because you may lose some along the way.

, If you have many friends or followers that are interested in your travels, you can schedule time to blog and promote your writing career at the same time. Make sure to give an animated, interesting view of your travels, rather than simply writing down details.

, If you have to devote time to work, then you should schedule that and add a few days to the trip so that you fit in all you can see. This is not necessary if you plan to journal through a vacation.

Take advantage of ""dead time.""",How to Write While Traveling2," If you rely on a laptop or other electronic device to work, this will command where and how you work. If you do not have a stable connection, you will need to find another suitable location, such as a cafe or a library to do your typing.

, Model it on your ideal work station at home, where you have elements like quiet, food or beverages, and a comfortable chair.

, Set a watch and do as much work as you can inside 1 to 3 hours. After that, take a break and enjoy your destination; the break may increase your productivity in your next session.

, If you are traveling with other people, opt to write while you are alone. If that is not possible, put some head phones in your ears and journal without talking to other people.

, People often forget the names, dates, places and other important details of their travel as soon as the next day. Force yourself to sit down for 15 minutes and note all the emotions and excitement of the day.

, They will understand if you tell them ahead of time that you will be unavailable occasionally.

, Make sure you schedule a few days without any work to enjoy your destination. If you are journaling, continue to do so for a few minutes every night, even on weekends.

, For example, if you are waiting for a train, sitting on a coach traveling to your next destination or waiting to meet people for dinner. This time can be used to jot down notes or journal.

Stay consistent.,

Proofread your final draft before submitting it.",How to Write Reflexive Essays," If the topic is not assigned to you, then you will have to decide what experience you will want to write about. You might want to consider a specific event that altered your attitude or actions, or an experience that you would change if you had a second chance. Try to include examples that demonstrate how you grew from that experience.Topics can range from difficult health situations to reading a book or watching a movie to issues of drugs and alcohol or even a recent trip you took.
Remember to focus on a topic that gives or incites a strong opinion.;
, Keep a journal, diary, or events log to record your ideas and descriptions of events as you create your topic and develop your thesis. Record the experience as accurately and as objectively as you can along with a brief narrative for context. As new ideas of how this experience impacted or changed you, write it down. You also want to consider things such as how the experience transformed your thoughts or helped you grow as a person.Try to reflect upon the experience before writing it down so that you do not get bogged down with information that is not important to the essay.
Talk with friends and colleagues about your experience to gain greater insight and perspective about how you feel. Be flexible, since new ideas or opinions might emerge through conversation.
Select relevant examples and materials that will illustrate the reflective process. Choose challenging or perplexing situations that pique your curiosity and motivate you to examine their lessons upon your life.

, Without concern about grammar or form, spend about twenty minutes freely writing about the experience you chose. At this point, do not worry too much about perfecting your ideas. This exercise is important to reflect on the experience and to begin generating an opinion.If you are struggling to start, consider focusing on what points you originally wanted to make about the experience, then start selecting examples that support your points.
If you're still stuck, try answering questions, such as ""What is the most important thing for someone else to know about my experience?"" or ""What would I do differently if I could go back?""

, The thesis statement is the most important sentence in the essay because it provides a strongly-developed overview of what you are writing about. The thesis statement should always be placed in the introduction, unless your assignment says otherwise.Start a thesis statement by framing a question that focuses on your analysis of the experience and how you changed because of it.
Try keeping an open mind as your analysis develops and transforms. This process will require many revisions until you are able to completely answer the question and transform your question into a statement.
Your unique perspective on the experience you are writing about then becomes your thesis statement. The statement you develop offers thoughtful insight into how you transformed because of the experience.
For example: “My life changed on July 1, 2012, when my little sister was born. From that moment, I knew that I wanted to become an OB/GYN doctor.""

, An outline follows a rather strict format, using Roman and Arabic numerals along with capital and small letters of the alphabet. This organization helps both you and your readers to clearly see your thought process. Although there are no rules for creating the best outline, this type is the most common. Organize it the best way you see fit.

, Your main topics will be located beside the roman numerals and should maintain a uniform structure. For example, if you begin with a verb in the first topic, a verb should also begin the second topic. The subtopics should follow suit. I. Choose international destination
II. Prepare travel itinerary
“Choose” and “Prepare” are both present tense verbs.

, All information should uniformly match. The main topic should be more significant than all the subtopics that follow. All subtopics should directly support the main topic. I. Visit a historical landmark facility
II. Visit a historical landmark website

A. Note important facts
B. Look for interesting stories


The “facility” and “website” share equal importance. Locating “important facts” and “interesting stories” found on the historical landmark’s website is part of the process of supporting the main topic.

, At the same time, general information should be found in the main topic. I. Describe your favorite athlete

A. Childhood role model
B. Baseball player


A “childhood role model” and “baseball player” are specific examples from the general topic of “favorite athlete” in your lifetime.

, Main topics and subtopics should contain a minimum of two entries. In other words, you should have enough main ideas and evidence to support them that is greater than just one.I. Buy a new car

A. Take credit report
B. Take driver’s license
C. Take checkbook


The heading “buy a new car” is divided into three subtopics. Although no rules exist for the number of subtopics, extensive amount of subtopics need to be combined or their significance reevaluated.

, Sound thinking and the ability to express it clearly is a practical skill that can be used in almost any circumstance. Since this ability cannot be acquired overnight, a commitment to placing intellectual standards on your thought process is the key to skillfully taking charge on your mode of thinking. The experience or event that you are writing about needs to be analyzed. Consider breaking the experience down into simpler parts and defining what the causes and effects were.
After breaking down the experience, think about how those various parts relate and react to each other or how they are impacted by change.
Once the topic has been thoroughly analyzed and synthesized, evaluate your attitude towards the subject and how you were affected. Then, you must reflect on how this event changed you or what you would have done differently if presented to you again.

, Academic writing does not often include the use of the first person, but since a reflective essay revolves around your opinion, there is no problem using the first person – I, me, my – to write about what happened to you.


Although the first person is completely acceptable, overuse is still possible.
Avoid distancing language, such as “I saw” or “I heard,” in which the “I” comes between the reader and a direct account of what happens.For example, instead of saying ""I heard a loud bang,"" you could say ""A loud bang reverberated through the parking lot."" The latter is more immediate and interesting for readers.

, Since you are writing about an experience that happened in the past, you should write your essay in the past tense. What happened in the past stays in the past.There are exceptions. If you are introducing new or current thoughts into the essay, you could use present tense such as “I think” or “I believe.” If they are realizations made in the past, however, it would be more consistent to use “I realized” or “I understood.” In either case, make sure your reader is clear about the timeline or time lapse.
Use the past tense when writing about your experience since it was a particular moment in time, while it is acceptable to use the present tense when referencing contemporary theory.

, Remember to not only run spell check but also to either reread what you wrote aloud or have a friend or colleague read it for errors. Make sure the final draft is polished. Reflective essays, although they are not research papers, must still adhere to the standards of formal writing – precision, clarity, conciseness, and correctness.Check grammar, sentence flow, and tone for an easy-to-read essay.
Search for common word usage and replace them with richer, more descriptive words that you can find in an online thesaurus.
Make sure your tone and level of diction is coherent. In other words, if you start formal, stay formal, and end formal.
Avoid using slang, emotive, or subjective terms.

Learn the forms of the letters.,

Learn the punctuation.",How to Write Tengwar1," The forms of the main letters (tengwa) are given above.;
, Tengwar can use either base 10 (decimal) or base twelve. It can also be written with the units first (so units, tens, hundreds etc, so 125 is five hundred and twenty one) or the more familiar units last (the way numbers are written in English). Usually, when using base 12, a dot is placed under the units digit. You can also place a dot or an overbar (not both) above every digit to make them stand out.

, Most modes of tengwar have no letters for the vowels. Instead, they use diacritic marks, called tehtar, that show the positions of the vowels. The placement of the tehtar varies: sometimes they are placed on the tengwa before them, other times the tengwa after them. If there is no tengwa in the appropriate place, then the tehta (singular of tehtar) is placed on a carrier. The short carrier is used for short vowels, the long carrier is used for long (accented or doubled) vowels. Note that in some cases, the long vowel tehta cannot be placed on a tengwa, so it must be placed on a long carrier.

, In some modes, only certain punctuation marks occur. Also, some writers don't use the tengwar punctuation, they just use standard English punctuation instead.

Be aware that there are a few peculiarities in this mode.",How to Write Tengwar2," In this mode, the tengwa is read first, followed by the tehta underneath it, then the tehta on top. Therefore, vowels are placed on the letter before them. Using these rules, the tengwa above would be read as tye.

, These are two vowels pronounced as one sound. In all other vowel combinations, each vowel must be pronounced individually.

, If you have an r followed by a vowel, use the left tengwa. If you have an r followed by a consonant or at the end of a word, use the right tengwa.

, The table above gives the tengwar values for this mode.

, Learn them well:


The first tengwa is only used for an s that developed from a th. E.g. Sauron was originally spelt Thauron, so it uses the first tengwa. Otherwise, use the second tengwa.
The third tengwa is only used in Classical Quenya, where it has the value nw.
The fourth tengwa is only used initially (at the start of a word). In Classical Quenya, it has the value ngw.
The fifth tengwa is only used initially, as the carrier for a y-tehta.
The sixth tengwa can be used for a v that developed from a w. E.g. Vilya (Elrond's ring of power) was originally Wilya (meaning air), so it is spelt with this tengwa.
The seventh tengwa is used in front of an unvoiced, initial r or l

Also, as this is the original full mode, other full modes are sometimes known as ""Beleriandic"" modes (there's a second full mode for Sindarin, the Sindarin full mode of Gondor, and two English full modes, in case you were wondering).

, A diphthong is a pair of vowels pronounced as one sound. All other vowel combinations are to be pronounced as individual vowels. Note that the diphthongs for ae and oe are written as a pair of symbols.

, In Sindarin, there are only four double letters (nn, mm, ll and ss). The correct way of writing each one in this mode is given above.

Begin by freeing your mind of all conventional restrictions or inhibitions you might have.,
Write letters.,
Keep a diary.,
Keep a notebook, which is similar to a diary, but rather captures the singular thought and not the development.,
Use poetry.,
Use Socratic dialogue.,
A short story, a play or an opera can also put across philosophical ideas.,
The novel is one of the best ways to put across ideas.,
Philosophical works also good ways to get your ideas across.",How to Write Philosophy," There are many ways to write, so don't hesitate just because you feel someone won't take your work seriously. Most people who won't take you serious are those that are stuck in a rut, usually with a fear of change, so don't listen to them. If you're having difficulty freeing your mind try meditating, to calm yourself down and clear your mind of unwanted thoughts.;
, The letter is a brilliant way, whether to yourself or to another, writing a letter is less time consuming and generally a lot easier. Seneca's letters of a stoic are a good place to learn how to write philosophical letters. There are a few ways this can be done, you can write letters to someone, who replies to your letter. You could write letters to yourself, though written in a manner as if to another. Finally you could write a letter to yourself and reply to that letter in your next letter, in a way that shows you have thought X one day and after contemplating think Z.

, Another way, similar to a letter, is a diary, writing in a diary regularly will help you build your writing skill and you will be able to look back over, seeing how your thought process developed. Like a letter, it only requires small amounts of writing input, however you need to be dedicated enough to write regularly, at least once a week. See how to write a diary.

, If you do a notebook, it is best to combine it with another way, as the notebook is more of a preparation for your main work. Leonardo Da Vinci kept notebooks which where filled with illustrations of different inventions and sketches of the human body, all of this was annotated. Read them to get a sense of writing notebooks.

, One of the most provocative and exciting styles is philosophy in poetry, which is much easier for people to read and will improve your poetry skills too. Goethe's Faust is the best example, although yours doesn't need to be so long. This is good for someone with a fertile imagination, it is also a lot easier for others, who are not as interested in philosophy to read being not so preachy as the other forms.

, This is the original way of writing down philosophy, pioneered by Plato. Read his works to get a grounding of how to write this type. For those not familiar with Plato, a Socratic dialogue is like a play in which a group of philosophers discuss philosophical ideas, the writer can then use the people in the dialogue to put across his point of view or rubbish someone else's. However do not write it as a play, a play should be a story with a message at the end, a dialogue should be like two old men sat talking to each other.

, These are more popular and easier to write if you have an ability for creative writing. However you must make it clear at the end that there is a moral to the story at the end and it's not just a nice little story.

, However it requires a lot of input and you yourself will have to be pretty good at creative writing if you want to perform this type of writing. One example would be Ayn Rand or Dostoyevsky's 'The brothers Karamazov' or 'Crime and Punishment'.

, It is a basic stating of your philosophical beliefs in a precise and condense format. The best way to start would to be to write down your basic beliefs in a philosophical statement (i.e. My basic beliefs are: x,y,z). After writing a basic philosophical statement add some more ""big"" words to replace more common ones (i.e. good, bad, nice, etc.)and transitions to get your basic idea across. Then begin writing a chapter about x, then y, then z. After doing so re-read and make sure you make sense; afterwords read it to a friend or relative and see how they react; after correcting what mistakes they are able to find in your grammar or logic you are practically done. Feel free to and an introduction and/or conclusion or have a friend/relative do that for you. Publish and have fun! Read Thomas Paine's Common Sense, or some Immanuel Kant to get a good format as well.

You can delve into the history of poems and read the classics, but it's also essential that you read the types of poems being written today. You're not living in Elizabethan England or on top of a mountain in feudal Japan, so it wouldn't make much sense to write poetry like you do. Some great contemporary narrative poems and poets to check out include:


""The Soldier"" by David Ferry
""Providence"" by Natasha Trethewey
""The Armadillo"" by Elizabeth Bishop
""A Wedding"" by James Tate
""Brazilian Telephone"" by Miriam Bird Greenberg;
, Poems don't arrive out of thin air, like transmissions from the muse. You've got to work to find a good poem, or a good place to start. For that reason, many poets carry around small notebooks, journals, or take little messages on their phone or mobile device to return to at a later date when the time is right. As a poet, keep an eye out for striking images, weird phrases, and moments that might be right for a poem.


Poems can happen anywhere, at any time. Maybe you'll be struck by a particular patch of graffiti, or the a way an off-duty mariachi lights his cigarette on the street. Even when you're not sitting at your desk writing, keep an eye out for poetic moments. ""Write"" all day.
Increasingly, many poets like to write on the computer, and it's true that using word processors is much more quick and efficient. But let yourself write out your initial fragments by hand every now and then. This serves to slow you down and force you to think about what you're recording, and let's you be less attached to your initial ideas and images, making it easier to explore them and revise them later, when you're writing.

, What story will your poem relate? A good narrative poem tells a story that could be mundane or could be spectacular, but either way finds narrative weight in some image or moment of that story. Narrative poems can be long, dramatic epics or short and lyrical fragments, depending on the story you want to tell.


Good narratives always have moments of ""tension,"" in which things act against each other. A friendly cop could be a moment of tension worthy of story, as could be an angry lover. If the story is very harrowing, add some lightness in the details. If the story is light, find the darkness in it to create tension that will come through in the poem.
Narrative poems can be true-to-life, like Sheffield's ""A Good Fish,"" which details the reeling in of an aggressive catch with luminous particulars. They can also be made-up, imaginary, or absurd narratives, the like of which James Tate, Russell Edson, and Matthea Harvey have built careers upon. A good story might revolve around a fishing trip, a romantic encounter, or a post-apocalyptic marching band.
If you experience an encounter that you think will make for a good narrative poem, write it down right away in your journal. Record the details you might forget, specific things that you'll have trouble remembering. What did it smell like? What was your mother wearing? Had your boyfriend shaved that day? Fill your journal with as many particulars as possible to mine them later.

, One of the most important things in a narrative poem is finding your ""in."" What is your particular perspective on this story? What unique angle will you introduce into it? Pretend that you're going to tell a story everyone's already heard and want to make it new, make it different, make it surprising. That's what we want from a narrative poem: to feel like we haven't heard it before, even if we have.


The opening should propel you through the rest of the story, giving us a thirst to finish. Think of Emily Dickinson's famous opening line ""My life has stood - a loaded gun / in Corners."" She gets at a completely surprising and unusual mode of solitude, frustration, and anguish in only nine words. It would be impossible to not finish reading the poem.
Poetry lets you play with time like no other medium. A narrative poem doesn't have to start at the beginning of the story, and it doesn't even have to tell the whole story. Shave off everything except the bones of the narrative and start there.

, Even if your narrative is just a single moment, a meal, an encounter, or a fight, it needs to have some forward motion that propels us. Before you do any writing, give some through to where the poem might go, how it might move forward into new territory. What happens is just as important as what happens next.


It's likely you'll get sidetracked along the way, and the poem will go awry, but that's a good thing. Poems should surprise the reader as well as the writer.
Most narrative poems will only detail a particular moment, not a whole day, a whole life, or a whole person. Still, it needs to have an arc to it. You won't be able to say everything you want to say about your grandmother in a single narrative poem, so look for a single moment that captures that life, and give it the narrative weight it deserves.

, The best way to start? Just write. Don't worry about getting every image perfect, or spelling each word correctly, just stay with the page and write as much as you possibly can when you're feeling inspired to work. Keep your fingers typing, or writing, and get as much raw material out on the page as possible for you to craft later.


Sitting down to a blank page can be an intimidating thing for lots of people, both experienced and inexperienced poets, but it doesn't need to be. You're not going to write a poem in five minutes, and it's not going to be done just because you've gotten a few words on the page. Just start writing.
Try not to think of what you're writing as a ""poem,"" just start writing. The ""poem"" happens as you revise, as you work, and as you carve the details into something concrete. Don't worry about making it perfect. Just worry about getting it out and giving yourself something to work with.
Don't worry about form, or rhyme, or the line-breaks right now. If you want to write in prose, write in prose. If you want to break the lines arbitrarily, break the lines arbitrarily. The techniques of form are ways to add meaning to what you've already written.

, As you write, focus on the tiniest possible details. Let yourself get sidetracked from telling the story, and focus on things that seem small, that seem insignificant. You're not writing a novel, after all, you're writing a poem. Jump around to different images, different locations, and even different people.


Robert Bly wrote an influential essay with accompanying poems called ""Leaping Poetry,"" detailing this idea. Poems allow the poet to illustrate the ""motion of the mind,"" he writes, making associations and leaps between subjects, images, and moments part of what makes poetry great. If your grandmother's hands suddenly conjure images of gray whales, let that association happen on the page, even if it seems ""weird"" to you. Weird is good.

, A poem should be built of ""luminous particulars,"" very specific details and images, things that we can see, touch, smell. Look for the little moments and let your mind make leaps and connections. Make those details drive the narrative.


Maybe, as in Bishop's poem ""The Fish,"" the eye of an animal might resemble ""isinglass"" and the skin ""old wallpaper."" These particular details make us feel the weight of the image, without having to tell us about how to feel.

, Don't worry about ""explaining"" the poem to us. Make a thing for us to interpret, not an argument for us to understand. A narrative poem made of abstractions and concepts like ""the weight of my anguish"" or ""the pounding depression in my soul"" won't be as effective as a poem build from luminous particulars that illustrate those abstractions and make them real. What does that anguish look like? Instead of feelings, focus on the things you can see.


Maybe you can find anguish in the coffee cups left around the apartment, half-stuffed with coffee grounds and tissues. Or maybe you can find anguish in the way your neighbor lovingly picks up his old dog's turds, diligently. The image is more powerful and more weighted than the idea.

, The ""I"" in a poem doesn't have to be the poet, though it might be. Don't worry about a poem needing to tell the truth, and let the poem speak from a place that it needs to be spoken from. Finding the right speaker for the poem can be a great way of creating tension in the narrative.


Think of as many different perspectives as possible before picking one. Maybe your narrative about the killing floor at the slaughterhouse could be cool from the perspective of the cow, but what about the perspective of the foreman? The guy at the end of the line? The truck driver? The grocer who unpacks the meat? The kid who lives down the road and smells the barnyard smells every morning when he gets up for school? Explore the idea fully and find the one with the most juice.
""Persona poetry"" is poetry that takes a particular speaker from history or life, like writing a script with a particular character in mind. Maybe your poem is about a gas station worker, written from his perspective, or even from the perspective of an inanimate object, like a fork or a mountain. What does your dog have to say? A poem is the right place to explore it.

, The way to write a bad poem is to go into it with a plan and stick to the plan. Great poems come from happy accidents, surprises that reveal themselves only as you get into the poem. Don't worry so much about what you want the poem to do, or be, just try to pay attention to where the poem is going and what ""it"" wants. Sounds weird, but it works.


Richard Hugo calls this ""writing off the subject."" Poems of every kind have a subject, whether the writer knows it or not. And while great poems might stay within their subject entirely, most poems work to touch something more. To create tension, a poem needs to write away from the subject into other places. Charles Simic's great study called ""Fork"" merely describes a fork the most pedestrian of objects, but the poem starts ""This strange thing must have crept / Right out of hell."" With that, we're not in Kansas anymore.

, It's always better to have a lot of material to work with when you're writing poetry, giving yourself the goods to cut and repair, like Frankenstein. It's very hard to enter back into a poem and try to produce more stuff after you've already gone through the hectic drafting phase, so try to get it all out when you can and worry about what's working later. If it looks too long, you're off to a good start.


Alternatively, some poets treat the writing of a draft like a building a sculpture, slowly piling up a few words, lines, and images at a time, until the poem starts to take shape. There's no right way to write, so experiment with different styles and processes and do what works best for you.

, How do you know you've gotten to the end? Short answer: end on an image. A poem doesn't need to close like a lock-box of meaning, especially when you're writing a narrative. Try to find something weird and reverberating that will echo beyond the end of the poem. In most cases, poems should end with a line like ""and then everyone died.""


Cut the poem off before the end of the story, to leave us wanting, or carry the poem beyond the ending, into a strange detail that will cast a shadow back over what we've just read. Maybe your poem about your grandmother ends on the garbage men arriving, and the mammoth forks of the truck clanging like monsters, so you can't hear her talk. Or maybe your poem about your girlfriend's beauty ends with an image of her dog. Surprise us and yourself.
Many beginning poets like to end poems on ""epiphanies,"" which can have a preachy effect. Try to avoid ending a poem about feeding deer in your grandmother's backyard with something like, ""And then I understood death."" Epiphanies can be an important part of poetry, but they can feel like being slapped in the head to the reader, or like a cheap trick. Stick an epiphany elsewhere in the poem to see how it works, if it serves the poem.

, The difference between poetry and prose is that poetry offers all kinds of little tricks that allow you to create meaning and affect the way the poem is read. Line breaks, musical elements, and and


A poem's ""meter"" refers to the number of syllabic beats in each line of the poem, and formal poets may count up the unstressed and stressed syllables to shape the poem. In ""pentameter,"" for example, each line will have 10 syllables, with five stressed and five unstressed beats: ""To be, or not to be, that is the question"" is an example of pentameter.
You can break your lines any way you like. In a free verse poem (a poem that ignores metrical restrictions), you can break your lines to affect the speed at which we read the poem. ""Enjambed lines"" are broken in the middle of clauses, while end-stopped lines will end at the end of classes, or with punctuation.

Enjambments: ""I woke to the smell of frying / gasoline, my father's car howling / up the driveway.""
End-stops: ""I woke to the smell of frying gasoline, / my father's car howling up the driveway.""


Stanzas are like the paragraphs of poetry, and can be broken into a variable number of groups of lines, broken by an extra space. For contemporary narrative poems, the most common stanza forms are 4-line stanzas, called quatrains, or in one long, unbroken stanza.

, After you've written your story in lines, go through the poem an eliminate extra words, unnecessary lines, and anything that makes the poem a chore to get through. Try to cut everything you can and get down to the bare essentials.


Adjectives are good candidates for cuts. If you've written the line, ""The hugely gigantic war beast was completely and totally swollen with the blood of innocents as it moved across the field."" you've gotten a lot of luminous particulars in there, but probably too many. Try cutting everything back but one or two: ""The war beast, blood-swollen, moved huge across the field.""
Use strong verbs. Avoid passive verbs, replacing them with more muscular cousins. ""We were flying the plane into a storm"" is much better off being written: ""We flew into the storm."" Fewer words means stronger images and moments.

, A poem has the power to make one thing into another, or to compare two things simultaneously.


A simile uses ""like"" or ""as"" (""the fish's skin like old wallpaper"") while a metaphor generally uses some form of ""is"" to call one thing another (""the fish was a wall, covered in old paper""). You could even use both at once: ""The fish was a wall like a brick battlement, covered in ancient paper.""
Similes and metaphors are great ways to add power to your descriptive lines in your narrative poem, but only as long as you keep them straight. Keep one metaphor going, extending it, rather than piling one on top of the next. Play by the rules and don't mix your metaphors: ""The sun was a ship that fell into the sea, a bird-star cascading through the night.""

, Poetry is meant to be spoken a loud, and many poets use the musical elements of rhythm and sound to affect their poems in sly ways. Often, these techniques have less to do with the content of the story, and more to do with the experience of it. A harrowing narrative poem might be strange if it were very mellifluous, instead choosing hard consonants and jarring rhythms to move the poem forward. Match the music to the content.Alliteration and assonance refer to words used with common sounds. Alliteration happens in words with similar consonant sounds: ""chair"" ""church"" ""Carlos."" Assonance refers to words with corresponding vowel sounds: ""Albion,"" ""allowance,"" ""alive.""
Rhyme with sly intent. Poems don't need to rhyme to be good, and it's often very difficult to rhyme well. Avoid clunky end rhymes, and avoid rhyming for the sake of rhyming. If you want to try, get a good rhyming dictionary and make friends with the ""slant"" rhyme, words that rhyme consonant sounds or sound close to the word being rhymed with. A true rhyme would be ""house"" and ""mouse,"" while a slant rhyme might be ""house"" and ""shoes"" or ""now.""

, Working on a poem should be fun. Many poets like to turn the act into a kind of craft project, cutting the poem up, moving things around as if they were making an art project. These experiments might not always result in a perfect poem, but it might give you a fresh perspective that you could use to restart and rejuvenate your interest in something you've already written. Here are some great revision techniques:


Circle every noun and go the dictionary and look up the word. Replace it with the word seven spaces up from it in the dictionary you're using.
Retype your poem with all the lines in the reverse order. Start with the last line and work your way toward the first. Would the poem be better if it worked backward?
If your poem uses formal elements, rewrite it in free verse. If your poem is in free verse, Try to rewrite it as a formal poem of your choice.
Draw a picture under your poem, of images the poem jogs for you. Without looking at the poem, examine your drawing and imagine you were supposed to write a poem to accompany it. Write that poem.
Pick six words that you like from your poem and delete everything else. Start fresh with those six words.
Change the title to something terrible, like ""String Cheese Incident Love Poem"" or ""Death Licorice."" Change the poem you've written to make it work with the new title.

, Every poet experiences the false moment of genius: after finishing something, we put it down and exclaim, ""Perfect!"" The next morning, after some rest and coffee, it suddenly doesn't look so great. We are our own best and worst editors, but our eye tends to get a little better with some time. When you get a draft you're happy with, let it sit and try to think about other things. Go back to it later. New ideas, images, and techniques might occur to you.


New York poet Ron Padgett published a book called Poems I Guess I Wrote, in which he finished a batch of poems he found in a drawer that he didn't remember writing. Some of them were more than 20 years old. While you don't have to wait that long, letting a poem sit for a while and working on new material can allow you to return to it with a fresh perspective. You might like it more later.

, Poems are work. The first stuff you get down on paper might be great, and it might be terrible, but either way the real poem happens during the revision process. Don't give up! Keep revising those poems until they become well-greased machines made out of words. Revise poems that you think are finished by reading them repeatedly. Can you memorize them? Keep looking. Keep thinking about them. Keep a stack by your bedside and read them before you go to sleep. Make changes as they arise.

Use a termination clause if necessary.,
Add a notification provision.",How to Write Terms and Conditions," If you are going to offer a service and that service will be available to a large number of people, you should consider drafting and implementing a series of terms and conditions. Some of the most common services people and companies offer that lend themselves well to terms and conditions include websites and mobile phone apps. These types of services are also available to the public at-large, which makes the use of terms and conditions particularly useful. If the service you are offering will not be available to a large number of people (e.g., consulting or other types of employment type relationships), consider using a more traditional and individualistic contract instead of terms and conditions. Some of the most common reasons for having terms and conditions include:



Protecting your business.Simply put, if you do not specify terms and conditions, you put yourself at risk of user uncertainty and misunderstanding.Preventing abuses.Terms and conditions are legally binding and can therefore act to prevent users of your service from abusing or misusing that service.The terms and conditions will lay out the guidelines of using your service, as well as what will happen if they do not follow your guidelines.Owning your content.The content your provide users will likely be yours and you will want to protect that content from theft or misuse.Terms and conditions are a great way to convey that to your users.

Limiting liability.Nobody is perfect and you are bound to have errors in your content.Terms and conditions are a great way to warn your users that you will not be held responsible for such errors.;
, Depending on what type of service you are providing, you will want to tailor your terms and conditions so they protect your particular situation. Terms and conditions are an incredibly powerful tool and you want to make sure you get the most out of them. For example:


If you are collecting personal information from your users (e.g., credit card information, names, addresses), you will need to include a privacy policy that discusses how that private information will be used, stored, and disseminated.If you are offering users accounts or subscriptions, you should be sure to explain the rules of those accounts and subscriptions, including how they can be terminated if abused., The last step in preparing to write your terms and conditions is contemplating where the information will be located and how users will access it.This is important to consider before you write your terms and conditions because your answers to these questions will dictate how the terms and conditions will be written.


Think about putting your terms and conditions in a location that is easily accessible, possibly even in a position where users are required to access it.For example, if your service is a website offering goods to buy, you may want to have your terms and conditions pop up as soon as a new user accesses your website for the first time. If you are doing this, you will want to format your terms and conditions with a clear and enticing title and initial statement so users will want to read it.
Think about requiring your users to actively accept your terms and conditions before they can use your service.For example, require your users to click or check off a box that says ""I Have Read and Accept the Terms and Conditions"" before they are allowed to use your website or other service., Your very first paragraph should always be an acceptance of terms clause.This clause ensures that your users understand that by using your service they are accepting the terms and conditions.Always put this in bold, uppercase, and large font.


Consider using the following language: ""By accessing and using this service, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. In addition, when using these particular services, you shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services. Any participation in this service will constitute acceptance of this agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service."", If your service involves the collection and retention of users personal information, you will need to include a privacy statement.This clause will set out how a user's private information will be used and when, if ever, their information will be disseminated to others.


A privacy policy will usually be in-depth, and therefore may be rather long. It should include a definition of the information being collected, how it will be used, and how it will be protected.For an example of a complete privacy policy, look here.

, This provision will protect you from as much legal liability as possible for any mistakes or errors that may be present in your service.If your service is a website, consider using language like: ""This site and its components are offered for informational purposes only; this site shall not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness or availability of any information transmitted or made available via the site, and shall not be responsible or liable for any error or omissions in that information.""This type of provision will help you protect against liability in case a user relies on your information and it causes a problem., If you have intellectual property associated with your service and that intellectual property is available or visible to your users, you should include a clause informing users that you are the owner of that property.Some of the potential property you may want to protect includes logos, designs, and content you created.If necessary, include a provision that looks like this: ""The Site and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws."", This type of provision will generally apply to your service if it is a website with advertisements on it. If you are in this category, you will want to include a statement about the advertisements and whether you are being compensated to provide that endorsement.If you are being paid to provide the advertisements, you are required by law to state that in this provision.Even if you are not being paid, it may be a good idea to provide your users with a brief statement about your advertising policy, including that you take your reputation and credibility very seriously and that you only endorse products you believe in., If you offer a service that users will pay for, include information on the acceptable methods of payment, how those payments will be processed, and how the return or refund process works.

, If you are offering a service that includes shipping goods to your users, you will want to include a statement about the responsibility you and others hold regarding that delivery.If you use a third party delivery service, make sure your users know that as soon as that third party takes possession over their product you are no longer responsible.Also consider a statement about the possibility of late deliveries and how they will be handled., If you require registration or account creation prior to allowing access to your service, you should always include a section in your terms and conditions discussing how those accounts can be terminated if they are abused.If necessary, consider including a provision stating: ""We may terminate your access to the Site, without cause or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account. All provisions of this Agreement that, by their nature, should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability."", When aspects of your services change, it may be necessary to change your terms and conditions to reflect those changes. It is therefore necessary to include a notification provision in your terms and conditions notifying your users how you will handle changes to the terms and conditions.


An acceptable notification provision may look like this: ""The company reserves the right to change these conditions from time to time as it sees fit and your continued use of the site will signify your acceptance of any adjustment to these terms. If there are any changes to our privacy policy, we will announce that these changes have been made on our home page and on other key pages on our site. If there are any changes in how we use our site customers' Personally Identifiable Information, notification by email or postal mail will be made to those affected by the change. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on our site 30 days prior to these changes taking place. You are therefore advised to re-read this statement on a regular basis."""

Edit your story.",How to Write Funny Stories," When you sit down to write a funny story, you need to be aware of your personal style of humor. If you're trying to write in a style that doesn't fit your strengths as a comedian or storyteller, then your story may not be as strong as it could be. There are many different types/styles of humor. Some of the most popular include:


anecdotal - focus is placed on humorous personal stories, which may be slightly embellished for comedic effect
burlesque - involves caricature and imitation, often with exaggerated characteristics
dark/gallows - humor that involves death and other types of misfortune, often with a comically pessimistic viewpoint
dry/deadpan - using a lack of emotion or expression to deliver funny material
farcical/screwball - uses skits or satire involving highly improbably circumstances, often with exaggerated reactions and frantic movements
high/highbrow - involves cultured or intelligent topics/themes
hyperbolic - uses excess and exaggeration for comedic effect
ironic - often involves either a split from normalcy or a situation in which the audience knows more than the characters know
satirical - the plot points out a person's or society's weaknesses and downfalls with comedic effect
self-deprecating - humor is derived from the comedian or storyteller making fun of himself/herself
situational - often employs some elements of farce, screwball, or slapstick comedy to make fun of everyday situations
slapstick - mock violence/bodily harm are acted out through physical comedy

, Before you can write a funny story, you need to have some idea about the story itself. It's not enough to have jokes or a funny scenario; the story needs to be strong so that it can support the humorous elements.Brainstorm ideas. If you're stuck, try watching funny movies and reading funny stories for inspiration.
Choose a setting. The setting itself doesn't have to be funny (though it can be), but it should make sense for the characters and plot you're creating.
Think about what you ultimately want your story to say. Is it a story about overcoming adversity? Is it a commentary on modern society?

, Ideally, the tension and its resolution in your story should illustrate some aspect of human nature. Good comedy also accomplishes this, so think about what your story and your humor mean in the context of this piece of writing. Remember that something has to happen; it's not enough to just write a series of humorous events if they don't mean anything.


The conflict and tension drive the plot of a funny story or movie.
In the Chris Farley movie Tommy Boy, for example, the conflict is the risk that Tommy's evil mother-in-law and her secret husband will sell the business and get away with it. The tension arises from that conflict as the narrative builds to a point where everything must be resolved.
Decide what the central conflict will be.
Your story's conflict should create tension. Because it's a funny story, that tension may be funny itself, or the circumstances around it (how it builds, or how it is resolved) could be humorous.
Create some kind of stakes. A good story has some outcome on the line for the characters, which may be funny or tragic (but needs to be realistic).
Sketch out the rising action, climax, and falling action. The climax is typically the high point of tension, and the rising and falling actions build up and relieve that tension (respectively).

, Choosing a story's point of view requires you to decide who would tell the story best, and how that information should be delivered. The main options at your disposal are first person, second person, and third person. There is no objectively right or wrong choice, because it all depends on what you think works best for your story.First person - this is where a story is told using ""I,"" ""me,"" and ""mine."" It's one character's subjective take on the events of your story, and the narrator is usually either the protagonist (the main character) or a close secondary character telling the protagonist's story.
Second person - a story told in second person is told directly to ""you"" (without any ""I,"" except in dialogue). The reader imagines herself as being part of the plot, with the action written in the following manner: ""You follow him down the stairs, and you're surprised at what you see.""
Third person omniscient - this is where an omniscient (all-seeing and all-knowing) narrator delivers the story, without ever referring to an ""I"" or addressing the reader as ""you."" The reader comes to understand the events, thoughts, and motivations each character experiences.
Third person limited - while told in a similar narrative style as third person omniscient, third person limited only offers insights into the thoughts/feelings of one character. The narrative follows the protagonist and delivers the world as he/she experiences it.

, A funny story requires funny situations and settings. In fact, some of the humor may even be derived from the events happening in a setting that is inappropriate or unusual. No matter what setting or situations you create for your story, make sure that they set up the narrative to allow for opportunities to be funny.Some classic comedic situations involve mistaken identity, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or simply inserting a character or object into a situation where it wouldn't normally belong.
An example of a funny situation might be a man not realizing that the lunch he was invited to is at a fancy restaurant and showing up in shorts and a t-shirt with his pet dog. It's not funny by itself, but it sets up opportunities for humor as the narrative progresses and the man is forced to explain himself.

, Good characters are vital to any story, and funny stories are no different. It may be more difficult to make a character well-written and funny, but it's not impossible. Focus on making the characters funny in their own way, whether it's because of the way they look, the way the talk/behave, or the situations that they find themselves in.Remember that there are many different kinds of humor. Your characters might be sarcastic, dumb, observant, and so on.
The Three Stooges offers a great example of funny characters. Their style of humor was predominantly slapstick, but much of the humor arises from each character's personality, quirks, and how each character reacts to situations and one another.
Let each character's humor arise from his or her personality, and be consistent with that character's traits.
Don't worry about crafting the character's entire backstory yet (though you will have to do this once you begin the actual writing process). For now, focus on getting a clear idea in your head about what the characters look like and how they behave.

, By the end of the first paragraph, many readers will decide whether to continue reading the story or to give up and set it aside. A strong, engaging beginning is vital, then, if you want your readers to continue through the rest of your story.A good first paragraph should hook your reader's attention and interest.
Don't worry about making the beginning funny; you can always insert humor during the revision process. Focus on writing a strong, interesting first paragraph.
Try incorporating something unusual, something unexpected, a striking action, or an interesting conflict in the first paragraph. This creates tension and a sense of urgency, and the reader will want to continue.

, Though different people will have a different sense of humor, one thing that many people find funny is an analysis of something common or mundane. Think about Jerry Seinfeld's comedy: he's not telling knock-knock jokes, he's pointing out funny situations that most people haven't realized are funny.The best humor of the mundane arises from situations that everyone has experienced, but no one has talked about. It requires observation and a humorous analysis.
These common, mundane experiences are great material for comedy because they are essentially shared experiences. Everyone has been there, though not with one another, and the reader can see the humor in it from his or her own experiences.
Aim to talk about a common situation in a way that makes people laugh and say, ""Wow, it's so true.""
A common mundane situation used in comedy is what a hassle it is to travel by airplane. A comedian might exaggerate the struggles of getting through security, putting your shoes back on, waiting for hours with strangers for a delayed flight, etc.

, Any story, whether it's fiction or nonfiction, needs well-developed, three-dimensional characters. Don't settle for flat stock characters that everyone has seen before. Give your characters some personality, and if you're writing about real people you know make sure you bring them to life by describing their appearance, mannerisms, and other facets of their personalities.Always know more about a character than you'll ever actually use in the story. Flesh out the character in your head before you begin writing so that he or she will feel real to you and to the reader.
Brainstorm what makes this character unique. Consider what he looks like, his hobbies, temperament, phobias, faults, strengths, secrets, defining moments/memories, etc.
Make sure you convey four main characteristics to your readers: a character's appearance, actions, speech, and thoughts. Any other details can support those characteristics, but without those four your character may not come to life for a reader.

, Anecdotes are short, personal stories that convey something funny or meaningful. An anecdote is the short personal experience you tell your friends about over coffee or cocktails. Some of the best anecdotes are pithy, punchy, and interesting.Many people find that humorous stories/anecdotes are funnier than an actual joke. Jokes can elicit a laugh, but they're short lived and generally less memorable than a true story of embarrassment or mistaken identity.
Don't just stop at your own personal anecdotes. Mine your previous conversations with friends, family, and coworkers, and try to incorporate their moments of humor.
David Sedaris is a great comedic writer who uses personal anecdotes as a jumping off point to talk about the comedic (and at times tragic) aspects of human nature and experience. Try reading his essays online or pick up one of his many books for inspiration and examples.

, You may have heard the old adage, ""Show, don't tell."" It means that there is more power and strength in describing a situation or setting to the reader, rather than simply telling the reader what's happening. For example, instead of using the old line, ""It was a dark and stormy night"" to tell the reader that it was raining outside, you might describe the sound of the raindrops hitting your roof, the squeak your car's wiper blades make, and the way a flash of lightning lit up the hillside as though it were daylight.


Use specific details that illustrate the point you're trying to make. Instead of telling the reader a character is sad, show him crying and running off to be alone.
Let the reader assemble the pieces of the scene or event on her own. This will help the reader feel your emotions more genuinely.
Be specific and use concrete descriptions. Avoid the abstract or intangible, and instead focus on something the reader can imagine seeing, hearing, touching, or feeling.

, Descriptions can be funny in themselves, and they can also set the scene for a funny action sequence. Your comedic descriptions may detail two things that shouldn't normally go together, or you might focus on describing the absurdity of the way a person, place, or thing appears.


Find a new and interesting way to say something familiar. This can be very funny, and it also keeps your readers on their toes.Try using funny adjectives in your descriptions. Again, the focus should be on saying something in a way that surprises or delights the reader.
Many comedians find that words with a hard ""k"" sound (like ""car"" or ""quintuplet"") simply sound funnier. The same is true for words with a hard ""g"" sound (like ""guacamole"" or ""garrulous"")

, A good comedic comparison should describe how two things are related, but it might do so in a funny or unexpected way. A comparison joke should still make the point you're trying to make, but it does so in a way that makes the reader laugh.Use similes and metaphors that evoke familiar images.For example, you might say something like, ""Making it through this week will be about as easy as painting an elephant's toenails; I hope I make it out alive.""
A simile is a comparison that uses ""like"" or ""as"". An example of a simile would be, ""Your love is like a flower.""
A metaphor is a comparison that describes something as though it were actually something else. An example of a metaphor would be, ""My heart is a pounding drum.""
A humorous comparison might be something like, ""He danced like a horse drunk on wine...but he was still a better dance partner than I was.""
Try out different comparisons until you find one that is effective and makes you laugh, then test it out on someone else to see if they find it funny.

, If you're writing about how everyone in your family or your workplace is dumb and ugly, your readers will probably think you're mean and unfairly critical. However, if you make yourself the butt of your jokes, your readers will understand that you're exaggerating or singling out yourself for comedic effect, and it won't come off as mean or judgmental.It's okay to poke fun at others close to you (your friends, family, etc.). But if you just hammer on them without taking a jab at yourself it may come across as mean or arrogant.
Worrying about offending others can stifle your comedy.Making fun of yourself lets readers know it's okay to laugh along with you, since no one else is being unfairly targeted.
Talk about personal experiences, things that have happened to your friends/family/coworkers, and any other aspects of your life that have brought you funny stories - just be sure to bring the mockery down on yourself at least as much as you make fun of others.

, You wouldn't tell a joke and then explain, ""That was supposed to be funny"" - or at least you wouldn't need to explain it if your audience found it funny. The same is true when you're writing a funny story. If you have to tell your readers that something is funny, the joke probably flopped.Let your readers discover the humor of your situation on their own. That will make for stronger storytelling, and it will let your jokes land better for the reader.
This ties in with the ""show, don't tell"" rule. Just as you showed your reader a scene or a character with skillful description, you should likewise show your reader the funny description or action sequence without saying it was funny.

, A lot of written comedy relies on setting up the reader's expectations (perhaps by establishing a pattern, for example) and then subverting those expectations. The reader will realize that the story did not go the way she expected it to, often with comedic results. One way to set up this type of humorous outcome is by using the rule of threes.The rule of threes relies on pairing two similar ideas/events/people together so that the reader recognizes a pattern forming.
Once the reader expects the pattern to continue, you deliver a third idea/event/person that goes in a direction the reader did not expect.
This works best with groups of three because it's a low enough number that most people will easily remember each item, but it's also just enough items that the reader will come to see a pattern and expect it to continue.
As an example of the rule of three, you might say something like, ""I don't know what's wrong with my dog; I've taken him to obedience classes, I learned how to discipline him, but he still hasn't helped me meet anyone at the dog park.""

, Comedic timing may mean setting up a series of events to unfold at a certain time and place, but it also means letting a joke, funny word/phrase, or punch line land in a humorous way. It's all about delivery and how you set up the joke or story.Comedic timing may involve an element of surprise, misdirection, or simply building suspense in order to let a funny line land at the best possible moment.
An example of comedic timing might involve writing something like, ""This dating tip always works and it will drive your partner crazy...except for when it fails.""

, If you're writing comedy for the first time, you may be tempted to pack in as many jokes, funny descriptions, and comedic situations as possible. But sometimes, too many humorous elements can be overkill, and it ends up detracting from the story's strengths. Try to balance the humor, and make sure it's relevant and serves your story (instead of your story serving the humor).Don't lose focus of what your story is actually about. It can be a very funny story, but it needs to be a strongly-written story first.
Try to limit the use of humor throughout the story. That way, when a funny line really lands well, it will be memorable and exceptionally funny.

, As you make revisions, like inserting more comedy (or scaling back the comedic elements), remember to do a thorough edit. Editing a story like this will require you to comb through each line and look for typos, run-on sentences, sentence fragments, weak descriptions, cliches, and other problems in your manuscript.


It may be helpful to set your story aside for a few days before approaching it to edit and revise. When you look at your story with a fresh pair of eyes, you're more likely to catch the mistakes that you might otherwise have missed.
Consider having a friend read your story, and ask for feedback. You should also ask your friend to circle or underline any typos, grammatical/syntactical errors, and weak or unresolved segments of the plot.

Decide what to measure to assess your success.,
Choose three key results for each objective.,
Make your key results difficult, but not impossible.,
Circulate your OKRs.,
Monitor your OKRs.,
Publish your results.",How to Write Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)," The objectives of your OKRs should communicate something that is important to your company’s values and overall mission, rather than focus on hard numbers. Leave the quantitative assessment for the key results portion.”Introduce a new social media channel for marketing” is an example of an objective, while “Increase social media traffic by 25%” is an example of a key result.
The number of objectives you set can vary. Some companies focus on one major objective per quarter, while others might set multiple ones (if they have several departments, for example).;
, OKRs are meant to get your team members excited so that they will push themselves beyond their comfort zone, and take the company to new heights. Use language that “speaks” to your crew.Examples of good objectives include: “Crush the iced coffee market in San Pedro this summer” and “Launch a killer new restaurant finder app.”
Less effective objectives are vague and boring, like “Get more users” and “Make a new product.”

, Usually, OKRs are planned quarterly, or even monthly. This is one of the major ways that OKRs differ from other objectives your company may have.If the objectives you want to write are more long-term, this is a sign that they are actually part of your company's mission rather than an objective for an OKR.
For example, “Give customers the best coffee in Southern California” is an ongoing, long-term goal that is better as a mission statement than an objective for an OKR.

, OKRs are usually directed by management, often a company’s CEO. Your objectives should have your whole team in mind, and focus on collaboration.OKRs are not performance reviews, and should not be treated as such. Tying them to things like promotions and compensation discourages employees from pushing to improve the company as a whole.
You can also apply the OKRs method to personal goals as well, using the same basic procedure.

, To see how well your company is achieving its objectives, you will need measurable, quantitative methods, or key results. Metrics will vary widely depending on your company and objectives. Some common things to measure (and examples of how to assess them) include:Growth (e.g., increased sales)
Engagement (more customers)
Revenue (higher profit margins)
Quality (repeat customers, which equals confidence in your product or service)

, If you set too many benchmarks for your objectives, meeting them will become overwhelming. Too few, however, and you may not be able to accurately assess how well your company is performing. Most experts agree that the magic number of key results for each objective is three. For example, if your objective is “Crush the iced coffee market in San Pedro this summer,” your key results might include:Raise iced coffee sales by 20%
Increase foot traffic on weekdays
Double the number of repeat customers

, OKRs are based on the idea that by pushing your company’s limits, you will drive growth and improvement. In order to push limits, you need to set a high bar. In fact, you should not expect to perfectly achieve your objectives.A success rate of somewhere between 50-70% is the normal expectation.
For instance, if your key result is to raise sales by 20%, actually raising them by 10-14% would mean successfully working toward your objective.
If you are consistently meeting your key results at or near 100%, that’s a sign you are making them too easy.

, Objectives and key results are meant to be public. They’re goals for the company as a whole, unlike individual performance reviews. Sharing a document describing your OKRs with your whole company will make its trajectory transparent, and all team members will feel important to its success., Don’t just write your OKRs and forget about them. To really make them effective, you’ll have to keep them in mind. If you have weekly company updates or meetings, you can share a brief statement about the steps you are making to achieve your goals.For instance, if you are tracking sales figures, present the previous week’s sales at each new meeting or in a memo.
Contextualize the information by saying things like “We increased sales 8% last week, which is great, but we’re still short of our quarterly goal of 20%. Let’s try a coupon campaign this week to keep raising sales.”

, At the end of the quarter, share the results of your OKRs with your company. Since a 50-70% success rate is normal, contextualize them in terms of your company’s overall mission.For example, imagine your objective was to “Crush the iced coffee market in San Pedro this summer,” and key results were raising sales by 20% and increasing weekday foot traffic.

For lawyers, using templates is important.,
Templates can also prevent major mistakes.,
If you use a template, you can use a ""*"" or some other indicator to tell yourself case-specific information must be added there.,
To create a template, you simply create a bare-bones brief, creating new styles as you go along.,
Page Styles - The page style saves major elements like margins and headers.,
Paragraph Styles - The paragraph style saves things like font, spacing, indents.",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org1," Because templates can save text, styles, and formatting, it can save a lot of time. Note that templates have the ""ott"" file extension which is different from normal open office files, which end in ""odt"".;
, For example, when many lawyers write a brief, they will typically cut and past the caption and other formatting elements into a new document. Then they will change the case names, numbers, etc. This is dangerous. There will always be a risk, no matter how careful you are, that you will forget to change something from the previous brief.

, You will never accidentally leave things from a previous brief that was pasted in.

, At the end, you save the document as a template rather than a document. I will go through the process step-by-step. But be aware that the template will include the following:

, You will want to have three of these because you want a different page numbering system for each. For example, create a different page style for the cover page, index pages, and body.

, You will want to create separate paragraph styles for the cover page, index pages, body, addresses (in proof of service), headings, the table of contents/authorities, and footnotes.

"

You don't need to use New Times Roman.,
My advise is to go with Century Schoolbook L, which is preloaded on Openoffice.org.,
I have found that, in Openoffice.org (at least the Linux version), Century Schoolbook L 12-point font takes up about the amount of space (slightly more) than 13-point Times New Roman.",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org2," Rule 8.204 of the California Appellate Rules allows you to use any conventional type-space as long as the size is at least 13 point. I did a little research and discovered the Times Roman font family was designed for newspapers, not books. The letters are very close together. Some people go the opposite extreme with Courier.

, The Century Type Font family is used by the United State Supreme Court and they require briefs in this font as well. Century Schoolbook is also the favorite font of Circuit Judge Richard Posner. The font may look a little weird at first, but it reads very well.

, So I go with 12-point size even though it is technically a violation of the California Appellate Rules of Court (don't tell anyone).

"
"
Go to format, then scroll down to page.,
Go to format and scroll down to ""styles and formatting."",
Take the same steps as indicated above to create another page style called ""appellate brief body style.""",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org3," That will open a page style box. To begin, I just tweak the ""Default"" template which I will use for the cover page. I just make the margins 1.5 on the sides and 1 on the top and bottom. That's it.

, A box with a list of styles will appear. Click the fourth icon over, which is the page style icon. The preloaded page styles will appear (including your default style). Right click and choose ""new."" The page style box will appear with ""Untitled 1"" at the top. Change the name of this to ""appellate brief index style."" Set the margins to 1.5 by 1. Also, where the page tab is, move down under ""lay-out settings"" and change the numbering system to ""i, ii, ii."" This will be important later.

, You can leave the numbering system for this page style the same.

"
"
Now that you have three different page styles -- all with the correct margins -- you can create the page numbering system.,
Create footers for the page styles that will have page numbers (appellate brief index style and appellate brief body style).,
Go to insert and manual break.,
With your cursor in the page you just created, insert another manual break.,
There will still be no page numbers in the footers.,
The basic structure of your document has been created.

",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org4," You should still just have one blank page.

, To do this, go to Insert, footer, and highlight ""appellate brief index style"" and ""appellate brief body style."" When this is done, you will notice that both of these page styles have white check marks, meaning they will both have footers now.

, Click the box saying ""page break"" and below it, choose the style, ""appellate brief index style."" Also, click ""change page number"" and fill in ""1."" This will allow the numbering to begin at page 1, even though it will literally be the second page of the document (due to the cover page).

, Click the box saying ""page break"" and below it, choose the style ""appellate brief body style."" Also, click ""change page number"" and fill in ""1.""

, Don't trip. Put your cursor in the footer for the index page style (the second page of the entire document now.) Then, go to insert, fields, page numbers. The ""i"" should appear. You can then center it if you like. Put your cursor in the body page style footer (third page of entire document) and do the same. A ""1"" should appear.

,"
"
Make a cover page caption on the first page.,
You can use ""table"" and ""insert"" to create boxes which have only two sides for the caption.

",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org5," But first create a style that uses only single space lines, I call mine ""appellate brief cover par style."" To do this, go to ""Format,"" then scroll down to styles and formatting. This time click the first icon for paragraph styles. Then right click, chose ""new,"" and create a style for your cover page. Go through the same process to create styles for the footnotes, body, ect. You can create a new style for each or just modify an existing paragraph style.

,"
"
Create and save styles for each level of your headings.,
For heading 2, you want the formatting to be like an outline.,
For heading 3, the second level of your point headings, I choose:


Before text: .89
After text: .40
First line: -.40

,
So once you made styles for each level of your headings, make sure you selected that style when writing your actual headings in your brief.,
Go ahead and write in the basic headings for your opening brief (where the appellate brief body numbering system begins), such as INTRODUCTION, STATEMENT OF FACTS, CONCLUSION, PROOF OF SERVICE.",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org6," A quick way to do this is by clicking on the styles and formatting button, scrolling down to heading 1, right clicking, then choosing modify. This will allow you to save a whole range of paragraph styles for for ""heading 1."" For me, heading 1 is used for the most basic headings like ""statement of facts,"" ""argument,"" and ""conclusion."" So the formatting is simply the font I use (Century Schoolbook L), bold, and centered.

, Heading 2 will be your first ""point heading."" For this, I modify the paragraph style just like above. I go to ""indents and spacing."" There, I check the single space box and type in the following numbers:


Before text: .49
After text: .40
First line: -.40

,, This is essential, otherwise they will not show up when generating a table of contents.

, You might as well add the headings where the appellate brief index numbering system is too, such as TABLE OF CONTENTS, TABLE OF AUTHORITIES.

For movies, you should plan on watching the film at least two or three times. The first time, just watch and enjoy as your normally would. During the later viewings, try to think about the more the film in more critical terms.For music. you'll likewise want to listen to album or single several times. There's no magic number for how many times is enough. Several listens over a few days is usually adequate, but you also don't want to over do it, because you can end up second-guessing your initial reaction. For at least some listening, do it in a natural setting--while jogging, driving, doing dishes, or however you would normally listen to music--rather than focusing too intently.For game reviews, it's common to need to have the review completed very quickly, as gaming websites and publications try to have reviews out the day the game is released. This can present a challenge, because games are generally longer than movies or albums. You may not be able to complete the game by the time the review is due. Usually, however, 7-10 hours is enough to form a solid impression of the game., After you've been playing, listening, or watching for a while, take some notes about features of the media that you'll discuss in your review. Technical features relate to how well-crafted the movie, album, or game is.


For movies, take notes on the acting, lighting, editing, and special effects. Did the movie look good? Was the acting convincing? What specific aspects of the film make you think this?
For music, take notes on the production and performance. Did the musicians play well? Could the singer hit the notes he or she was reaching for? Does the recording sound clear? What does the music sound like or remind you of?For games, you'll want to make some notes about the control, level of difficulty, music, sound, and graphics. Does the game look good? Are the controls smooth? is it challenging?, You'll also want to make some notes about the content of the media you are reviewing. For movies and games, this mostly comes from the story. For music, this typically arises from the lyrics.


For movies and games, what makes the story interesting or boring? Is it believable? Why or why not? Is there a deeper message you think the movie or game is trying to communicate or issue you think it is seeking to address? What is it? How do you know?For music, what are the features that stand out about the lyrics? Are they interesting? Meaningful? Poetic? Unintelligent? Are there common themes that come up repeatedly over the course of an album or body of songs?, When you write your review, it will be valuable to know as much as you can about who worked on the movie, music, or game you are reviewing. Find out who was involved in what roles, and write this information down.


Much of the basic information you need will usually be found in the credits, for movies and games. For music recordings, you may have to do some more independent research to find out who all the musicians are, who the producer is, etc.
Find out what projects the key artists have been involved in in the past, and ready anything you can find about them.It's also a good idea to look at reviews for similar movies, music, or games. If you aren't a regular reader of such reviews, spending some time familiarizing yourself with how others have written about similar media will give you a better sense of the format and conventions., If you have time, it's also a good idea to immerse yourself in other works from the same artists or game companies who produced the media you are reviewing.


It can be ver y helpful to make comparisons in your review to previous works by the same artists.This allows you to make statements such as ""This album is much more melodic than the band's previous work"" or ""This film is par for the course for this director. All he ever seems to produce are silly slapstick comedy films.""

, Once you are well acquainted with the media product you are reviewing, you need to decide what you think of it, overall. What is it you hope to say about it?


Keep in mind that, depending where you hope to publish your review, you will typically only have 600 to 1,200 words to get you ideas across.Some reviewers find it helpful to think of reviews in narrative terms: what story do you want to tell about this movie, album, or game?Some writers like to create an outline to determine which points they want to make and in what order. This can lead to a more smoothly flowing review., Most reviews start with an introduction that includes basic information about the film, music, or game.It should also tell the reader what the main theme or idea is (if there is one) and give the reader a general impression of your opinion of the media product.The introduction may be one paragraph or a few short paragraphs.It should include information about who the key artists involved are.The introduction should give the reader a general idea of what the film or game is about, or for music, what style or genre the music is.

, The next section of your review should describe the film, game, or music in greater detail. It may also discuss your personal experience with viewing, hearing, or playing it for the first time.For example, was the theater crowded with excited movie fans, or was it empty and quiet? Did listening to the album make you feel happy? Sad? Did playing the game get your heart racing?
For a movie or game, this is the portion of the review where you would describe the plot. Don't spoil the ending--remember that your readers may not have seen the movie or played the game yet.As a rule of thumb, it's a good idea to describe at least five events that occurred in the story, spanning most of the plot for movie reviews.For a plot-driven game, this probably also works well.

, Next, it's time to give your impressions of the film, game, or music. Refer back to your notes to find examples of things you did and didn't like as you evaluate the movie, music, or game on the basis of both it's technical merits and content.


It should be very obvious whether or not you enjoyed the media you are reviewing.It should also be very clear why you did or didn't like it.Be detailed in your evaluation of the actors/musicians, plot/lyrics, as well as the lighting, graphics, production, and other relevant technical themes.Don't, for example, say, ""the graphics were bad."" Describe what it was that bothered you about the graphics. Were they too pixelated? Were the characters to blocky? Were the scenes too dark? Were the backgrounds distracting? Be specific!

, The conclusion of the review should sum things up, reminding the reader of your general impressions. It may also give advice or a specific recommendation.For example, you might say, ""If you like heavy metal that sounds like it came out in 1987, you might enjoy this record. But if you're looking for something with a more modern sound, I recommend skipping this.""

, After you've finished your review, move on to something else for a while. Don't look at it for a few hours, or even a whole day or more if you can spare the time.Taking some time away from your review will make it easier to see the flaws in it when you come back to it later.

, Next, closely read your review, looking for mistakes, awkward phrasing, or other features you might want to change.


It goes without saying that you should fix any typos you find. You should also look for sentences that might be confusing, or places where you could have stated things more effectively.Don't be afraid to make major revisions. You might decide, for example, to move, delete, or rewrite an entire paragraph. If it makes the review better, then embrace this opportunity to improve your work., When you are satisfied with your review, pass it along to a friend or family member to read. She or he can let you know if everything makes sense and if they spot any errors.Someone else will be more likely to spot typos or grammatical errors than you might be at this point.
Ideally, this should be someone who is already familiar with the type of media you are reviewing. Giving a review of a new first-person shooter to someone who hasn't played a video game since the 1970s might not be the most helpful.

, When everything is finished, turn your review in to the editor of the publication or website you hope will be publishing it. Then, wait to hear if your review has been accepted or not.


It's possible the editor will ask you to make some more revisions before the review is published. Other times, the editor will makes changes him or herself.Don't be surprised if the published review doesn't look exactly like the one you submitted.

Once you have written your brief, consider the following:

,
To generate the table of contents, go to the front of your brief where you want the table to appear.,
Pick okay and you have your table.,
If you think making table of contents without using styles and the tools mentioned above is easier, that is fine.",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org9,", Hover your pointer over Insert, and go down to Indexes and Tables. Then chose the middle ""Indexes and Tables."" Here, you can insert a title. I just leave this blank because I set up my brief template with the title ""Contents"" already there. Now, uncheck the box that says, protect against manual changes. This is very important. You want to be able to tweak things after the table is generated.

, Now, if you notice at the top, it chooses a whole different style for this table, ""Contents 2."" Modify this style to your liking and save that just like you did with your heading styles. Save that style so you have a consistent style for your table of contents every time. Now one really cool feature here is that you can right click on the table of contents and ""Update Index/Table."" This is great for when you made changes to your brief. Perhaps you added a new heading or you wrote more and the page numbers are different. The changes will instantly be reflected. One problem, however, is that once you update, any formatting changes you made after the table was first generated will be erased.

, But consider this, if you don't use the above tools, your pdf file at the end of the process will not be navigable based on the contents. Pdf files you can navigate are really useful.

Mark each case or statute so it shows up later when we generate the table of authorities.,
Marking your cases.,
Some citations will be the short form version (for example, Brown v. Board, supra, 123 U.S. at p.,
Once you are done with the cases, locate the statutes.,
Working back and forth with the search tool and the index tool is not a perfect system, but it is pretty fast with practice.

,
Go to where you want the table to appear.,
Because we just marked the entries as they appeared, you will notice some redundancies.,
One thing you will need to do manually is italicize or underline the case name while leaving the rest of the citation normal.",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org10," This is where lawyers can save a lot of time if they are smart about it. You will be using two tools at the same time, the Insert Index Entry tool and the Find and Replace tool. Open both tools. The Index Entry tool can be opened by going to Insert, and scrolling down to the Indexes and Tables button. The Find and Replace tool can be opened quickly with control+F.

, Figure out a good set of letters that will locate all or most of your cases and enter it into the find box. For me, I choose ""cal."" which locates all California citations in the document. When you get to your first case, simply highlight the entire case citation and click one time into the ""entry"" box. The citation will automatically appear. Then click insert. You just marked that entry. Now go on to your next citation, using the search tool, and do the same thing. Every entry will appear darker on your screen. Don't worry, it will not print that way.

, 45.). When marking these, you could go back to the original full citation, copy, and paste it in the entry for the short form citation. Trust me on this, don't bother. It is not time efficient. Just mark the short form as it appears. Later, when creating the table of authorities, you will have to deal with some redundancies and extra clean-up, but it is still quicker to do it this way.

, Again, just mark them as they appear to save time. Use key letters or words to quickly locate each statute. For example, I use ""section"" to locate the statutes. If you're working with federal law, you might use ""U.S.C.""

,, Scroll down ""Indexes and Tables"" and the same box will appear that appeared for the table of contents. This time, where is says ""type"" choose ""Alphabetical Index."" Uncheck the box saying ""protect against manual changes."" As with the table of contents, we want to be able to do some tweaking if needed. Also, make sure the box ""combine identical entries"" is checked but uncheck all other boxes below it. By doing this, multiple page numbers will appear for each citation. Then press okay and you have your table. If you notice, this table will be assigned its own style called ""index 1."" Modify and save this style to your liking.

, For example, you might see ""In re Paul (2001) 55 Cal.App.4th 200....2, 4."" Then, right below it, you might see the short version that you marked separately because you're lazy and I told you to: ""In re Paul, supra, 55 Cal.App.4th at p. 204....6"" To fix this, just delete the lower short version and add page ""6"" to the full version above.

, Again, just like with the table of authorities, the cool part at this point is that you can right click and update table/index if you made changes to your brief. This is really useful because, otherwise, manually trying to figure out the different page numbers for your cites after you made changes is very time consuming. But you will have to re-do some of the formatting and cleaning up of the table of authorities.

Just push the pdf botton or go to file, export to pdf.",How to Write Legal Briefs With Openoffice.Org11," I would try out your pdf document in adobe reader or a similar program and see if it is navigable through a table of contents.

If you’re rejected, don’t give up.",How to Write for Major Magazines," The pitch is an introduction to the story you’d like to do for a magazine; it gives the editor a general idea about the story itself, as well as your own writing abilities. When choosing an idea for your pitch, think about subjects that matter to you. You don’t need to interview the next president, but you do need it to be something compelling, that other people will relate to.


If you’re interested in human interest stories, look to your local paper. Maybe you can find a short piece on a person that you can interview and turn into a longer piece.
Think local and global at the same time. That is, what’s happening locally that reflects something that a large number of other people will be interested in?;
, You want to be at least something of an expert on your topic before you write it. Plus, you want to make sure your idea will make a good article before you pitch it.


You don’t want to be approved for an idea that you find out later you can’t write. Therefore, it's important to research your topic thoroughly so you know what you're getting yourself into.

, Make sure your idea is the perfect fit for the magazine you choose for submission. Also, ensure that you read a few previous issues to understand exactly what kind of content they publish.


If you don’t want to spend too much money buying back issues, search for old copies of the magazine in the library, or purchase cheap copies at a used book store.

, If possible, research the editor and what kind of articles they have accepted in the past. This will give you an idea of what they look for in a story and allow you to tailor your pitch/article to their preferred style.

, Most magazines have their submission guidelines posted on their website. Look for length restrictions, as well as style guidelines; magazines will either want you to follow an established style guideline (like AP) or use one they have created.


Style guidelines will tell you things like how to write numbers, when to use a serial comma, and how to capitalize titles. These may sound like minor details, but getting them right can make a positive impression on the editor, as it shows them that you've done your homework.
The submission guidelines should also tell you what kind of content the magazine is looking to use.

, It's important to keep your pitch short, usually less than a page — just like a cover letter. At most, it should be a page and a half.


If the pitch is too long, the editor will be more likely to just skim over it and potentially miss the main point of the article. Keeping it short allows them to easily grasp what you want the article to say and make a quick yes or no decision.
Also be sure to keep it free of typos and grammatical errors. Like a cover letter, the pitch is where you show the editor you can write.

, In the first paragraph, explain your idea in a short, compelling manner. In the next 2-3 paragraphs, tell the editor why your story is important. Keep it to one idea per paragraph.


Next, outline how you want to execute your story. That is, when and where are you going to find your information? Who are you going to talk to? How are you going to incorporate that information into your story?
Don’t forget to include previous publications, as that shows you have writing skills. You can list a few in paragraph form or a short bulleted list.

, In the conclusion, make sure your editor knows exactly why this story should be in his or her magazine. Remember that even if you find a good story, your first task is convincing the magazine editor that it’s the right story for them.

, Writing for a magazine is a bit different than other types of writing. It is informative, but it’s also entertainment. You want to open the readers’ eyes to something they've never noticed before.


An essay your writing for class is not likely something that your professor has never read in the past, unless you are in a postgraduate program. Also, in an essay, you’re building an argument, while a magazine article is more story-based, though there is still an underlying point.
Also, the writing style for most magazine articles tends to be more short and to the point, as well as being more fact-based (unless you are writing an editorial) rather than opinion-based.
Writing an article is also different from many freelance writing jobs, as many of those are marketing-based, where the company employing you is trying to drive traffic to the site. While magazines also have this goal in mind, they tend to do it through using trending topics and entertaining readers rather than trying to trick search engines to drive their results higher.

, Again, research, research, research. The best sources are often people, so set up interviews. Make sure to record your interviews and take notes so that you have a backup system. Also, always be professional when conducting interviews: show up on time, dress nicely, and be polite.


However, you can also use other resources, of course. Check local papers, archives, and books at the local library—anything that will help you tell the story.
Just remember that more current resources are generally considered better, especially in journalism.

, Outline exactly where you want your story to go. Remember that in a journal article you want to tell the story little by little, not all at once. Keep that in mind when making your outline.

, Begin with a great hook. A hook draws your reader in. It can be a short anecdote, a joke, or a shocking fact. Make sure whatever you choose is appropriate for the venue. The hook should be relevant, drawing your reader in to the story.

, In some ways, a magazine article isn't that different from a short story. You are leading up to a climax for the reader, and you want to spin your story well. I


n that vein, make sure you keep the suspense going; that is, continue to drop in new details throughout the article, and make sure the story flows in a logical manner.

, For instance, instead of saying “June was a middle-aged housewife,” you could say, “June spends her days at home caring for her two kids. She gave up a career in accounting to take care of her family.”


The second set of sentences provides more detail, allowing more space for the reader to connect with it.

, Like all journalism, space in magazines is at a premium. You will have a set word limit; stick with it. Also, short sentences make more sense in a format like a magazine, where small columns make long sentences look longer and more confusing.

, You don’t want to draw too much on cliché, but most magazines will want you to wrap up the story nicely. Have a climax (a high point), and pull it altogether into the point your making.

, After you have finished writing, have someone proofread both your pitch and article for grammatical errors. There is a good chance they will pick up on errors that you missed. Also remember to go back and make sure that your story will fit into the submission guidelines.

, Not only is the deadline basically a contract with the magazine, but also you will build a good reputation by always being on time. If you miss your deadline, the magazine and editor will be less inclined to want to work with you again in the future.

, Many writers are rejected a number of times before they are accepted somewhere. Try your story at other places until one of them accepts it. Even if you can’t find a home for your current article, try another one; eventually, you’ll find one that an editor loves.

",How to Write Dystopian Fiction," Some people like write, while others prefer typing. If you want to hand write, you'll need lined paper or a notebook, a pencil, and an eraser. It would also be handy to carry a notebook around, so you can jot down any ideas that come to you. Look at the Things You'll Need list for a more details.;
, It would be a good idea to look at them in different formats. The movie for Divergent is coming out in the spring and the book has already been written. You could also look at Blade Runner, Hunger Games and the Phoenix Files. Think about what is different from today and why this has happened.

, When writing dystopian, you have to think of a problem with the world, government or society. Next, you must enlarge it. Government control can be an issue now, for instance, with the NSA. What if the entire government decided that its citizens must follow strict rules? What are some of the rules and how are they enforced? How would the people fight back? You should write or type any ideas you come up with.

, If it is an existing place, do some research. If it is based off a real location, learn about that location. Example: Veronica Roth set Divergent in Chicago. She'd never been to Chicago, but learned that trains run everywhere. Trains play an important part in her novel. Factor in the weather conditions. Does it snow or rain? Is it cold or dry or hot or humid or wet?

, Figure out any basic details about them, such as age, height, and name, as well as some more specific things, like fears and desires. There are some apps and websites that give you a form to fill out. Think about how the characters will change over the course of the story.

, You don't have to know every twist or turn in the story is, just at least have a basic idea of the plot events, or the beginning, middle, ad end. It's also nice to know about any spoilers or secrets that will be revealed so you can put in some foreshadowing. You should also know the main events that happen throughout.

,, Make the the beginning introduces your setting, main character, and topic. It should draw your reader in, even if you don't want to skip to the exciting parts right away. Try looking at some unique first sentences for inspiration. Unless you're going for a mysterious, creepy feel, name the setting and all the characters in the scene. Try not to tell things to the reader; rather, show them through the words and phrases you use. Do this throughout your story.

, This should be exciting, dramatic, and tense. Put everything you can into writing the body of your story. It would pay off to research and use some language features, and describe everything of importance, especially characters. The events in the beginning should lead up to the events in your middle. Again, if you want any surprises, you might want to leave a few hints, but don't make them too obvious!

, This comes when you feel like all of the action is over or you can't write any more. If this is a single story, tie up any loose ends. If you are writing a series, your end can be a cliffhanger. Before you write, think about the vibes you want the ending to have. Will it be a happy ending, or an unsatisfactory outcome? Will the main character live or die? What about his friends? Is the problem fixed completely or are there still loose ends for the characters to tie up? (If you want to write a sequel, be sure to leave some problems unsolved.)

, Go over your story and make sure that it sounds the way you want it and has correct spelling and grammar. This is more important than it sounds! Also add in any other descriptive or figurative language you can, but make sure that the story doesn't drag on. It needs to be concise, otherwise the reader will lose track and/or get bored.

, Ask a trusted friend to read your story over with you and tell you if parts are confusing, need more description, etc. Listen to their suggestions and correct anything that needs correction The more you repeat this step, the better!

, You should pick a title that sounds good and fits the story. A way to do this is by writing down quotes from the most important section of the story and listing possible titles. If you named it, ""The Intellect,"" you should make sure that the intellect in your story has emphasized intelligence or intelligence comes in handy.

, You might consider typing the final draft if you haven't already, or using a website to put it into a format. You can always just show the first draft with corrections, but that might be slightly confusing. Another option is to enter a writing contest or publish your story online. (Look up Storybird if this sounds like something you want to do.)

Come up with the idea for your horror tale.,
Decide the title for your entertaining horror piece.,
Create your horror characters.,
Consider the length of the story.,
Write.,
Come up with a good beginning.,
Come up with a good ending.",How to Write Entertaining Horror Fiction," To ensure it is more interesting than the standard rehash of horror themes already produced, come up with twists on the usual take, to throw readers off the scent and really entertain them in terrifying, horrifying ways.


Be wary of writing yet another vampire/super villain style tale. When a certain character type is everywhere in the media, it's tempting to join the bandwagon but also unoriginal and potentially less entertaining. Look beyond what's currently popular and be a trendsetter with a new horror style.
Look back over centuries of writing about horror themes. Which ones are yet to be fully explored and exploited? You'll have fun doing the research and that will flow through into your writing too.
Looking for inspiration? Try reading about the authors R.L. Stine (writer of Goosebumps and Fear Street Series), J.K. Rowling (writer of Harry Potter), K.A. Applegate (writer of Animorphs series), Stephen King (writer of world famous horror stories), Diana G. Gallagher (The Secret World Of Alex Mack series).;
, The title should fit the story without giving it away. For example, if the story is going to be about evil clowns, think of a title that reveals the presence of evil clowns, to draw people in when they see this book on a shelf. If one of the clown's names was ""Jack"" for example, you could call the book ""Jack The Clown.""


The title might include creepy, sadistic or sinister elements to make it more interesting.

, Try to think them through in as much detail as possible, to help you to describe them well and to understand their motives and actions. If you say something like ""Jack used to be a clown before the incident,"" that doesn't paint a pretty picture (much less a picture, really.) Now if you say ""Jack was a tall clown with face paint, an orange jumpsuit, and a blood-curdling voice,"" then people can begin to imagine this nefarious character's appearance and sound.

, A juvenile fiction book for readers ages 12 onward is usually about 200 pages long, or less. An adult fiction book can be over 1000 pages long, but don't get carried away. Most people like a story that wraps up in 300 to 400 pages.

, Add elements of surprise, pauses that will make the readers wanting more, detail and description, originality, unique characters, funny and scary and sad and silly parts and finally your story will come together.

, A story's beginning or foundation needs to draw readers in. It should be descriptive, imaginative and original. Let's say the beginning to your story was ""Everybody said that the chemical factory was haunted."" Would you read that, or would you read something more lively? Try adding a few descriptive words to draw readers in. Change this to: ""An icy chill shivered up my spine as the ominous shadow of the old abandoned chemical factory descended over me, filling my head with the stories my friends had told me of the mutated factory workers inside"". This latter sentence captures the reader's interest more because it is invoking the atmosphere and throwing a bone to the reader of possible terrible things having once happened there.

, In the horror genre, you can't have a character brutally murdered just to bring them back to life because you need them for the ending––it can become cheesy all too quickly. Imagine the whole story play out in your head for five minutes or so. You should get a good feeling of how you wish the characters to develop, how they all turn out in the end and who will potentially be left standing. What will the final character have at the end––a trophy in their hand or lodged squarely in their head?


Do you plan to write sequels? The ending of a story doesn't always have to mean ""the end"" if you're planning to write a sequel or series. Make the readers want to read more by adding a ""cliffhanger"" to the end of the story, creating suspense to begin your next story.
If you're planning on ending the story altogether, make the ending descriptive and exciting and don't just end it with ""the end"" or ""they lived happily ever after."" Does it have to be a happy ending? No, it can be whatever ending you want, if you want the characters to die in the end or to be eaten by a zombie or abducted by aliens, it's all up to you. If you want the characters to fall in love and get married or to defeat the mad pink poodle with razor sharp teeth he was fighting, it's your story. Remember, no one else will write it for you, the story can be whatever way you want it, it's all about imagination.

Decide on the characters you'd like to include the tale.,
Create a setting.,
Write your plot line.,
Come up with an introduction.,
Begin your first draft.,
Edit.,
Write as many drafts as you feel like.,
Create a cover.,
Finished!,
Use additional elements that are not appropriate in a children's fairy tale.,
Flesh out the characters with greater depth than for a child's fairy tale.,
Set the tale whenever you prefer but give consideration to modernizing the tale.,
Make the ending realistic.",How to Write Fairy Tales," Will there be a trapped princess? A lost lamb? Four pigs? Be inspired by other fairy tales, such as ""The Three Little Pigs"" or ""Snow White"". There are a lot of stories written by the Brothers Grimm or you can check out the massive collection of fairy tales in the Andrew Lang colored fairy tale books.;
, A broken down castle? A farm in the middle of nowhere? Write a couple of sentences describing your setting. Describe it in good detail, so as to make it seem real.

, A good way to do this is by drawing a rainbow shape across the page. Then, start at the bottom right and work your way up. The arch of the rainbow should be the climax, where the story is at its worst. It should get better from there (if it's a story with a happy ending.)

, There are the standard classics, such as: ""Once upon a time..."" ""In a land far, far away..."" ""Long ago when..."", and the like. However, if you're creative enough, you can come up with a much more imaginative introduction on your own. How about ""Legend says.."" or ""Deep in the heart of the woods..""

, Start with your chosen introduction and begin with the main character doing an action. Is she running through the forest, sitting at home reading, or doing something else? Remember that fairy tales are almost always fairly short, so unless you want to write a novel in the fairy tale genre, keep the story succinct and tightly written.

, When you are done with your draft, edit it. Spell check, look for structural issues, and more. That draft will be your second draft.

, The fairy tale could take two drafts, three, four, five, or 100! Just try to make sure all the spelling is correct.

, You can go without a cover, have someone else make it, or draw it yourself. It should be a reflection of the story and be interesting.

, When you have finished, read it to an audience. Read it to kids, your family and the neighbors. If they like it, you might even try to publish it.

, For example, an adult's fairy tale can delve much deeper into the turmoil of emotions experienced by human beings. And adult fairy tale can include sexual intimacy, exploration in depth of challenging emotions, and even violence and depravity; however, do not use these additions to get out of writing well. The fairy tale must still hold together well, make good sense and be treated sensitively and maturely.

, Adults will be keen to understand the motivations that underlie a character's supposed goodness or evil nature. What has caused the character to see him- or herself as a good person? What flaws does that character have in spite of trying to be as good as possible?


Never make a character without flaws––this is unrealistic and readers find such characters a royal pain and can't wait for them to be killed off quickly. On the other hand, never make the evil character plain evil––occasionally write moments which show what drove the character to see the world as a hateful place and to only wish to commit bad deeds.
Explore the interface between good and bad and how this too is messy and unclear, and how what seems good can sometimes turn evil and vice versa. Often, the sense of what is good and what is bad is in the eye of the beholder or the pen of the storyteller, so have some responsible fun exploring this.

, While the past seems to be a traditional time for many fairy tales, it is also fascinating to place a fairy tale in the here and now. This can be fun for you as the writer too, as you can explore how modern day realities impact the tropes of the standard ""set-in-the-past"" fairy tale and can lead to humorous and entertaining outcomes. It can also highlight that the underlying morals, warnings and hopes of the fairy tale genre still have applicability in modern day life.

, It doesn't have to be a happy ending. It doesn't even have to be a sad ending. It can be an ending that befits with the modern way of thinking about the world, an ending that throws up more questions in the face of the complexity of living that human beings constantly do battle with. Of course, use all of the appropriate skills to produce an ending that is interesting but don't feel obliged to comply with either killing off the villain or ensuring the married couple rides off into the sunset. Stick to being original and come up with an ending that leaves the reader thinking.

Schedule interviews.,
Review documents.,
Interview clients in a safe atmosphere.,
Ask open-ended questions.",How to Write an Assessment for Social Work1," Most of the information that a social worker incorporates into a social work assessment comes from direct reports from all parties involved with a case.


Begin by interviewing the person who is seeking services. If possible, interview family members, former case workers, physicians, teachers, and other people who you can inform you of your client’s situation.;
, You can add to your information by consulting important documents. These might include psychiatric, educational, vocational or medical tests as well as agency records.


Keep a record of all sources used for your assessment. In the assessment you will want to record who you interviewed, any incidents you were able to observe, and any documents you consulted. , The most important part of the assessment process is creating a rapport with your client and other interviewees that would encourage them to divulge information honestly. Focus on obtaining information about the client’s needs and the resources that would help fulfill those needs.Create a safe atmosphere when conducting interviews by explaining the rules of confidentiality to the interviewees. In general, all information obtained in the interview will remain a part of the report and that you will not share the information with people who are not involved with the case.
To elicit positive responses, focus on finding the strengths of the client. Do not apportion blame. Negotiate with the client over a mutually agreed assessment.When you encounter resistance, be optimistic so as not to discourage your client. Continue to be polite, punctual, and attentive. Refrain from using jargon., These require the person to respond with detailed answers. Questions requiring only a yes or no answer will not produce enough information for you to write an assessment that can be used to set goals and determine a treatment plan. For example, instead of asking if the client is angry with another individual, ask them to explain how they feel about them.


Have an assessment form on-hand during your interviews. Assessment forms include specific questions. Using an assessment form will help focus your interview and allow you to take thorough notes. Many facilities have their own assessment forms available for the interview process

"
"
Recognize the flexibility of the writing process.,
Ascertain the problem.,
Find strengths and solutions.,
Think about the client “ecologically.” Remember that the client is influenced by a wider social “ecology” that includes his family, school, workplace, the community, and the wider sociocultural context.,
Use the assessment as part of the therapeutic process.",How to Write an Assessment for Social Work2," There is not necessarily a single way to write an assessment. This can cause trepidation because you will need to find your own voice, but it does allow you to write the report as you think is best for your particular case.Include as much information as possible. Describe the client's personal appearance, whether or not the client was appropriately dressed for the weather on the day of the interview, the client's personal hygiene, ability to maintain eye contact, and the client's mental orientation (awareness of person, place, time and event).
Many facilities have standardized forms that direct you to describe specific questions about the client. One example of categories for an assessment include: “presenting problem,” “problem history,” “personal history,” “substance abuse history,” “family history,” “employment and education,” and “summary treatment and recommendations.”Another example of such categories include: “identifying information,” “referral,” “presenting problem,” “sources of data,” “general description of client,” “family composition and background,” “educational background,” “employment and vocational skills,” “religious involvement,” “ health conditions,” “psychological background,” “social, community, and recreation activities,” “basic life necessities,” “legal concerns,” “client strengths,” “clinical summary,” and “goals and recommendations.”

, The most basic function of the assessment is to determine what the social worker is trying to accomplish with the client. Reports are often written in a narrative form that tells the story of the client's current problems and how and when those problems initially appeared. It is important to do this in a way that would not offend the client.


It is often best to refrain from using technical diagnoses, like borderline personality disorder. These can offend the client. Furthermore, they are often not as useful as detailed, specific characterizations of the individual in question., You should make an effort to ascertain the strengths and resources of the client, as well as the community that he is part of. Think about how these can be used to improve the client’s condition.Set specific goals for the client that are time-limited and attainable. If a goal is to stop using drugs, for example, your treatment recommendation should include a referral to a substance abuse program that requires the client attend a set number of meetings and submit to random drug screenings, and a target date for completion of the program.

, Consider how this contributes to the client’s needs or how the resources of individuals in this wider context can contribute to rectifying problems.Compare and contrast the client's perception of his problems, needs, weaknesses and strengths with the perceptions of other people you interviewed for the assessment. Such a comparison can provide you with a more complete understanding of the client's goals and treatment needs.

, Use the occasion of writing the assessment to think comprehensively about how to improve the client’s situation. Share a summary of the assessment with the client. This can encourage him to reevaluate his situation and might help him reach his own conclusions about how to precede. Try to negotiate a consensus rather than unilaterally imposing your own assessment.Schedule a follow up meeting with the client after you've written and discussed the assessment to review the client's progress towards completing each goal. Return to the assessment periodically to evaluate the client’s development

Start early.,
Conduct an internet search.,
Gather reliable information with a citable source.,
Research the industry.,
Contact members for details.,
Read and make notes.,
Plan your article.,
Gather and analyze data.,
Start writing.,
Proofread and edit.",How to Write an Article About an Organisation," Begin your research early. Especially if you have a deadline, don't wait until the last minute to write your article. Instead, find spare time here and there to learn more about the organization.;
, The online presence of an organization can tell a lot about their branding and give a staring point. Gather information about what industry it is in and how big it is, visit the official website and social media sites of the organization, and find some interesting quotes. It's a good idea to look at online reviews, too.

, Use financial statements, annual statements, strategy plans, and other publishings of the organization.

, Find out what kind of market the organisation is operating on, who the stakeholders and competitors are. If you know how the industry works, you'll be able to understand the organization's workings more easily.

, Talk to an employee about the quality of the work environment. Email a manager asking about about future growth. This is a great thing to do whether you're working with a small-scale company or a multinational organization.

, Focus on topics you want to write about. If you want to give a overall write up, read more broadly. If you want to be more detailed, focus on some area in your reading. You might want to focus on an event such as recent market entry or focus on a trend such as development in the past two years.

, The key is to write down a list of points that will each become a paragraph or two. This is important so that you don't stray away from what is important and stick with an efficient way of writing. The basic components should be the introduction, issues you want to highlight, and the conclusion. Depending on the size of you report, you might want to have a executive summary or abstract near the beginning or other things such as discussion of future potential. Be sure you mention the good and bad parts of your topic.

, Try organizing your data, if you are gathering it yourself, in a table through Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Put the numbers together and see if your data matches what the organization advertises. If you are using a premade data analysis, find some indicators both for the industry and other key competitors that you can compare with the organisation and make those into tables.

, You can start writing even when your plan isn't quite finished. Make sure you flesh out each point well and make the article easy to understand. Explain your points well, since most of the readers of your article will not understand the topic or the industry as well as you do. It is a good idea to write fewer points and elaborate well on them than write about a lot of things and not explain those things.

, Get someone who is not an expert to read it and make sure it is clear. Edit carefully for language and style. Don't hesitate to get as much help as needed with proofreading and editing so that you know your article is clear, precise, and interesting.

Determine the content of your piece.The content of your piece will greatly affect the tone of your piece.,
Brainstorm.",How to Write an Attention Getter1," For academic work, your attention-grabbing introduction is not your thesis, but it should lead up to it, and draw the reader in by articulating some point of your paper topic in a way that is both coherent, and applicable to the following text. For narrative—whether it’s personal or fictional—the first line is the first impression the reader has on the world of your story and whoever you’ve (re)created within it.


Academic paper. If you’re writing a serious, academic article, you’ll want an introduction that is clear, articulate, and intelligent.
Creative Nonfiction. What is meant by creative nonfiction is some sort of anecdote; these range from travel writing, to a personal story, to a biographical type of literature. They can be humorous, strictly factual and straightforward, and everything in between. One thing is for certain: at their core, there is a true story.
Fiction. The genre of fiction encapsulates everything else; whether it’s a novel about fairy princesses and dragons, or a simple short story about a man walking his dog; although it can be based on fact, at its core, fiction is made up and never actually happened.

, Don't be afraid to try different ways of starting your piece. If you're feeling brave, you can even combine them for an extra-strength, unique feel that's completely your own.

"
"
An applicable, intriguing example.,
A provocative question.,
A paradox.,
Historical review.,
A surprising statement.,
Declarative statement.",How to Write an Attention Getter2," This is an excellent choice for academic writing, and is most effectively paired with a counter-example thesis. First, you'll state a common misconception as your topic sentence. Then, after listing examples, you tie this in to your thesis.


Example: Shakespeare’s plays are littered with archetype damsels in distress: Ophelia, Juliet, and Hermia all spring to mind. However, this is by no means the case with all of Shakespeare’s Women—in fact, Rosalind in As You Like It holds more power than any other character in the play.;
, Perhaps, if you’re writing on a war or battle, initially frame the paper in asking the question: “What if this didn’t happen?” It’s an excellent way to examine the effects of the war on both sides. This is by no means the only provocative question to ask, and there are certainly many more depending on the topic of the paper; just make sure to tie the question into the thesis.Example: The American Civil War is a horrific scar that has marred the American past since it’s conclusion in 1865. This begs the question: was it really necessary--would the economy that depended so much on slavery eventually have burnt itself out?

, Paradoxes are difficult to articulate well. That being said, they are also very effective in conveying contrasting emotions, feelings, or even sides in a very short span of writing. They hold a great amount of gravity, and should be used sparingly to increase their effect.Example: With the explosion of the first atomic bomb came the advent of the greatest weapon of war the world has ever seen—soon, though, it was to be used to bring a new peace to a broken world.

, Immediately placing your paper in historical context can be very helpful and give a solid, interesting start to the piece. This technique can be applied to a huge variety of situations, ranging from specific people, to current events, to past events, to ongoing cultural change. With this, it’s best to start with a very specific example that can be applied to the topic as a whole.Example: “It was April, 1865, and the air was thick with joy and tension at the Appomattox Courthouse.”

, This is a very similar statement to the intriguing fact example above, and should be used in a similar way. However, instead of starting with the common misconception, you should start with the shocking fact and then tie that into your thesis.Example: Archaeological evidence has recently started to indicate that Native Americans were among the tallest races in history. In fact, their height seems to be roughly the same as Norwegians of the same era, which may be reason to believe that Native Americans were actually the descendants of Norse-Mongoloid relations.

, The purpose of a declarative statement is to come straight out and say what your paper is about. One problem with this is the increased danger of a boring start. However, if the topic of your paper is interesting enough, it may be a good way to go.Example: Einstein’s Theory of Relativity shaped much more than the scientific world of the 20th Century; his work had a great effect of the social structure of pre and post World War Two America as well.

"
"
The “place holder.” Essentially, the “place holder” introduction is a vague allusion to the topic of your paper.,
Over repetition.,
The Webster’s Dictionary definition.,
The “Since the beginning of time….” Like the Webster’s definition, this too is self-explanatory.,
The book report.",How to Write an Attention Getter3," It’s a good place to start, but after you’ve written your piece, you should come back and revise it.Example: Women have fought for their rights for hundreds of thousands of years.
Example: Painting is an expression of the human soul.
Example: World War One was a horrific period in human history.

, Here, repetition of the main point of the paper is used in (close to) every sentence. While repetition has a very powerful rhetorical role, it can be overdone, especially in the introduction. That being said, don’t be afraid to keep the central idea apparent in the introduction, but do come up with more ways to state your point.Example: Salt built the Roman Empire. While salt’s importance may seem trivial today, salt was one of the most important goods used by the Romans. Salt's importance came from its many uses, and it was also very prominent indicator of status, and was even used as a tool for rebellion. Salt was important because it linked the classes together.

, This is pretty self-explanatory: beginning your paper with “Webster’s Dictionary defines….” It’s a bit of a cliché, and looking up a dictionary definition is something anyone can do. A better idea is to define the central topic of your essay within the context of your class, or even from an original viewpoint, and then tie that into your thesis.Example: Webster’s Dictionary defines diversity as “the condition of having or being composed of differing elements : variety; especially : the inclusion of different types of people (as people of different races or cultures) in a group or organization.” Therefore, it is easy to see why diversity is so important to society.

, Starting a paper with “Since the dawn of humanity…,” or something similar, is a bit generic and often overdone. It also is very difficult to forge a meaningful link to your thesis. A better way to start is to draw a similarity between a well-known historical figure, or even bring up an interesting ancient historical fact that you could draw the reader in with, and eventually tie into your thesis.Example: Mankind has always strived to create.

, Although a comfortable classic, the book report introduction is no way to hook a reader. Even though beginning a paper with a straightforward, logical statement may seem look like a good place to begin, it’s usually very bland.Example: Queen Victoria came to power in 1837, and her reign lasted more than 60 years.
Example: Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776.

"
"
Surprising Statement.,
Declarative Statement.,
Paradox.,
Historical Review.,
Memorable, Poignant Dialogue.,
Imagery.",How to Write an Attention Getter4," Sometimes, especially for travel writing or personal storytelling, catching the reader off guard can be a good way to start a piece—especially if you’re writing about an embarrassing situation.


Example: The curry had not been kind to me the night before.
Example: It was a muggy Madrid day, and I’d just been pooped on by a sparrow.
Example: Just before a date with the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen, I forgot to brush my teeth—and there was no gum in sight.

, If surprising your reader at the onset of your piece isn’t your aim, then a simple declarative statement may be a better way to go. This isn’t to say that it holds less literary merit or power than a surprising statement, though; declarative statements, when used correctly, can be very effective in establishing a relationship with your reader and the qualities of your main character as well.


Example: I never intended to like Paris.
Example: As it turns out, on a bus ride around the desert, air conditioning is optional.
Example: From the moment I saw rusted bumper sticking out under the tarp, I knew it had to be mine—and I didn’t even know what kind of car it was.

, Paradoxes are powerful rhetorical tools and should be used sparingly to maximize effectiveness. They’re also pretty tricky to articulate. That being said, if you’ve got a good one, use it.


Example: There I was, a Christian learning about God from an Atheist.
Example: In the sweltering, death-ray heat of the Atacama Desert—the most lifeless place on earth—I learned how to live, and live well.
Example: I never learned to listen until I lost my hearing.

, Placing your location (or yourself) in history is an effective way to draw in the reader and generate heaping amounts of relatability and context at the same time. These are particularly effective in a biographical-type piece.


Example: It was the Summer of Love, and I was a nineteen-year-old kid with a crew cut who’d stumbled his way onto Haight-Ashbury.
Example: Fredrick Douglass was his own man—a man who fled the tyranny of slavery in 1838 at the age of 20.
Example: The aqueduct dated back some 2,000 years, and as soon as I pressed my 20th-century hand against its stone, I was flooded with the weight of history.

, Dialogue is a great way to start a piece because it establishes a relationship between characters in the story, and therefore creates a creates a relationship with the reader. You can also tell a great deal about a person by how they speak.


Example: “Marty, don’t forget your lunch,” Mom yelled out the window of her blue station wagon. “Oh, and have a great first day at school.”
Example: “No,” she said. “I don’t think you understand.”
Example: “Wait,” I said. “We needed to bring our passport?”

, Another excellent way to set the tone of your story—and give setting as well—is to describe the story’s location. The key, though, is to be specific. The one problem with opening with an image (especially in travel writing) is the use of a cliché. Don’t be afraid to give some thought to what you’re saying and put your own spin on it.


Example: The woman’s dress—white as flame, and garnished with mountains of rhinestones—ripped through the hot afternoon air.
Example: In the autumn of 1994, I somehow managed to eek out beyond the reach of the herds of New Yorkers, and found myself drowning in a sea of leaves, which burned hot against the cool clouds of Maine.
Example: Both sides gathered on the massive battleship USS Missouri, which hovered prominently over the depths of Tokyo Bay.

"
“The most beautiful…in the world.” Superlatives should be avoided at all costs; it makes you come across as ignorant, and therefore creates a large amount of distance between you and your reader.

,
“A trip back in time.” While nostalgia is a powerful tool when writing creative nonfiction, almost any location can be used as a place to “look into the past.”

,
“There’s something for everyone.” While this may very well be true, using this in your description—especially in the introduction—is a good way to immediately lose your specific angle on the destination.

,
“Nestled in the….” Although a decent enough image, almost any location can have something about it that’s nestled somewhere.,
“…is a place of contrasts.” On top of this phrase being used constantly, it also could be applied to any location.,
“…is colorful/vibrant.” This opener makes the reader want to know what the colors were, so you should describe them in the first place.,
“…’s rich history.” This is makes the reader ask themselves “what happened?” Because of this, if you want to focus on the history of your location, begin with an interesting fact about wherever it is you’re writing about—it’s much more engaging, and it immediately creates intimacy with the reader.

,
“Crystal clear water.” Comparing jewels to water, although a fairly effective image, is way overdone.,
“Panoramic Views.” Sometimes, there are places that do offer panoramic views, but describing a view of the Himalayas as ""panoramic"" isn’t going to do most people very much good at all.,
“Breathtaking.” The problem with this word is that it’s often used in an over-exaggerated way; chances are, the author’s breath wasn’t actually taken away by what they saw, and if it was, chances the reader won’t believe them.",How to Write an Attention Getter5,",,, Instead of using this cliché, work words like burrowed, bundled, engulfed, situated, or surrounded into your introduction. They will create a more authentic and original take on the location.

In general, argumentative essays require you to support the argument you are making using logic and support from your research. You should also be sure to include in your argumentative essay:a thesis statement that makes a clear argument (provided in the first paragraph)
logical transitions that connect paragraphs and sentences
claims that help prove your overall argument
support for your claims from your sources
a conclusion that considers the evidence you have presented
in-text citations throughout your essay to indicate where you have used sources (ask your teacher about what citation style to use)
a works cited page with an entry for each if your sources (ask your teacher about what citation style to use)

, While most argumentative essays share these basic features, your assignment might have some special requirements or guidelines. Therefore, it is important to make sure that you understand your assignment before you get started. As soon as your teacher assigns the paper, read the guidelines carefully and highlight anything that you do not understand. Ask your teacher to clarify the instructions if anything seems unclear or if you just don’t understand the assignment.


Make sure that you understand how to cite your sources for the paper and how to use the documentation style your teacher prefers.
Don’t feel bad if you have questions. It is better to ask and make sure that you understand than to do the assignment wrong and get a bad grade.

, It is important to take time to explore your ideas before you choose a topic and start your paper. Take some time to explore your ideas and get some things down on paper by using an invention activity. Invention activities like listing, freewriting, clustering, and questioning can help you to develop ideas for your argumentative essay.Listing List all of the ideas that you have for your essay (good or bad) and then look over the list you have made and group similar ideas together. Expand those lists by adding more ideas or by using another prewriting activity. Freewriting Write nonstop for about 10 minutes. Write whatever comes to mind and don’t edit yourself. When you are done, review what you have written and highlight or underline the most useful information. Repeat the freewriting exercise using the passages you underlined as a starting point. You can repeat this exercise multiple times to continue to refine and develop your ideas.Clustering Write a brief explanation (phrase or short sentence) of the subject of your argumentative essay on the center of a piece of paper and circle it. Then draw three or more lines extending from the circle. Write a corresponding idea at the end of each of these lines. Continue developing your cluster until you have explored as many connections as you can.Questioning On a piece of paper, write out “Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?” Space the questions about two or three lines apart on the paper so that you can write your answers on these lines. Respond to each question in as much detail as you can., An argumentative essay requires you to demonstrate your understanding of three basic rhetorical concepts: ethos, pathos, and logos. You will need to be aware of these concepts as you write your paper and demonstrate your knowledge of them through your writing. Here’s what you need to know about ethos, pathos, and logos:



Ethos refers to a writer’s credibility or trustworthiness. To convince your readers that your argument is valid, you need to convince them that you are trustworthy. You can accomplish this goal by presenting yourself as confident, fair, and approachable. You can achieve these objectives by avoiding wishy-washy statements, presenting information in an unbiased manner, and identifying common ground between yourself and your readers(including the ones that may disagree with you).

Pathos refers to your use of emotional appeals. Emotional appeals have a place in argumentative writing, but overuse of them may lead a reader to reject your argument. Make sure that your use of emotional appeals is minimal and appropriate. Some ways that you can incorporate pathos into your paper without turning off your readers includes using descriptive language that evokes the desired reaction (positive or negative) to your subject, providing relevant examples that evoke an emotional response in your readers, using figurative language (such as metaphors) to help your readers understand and sympathize with your point of view.

Logos refers to your use of logic. You can appeal to your readers’ desire for logic by organizing your examples in a way that is easy to follow. For example, you might organize your examples, chronologically, or by cause and effect, or problem and solution.

, Once you have developed your ideas for your argumentative essay, you should be ready to write a tentative thesis statement.A tentative thesis statement can help you to move forward with your ideas while reminding yourself that you are open to changes to the thesis statement. In other words, the tentative thesis statement is not set in stone. Effective thesis statements let readers know what the main focus of a paper is going to be. For an argumentative essay, the thesis should state an arguable claim. A thesis should not be more than one sentence in length.Place your thesis statement at the end of your first paragraph unless your instructor tells you to place it elsewhere. The end of the first paragraph is the traditional place to provide your thesis in an academic essay.

, Your thesis should express a clear position on your topic that can be supported using evidence from your sources. Do not state facts or matters of taste. For example, something like ""George Washington was the first president of the United States,"" would not be a good thesis because it states a fact. Likewise, ""Die Hard is a great movie,"" would not work because it expresses a matter of taste.Consider whether your thesis statement is arguable before you move forward.


For example, an arguable thesis statement might be something like, “The drinking age should be reduced to 18 in the United States.” This statement is arguable because it presents a position that others might debate by saying “The drinking age should not be reduced to 18 in the US.” Or, others might argue that the drinking age should be abolished altogether or even raised. There are many possibilities for a counter argument, which makes this topic arguable.

, In addition to having a thesis that is arguable, you should also include some details about why you hold the position. In other words, you should avoid simply saying that something is bad and should be changed and provide a bit of detail about why it is bad and should be changed.What is wrong with the current drinking age? Who would benefit if it was changed?


For example, a detailed thesis statement might be something like, “Because youth are more drawn to drinking as a way to rebel, lowering the drinking age to 18 in the United States would help to reduce binge drinking among teenagers and college students.” This thesis still provides a position that could be debated, but it also explains the reasoning behind the position. Providing this detail gives readers a good sense of what the rest of the paper will discuss.

, Writing an outline before you begin drafting your argumentative essay will help you to organize your information more effectively. You can make your outline as detailed or as scant as you want. Just keep in mind that the more detail you include in your outline, the more material you will have ready to put into your paper.Organize your outline by essay part and then break those parts into subsections. For example, part 1 might be your introduction, which could then be broken into three sub-parts: a)Opening sentence, b)context/background information c)thesis statement.

, Before you head to the library or log on to the library’s webpage, it is important to take a moment to develop some key terms and phrases that will make the process of finding relevant sources a bit easier. You can use these key terms and phrases to search your library’s databases for relevant books, articles, and other sources. As you develop key terms, keep your topic and your position in mind.


For example, some relevant key terms and phrases for a paper on lowering the drinking age to 18 might be: “drinking”, “underage”, “minors”, “binge”, “rebellion”, “drinking age”, “binge drinking culture”, “countries with low drinking age”, “drinking and rebellion”, etc.

, In order to find support for your argument, you will need to gather a variety of sources. See your assignment guidelines or ask your instructor if you have questions about what types of sources are appropriate for your assignment. Books, articles from scholarly journals, magazine articles, newspaper articles, and trustworthy websites are some sources that you might consider using.


Use your library’s databases rather than a general internet search. University libraries subscribe to many databases. These databases provide you with free access to articles and other resources that you cannot usually gain access to by using a search engine. Schedule an appointment with a librarian at your school’s library if you are not sure about how to use the library databases.

, Use trustworthy sources only in your argumentative essay, otherwise you will damage your own credibility as an author. Using the library’s databases will also help to ensure that you are getting plenty of trustworthy sources for your paper. There are several things that you will need to consider in order to determine whether or not a source is trustworthy.Author's credentials Choose sources that include an author’s name and that provide credentials for that author. The credentials should indicate something about why this person is qualified to speak as an authority on the subject. For example, an article about a medical condition will be more trustworthy if the author is a medical doctor. If you find a source where no author is listed or the author does not have any credentials, then this source may not be trustworthy.Citations Think about whether or not this author has adequately researched the topic. Check the author’s bibliography or works cited page. If the author has provided few or no sources, then this source may not be trustworthy.Bias Think about whether or not this author has presented an objective, well-reasoned account of the topic. How often does the tone indicate a strong preference for one side of the argument? How often does the argument dismiss or disregard the opposition’s concerns or valid arguments? If these are regular occurrences in the source, then it may not be a good choice.Publication date Think about whether or not this source presents the most up to date information on the subject. Noting the publication date is especially important for scientific subjects, since new technologies and techniques have made some earlier findings irrelevant.Information provided in the source If you are still questioning the trustworthiness of this source, cross check some of the information provided against a trustworthy source. If the information that this author presents contradicts one of your trustworthy sources, then it might not be a good source to use in your paper., Once you have gathered all of your sources, you will need to read them. Make sure that you read your sources very carefully and that you stay focused on your topic as you read. Read the sources multiple times if necessary and make sure that you fully understand what each source is about. You should be able to summarize the source in your own words and generate a response to the source.


To be certain that you understand your sources and that you are capable of responding to each of them, try writing a paragraph summary and response after you finish each one. Some people find keeping notecards on their sources to be a helpful way of organizing their ideas about each one.Misunderstanding and misrepresenting your sources can damage your credibility as an author and also have a negative effect on your grade. Give yourself plenty of time to read your sources and understand what they are saying.

, Highlight and underline significant passages so that you can easily come back to them. As you read, you should also pull any significant information from your sources by jotting the information down in a notebook. Indicate when you have quoted a source word for word in your notes by putting it into quotation marks and including information about the source such as the author’s name, article or book title, and page number.Be careful to properly cite your sources when taking notes. Even accidental plagiarism may result in a failing grade on a paper.

, Your introduction should immediately begin discussing your topic. Think about what you will discuss in your essay to help you determine what you should include in your introduction. Keep in mind that your introduction should identify the main idea of your argumentative essay and act as a preview to your essay.For example, an argumentative essay about lowering the drinking age might begin with something like, “Binge drinking culture is killing teens in the United States, but it hasn’t always been this way.” This sentence offers a compelling statement and it also acts as a launch pad for you to provide some background on your topic.

, Providing adequate background information or context will help to guide your readers through your essay. Think about what your readers will need to know in order to understand the rest of your essay and provide this information in your first paragraph. This information will vary depending on your argument topic.For example, if you are arguing that lowering the drinking age would help to counter binge drinking among teens and young adults, your introduction should talk about the damage that is being done by binge drinking. Tell your readers about this problem in more detail so that they will begin to see why something needs to change.
Keep in mind that your background information in the first paragraph should lead up to your thesis statement. Explain everything the reader needs to know to understand what your topic is about, then narrow it down until you reach the topic itself., After you have given your readers some information on the topic and captured their interest, you should provide your thesis. Providing your thesis at the end of your first paragraph will help to guide your readers through the rest of your essay. Make sure that you state your thesis is a very direct manner, so there is no mistaking that this is your position.


For example, a thesis statement for a paper on lowering the drinking age might look something like, “Because the current drinking age of 21 in the United States does more harm than good by proliferating binge drinking culture among teens, the drinking age should be lowered to 18.” This thesis provides a straightforward position and reason for that position that readers can easily identify as the author’s main argument.

, Rather than trying to talk about multiple aspects of your argument in a single paragraph, make sure that each body paragraph focuses on a single aspect of your text. Your discussion of each of these aspects should contribute to proving your thesis.For each body paragraph, you should provide a claim at the beginning of the paragraph and support your claim with at least one example from one of your sources.


For example, one of your body paragraphs might begin with something like, “Teens are more likely to engage in binge drinking in the United States than in countries where the drinking age is lower or non-existent.”
You might then follow up this claim with evidence from your sources. For example, you could provide statistics on teen drinking in other countries where the drinking age is lower, or you could summarize an interview with an authority of the subject, or cite an article that explains the psychological basis of this phenomenon. Whatever source(s) you choose, make sure that they are relevant that they offer convincing support for your claim.

, Concluding an essay is the hardest part of writing for many people, but it may make more sense if you understand the purpose of the conclusion. Your conclusion should emphasize what you have attempted to convince your readers about your topic.In other words, it should offer a final statement that touches on the major points that you have made in your essay. Before you write your conclusion, spend some time reflecting on what you have written so far and try to determine the best way to end your essay. There are several good options for ending an argumentative essay that might help you decide how to format your conclusion. For example, you might:



Rephrase your thesis. It is often helpful to remind your readers of the initial argument, but don’t simply restate your thesis if you do this. Rephrase it so that it sounds different but has the same meaning. Summarize some of the most important evidence you have offered in your essay and say remind readers of how that evidence has contributed to supporting your thesis.

Synthesize what you have discussed. Put everything together for your readers and explain what other lessons might be gained from your argument. How might this discussion change the way others view your subject?

Explain why your topic matters. Help your readers to see why this topic deserve their attention. How does this topic affect your readers? What are the broader implications of this topic? Why does your topic matter?

Return to your opening discussion. If you offered an anecdote or a quote early in your paper, it might be helpful to revisit that opening discussion and explore how the information you have gathered implicates that discussion., Before you finish working on your essay, you will need to make sure that you have cited all of your sources using the proper format. Not citing your sources using in-text citations or a works cited page may be considered plagiarism by your professor and lead to failure of the assignment or even the course.Ask your teacher what documentation style he or she prefers that you use if it is not mentioned in the assignment guidelines.
Visit your school’s writing center for additional help with your works cited page and in-text citations.

, By taking a break after you have finished drafting your paper, you will give your brain a rest. When you revisit the draft, you will have a fresh perspective. It is important to begin writing a paper far enough ahead of time to allow yourself a few days or even a week to revise before it is due. If you do not allow yourself this extra time, you will be more prone to making simple mistakes and your grade may suffer as a result., Revision is just as important, if not more important, than the drafting phase of writing a paper. Therefore, you will need to give yourself time to do a thorough revision of your paper. Plan to finish writing your draft at least a few days before the final version is due. Giving yourself plenty of time can help you avoid simple mistakes like typos and punctuation errors, as well as major problems such as poor logic or faulty arguments.

, As you revise your paper, you should consider multiple aspects of your writing to make sure that your readers will be able to understand what you have written. Consider the following questions as you revise:


What is your main point? How might you clarify your main point?
Who is your audience? Have you considered their needs and expectations?
What is your purpose? Have you accomplished your purpose with this paper?
How effective is your evidence? How might your strengthen your evidence?
Does every part of your paper relate back to your thesis? How might you improve these connections?
Is anything confusing about your language or organization? How might your clarify your language or organization?
Have you made any errors with grammar, punctuation, or spelling? How can you correct these errors?
What might someone who disagrees with you say about your paper? How can you address these opposing arguments in your paper?, Read your paper out loud to make sure that it is polished and ready for your teacher to read it. Use your final read through as a chance to weed out any typos, grammatical errors, wordy or incomplete sentences, and other minor mistakes that may have a negative effect on your grade. Highlight or circle these errors and revise as necessary before printing your final copy.

Get feedback, if possible.",How to Write Effectively," Are you writing something for a school assignment? Writing an e-mail or letter to a friend? Writing creatively? Different types of writing have different goals, and you'll need to identify the purpose of your piece to write it effectively.


Look at your assignment sheet or writing prompt to find the purpose of school projects. If it's a question, your purpose is to answer the question.
If you're writing correspondence, your purpose is to update the person about your life, to communicate, or to respond to their writing.
If you're writing a story or poem, your purpose is to entertain.;
, If you're writing a card to your spouse, you'll want to write differently than a note to your doctor. What will the reader expect of your writing? What do they already know?

, If you can't figure out the best way to start, just start writing and see where it goes. Set a 10 minute time limit and don't stop typing or writing until the ten minutes is up, then look back to see if you found an interesting idea on which to build.


If you don't like freewriting, try talking out loud and recording it on your phone, making lists, or a mind map.

, When someone reads this piece of writing, what do you want them to learn? This could be one sentence or a few. Effective writing starts out with an interesting and complicated main idea.


If you're responding to a prompt for an assignment, your main idea should be your answer to the question being asked.
If you're writing a letter, your main idea should be some topic from your life.
If you're writing a story or poem, your main idea should be a plot, theme, or style.

, What makes your main idea true? Think of the main idea like the top of a table. It doesn't do much good without the supporting legs to hold it up. A good main idea needs lots of specific, convincing details, or it won't be worth much.


Try to come up with at least three supporting details for each main idea in your writing.

, The order you came up with your original ideas might not be the most effective order. To make your writing more effective, organize your points such that they will meet the reader's expectations and support your main ideas logically.


To learn to organize a formal outline, read this article.

, If you don't like outlining, there are a variety of other organizational tools you can use to structure your ideas:


Idea web
Flow charts
Mind maps
Lists
Diagrams

, A thesis statement is a single sentence that summarizes what the reader will learn in your writing. It needs to be clear, concise, and in the first paragraph of most writing., Ineffective writing will often attempt to create ""suspense"" or delay the main ideas to try to include ""hooks"" in the early parts of writing. It's far more effective to just get to the point and let your strong ideas do the work.

, Don't stress too much about paragraphs. Each time you change ideas, it's probably time for a new paragraph. When you've written all there is to write about each idea, start a new paragraph.

, As you're writing, include all your good supporting details for each main point, and be sure that you connect each main idea back to the thesis it should be supporting. Make the connection explicit and clear.

, Avoid vague and abstract language. Instead of writing, ""Seriously crazy weather is sometimes reported in Florida,"" use concrete details. Write, ""Summer weather in Florida is often extremely humid and damp.""

, Periodically, it's important to remind the reader why what they're reading is important, and what it should be proving. This helps to transition between sentences and paragraphs.


After introducing a supporting detail, use signpost phrases like, ""This displays..."" or ""It's important to note that...""

, Most inexperienced writers write too short, and haven't fully explained the connections between their main ideas, support, and thesis. If you're worried about running too short in your writing, focus on explaining more, not filling the draft with fluff.

, As you're writing your draft, don't worry about ""sounding smart."" The first draft of any writing needs to focus on communicating your ideas, not impressing someone with your vocabulary.

, After you finish a draft, read it with a pencil in your hand, or your finger on the delete button. If you see something that repeats a point you've already made, or wastes the reader's time, delete it. Anything that isn't working to prove the main idea is ineffective wasted space.


It's sometimes necessary to eliminate unnecessary sentences, ideas, points, sections, or even paragraphs to make a piece more effective.

, Make sure your subjects and verbs agree, and replace weak verbs to avoid passive voice. Weak verbs include ""is"" ""was"" ""be"" and ""have."" Learn to replace weak verbs with more active verbs to make your writing more vigorous.


Instead of writing ""A big crowd has been lured downtown,"" use a stronger verb than ""has been."" Try, ""The festival lured a big crowd downtown,"" replacing the verb with the stronger ""lured.""
Look for sentences that start with the word ""there"" for a quick tip to weak verbs.

, Bad writing is wordy and wastes the reader's time. Good writing is concise, cutting straight to the point. Don't use two words when a single more accurate word is sufficient.


Instead of writing ""The party was super fun and exciting,"" write, ""The party was thrilling.""

, Any sentence that involves multiple ""ands"" or semi-colons needs to be cut into more than one sentence. In general, avoid semi-colons and sentences with more than one clause.

, Does your writing accomplish what you wanted it to accomplish? Does it explain the main idea fully and clearly? If so, you're ready to move on to late concerns.

, Read over the improved draft and look for misspellings, typos, and punctuation errors. This should be one of the last things you do with a draft before it is finished.

, Ask a friend or family member to read your writing and ask them for specific feedback by having them tell you what they thought the main idea was, or having them write it at the end of the piece. Did they get it right? If not, keep working to make it more effective.

Scholarly books
Scholarly articles (within a journal or periodical, for example)
Scholarly abstracts
Websites
Images or Videos

, If you are submitting a paper for an academic course, ask your teacher which style s/he prefers. If you don't know which style you're supposed to use, the most widely used styles is generally the Modern Language Association (MLA) guide for humanities or the American Psychological Association (APA) guide for social sciences.Other styles that are popular include:



Chicago or Turabian Style for publishing
Associated Press (AP) Style for publishing
Council of Science Editors (CSE) for hard sciences

, List the author(s); use the full title of the book or the article you are citing; give the full name of the publisher; note the date of publication or the latest revision date if the source is a web page. A properly cited MLA source will look something like this:

, You want there to be a method to your madness, after all. Organizing your citations will help readers process them, as well as research them if they have any further questions. See if your teacher has a preferred method of organizing; if she doesn't organize your citations according to any one of the following methods:


Alphabetical
Chronological (either by date of publication or time period of subject matter, e.g. era, decade, etc.)
By subtopic
By format (articles, books, media, websites, etc.)
By language

, An annotation is a short, one-paragraph description of a particular source. It helps the reader place the citation in context. It also helps the reader decide whether to further consult the citation. It is different from an abstract in that it provides more contextual information than simply a descriptive summary of the work.

, Include any institutional affiliations, published works and critical reviews. Keep in mind that respected authors tend to get cited frequently by other authors and scholars.


Example: ""Currently a departmental Head of English Literature at Cambridge University, Professor XYZ earned her undergraduate degree from Princeton in 1984.""

, It's helpful to include information on a bias the author may have, especially if the author admits to having one.


Example: ""Being more inclined to approach the issue from a Marxist perspective, Professor XYZ admits that his methodology lacks a comprehensive lens.""

, Give the reader a quick sense of what the work is about.


Example: ""Marriage and Morals Among the Victorians is a book of essays that profiles notable English persons of the 19th century, examining how their outsized moral sensibilities created both conundrums and conventions during a tumultuous time.""

, Answer the question, ""Why am I using this source as a reference or authority in my research?""


Example: ""Himmelfarb profiles Benjamin Disraeli at length, delving into his complicated Prime Ministership.""

, Let the reader of the annotation know if the source is primarily academic or not, as well as whether the source is approachable to the layperson.


Example: ""Rorty's examination of American pragmatism is primarily addressed to the niche philosophical community and, as such, makes for a complicated read without the proper philosophical context.

, Note whether the source has a bibliography, glossary, or index — this can be a simple ""bibliography included."" Note also any special survey instruments, testing devices, etc.

, After summarizing, take a more critical look at the source and consider these questions:


What is the usefulness of this source to my research project?
Is the information reliable?
Is the information biased or objective? Is the information based on fact or opinion?
Is the source current or outdated?

, Note how the citation is first presented, in proper MLA style. The annotation follows the citation, briefly listing a description of the citation and putting it into context.

Your script is ready.",How to Write an Anime Script," Before anything, make sure you know your characters. If you haven't already, make a character profile. Think about how your characters would act in certain situations such as fear, embarrassment and enjoyment. Decide who is friends with who, and who is the enemy. Is the main character outgoing at school or is the loner no one knows about? Put yourself in each characters shoes and just imagine an average day being like them.;
, On a piece of paper, start of with a straight line near the bottom of the page, make it incline by a 45 degree angle and when you are near the top of the page, drop drastically with about a 80 degree angle and continue making the line near the bottom of the page. It should look like a straight line with a lopsided mountain that is closer to the right side of the page. Use this to make your story line. This can be one episode or the whole anime. The beginning where the line is straight is the beginning of the story. This is where we get to know the characters and their average life. Try to include as many characters at this point. When the mountain begins, introduce the enemy or the conflict, such as a huge earthquake, or a threat. As you continue moving up the mountain, make the problem bigger and bigger until you are at the climax. This would be the big fight scene, the time when it seems like the world will end, whatever is the worst or biggest part of the anime should be here. Once they solve the problem, you will go down the mountain. Add how they cope after or how things go back to normal. Be sure to add what characters are involved in each scene and at least 5-10 lines about what happens in each part and scene. In the end, when you read through, it should sound like a summary of the whole anime.

, When writing, do it play style. Put the person's name with a colon and what they say. If they do any specific actions, but it in quotes or stars. (Kuma: Are we lost? Shin: *pulls out map and looks at it. He begins to act nervously* I think so...)

, Be sure that what the character says is something the character would say. If a character is a serious person, don't give him any goofy or silly jokes to say. If a girl is shy, give her as little lines as possible unless she changes by the climax.

, This is your story. If you want, draw out the characters in a certain time in the story so you can look at it and imagine that scene in your head. You can skip certain parts, or even start at the climax. Because you have your plot line, you know how the story would go rather than being clueless when writing.

, When you are done, go back and make sure everything adds up. Avoid any holes or any totally arbitrary and random parts. Make sure your grammar and punctuation is right. If you want, ask a friend to read it. They may have some great ideas or additions to your story that you may not have thought of.

, If you plan on recording it and making a real anime, you can add notes about the emotion or breaks the voice actor would take. Every detail counts. Be sure to say if they would be reading a part fast or slow or if there are any other vocal actions they need to do. (Rai: Oh *breathes heavily* my *breathes heavily* GOD!!! *big sigh as he falls to the ground. A few seconds later, he groans* Ow....)

, Type and print out the good copy. If other people would be reading or acting to it, give them the character descriptions too so they get a better idea of the character. They would be able to tell if what they are saying matches up with the character they are supposed to be, so be open to ideas and changes until the end.

Create your sidekick.,
Create your villain.,
Create your story.,
Arrange your story.,
Create a title!",How to Write an Adventure Story," This is very important if you are to create an adventure story, your artifact could either be based from true objects (the Excalibur, apple of discord, etc.) or you could make one up! Does your artifact possess supernatural powers? Be free and creative! Have fun.;
, Every adventure story must have a hero or else the events will not untangle! You could choose what your protagonist could be, is he/she male or female? What's his/her educational degree? Why is he/she interested in the artifact? It's your call!

, Adventure stories are no fun if the hero goes solo, that's why you must create a sidekick (usually a leading lady, a child, etc.) Is your sidekick loyal or is he a traitor? Is he/she male or female? It's also your decision.

, Now if there's good, there is always bad, that's why you must make a villain. Is your villain alone or with some companions? Does he repent or not?

, Now this is the most fun part in making an adventure story. You get to choose, arrange and decide the fateful events in your story. Make a draft and put it aside so that when you're done making the story, you can polish your story's details. Does the villain die? Is the artifact retrieved?

, When you're done with the drafts, you must arrange your events and start to polish your adventure story's details. Here you can see the plot spaces and could change a certain event in the story.

, Since your adventure story is already done, write its title! It must be connected to your story and it must be inviting to your listeners. After making your adventure story, go share it with your friends!

,How to Write About Your Hobbies and Interests1,
"
Format your application resume by priority.,
Use appropriate terminology.,
Choose a formatting style for listed sections.,
Demonstrate well-roundedness.College admissions officers don’t expect high school seniors to know specifically what their futures will hold.,
Set yourself apart from the pack.This may seem to contradict the previous step, but you don’t want to present yourself as so well-rounded that you’re indistinguishable from all the other applicants.,
Choose language carefully to dress up your activities.",How to Write About Your Hobbies and Interests2," You likely know the basic content of a resume — education, work experience, skills, awards, and hobbies. However, listing all that information is not enough. You must put thought into the order in which that information is presented on the resume.College admissions committees are far more interested in your grades, work experience, skills and awards than they are in your hobbies and interests.
As such, the hobbies and interests section of your resume should be presented toward the end of your resume. End with it, don’t lead with it.
Prioritize individual activities as well. You can either list your activities chronologically, as you probably did in the “Work Experience” section, or from most to least impressive.
Always remember that resumes are “top-down” documents, meaning you should lead with what you most want the reader to know about you., Although you may think of tennis or chess a fun hobby, the language you use in your resume should indicate more gravity. Rather than titling your “hobbies and interests” section “Hobbies,” call it “Activities” or “Extracurricular Activities.” By using more formal diction, you subtly give the impression that you exercised dedication and professionalism in practicing these activities, rather than simply goofing around and having a good time. This is what colleges are looking for.

, All of the sections of your resume that include detailed lists should be formatted in the same way. The “Activities” section of your resume should be formatted the same way as the “Work Experience” section. There is no single correct method to use, but you want to make sure that you give yourself room to not simply list your activities, but expand on them in a concise manner.


Do not simply list all of your activities with commas. This suggests that you have nothing to say about what you did other than the fact that you did it. Break each activity into its own bullet point.
Decide whether you will write in full sentences or short phrases. A resume should not be overly long — ideally, it should fit onto a single page. If you find that your resume has too much length, use phrases rather than full sentences.
For example: “Tennis: state champions, 2013, 2014; co-captained varsity team, 2012-14; member of varsity team, 2010-14.
If your resume is not long enough and you need to develop length, you can write that same information out in full sentences: “Tennis: As a member of the varsity team from 2010 to 2014, I helped my team win the state championship in both 2013 and 2014. As co-captain from 2012 to 2014, I provided leadership both on and off the court, leading team workouts during the off-season and keeping teammates accountable to one another.”

, Although in your essays, you want to demonstrate that you have a plan for your future and lofty goals, colleges know that in reality, student plans often change as they enter coursework and develop their interests in college.


The activities section of your resume is the place to demonstrate that you don’t have a one-track mind. You have a variety of interests that can be developed over your four years in college.
If possible, present an array of activities that demonstrate an engaged, curious mind: athletics, volunteerism, academic teams, interest in both the humanities (speech team) and STEM areas (Mathletes), etc.
The more well-rounded you seem, the more appealing you will be to a committee that is trying to assess how you will develop over the next four years.

, Consider which activity you have engaged in, that most sets you apart from the rest of the applicant pool.


Demonstrate a high level of interest in at least one of your activities. If you were a team captain, elected official or an otherwise engaged member of a group, you need to highlight that as well as possible.
Describe the leadership qualities you may have developed through this activity: “As Key Club president, I chaired weekly meetings, delegated club responsibilities into committees, expanded our presence by recruited peers into volunteerism and oversaw member training before sending volunteers out into the community.”
Explain what peripheral qualities you developed: “Over my four years in the Key Club, I developed an abiding dedication to undeserved populations in local communities.”

, Much of this advice so far has assumed that you have a wide variety of impressive activities that can be easily listed on your resume. Unfortunately, this is not the case for many college applicants. While you should never fabricate activities for your resume, you can make what few activities you have seem more impressive by choosing your language carefully.


Use the active voice throughout every document you submit in the application process.The passive voice suggests that you passively received skills or qualities from your life experiences, whereas the active voice demonstrates your engagement: you earned those skills.
Note the difference between “Being on the football team taught me the importance of being a team player” and “I strengthened the team’s resolve and success by stressing to individual players the importance of group cohesion to the achievement of our goals.” Take credit wherever possible, even if you weren’t in leadership positions.
Even if you don’t think you got a lot out of an activity, think about what skills and qualities you could have developed. For example —you might have been an awful cheerleader, but you can still say “I devoted myself to grueling practices daily throughout the season and developed an effective time-management system, through which I balanced schoolwork and cheering while dedicating myself fully to both.”
Even if you’re not going to make the collegiate cheer squad, you’ve still demonstrated that you can manage your time — something you learned from cheerleading.

"
"
Decide whether or not a “Hobbies and Interests” section is appropriate for this job.,
Be brief.,
Choose the interests you include carefully.Don’t list an interest if you’re not actually passionate about it — if it comes up in an interview, your lack of passion and knowledge will give you away as a resume passer.,
Connect your interests to the job.Wherever possible, demonstrate how the skills and qualities you develop through your hobbies make you a better candidate for the position for which you’re applying.",How to Write About Your Hobbies and Interests3," Depending on the application conventions in the industry you’re applying in, it may be inappropriate to include your hobbies on your resume at all. The potential employer may find it irrelevant and you don’t want that feeling to be attached to your application.Research the corporate culture of the company you’re applying to. Some companies encourage employees to bring their interests into the creative workplace, for example, Google explicitly cultivates an “open culture” workplace where hobbies are welcomed.A hobbies section would be very appropriate for a Google application.
However, if you’re applying for a position at an accounting firm, the corporate culture may not be as welcoming of your hobbies. Leave them off that resume.

, Whereas a college admissions officer is looking to get a sense of how you might develop over the course of your undergraduate career, a potential employer wants to know, as concisely as possible, whether you would fit into the workplace or not. Don’t dwell on how you feel at one with nature when you go biking every morning if you're applying for a job with a consulting firm. Simply say that you bike regularly and participate in races.

,


Choose interests that not only mean a lot to you, but also demonstrate the kind of person you are.
For example, “reading” is a fairly generic activity that doesn’t reveal that much about you. However, running marathons suggests that you possess a high level of dedication and that you can overcome obstacles.
""Listening to music"" doesn't tell your employee anything about you, but ""I have practiced classical piano for 17 years"" tells them a lot.
""Volunteering"" tells the employer something about you, but it's not as detailed as it could be. Say, instead, that you've volunteered weekly at the same soup kitchen for three years, or that you bring your expertise from your state champion high school football team to bear when volunteering as a coach for community football league.

, For example, a consulting firm may not care about what how biking up a mountain brings you closer to nature, but they will want to know that you have participated in several large-scale races that required dedication and grit in training, or that you suffered a serious injury that at some point threatened to derail your hobby, but that you are not fazed by obstacles, and you worked through it.

Write down the main points of your finished paper.,
Think about the key ideas, concepts, and methods used in your paper.,
Jot down notes and ideas as you go.,
Turn your notes and ideas into complete sentences.,
Organize the ideas by placing them in the same order you have them in your paper.,
Read through the summary you've just constructed.,
Get your indentations and spacing correct.,
Always use the serial or Oxford comma.,
Spell out acronyms the first time you use them.,
Give it a final read-through yourself or with a friend.",How to Write an Abstract in MLA Style," The very first thing to do to create a useful, on-point abstract is to take notes to summarize your paper. One way to begin this process is to go through and summarize each paragraph. That way, you know you’ve included all the main ideas throughout your paper.


Remember, a summary gives the general idea; you don’t have to provide every detail. Imagine you're in a lecture hall and only have time to write down the key words before your professor moves on. When taking notes on your abstract, stick to what you actually need to keep the process quick, easy, and effective.
If you have an outline of your paper, that can be a great way to see the summary of your main points and ideas, as it should include everything.;
, What is your main thesis? What are the main points you are trying to make? What conclusions did you draw at the end? If you’re summarizing an experiment or clinical research, what were your methods and subjects? Each of these will need to be included in your abstract.


Is there anything in the larger picture of your paper that needs to be addressed? Make sure you take notes on each important point but also the consequences, implications, and results of the points you make.

, You don’t need to make it cohesive just yet. Simply start a list of the things your abstract will talk about in a roughly chronological order that isn't far off from your paper. You want those who do choose to read your entire paper to be able to follow along with what they've already gathered from your abstract.

, Now you simply need to make your summary into a cohesive paragraph. Put all of your ideas into complete sentences, if you haven’t already. Make sure each idea makes sense on its own.


If it feels like you've essentially written your paper twice now, go through and weed out what you don't need. The abstract is essentially useless if it's too long. While there technically isn't an MLA length requirement, most abstracts are somewhere between 150-250 words., Add transitions as necessary to make sure the sentences flow together and don't come off piecemeal and choppy. It should make sense to an audience that hasn't read your paper and can't fill in gaps on their own.


If there are any leaps you have to make between sentences or any assumptions your audience would have to make to understand your abstract, take it as a cue that you missed a main point from your paper and fill it in as necessary.

, Take a step back from your abstract for a second, finish another task or two, and then come back and read your summary. Here's what you should be looking for:


Cut out anything that’s unnecessary. If it bulks up your abstract and it doesn't lead to a greater end, cut it. You don't need it.
Add transitions in places if it still seems jarring.
Check to make sure you’ve included all your main ideas, though each main idea doesn’t need to be its own sentence.
View it as a whole. Does it make sense overall? Does it answer the main questions your paper sets out to ask?

, An abstract in MLA style is not that different from any other style. Here's what you should keep in mind when adding the final finishing formatting touches:


Only use one space after end punctuation, like periods.
Use paragraph indentations by tabbing over once at the beginning of each paragraph.
Make your abstract double-spaced by highlighting the section and clicking on “Paragraph.” Go down to “Spacing.” Under “Line Spacing,” select “Double.” Click “OK” at the bottom of the window.
Use 1-inch margins. Select the “Page Layout” tab, and use the margin drop-down menu to select 1-inch margins (generally labeled “Normal”).

, This means that if you are making a list of more than three items, put a comma before the “and,” such as in this sentence: “The children ate ice cream, cupcakes, and sprinkles.”


The sentence, ""We saw two elephants, William, and Kate"" can mean something entirely different than, ""We saw two elephants, William and Kate."" In the first sentence, we saw four things: two elephants and two people. In the second sentence, we saw two things: two elephants (with the names William and Kate). For this reason, the Oxford comma is very important!

, Unless it is used as a word itself (such as RADAR), always spell out the acronym and then put the acronym in parenthesis. After the first explanation, you can use the acronym alone.


This is similar to pronouns. You would never start off a story saying ""He went to the store."" Who's he? Without saying what the acronym stands for, your audience may not know what you're talking about.

, Basically, you want to make sure you cover all the main points, and that your abstract is concise and to the point. Don’t cloud it up with overly complicated language, as your reader is trying to judge your article in one quick take. If your abstract meets this requirements and is formatted in line with MLA guidelines, you're good to go.


Two sets of eyes are always better than one. Once you have your finished product, ask a friend (or two) to read your abstract. Do they notice any grammar mistakes? Do they understand the topic at hand? This can be especially useful since they aren't already familiar with your paper and their eyes are fresh on the page.

Research.,
Use accurate videos.,
Use images, graphics or photos that match the article you are writing about.,
Use proper grammar and appropriate spelling.,
Write in your own words.",How to Write an Accurate wikiHow Article," Unless you know your subject well, a bit of research is needed before writing your article.


Research using the Internet. Use reliable neutral or unbiased sources. Information of Wikipedia is a good starting point. So is reading articles from peer reviewed sources. You can also check mainstream newspaper articles too.
Search wikiHow importable videos or head to one of the video sources listed at wikiHow. Listen and take notes from the video. Use that information to write your article.;
, Check to see if the video was made by a well known company. Just because you saw Joe's video on YouTube doesn't mean that it's accurate. Check to see how others rated the video.

, Doing a bit of research will help. If you know your subject well, then you will know what image, graphic or photo to use.


Accurate images, graphics or photos are important as they are often what catches the readers eye. Make sure to use the right image, graphic or photo to help lead them to reading your article.

Savvy readers will also know when an inaccurate image, graphic or photo is used and wonder if the article is truly accurate.

, Both will add to your credibility. A well written article is almost always credible.

, Do not plagiarize. You can use research information but you should write down what you found in your own writing. To ""borrow"" someone's writing could be construed as a copyright violation. It also lessens your article's credibility.

Read primary sources to familiarize yourself with the time period.,
Watch period television shows and commercials to acquaint yourself with more recent time periods.,
Consult people that lived during your setting's time period to get firsthand insight.,
Use dictionaries and other text resources to learn about the history of certain words.",How to Write Accurate Dialogue in Historical Fiction1," In order to get in the mindset of writing for your time period, read letters, journals, and other types of personal communication.


Take note of the differences you see between that era’s dialogue and modern dialogue.
Reading these works will inherently train your subconscious to identify and utilize historical constructions in your writing.;
, For a historical novel set in a more recent era, watch television shows made in the decade you’re writing about, to get an idea of how the dialogue plays out when spoken.


Also, watch the commercials to brush up on dialogue, and gain the added bonus of learning about products that are true to the time period.

, You can try talking to people who lived through the time in which your novel takes place, if there are any still alive.


Ask them questions about the language they used, and what slang was popular when they were young.
Also, see if they’d be willing to read your dialogue to see how true-to-life it is.

, Most dictionaries will tell you when and where a word first appeared, so if you’re not sure if you should use it, look it up.


Some great resources to use for works set in much older settings are The First English Dictionary of Slang from 1699 or Francis Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, published in 1811.
Essentially, any dictionary published near your time period should be helpful, though slang dictionaries will be even more useful.
Many older dictionaries are available online.
One problem with researching profanities is that they often weren’t written down in older time periods.
Therefore, even though many curse words are fairly old, their histories are more difficult to trace.

"
"
Keep dialogue short.,
Use words appropriate to the time period.,
Use appropriate syntax and slang to construct historically accurate sentences.,
Use older idioms to evoke a bygone era.,
Use action to break up long stretches of dialogue.,
Avoid using overly formal language.,
Don’t overdo historical phrasing.",How to Write Accurate Dialogue in Historical Fiction2," Long paragraphs of dialogue can overwhelm readers, so make sure the dialogue that you write is full and vibrant, but not too dense.


Keep the dialogue as exchanges between characters, not overly long monologues.
Dialogue should always move the plot along.
The dialogue should serve the plot, not the other way around.
Take out any unnecessary dialogue, especially if it is long-winded.

, When you're writing, think actively about the vocabulary you are using.


Avoid using contemporary words.
You can use your dictionaries to help you determine what words are contemporary.

, Think about using accurate syntax, which is a bit more difficult than choosing the proper vocabulary.


Syntax is the way sentences are structured, and it does change over time.
One way to think about syntax is to think about historical dialogue as its own dialect (a sub-section of a language, with different inflections and words), which it essentially is.
Look at this example of a southern American dialect from Flannery O’Connor:

“He and the girl had almost nothing to say to each other. One thing he did say was, 'I ain't got any tattoo on my back.'
'What you got on it?' the girl said.
'My shirt,' Parker said. 'Haw.'
'Haw, haw,' the girl said politely.”


Of course, words like “ain’t” and “haw” stand out as southern slang/dialect.
However, the structures are different from standard English as well.
For instance, the sentence, “What you got on it?” leaves out the ""being"" verb, as normally “have” would go before “you.”
Historical dialogue can also have different structures, and the only way to learn those structures is to read primary texts and even secondary texts from the time period.
In fact, the best dialect writers rely more on syntax than on trying to make words appear accented by changing spellings and shortening words.

, An idiom is a phrase the meaning of which is not directly derived from its actual words.


Idioms are often phrases that don’t necessarily make sense, like “It’s raining cats and dogs"", or ""He kicked the bucket"".
They are often metaphorical in nature, though not always.
Like looking for vocabulary, you can read older sources to find common idioms of the time period.
Similarly, idiom dictionaries can help you find out-of-use phrases, as well as the slang dictionaries mentioned above.

, Using only dialogue bores readers over time, so keep the action going between exchanges.


Monologues, especially when they are in hard to understand historic phrasing, can lose your readers attention.

, Although language may have been spoken more formally in the past than today, not all language in the past was formal and there were still divisions between formal and informal speaking.


In other words, if your character is talking to a close friend, their language needs to be less formal than when he or she is talking to a complete stranger, even in historical fiction.
Also, dialogue doesn’t need to be—and shouldn’t be—in complete sentences all the time.
When writing formal language, remember “formal” does not necessarily mean “stilted.”
For example, if you’ve ever read Jane Austen or the Brontë sisters, you will realize that even formal language can have wit and punch.
Try speaking the dialogue aloud, and make sure that you don't stumble over it.

, While you don’t want your text to sound modern, you don’t want it to be so “historical” that readers have a difficult time understanding it.


Your text should still be enjoyable to read, and not require too much ""translation"".
This will allow your readers to move through your book at a fairly quick pace, and avoid losing interest.

This will make writing your wedding thank-you notes much easier than starting from scratch with making a new list. Keep this information in a spreadsheet so you can later add a column for gifts. , Writing thank-you notes can be a long and arduous process, especially for those with packed weddings. Treat writing thank-you notes with the dedication of a job, complete with an area for you to specifically write thank-you notes. Find a nice spot in your house, and make it your consistent location to write. Make sure you have an easy-to-access drawer in this spot to house all of the thank-you cards. , Follow the gift list created at the bridal shower as your guideline for writing the thank-you cards. Go back to your spreadsheet with the names/addresses, and start adding in gifts next to the corresponding names so all of your information is in the same place. Begin at the top of the list and check off each name as you complete the thank-you card. Be sure to add names to the bottom of the list as late gifts arrive.

, Work as long as you can, but do not feel as though you must finish all of the notes in one sitting. For example, set aside 30 minutes each day to work solely on your thank-you notes. This way the work is divided up in reasonable increments instead of dealing with an entire day of writing cards. You should also plan to write your notes as soon after you get your first set of wedding gifts as possible. Words are simpler to express while the gifts are fresh in your mind.

, Purchase high quality thank-you or white note cards with Ecru paper. Consider adding a symbol that represents your wedding’s theme, such as a pumpkin if you had a Halloween theme or a sunflower if it was fall themed. Having your new married name or initials on the card also adds a special touch.
Use Google to find a variety of websites specializing in customizable thank-you cards.
Ideally you should purchase your thank-you notes at the same time you buy wedding invitations.

, Instead of trying to track down postage after every thank-you note, buy a sizeable roll of stamps first. Forever-47 cent stamps are a good choice because you can choose a design that fits the aesthetic of your wedding while making sure you can order enough without going to the store and buying more. , Find a blue or black ink pen with which you are comfortable writing. Other colors often do not appear to be as formal and are harder to read. Buy a firm, roller ball that will make your handwriting boldly stand out on your thank-cards. , Every thank-you card should incorporate the guest’s name and gift. Do your best to personalize each note and try to incorporate some specific fact or memory about that person into your writing. For example, instead of writing “Roger, I appreciate your set of pots and pans,” consider writing, “Roger, your set of pots and pans are perfect. They remind me of all the times we spent in your parent’s kitchen cooking up burnt grilled cheese sandwiches at 2 in the morning. I’m looking forward to perfecting them this time around.” , Instead of merely thanking them for their present, make each guest feel like their gift will be put to use by detailing how you plan on using it in your married life. A good example would be, “Samantha, thank you so much for the blender. Daylynn and I have always wanted to get into juicing and fruit smoothies and now we finally can. I’ll be sure to whip you up a strawberry banana smoothie next time you visit.” , It may be easier to just slip a cash gift into your pocket and forget about it, but you need to let your guest know it’s going to something worthwhile. Detail exactly what you’re going to use the cash for, and make sure it’s something useful, like a newborn’s crib instead of the latest video games.

, Some obscure family members or unknown family friends may send you gifts before the wedding, but you still need to try your best to make their card feel personal. For example, you could write, “Don, thank you so much for the high quality toaster oven. My mother must have told you how rusted my current one is. She tells me all about the wonderful college days you two shared together. Looking forward to finally meeting you at the wedding.”

, Inevitably you will receive gifts that are useless, distasteful, or downright gaudy. Nevertheless, you must find a way to express your gratitude, even if it’s a bit insincere. For example, if you were gifted an ugly picture of a wine cork with the $10 price still attached, you could write, “Dear Sylvia, thank you so much for the wonderful piece of art. Kendrick and I are both avid wine aficionados, so it will be a perfect fit in our kitchen.”

, Weddings can be difficult to attend, and there may even be some guests who weren’t able to bring you any gifts. These friends and family members should still be thanked and made to feel like they have a special place in your life. If someone couldn’t get out of work, for example, you could write, “Dear Erykah, I’m sorry to hear your veterinary clinic wouldn’t give you any time off for work. I know how hard it is to get a break from such a demanding and important job. I know we’ll be able to see each other seen and I can’t wait to hear everything that’s been going on in your life.” , A good way to end each note is by saying thank-you once again and signing the bride and groom's names to the note, if their names were not mentioned within the text. Instead of saying something bland like “All the best,” try an ending like, “With Much Love, Binh and Jeremy.”

, You can either print address labels or neatly write the person's address on the envelope. Remember to add your return address to ensure that everyone has your correct new location.

Format the essay according to the instructions.",How to Write a Winning College Scholarship Essay," Start by sitting down and reading the essay prompt for the scholarship essay. The prompt may be a question or a statement that you must respond to in your essay. For example, “What book has most affected your life and why?” or “Describe a major obstacle or hurdle that you have overcome.” Reading the essay prompt and understanding it will ensure your essay stays on theme and fulfills the expectations of the scholarship committee.If you are unsure what the theme or focus of your essay should be, you may want to look at the purpose of the scholarship award noted by the committee and/or why the organization is giving away the scholarship money. You should then write your essay with these reasons in mind.
For example, the mandate of the scholarship committee may be to “promote social justice and community outreach.” You may then consider how you can write your essay around the theme of community involvement and social justice. You should try to focus on how you can explore the mandate of the scholarship committee in your essay.;
, Once you have read and understood the essay prompt, you should sit down and brainstorm ideas around the prompt. Brainstorming ideas will save you time and energy later when you compose your essay.Writing down what you think is the main point or question of the essay. For example, this may be, “What book has most affected your life and why?” You should then write down words or ideas that relate to the question. You may write “Pride & Prejudice”, “Crime and Punishment”, “Frankenstein”, “Their Eyes Were Watching God”. You could then select one of these titles as the key example in your essay.
You can also generate ideas for your essay by doing a timed freewrite that focuses on answering the question posed by the essay prompt. During a freewrite, you should try to keep your pen on the page and focus only on the topic at hand. Try to write continuously about the topic for the set period of time.Once you have done some brainstorming, you should read over your notes and highlight any ideas or terms that seem useful to you. You may highlight sections of your brainstorming notes or lines from your freewrite.
For example, if you are trying to find key terms for the prompt, “What does social justice and community outreach mean to me?”, you may highlight terms in your freewrite like “volunteering with the homeless”, “using social media”, and “helping marginalized communities”.

, Most essays can be broken into three main sections. Your scholarship essay may be shorter than a standard personal essay, usually 500-1000 words depending on the scholarship, so you may need to compress these sections accordingly. You can outline your essay using the following sections:Introductory section: This section should include a ""hook”. This is an opening line or lines where you catch the reader’s attention and draw them in. Your introductory section should also contain a thesis statement.
Body sections: These sections act as supporting evidence for your thesis and explore the key themes in your piece. You may use your experiences and your reflections on your experiences as supporting evidence.
Concluding section: This section should wrap up or conclude the events and experiences discussed in the essay. You may also include a moral of the story moment, where you reflect on what you learned or how you changed as the result of your experiences.

, Your college scholarship essay should have a strong thesis statement, as this will help to focus your essay. Your thesis statement will act as the road map or guide for your essay. A strong thesis statement will ensure your essay feels direct, concise, and to the point.You can create a thesis statement by asking yourself, “What is the point of my essay in one single sentence?” Try to answer this question in one sentence, with a focus on specificity and brevity.
For example, if you are writing a thesis statement for the prompt, “What book has most affected your life and why?” You may respond with the thesis statement: “Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God helped me realize that my Black heritage has value and empowered me to examine my identity as a young Black woman.”

, You should also try to include one to two supporting points that will be in the body section of your essay, as this will help you to structure your essay. It will also make it easier to compose your essay once you are ready to sit down and write. Your main points should support your thesis statement.For example, if you are writing about Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, you may use supporting points from the text as well as from your experiences.
You may have supporting point 1: My literary experience reading the novel in English class.
Supporting point 2 may be: My personal experience reading the novel at home.
You may have Supporting point 3: How the book shaped my experience of the world.

, You should draw your reader in with an opening line that is specific, engaging, and bold. Having a strong hook opening line will help your scholarship essay stand out from the rest.Avoid opening lines that are vague, impersonal, and dry. For example, the opening line: “Some say literature is the most important thing in the world” is vague and general. It does not tell the scholarship committee anything about you or your perspective.
The opening line: “The day my mother died, I read to distract myself from grief” is specific, powerful, and tells the reader something about you, the “I”, in the essay. It will likely get the reader’s attention and encourage them to keep reading.

, Your college scholarship essay will be much stronger if it focuses on how you relate to the essay prompt on a personal level. You should have a personal approach to the essay, where you tell a story about a personal experience that relates to the essay prompt. This will make the essay feel specific to you and tell the scholarship committee more about you as a candidate.For example, you may explore the essay prompt on “What book has most affected your life and why?” using the experience of reading Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God while you were trying to be a social justice warrior at your school. You may then discuss the book and how it helped you better understand your role as a young Black woman in America.

, You should also consider who is going to be reading your essay and ensure your essay appeals to your audience. Though you want to be sure you are personal, focused, and passionate in your essay, you should also make sure you include details that would interest your readers. Think about the scholarship committee's expectations of your essay and try to appeal to their interests.For example, if you are trying to address a prompt on “social justice and community outreach”, you should try to ensure your personal experience relates back to the prompt. The scholarship committee will be interested in your personal experience but they will also expect you to address the prompt.

, Do not be afraid to include your accomplishments, achievements, and awards in the essay. You are writing the scholarship essay to impress the review committee and show them why you are the best candidate for the award. Make sure you note at least one to two of your important awards or accomplishments in your essay so the committee knows you are an ideal candidate.You should also put the accomplishments in context and provide details about how and why you earned the award or achievement. Use accomplishments that relate to the essay prompt in some way, if possible. This way, the list of accomplishments will not come across as bragging or showing off. Instead, they will feel relevant to your essay.
For example, if you are writing an essay on the prompt “social justice and community outreach”, you may include a recent youth outreach award you earned at your high school. Or, you may include a recent article you wrote about social justice that received a writing award.

, The best college scholarship essays will be honest and original. But many college essays tend to fall into cliche, with personal narratives that are not detailed or specific enough. A cliche is a phrase that has become so known by readers it has lost all meaning. You should avoid using them in your essay, as they will tell your readers you are not being as creative or as original as you could be.For example, try to avoid the “I volunteered in a foreign country and I learned I am privileged narrative”, as it is familiar and has been done many times before. Instead, consider why you are privileged and why others are not. Think about personal circumstances and experiences that shaped your position in the world.
You should also avoid a confessional narrative, where you relay all your awful past sins and your story of redemption. The college scholarship essay should be honest but it should also highlight your winning qualities and experiences. Confessing your sins and past crimes will not make you seem like the ideal candidate for the award.

, Successful college essays will present a tone that is relatable and positive. Your personal experience should appear inspirational to the review committee and demonstrate how you have overcome a difficulty or a challenge in your life.For example, if you are writing an essay about your struggle with a family member’s death, you may discuss how your favorite book got you through your grief. Though you were saddened by the loss of someone you love, you were still able to find strength and move on through literature. This will strike the positive, inspirational tone the review committee will be looking for, without coming across as fake or cliche.

, Once you have completed your essay, you should take the time to revise and edit it so you end up with the best draft of the essay possible. Start by reading the essay out loud to yourself. Listen to how the sentences flow and how each paragraph transitions in your essay. Note any sentences that sound confusing or unclear.


You should also highlight any information in the essay that feels unnecessary or redundant. Keep your sentences concise and clear so your reader can easily follow along. If you feel you are repeating yourself in the essay, note these areas and revise them.
You may want to also read the essay out loud to someone you trust to get a second opinion. Be willing to accept constructive criticism and feedback, as this will likely only improve your essay.

, You should also go through your essay and watch for any grammatical errors or misspelled words. Mistakes like these can make your essay appear sloppy and unprofessional, leading the review committee to possibly disregard your essay completely.Do not rely on the spell check option on your computer to catch any errors for you. Instead, try to read the essay backwards, focusing on one word at a time. This way, you will be able to spot misspelled words or typos more easily.
You should also watch for run on sentences. Try to break up long sentences into a series of sentences so your thoughts are clear and easy to read.

, Most college scholarship essay applications or contests advertise a list of application instructions. You should follow these instructions to the letter so your essay is properly formatted and appears professional.For example, the instructions may require you to use 12 point font, double spaced, with 1 inch margins. You may also be required to put your name and contact information on the essay itself.
You should also note the required word count for the essay in the instructions. Most college scholarship essays are limited to 500-1000 words. You should stay within the word count, as essays over the word count may not be considered by the committee.

Learn the rhyming structure of the triolet poem.,
Read examples of the triolet poem.,
Analyze the examples.,
Brainstorm.,
Create your first, repeating line.,
Make your second, repeating line.,
Fill in the supporting lines.,
Read the completed triolet out loud.,
Title your triolet.",How to Write a Triolet Poem," The structure of a triolet poem is based on a rhyming scheme where the first line of the poem is used three times and the second line of the poem is used twice. The structure can be broken down by:A (first line)
B (second line)
a (rhymes with the first line)
A (repeat the first line)
a (rhymes with the first line)
b (rhymes with the second line)
A (repeat the first line)
B (repeat the second line);
, To get a better sense of how to use the structure of the triolet to create a unique poem, look at several examples, including:


Thomas Hardy’s “How Great is My Grief”.Peter Poole’s “Feed Me Lord That I Might Live”LuAnn Kennedy’s “The Night”, Choose one or two examples and note how they use the repetition of the first line and the second line to enhance meaning in the poem. Ask yourself:


Does the meaning of repeated first line and the repeated second line shift throughout the poem? For example, in Hardy’s triolet “How Great is My Grief”, the first line underlines the overall grief and sorrow of the speaker and enhances the lines between the repeated lines in the poem.
How do the supporting lines respond or react to the repeated lines in the triolet? In Hardy’s poem, the supporting lines put the repeating lines into a certain context. They tell the reader that the speaker has known the subject of the poem over the course of “slow years” and they have shared memories with the subject or “thee” of the poem.
What note does the last line end the poem on? How does the last line, the repeated second line, enhance the overall meaning of the poem? Hardy alters the meaning of the repeated last line by using a question mark, instead of an exclamation mark. This leaves the reader in a state of wonder, as the speaker seems to be posing a question to the subject of the poem, but the reader will never know the answer.

, Think about what you want the triolet poem to be about, or the theme or subject of the poem. One way to brainstorm a theme or subject is to create an association diagram, also known as a clustering technique.Take out a sheet of paper. Write your main topic or subject in the middle of the paper. For example, “a tortoise”.
Moving out from the center, write down other words that pop into your mind that relates back to “a tortoise”. You can also draw a circle or box around the main topic and use little lines to connect the other words to the main topic.
For example, for “a tortoise”, you might write “hard shell”, “ancient”, “slow”, “wise”, “dark green”. Don’t worry about organizing the words as you write. Simply let the words flow around the main topic.
Once you feel you have written enough words around the main topic, start to cluster the words. Draw a circle around words that relate to each other and draw a line between the circled words to connect them. Continue doing this with the other words. Some of the terms may end up uncircled, but these lone words can still be useful.Focus on how the words relate back to the main topic. If you have clustered together several words that relate to “wise”, for example, maybe this may be a good approach for the triolet. Or if there are a lot of clustered words that focus on “dark green”, this may be another way to approach “a tortoise.”
Answer questions like: “I was surprised by…” or “I discovered…” For example, you may look over the clustered words and note “I was surprised by how often I mention my father in relation to a tortoise.” Or, “I discovered I may want to write about how a tortoise means a wise and old personality or character, like my father.”, Some poets find coming up with your main, repeating line first, (A) in the scheme of ABaAabAB, can help to develop the rest of the poem. The (A) line will need to be a line that can be repeated several times in the poem, it should have an ending word that will rhyme with other words, and a strong or powerful tone that will be a good opening and closing for the poem. Many poets also try to make the first line eight to ten syllables long so that it is not too wordy and it will flow with the rest of the poem.


For example, for a triolet about a tortoise, your (A) line might be: “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.” This is an ideal (A) line because it ends on a word that is easy to rhyme with other words and it stays close to 10 syllables.

, The second line of the poem, the (B) line, will also need to be strong and have impact, as it will be a grounding line throughout the poem. The line should end with a word that is easy to rhyme with other words, as you will need to create a supporting line that rhymes with the (B) line.


If you continue the triolet about a tortoise, your (B) line might be: “Though he was once a young man like me.”

, To help you come up with the supporting middle lines of the poem, it may be helpful to place your (A) line and your (B) line within the eight line structure of the triolet:


“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.”
“Though he was once a young man like me.”
(supporting line that rhymes with first line)
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.”
(supporting line that rhymes with first line)
(supporting line that rhymes with second line)
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.”
“Though he was once a young man like me.”
Once you have positioned your first and second lines, you can do some free writing to fill in the supporting lines. Note that you will need to end the supporting lines so they rhyme with the applicable lines in the poem.

, Now that you have filled in all eight lines of the poem, read the triolet out loud to ensure it flows well and each line follows the triolet structure.


For example, your completed triolet about your father, the tortoise, might be:
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow”
“Though he was once a young man like me”
“He is full of knowledge I will never know”
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow”
“His thoughts and memories he will not show”
“Yet I try to set them free”
“My father is a tortoise, wise and slow”
“Though he was once a young man like me.”

, Once you have a completed triolet, it will need a title. Many poets use the first line of the triolet as the title of the poem, or they choose the theme or subject to act as the title of the poem.


For the triolet example about your father, a good title might be: “The Tortoise”.

Revise the manuscript.",How to Write About Your Own Life," In a memoir, you are the main character of your own life story. Many memoirists use the facts of their life story to create an engaging tale for the reader. Because you are relying on your own memories as source material for the story, you may end up describing things differently than others might remember it. The key is to write down things as you remember it, in the most honest way possible. Keep in mind memoirs are different from autobiographies in that memoirs should only cover certain key aspects of your life, not your life from birth until the present day.Most memoirists struggle to begin their life story and are not sure where to start. Depending on your life story, you may reach out to other family members for details on a childhood memory or event. But it’s important that you also focus on your personal experiences and your recollection of a childhood memory or moment, even if it may be flawed. Often, the best memoirs are about the process of remembering an event, or are about processing a moment in the past that felt important.;
, There are several good examples of memoir, some of which are considered classics of the genre:Speak, Memory by Vladimir Nabokov. Nabokov is a highly regarded fiction writer, but one of his most celebrated works is his memoir of his childhood in Russia. The book is a good example of using literary prose and masterful storytelling to share a personal history.

The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion. Didion’s memoir focuses on the sudden death of her husband and the death of her adult daughter a few months later. This is a great example of using memory to inform the present, which for Didion, is colored by extreme grief and a sense of mortality.

Maus by Art Spiegelman. This is a graphic novel that uses animals to tell Spiegelman’s childhood memories of being imprisoned in a concentration camp during the Holocaust. Spiegelman’s use of animals in fact makes the memoir feel that much more universal and relatable.

The Woman Warrior by Maxine Hong Kingston. Kingston’s memoir of growing up as a Chinese immigrant in California combines myth, legend, and memory. Another good example of using different writing styles or approaches to write about your own life.

, Choose one to two examples and read through them. Ask yourself several questions:


Why did the author choose to highlight certain events in their life in the memoir? Consider why the memoirist chose a certain section of their childhood or a specific life event as the focus of the book. For example, Didion’s book The Year of Magical Thinking focuses on the recent deaths of her husband and her daughter, while Nabokov’s Speak, Memory focuses on his childhood in Russia. One event is in the recent past while one event is in the very distant past. Yet both events have a very strong, and possibly traumatic, effect on the writers.
What were the narrator’s desires in the memoir? What was motivating the narrator to share this particular story with the reader? Often, memoirs can be cathartic for the writer. Perhaps the writer was trying to process a year of grieving and loss, as Didion does in The Year of Magical Thinking, or perhaps the writer was trying to describe a childhood in a concentration camp, as Spiegelman does in his memoir Maus. Consider the motivations of the writer for putting down their story and presenting it to readers.
How did the memoir keep the reader engaged and interested in the story? The best memoirs are honest and unflinching, with details or admissions that the writer may be afraid to make. The writer may write in a way that feels truthful, full of moments that may not make the writer look good or conflicted. But readers often respond to vulnerability in a memoir, and a writer who is not afraid to describe their failures along with their successes.
Were you satisfied with the ending of the memoir? Why or why not? Unlike an autobiography, a memoir does not need to have a linear beginning, middle, and end. Most memoirs end without any firm conclusions or end of life moments. Instead, memoirs may end with thoughts on a running theme throughout the book, or with reflections on the pivotal event or moment in the writer’s life.

, In your memoir, your narrator is you. You will use the first person, “I”, to lead the reader through your story. But it’s important to focus your memoir on specific need or desire. Your want will drive the food forward and make your story worth reading. Think about your desire line, or what motivates your narrator to tell her story. Your narrator will then struggle to achieve her desire line through telling her story and reaching a realization about a pivotal moment in her story.Try to sum up what your narrator wants in one sentence. For example: I wanted to understand my mother’s decision to move our family to America. Or, I wanted to become healthier after a brief brush with death. Or, I wanted to explore my experiences as an air force pilot in World War II.
Be specific in your desire line and avoid vague statements. Your desire line may change as you write your memoir. But its good to have a clear desire in mind before you start writing.

, Once you have a sense of what desire or want you want to explore in your memoir, you can identify the actions and obstacles your narrator must overcome to achieve the desire line. Obstacles or challenges will give the story stakes and motivate your reader to keep turning the pages of your memoir. You are the driver of the action in your story and a story isn’t very exciting if it doesn’t have any driving action.Try to write your actions and obstacles in short sentences: To get my desire line, I did this action. But then an obstacle got in my way. So, I did this action to overcome this obstacle.
For example: To understand why my mother moved my family to the United States, I tried to track down my mother’s family in Poland. But then I couldn’t locate my mother’s family due to poor records and missing relatives. So I went on a trip to Poland to better understand my mother and her family.

, Often, writers have a difficult time to determining how to start a story. A memoir can be even more challenging as you might feel you have so many details and scenes you could start with or that feel important. One way to start is to identify the inciting incident in your story and the ending incident. You will need to dramatize your inciting incident and your ending incident in your book.The inciting incident is the pivotal moment in your story, where you realized your desire line. It could be a seemingly small moment, such as a brief fight with your mother, that becomes a major moment or inciting incident in your story. For example, your brief fight with your mother could be the last time you speak to her before she passes away and leaves you letters about her life in Poland. Think of the ah ha moment in your story when you realized what you wanted in your life, or where you realized you were wrong about your assumptions about a specific moment or event.
The ending incident is the moment when you achieve your desire line or want. It will also help you develop an ending for your book. It could be when you discover your mother’s reason for leaving her homeland, for example.

, Though you are writing a memoir, following the principles of fiction, such as a plot outline, can help give your book form and shape. It can also make it easier for you to organize your research materials in a way that is engaging and interesting for your reader. A story’s plot is what happens in the story and the order it happens in. For there to be a story, something has to move or change. Something or someone goes from point A to point B due to a physical event, a decision, a change in a relationship, or a change in a character or person. Your plot outline should include:A story goal: The plot of any story is a sequence of events that revolve around an attempt to solve a problem or attain a goal. The story goal is what your narrator wants to achieve or the problem she wants to resolve, or her desire line.
The consequence(s): Ask yourself, What disaster will happen if the goal is not achieved? What is my protagonist afraid will happen if she doesn’t achieve the goal or solve the problem? The consequence is the negative situation or event that will result if the goal is not achieved. The combination of goal and consequence creates the main dramatic tension in your plot. It’s what makes the plot meaningful.
The requirements: These are what must be accomplished to achieve the goal. Think of it as a checklist of one or more events. As the requirements are met in the course of the novel, the reader will feel the narrator is getting closer to attaining the goal. Requirements create a sense of anticipation in the reader’s mind, as he looks forward to the narrator’s success.

, Depending on your story, you may feel you need to do in-depth research on a certain subject, like air force pilots in WWII or life in a refugee camp in Poland. However, resist doing too much research before you start your first draft. You may get overwhelmed by the amount of information you come across during your research and start to forget your personal take on the facts. Remember that your memoir should focus on your memory of the event, rather than be purely factual or completely accurate.You can conduct online research and use libraries, archives and record offices, newspapers, and microfilm.You may also interview “witnesses to events”. This means individuals who can share first person accounts of an event. You will then need to follow up on leads, interview people, transcribe interviews, and read a lot of material., This will help you determine how long it is going to take you to write a draft of the book. If you are working under a deadline, you may make your schedule more tight than if you have the luxury of more time to write.Try to organize your schedule around word count or page count. So, if you normally write about 750 words an hour, factor this in on your schedule. Or if you feel you may actually write two pages an hour, use this as an estimate in your schedule.
Determine how long it will take you on average to compose a set number of words, or number of pages, per a day. If you are working towards a final word count goal, like 50,000 words or 200 pages, focus on how many hours per a week it will take you to reach this goal., You may feel pressure to write and rewrite every sentence you put down. But part of writing a memoir is writing an honest account of a pivotal event, in your own words and with your own style. Avoid putting on a “writer” voice. Instead, don’t be afraid to write like you speak or talk. Include slang and any regional vernacular. Make your story sound like it is coming directly from you.Use your plot outline to get a general sense of where your writing might be heading. But let yourself explore scenes in your rough draft. Don’t worry about writing perfect sentences or scenes. Instead, use your memory to create moments that feel true to you.

, When you use the passive voice, your writing will end feeling long winded and dull. Look for signs of the passive voice by circling all the “is” “was” and other passive verbs like “begin” “have” “seems” and “appears” in the manuscript.


Use your grammar check (or an app like Hemingway app) to count the number of passive sentences in your manuscript. Aim for 2-4% maximum.

, Instead of “utilize” you can just put “use”. Focus on simple language, with one or two syllable words. The only time you should be using higher level language is if you are using scientific terms or describing a technical process. Even then, you should be writing for the average reader.


It may help to identify the reading level of the ideal reader of your book. You can determine the reading level based on the grade level of your ideal reader. If you account for ESL readers, you should aim for a grade 6 or 7 reading level. If you are writing for a higher education audience, you may write at a grade 8 or 9 level. You can use the Hemingway app to determine the reading level of your draft, or other online reading level tools., Engage your reader by showing them a specific process or scene, rather than narrate directly to them. For example, write a scene that shows the reader how you discovered your mother’s letters from her family in Poland after her death. This will give the reader key information to help move the story forward, without telling them in a long, uneventful passage.

, Find a few sympathetic ears (friends, colleagues, a writing group) and read sections of the manuscript out loud. Good writing should engage readers as listeners, with details and description that create visceral images and a strong narrative.Don't try to impress your listeners or put on a ""reading voice"". Just read a natural, slow way. Ask for a reaction from your listeners after you finish reading. Note if there were sections that felt confusing or unclear to your listeners.

, If you are planning to send out your memoir to publishers, you need to edit the manuscript. You may want to hire a professional proof reader to give the book a good once over for common errors or mistakes.Don't be afraid to cut at least 20% of the material. You can likely get rid of certain sections that go on for a bit too long and cause the reader to tune out. Don't be shy about cutting chapter sections or pages that may be deadweight.
Note if each scene in your book uses the power of the senses. Are you engaging at least one of the reader's senses in each scene? The power of enhancement through the senses (taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing) is a trick both nonfiction and fiction writers can use to keep the reader interested.
Check the timeline of the book. Did you follow your desire line all the way through to the end of your book? Does the ending of your book leave the reader with a sense of closure or achievement?
The sentence level. Check for the transitions between paragraphs, are they smooth or jumpy? Look for any overused adverbs or terms and replace them so the sentences don't start to feel redundant.

Brainstorm ideas to find your topic.,
Pick an event to help convey your topic.,
Write down all the details you can remember of that event.,
Create an outline for your narrative essay.,
Write a short phrase for each major section of your essay.,
Begin your thesis with the main idea or theme you are trying to convey in the essay.,
Add examples to support your main theme or idea.,
Refine your thesis.,
Remember that your thesis should always cover the main topics of your essay.",How to Write a Thesis for a Narrative Essay," Ask yourself what idea or ideas you want to convey to your readers? Maybe you want to tell an uplifting story about achieving your goals or maybe you want to talk about the effects of grief on a person’s psyche.


Come up with a topic that is important to you and that you feel you can talk about in a personal way.;
, Look through old photographs of your life, or read through your old journals to help find a personal event that relates to your topic.


Another way to find a personal event is to look through your old social media posts, as they often chronicle important or meaningful events in your life.

, Use your five senses to help you tell your story. What did you see? What did you smell? What did you taste, hear, feel? All of those details will eventually make your story more vivid, even if you don’t include every single detail.


Remembering the details of the event through your five senses will also help to trigger other details or images you may have forgotten.
For example, maybe you remember the taste of coconut after your grandmother’s funeral, which will then help you remember that you all ate your grandmother’s favorite coconut cake at the gathering after the funeral. You can then try to find that recipe and use it as a way to jog other memories of your grandmother., Write down a rough idea of how you will tell the story. What will you begin with? What details or scenes will go in the middle? What scenes will go in the ending?

, For example, if you are discussing your grandmother’s death in the first section, you could write something like: “discuss grandmother’s sickness.”, A possible beginning may be: “In this essay, I will discuss the issue of grief.”

, Start by composing the simplest, most direct thesis and then edit it.


For example: “In this essay, I will discuss the issue of grief by discuss my grandmother’s sickness, discuss my grandmother’s death, talk about what happened afterwards.”
Adjust your first attempt so it is grammatically correct: “In this essay, I will discuss the issue of grief by discussing my grandmother’s sickness, my grandmother’s death, and what happened afterward.”

, Remove any repetitive phrases or words. “In this essay, I will discuss the issue of grief by describing one of my personal life experiences, when my grandmother became sick and died and how I dealt with her death.”


You may want to create a thesis that is a bit more sophisticated and less stilted by removing the more formal phrase, “I will discuss”.
For example: “Grief affects everyone’s life at one point or another, and it certainly has affected mine; when my grandmother became sick and passed away, I had to learn how to deal with the aftermath of her death.”

, Think about how you can convey the main theme of your essay, as well as what you are planning to cover in each section, in your thesis sentence.


Avoid packing too many ideas into one sentence. Your thesis should help ease the reader into your essay, not confuse them.

Start strong.,
Introduce your main characters near the beginning.,
Cover the entire narrative arc, including the end.You need to describe the entire main plot from beginning to end so that the agent or editor knows you are capable of maintaining a strong story throughout the entire novel.,
Demonstrate character development and emotion.,
Polish the synopsis using a strong voice.,
Know when to stop.",How to Write a Synopsis1," The start of your synopsis should include a ""hook,"" a statement that introduces the concept of your novel in an intriguing enough way to grab or ""hook"" the reader's attention.


The hook often includes information about the setting, as well.
The goal is to create a strong image in one to three sentences. The agent or editor reading your hook needs to have a clear idea about the conditions responsible for molding your characters.;
, As soon as you introduce the conditions surrounding your characters, you need to introduce the protagonist. Within the first paragraph or two, you should also introduce any other major characters.


When you introduce the main character, include one to two descriptive words capable of defining that character. You should also state how that character fits into his or her surroundings and the role that character will play.
As you introduce other characters, you should introduce them in relation to the main character. For example, if your main character is named Sarah, you might introduce the antagonist as ""Tracy, a popular girl at school who bullies Sarah relentlessly.""
As a general rule, you should only name three characters: the protagonist, love interest, and antagonist. Any other character you need to mention should only be referred to by his or her role: the father, the teacher, etc.,


Do not be tempted to leave the end off in an attempt to ""tease"" the editor into wanting to read more.
There are certain plot points you need to hit along the way. You need to describe the inciting incident, or the event that causes your main character to begin his or her journey.
Once the journey begins, you need to explain the conflict that really propels your main character forward.
Mention any turning points along the way, especially any moment at which conflict resolution seems impossible.
Spend at least a full paragraph on the climax.
End with the resolution.

, As you advance the plot, you should also describe any character development your main character goes through. Explain the mental and emotional state of your protagonist with every new plot twist or event.


If it helps to advance the plot, you should also explain the thoughts and feelings of the other characters named in your synopsis. For instance, if the love interest is a bad-guy-turned-good, you need to track his emotional progress and romantic feelings so that his switch to the good side makes sense.

, As often as possible, you should write your synopsis using active voice and third person.


Third person is generally advised even if your novel itself is written in first person. If you write the synopsis in first person, it might be difficult for the editor to distinguish your voice from the voice of your protagonist.

, Usually, a novel synopsis should only be one page long. In an effort to reduce the amount of bulk, there are also a few details you should stop yourself from adding.


Avoid subplots in your synopsis unless they are crucial to the main plot or unless you have extra space at the bottom of your page.
Avoid mentioning too much: too many characters, too many events, too many minor plot twists, or too much description. You need to present the essentials of your plot, but every sentence should be concise.
Resist the urge to editorialize. Avoid introducing scenes with phrasing like, ""In one significant scene...""

"
"
Include the basic information.,
Briefly describe the concept and its importance.Your concept is an explanation of the idea behind your book or the purpose the book is designed to serve.,
Elaborate on the content.,
Mention your own credentials.,
Analyze the competition.,
Suggest who to market the book to and how to do it.,
Estimate your delivery.",How to Write a Synopsis2," Near the beginning of your synopsis, you should include all the essentials about your nonfiction book, including the title, genre, and length.


You can either list these elements at the top of your synopsis, separate from the body of the synopsis itself, or you can weave them into a brief introductory paragraph at the start of your formal synopsis.
Note that the length does not need to be exact. If your book comes to a total of 62,843 words, you can round the number off to 62,000 or 60,000.
If you are offering a synopsis of a proposed book idea instead of a completed manuscript, estimate how many words you plan to write for your completed book.
The length of the book can also be disclosed in the final paragraph of the synopsis instead of the first.

, You should also explain why the book is important enough to be written and published.


A good way to think about your concept is to recall what your initial thoughts on the subject matter were. Ask yourself what type of book you wanted to write when you set out, and arrange your reflections into a few sentences. Also ask yourself why you wanted to write the book in the first place, and form those reflections into a few more sentences.

, This is, in some ways, a full summary of your book. Expand on the concept of the book, filling in the details to address how you plan to or have already covered the topic of your book.


You can either address the content of your book as a block of prose, with each paragraph corresponding to a different chapter, or as a list of proposed or written chapters. The latter method is usually preferred.
Each paragraph or chapter outline in your synopsis should address a different subtopic or portion of your overall topic. Introduce the main idea of the chapter and a few supporting points or questions covered in the chapter.

, After discussing what your book is about, you need to sell to the publisher your own ability. The best way to do this is to mention any past credentials in the field you are writing about or within the field of writing.


Regarding your credentials with the topic, you should mention any formal education you have had in the field as well as any professional and personal experience with the topic.
Regarding writing credentials, you need to state any professional writing training you have received and any past, published books or articles, especially those related to the topic of your current book.

, Mention a few other works that address a similar or related topic and explain, in a few sentences, how yours varies from all of them.


The main purpose of this portion is to show why your book, specifically, should be added to a collection of books already on the same general topic.
Doing this also serves a secondary purpose. By mentioning other books in the field, you can demonstrate that you are realistic and knowledgeable about your competition.

, A publisher will want to accept a book that can sell. You need to indicate that you know of an audience who will be interested in your book and that you have plans of your own to help market it.


List both general and specific readerships. A general readership would be something like an age group, gender group, religious group, or ethnicity. A specific readership would be something like a specific profession or organization.
Regarding ways to market or promote your book, you should list any professional connections you have that can help or any audiences you already have, such as an active blog.

, Describe how much of your book is already written. If your book is not yet finished, explain how long you expect to take in finishing it.

"
"
Stick to an appropriate length.,
Maintain a professional tone.,
Provide an overview of your arguments.,
State your conclusions.,
Put your synopsis in the right spot.",How to Write a Synopsis3," When writing a synopsis for a research paper or academic journal article, you should aim to make the end result no longer than one to two paragraphs.


Understand the function of a synopsis within the academic and professional worlds. A synopsis summarizes the article or essay and lets the reader know if the information is relevant to their needs or otherwise worth reading. As such, it needs to be short enough to read quickly.
When submitted to a conference, synopses must be submitted before the presentation so that those attending the conference can determine which presentations to listen to. Since many synopses need to be included in the conference materials, each one needs to be fairly short.

, The tone of your synopsis should be the same as the tone for your essay or article: clean-cut and intelligent.


Use third person. First person and second person comes across as being too subjective and biased.
State factual or scientific information. Do not write about your feelings, and avoid mentioning opinions that are not backed with evidence.

, Introduce the premise of your essay or article, then lead into your hypothesis or thesis and the arguments that support it.


For something like a history or literary article, you need to state your thesis and include a sentence for each of your main supporting points or arguments.
For a scientific research article, you need to explain what hypothesis you are trying to prove and the method you used to study it, including details about why the method used would present a valid argument or piece of support.

, Regardless of the subject or theme, each academic synopsis must state the overall conclusion you reached. Without that conclusion, the reader has no way of knowing whether or not the essay will come together in a sensible, beneficial manner.


With literary and history articles, you need to show how all of your arguments lead up to one crucial and seemingly inevitable conclusion.
With scientific research essays, you need to state the results of your experiment or research and quickly mention how that affects the topic as a whole.

, The synopsis should be included after your title page but before the actual essay or article.


Note that for some writing styles, the term “Synopsis” might be swapped out for the term “Abstract.”

,How to Write a Synopsis4,
"
Identify the main sections in your paper.,
Write out a short phrase for each main idea.,
Re read your paper from beginning to end.,
Look at any areas where two main ideas meet each other on the page.,
Write a sentence that summarizes the first idea.,
Connect the first idea with the second idea by showing how they are related.,
Always have transition sentences within your main ideas.,
Begin the transition with the first example.,
Use the similarities and the differences between the two examples to create a transition.,
Only use a transition sentence when you are trying to discuss two different ideas.,
Avoid overusing transition words.,
Don’t try to force connections between two ideas.,
Use transition sentences to make your writing sound better and give it a sense of flow.",How to Write a Transition Sentence," If you outlined your paper before you started writing it, this step shouldn’t be too difficult. If you didn’t make an outline, go through the paper and highlight similar ideas in a section.


For example, is your first paragraph all about the same idea? Then highlight this idea in one color. Some ideas may go over several paragraphs, depending on the length of your paper.
Don’t forget to mark your introduction and conclusion as their own separate sections, as they each cover different aspects of your thesis.;
, For example, if your paper is about dragons, then one may idea may be “the symbolism of the dragon” and another idea in another section may be “dragons in mythology.”

, Are there any sections that seem choppy? Does one section seem to jump from one idea to another without any connecting sentences? Mark or highlight these areas.


It’s a good idea to also ask someone to read your paper, and have them mark or note any sections that seem abrupt or choppy to them.

, When writing a transition sentence, you are trying to move smoothly from one idea to the next. Think about how the two ideas are alike; how do they relate to each other?


For example, how is dragon symbolism like dragons in mythology? You could connect these two idea together by arguing that dragon symbolism is developed in dragon mythology. So, in a way, one idea creates the other idea.

, This will let the reader know that you are moving from the first idea to the second idea.


For example: “The symbolism of the dragon has a rich history…”

, Using our example, the transition sentence would be: “The symbolism of the dragon has a rich history, which was largely developed in the mythological tales told about dragons throughout history, such as the legend of King Arthur.”


In the second part of this sentence, you are showing that you are talking about dragon mythology next in a general sense and you immediately provide an example, in this case, the tale of King Arthur.

, You will need to provide examples around the main idea in a section, so transitions will help you do this smoothly.For example, in one section, you may begin with the mythology of dragons in the legend of King Arthur and then transition to discuss mythical beasts and dragons in the Bible.

, “Dragons abound in mythology beyond the legend of King Arthur…”

, Consider what the similarities and the differences are between the legend of King Arthur and the Bible. Both are legends or myths, but the Bible is a central text to one of the world’s major religions.


So, you can use this difference to transition to the second example: “Dragons abound in mythology beyond the legend of King Arthur, including some of the central texts of the world’s major religions, such as the Bible.” This is an effective transition because it shows how the examples are similar and how they are different.

, In a paragraph that discusses the same two ideas or examples, you don’t need a transition., While words like “in addition,” “however,” and “also” can be very helpful for transitioning, they should be used sparingly. Otherwise, the paper will come across as stilted and too formal.

, If two ideas are placed near each other in your paper, but don’t seem connected, than maybe one of them doesn’t belong or maybe it needs to be moved to a different section. Your ideas should flow logically in your paper.

, Transition sentences are essential to a well structured essay because they introduce new ideas and help guide the reader. The best writers use transitions to connect the dots between ideas and help their reader understand the overall theme or overarching argument of their essay.

Most YA novels have protagonists that are under 18 years old, and are written from the perspective of a teenager.The target audience for YA novels are 13-18 year olds, teen readers who are dealing with feelings of love and desire in their lives. Teen romance can give these young readers access to these emotions through fictional characters and stories, and help them figure out how to deal with their romantic feelings.Most teen romance novels have female protagonists, as many YA novels are written by women and are targeted to a young female audience. However, there are several prominent YA romance novels that are written by men and feature male protagonists.;
, Study up on the genre by looking at best selling examples of teen romance stories. For example:


The Twilight series, by Stephenie Meyer. This four book series is one of the biggest selling teen romance series in publishing. Meyer creates a strong, unique female protagonist (Bella Swan) and gives her relatable teen issues like a distant father, fitting into a new town, feeling isolated and alone. These teen issues are mixed in with supernatural elements, like a handsome vampire lover, to create a compelling romance for teens.The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green. The story of a cancer stricken teen, Hazel, and her encounter with Augustus Green, is a favorite among YA readers.Eleanor & Park, by Rainbow Rowell. This story of two love struck sixteen year olds uses two strong main characters to tell a classic romance., How is the main character or protagonist developed in the book? For example, though they are both female protagonists, the main character in Twilight, Bella Swan, is very different from the main character, Hazel, in The Fault in Our Stars. Each character views their world differently, and describes or reacts to other characters in each story differently. However, both books tackle the darker side of being a teenager (loneliness, isolation, death), another major element of a YA novel.The love interest in Twilight follows the standard descriptor of male love interests in YA novels: being ridiculously good looking.This is the same for Augustus in The Fault in Our Stars, who is described as “hot” by Hazel and falls into the familiar trope of the handsome, mysterious male love interest.

, A good romance story needs to have conflict and stakes. This could be a strong hatred or dislike of each other that eventually grows into love or a misunderstanding or mistake early in the story that keeps the lovers apart or away from each other. Usually, the higher the stakes, the more engaged your reader will be.


For example, in the first Twilight book, the stakes are raised when Edward and his family defend and save Bella from a sadistic vampire. The main character is placed in danger, and her relationship with her love interest is tested. This conflict then sets the stakes for the rest of the books in the series.

, As a reader, were you satisfied with the ending of the book? Did you feel the book’s ending dragged on or felt too predictable? How did the writer bring together all the narrative threads of the previous chapter to create a believable and satisfying ending?


The ending of The Fault in Our Stars ends not on a happily ever after resolution for Hazel and Augustus, but instead allows dark themes like death and suffering to be part of the ending. Though the ending may not follow the familiar structure of a romance, it fits within the model of YA novels, where the main character may not get what she wants, but she experiences a transformation or an epiphany.

, Though many YA romance novels focuses on a female protagonist, you do not have to limit yourself to a female main character. A male protagonist or a non gender identifying protagonist are also options. However, when creating your main character, try to avoid falling into cliche or familiar territory. You want your protagonist to be engaging and unique enough to keep your reader turning the page.Avoid the trap of a writing a “Mary Sue”, which is shorthand in the YA book world for a female protagonist who is self centered and shallow. Mary Sues are often one note characters, who can do no wrong and every plot point seems set up to let them get what they want or get their perfect man. No only does this create a flat main character that is not relatable to the reader, it also kills any stakes in the story and renders the story predictable.Rather than let the main character’s crush or romantic desires define her, develop her as a fully formed character separate of her crush. Think of your main character as the foundation for the romance you are going to build in the book. Make her a person the average reader can identify with, full of insecurities, awkward tendencies, and teenage impulses.Use a teenager you know as a model, or think back to how you felt when you were a teenager. You likely did not feel perfect every day or get what you wanted. Give your main character deep rooted struggles and show her insecurities to your readers so they will sympathize with her and relate to her., Because most teen romance stories are read by a female audience, your love interest will likely have to possess one overriding feature: being very good looking.Often called a “Gary Stu” (to his “Mary Sue”), most traditional teen romances contain a highly desirable and physically attractive love interest. However, it’s important not to go too extreme with the desirable traits and physical beauty of the love interest. Cliche descriptions of men like “tall, dark, handsome” or “as beautiful as a Greek god” or “really damn hot” should be avoided.Though you will likely need to imbue your male love interest with a high level of physical desirability, it’s important to also stress personality traits or attributes that make him of interest. Try to keep his character grounded by giving him insecurities and issues that mirror those of the protagonist. Though there should be an element of fantasy to the love interest, you want the love interest to seem believable and similar to a living, breathing person, with issues.

, Establish a connection between the two characters through a shared hobby or interest, a friend or acquaintance in common, or even an awkward conversation while waiting in line. Avoid familiar set ups like “love at first sight” or the male love interest simply sweeping the female protagonist off her feet.The lovers should have an immediate connection, but it doesn’t always have to be a positive one. They may initially dislike each other, or not think very highly of each other. Or they may clash and argue. Let the connection between them grow slowly over the course of the story. Often, young romance involves a lot of yearning, miscommunication, and awkwardness.
One mistake many YA love stories make is to jump right into the smoldering look into each other’s eyes and an immediate love. But letting the tension between the two characters build over time will create a more effective story, and give your reader a reason to keep turning the page.

, A story is nothing without a problem. This is especially true of teen romance stories, as the lovers are often placed in a conflict or faced with an obstacle that tests their love and devotion to each other. The problem can also cause the lovers to admit their romantic feelings or to realize their romantic feelings.


The problem in the story should act as a way to discover more about your protagonist and/or your love interest. It should also create a conflict for the protagonist and for the love interest.
Create a problem that fits the stakes of the story. If you are writing a teen romance novel that involves supernatural elements, you may use the discovery the love interest is a vampire as an initial problem. If you are writing a romance novel about a cancer patient, the problem may be the amount of time she has left to spend with her lover.

, Use Freytag’s Pyramid to structure your story. Structuring your story in an outline before you start writing will help you get a sense of the big picture.


Introduction or Exposition - Set the scene. Let the readers meet your main character. Introduce your reader to the protagonist and the setting.Inciting Incident - This is the thing that gets your story rolling, or an incident that starts the action. It should signal the beginning of the main conflict. In most teen romance stories, this is where the love interest is introduced. For example, your protagonist, a sixteen year old cancer patient with several weeks to live, meets a seventeen year old cancer patient with less time to live and they connect.
Rising Action - Where things in your story become complicated. The stakes of the story should start to rise, due to inciting incident or the main problem in the story. This could be through showing the two characters growing closer together, or further apart. This could also be in the form of a quest, like Hazel and Augustus’ trip to Amsterdam in The Fault in Our Stars.
Climax - The turning point of your story. This section or chapter should have the highest level of tension in the book and be the most exciting moment or event.
Falling Action - The main conflict has been resolved, or not resolved, and events happen as a result of the climax.
Resolution: Your protagonist solves the main problem or conflict, or it is solved for her.
Denouement - Wrapping up the story and letting any last details fall into place. Any remaining questions or concerns in the book are solved or answered. In some books, the author will end on a theme or hint at other possibilities for the characters, beyond the last page.

, Remember your readers are 13-20 years old, and are often going through heavy teen issues around love, loneliness, and desire. Avoid formal terms and language, and use descriptions that will seem accessible to a teenager.Rather than dumb down your language, listen to how teenagers you know talk and interact. The goal is to create believable dialogue and reactions between characters. You want your reader to relate to the your protagonist and her perspective on the world.
For example, in Twilight, there is a scene where Bella tries to flirt with Jacob, a 15 year old boy who turns into a werewolf when the sun goes down.Their dialogue is awkward and hesitant. Bella feels embarrassed by her attempts at flirting and tries to hide her attraction to Jacob. Many teenagers can likely relate to this scene, and understand how Bella might be feeling. This makes Bella an effective protagonist in the story.

, This is a basic writing rule for all genres, not just teen romance. Rather than direct the reader on how they should feel in a scene, show an emotion through the character’s actions and through dialogue.For example, rather than tell the reader, “Bella was upset at Jacob. She felt betrayed”, you can use her action and dialogue to show these emotions. “Bella glared at Jacob, her fists clenched at her sides, her mouth twisted into a frown. “I can’t believe you did that,” she yelled at Jacob.”

, Think about what teens might be struggling with at their age. Often, teens are trying to figure out who they are going to be as adults. They may experience big life issues, like moving to a new city, realizing feelings of desire and love, and wrestling with sexual attraction. A good YA romance novel will look at the larger themes of being a teenager, and incorporate them into the novel.Consider a big theme you may want to explore in your teen romance story. This could be as simple as a protagonist with a special ability that she keeps hidden, causing her to feel like an outsider or an outcast. Or your protagonist could be wrestling with themes like death, unrequited love, or discovering their identity.

, Create an ending that shows the transformation of the main character due to an experience, rather than an ending that gives the protagonist a happy resolution. Often, happy resolutions where the protagonist gets exactly what she wants can feel false or unrealistic.For example, in The Fault in Our Stars, the protagonist, Hazel, is forced to confront the death of her first love, Augustus, but in doing so, she realizes the value of her life and the value of falling in love with someone.

Know the type of article you are writing.,
Consult good examples of sports writing.,
Know as much as you can about the sport you are covering.,
Think about the reader.",How to Write a Sports Article1," You may have an editor assigning your topic, or you may be a freelancer choosing your own. Regardless, be familiar with the most common forms of sports articles and determine which best matches your task. There are five types with which to be most familiar:A “straight lede” (or “lead”) is a basic recap of a sporting event, providing the essentials on who played, who did what, and who won. They can be (but need not be) so formulaic that a computer can write them,and are most common today for youth-level, high school, and small college events that are not shown or covered on TV/radio/internet.
A “feature lede/lead” is more common for larger college and professional events where most of the readership already knows the score, but wants a more in-depth view of what happened and who made the difference in the result.
A “profile” focuses on a colorful character or key figure such as a coach, star quarterback, or journeyman backup catcher with a love for practical jokes.
A “season preview or wrap-up” either prepares the reader for the season to come or takes them on a tour of the highs and lows of the just-completed season. For instance, a baseball writer might file a preview during spring training and a best/worst summary after the end of the regular season (or playoffs).
A “column” is an opinion piece where the sportswriter gets to express his/her opinions on (mostly) sports (mostly) freely. Aspiring sportswriters are likely to have fewer opportunities to write opinion columns than old pros who have proven their mettle over the years.;
, Leaf through your local newspaper, favorite sports magazine, or go-to sports website and think about what makes certain articles stand out. How does the writer draw you in and make you feel like you were at the big game or in the locker room?


Search websites for classic and modern examples of exceptional sports writing., Sports fans are known for their passion and not necessarily for their patience.If you don’t know a sand wedge from a 5-iron or mention your admiration for “LaRon James’” passing skills, readers who know, love, and may have experience playing the sport covered will probably tune you out quickly.


When you’re starting out, if you have the choice, cover the sport you know best. Master writing effectively about it before moving on to less familiar sports.

, What would you want to know about this sporting event? Is the reader likely to already know the final score and who was the star of the game, or are you breaking the news? Write an article you would want to read as a fan of that sport.

"
"
Go to the game, and make the most of being there.,
Talk to people there.,
Sort out the essential details.,
Start with a great hook.,
Flesh out the rest of the essentials.,
Keep it concise.",How to Write a Sports Article2," Watch closely. Take notes. Keep track of important plays, scores, and statistics. Take note of interesting details, such as how the players celebrated at the end or the feel of the crowd that night.


Local sporting events are a good place to start for an aspiring sportswriter. You’ll find passionate fans/parents, eager participants, and a good environment for covering a sporting event from several angles.

, Even if you are writing an event recap and not a personal interest story, a few good soundbites or a central figure to build the article around can only help.


Contact coaches to see if they have a player who would make a good story. Watch the subject play the game, and set up a brief interview. Figure out what makes his or her story distinctive.
Talk to players and coaches to get quotes about the game. Even asking boilerplate questions like “What contributed to you winning the game?” will give you some material with which to work.
Ask permission to record your interviews. Also, try talking to people close to the person, such as parents and friends to create a well rounded view of the person.

, Obviously you need to provide the final score and who did the scoring, but think about the most interesting statistics to come out of the event. How many passing yards did the quarterback have? Did the team’s star swimmer set a personal best in the backstroke? Was a long losing or winning streak broken?

, Known in journalistic circles as a lead (or lede), the opening lines of an article, sports-focused or otherwise, are critical to the success of the piece.Leads should be short, direct, provide the most essential information, and compel the reader to keep going deeper into the article.


Leads focus on the 5 “W’s” and “H” (who, what, when, where, why, and how). In a sports context, the score is always a great place to start. For example: “Last night in Falcon park, the air as crisp as winning quarterback Joe Smith’s passes, the Redview Falcons stunned the first-place Washington Coyotes in overtime, 56 to 54.”

, What was the best part of the game? What were the highlights? What made this game special? For a person, why is his or her story important? What makes them special? Use the quotes you got from players and coaches to add interest to the story.


Consider the 4-step approach to a sports recap that begins with the lead, follows with more essential information, then adds a quote for flavor, then pushes out the rest of the details.News article writing relies on an “inverted pyramid” structure, where the most substantial elements are found at the top of the article, and the information becomes less weighty and important as one approaches the bottom.Readers always start but don’t always finish an article, so make sure they get your best stuff up front.

, Even if you aren’t on an editor’s word count, one of the essential goals of all journalism, including sports writing, is to say as much as possible in as few words as possible. Even if you aren’t restrained by the space needs of a newspaper and are publishing online, your readers will appreciate it if you get to the point quickly. Use shorter sentences instead of longer ones.

Meet expectations.,
Follow your passion.,
Transport the reader.,
Be a writer.",How to Write a Sports Article3," If you’re assigned a profile piece, conduct an in-depth interview and humanize the subject for your readers. If given the chance to write an opinion column, be bold and invite a reaction/response from readers. As mentioned in Method One, know what type of sports article you are writing and study best practices for success.

, Writing is work, often very hard work. Try to remember why you wanted to write about sports in the first place. Think about what you love about sports and let it be reflected in your writing.


If you are covering your alma mater in a basketball game or interviewing a pro golfer who happens to be a childhood hero, let your fan-dom be revealed. Sports are about passion, enthusiasm, and often silly biases. Be impartial with the facts but let readers see you as a sports fan as well as sports writer.

, Most readers of sports articles have, at some point, dreamed of being at the plate with the World Series on the line or serving for the U.S. Open title. Even if they never reached that point, they probably remember what it’s like to grip the bat or toe the service line nervously. Find creative ways to make them feel like they were there at the event you’re covering, not just in the crowd, but on the field.


For example, draw from interviews to place the reader at the foul line with the game on the line: “As she looked at the basket, trying desperately to block out the crowd behind it and the emptiness in front, Jane Davis could swear she caught a glimpse of her old garage wall holding up the hoop, felt the crumbling driveway beneath her feet, and sensed her Dad at her side.”

, Sports writing can sometimes get a bad rap as a lesser form of journalism, but some of the best writers and writing today and historically have covered sports. Hemingway famously wrote about bullfighting, and more recently, one of novelist David Foster Wallace’s most remembered pieces was about tennis star Roger Federer. Don’t sell yourself or your readers short, even if you are covering a youth soccer game. Those kids are giving their best, and so should you.

Inform your instructor if your paper will be late.",How to Write a Two Page Paper in One Day," Before you can write a paper, you'll need a topic to work on. If you were assigned a topic by your instructor, then you won't need to worry about coming up with an appropriate subject. If not, you'll need to come up with your own topic to write about.


If you're having a hard time coming up with a relevant topic, you can try brainstorming. Set a timer for one minute and list as many ideas that come to mind without stopping until the timer goes off.Your topic should address a clear, concise research question.For example, instead of writing about the U.S. Civil War in general, you could write about whether the economy of the Northern and Southern United States prior to the war was a potential cause of conflict.
The best research papers make a clearly-articulated argument for or against a thesis derived from your research question. For example, you might make the claim that economic factors were a cause of the Civil War, and your paper would offer support for that claim.;
, Research is usually a requirement of most school papers, including shorter assignments. However, if your instructor told you that you do not need to do research or incorporate sources, then you won't need to search for or cite texts to support your argument in this paper.Depending on your topic, you may need some primary sources, which are generally considered eyewitness accounts that may include interviews, diaries, recordings, or surveys.Your instructor will probably accept secondary sources for a two-page paper. These include thoroughly-researched texts about a person, place, or event, such as an academic journal article, encyclopedia entry, or textbook subject.You can find both primary and secondary sources by doing research at the library or by searching online.

, Outlining can simplify the writing process, but not everyone likes to work with an outline. This will largely depend on your own personal writing style. If you do decide to use an outline, though, it's important that you make an outline that will be most helpful for you.Draft your thesis statement/argument in your outline.
Come up with a list of major points that support your argument.
Next, create a sub-list of ways to support each major point. This sub-list should be derived from your research and should make it easy for you to plug in each point and source when you write your paper.
Your outline can be more or less detailed, depending on your writing style. For example, instead of breaking down each paragraph of the paper in your outline by idea and citation, you might just list what you will discuss in each paragraph and how it relates to the thesis.

, Planning out a long paper can take a good deal of time and energy. If you're trying to get your paper done in one day, you probably don't have much of either. If you have the time, you should absolutely work out a thorough and detailed outline. However, if you don't think you'll be able to get the paper done in time, you may need to condense your outline to focus on the basics.


While you should take breaks, you should resist the urge to take a break in the middle of a section that you're working on. Use the break as a motivation to finish that section and relax for a few minutes.
Instead of getting bogged down in a detailed outline, work on a basic, bare bones outline.
Limit your outline to a single sentence for each paragraph. For example, in a paper about a book's protagonist the first paragraph's outline might be, ""_____ is a tragic character because they do not know the things the audience knows and cannot recognize their arrogance.""
You will fill in the blanks in your paper once you start to actually write it. For the outline, just stick to one point per paragraph, summed up in a single sentence or just a few words each.

, Working in your dorm or bedroom may be convenient, but it often isn't the most productive environment. Instead of risking being distracted by things like television, video games, or internet browsing, try working in a more conducive work space like the library or a coffee shop.Choose a work space that gets you out of your room and away from distractions as much as possible.
Turn off your cellphone before you start working. Getting texts or social media notifications will only distract you and delay your paper.
If you need to be alone to work efficiently, don't invite any other friends to work at a shared location. It may be fun to work with friends, but it will only further prolong your work and keep you from focusing on the task at hand.

, Depending on your instructor's teaching style, you may have been given a lot of detailed instruction or you may have been given very little guidance. Either way, you'll need to know what your instructor expects out of your work if you want to meet those expectations.


Try to determine how many paragraphs you'll need. The standard model for an academic paper is to have five main paragraphs: the introduction, three body paragraphs, and the conclusion.
If your paragraphs end up being under-developed and too brief to fill two pages, you may need to include more paragraphs or build off of the paragraphs you have.
Find out how many sources you're expected to have. Your instructor may expect you to have a minimum number of citations, and while you can always exceed that number (though not by too much in a two-page paper), you'll want to at least have the bare minimum.

, If you haven't done the reading, it will be very difficult to research and write about your topic. Without doing the reading, you'll have to either look for shorter source articles, find summaries of credible sources, or skim the texts to carefully extract meaningful points that support your claim.As long as you can explain why a given source or quote supports your thesis in some way, you should be able to use it. Just contextualize each source or quote within your thesis so it makes sense to readers.
Make sure you're clear on what the author's arguments are. You don't want to misinterpret an article that argues the opposite of your thesis and cite it as a source in your paper.
If you're doing research online, you can do a key-word search for the topic(s) you need to address at a given point in your paper. This can help you simplify your search and pull out facts or quotes.If skimming the texts, try using the book's index to find anything related to your point. Then scan those passages and make notes on anything that remotely relates to your point., Even though your paper is relatively short, you'll still need to include strong, reliable information. Choosing poor sources affects the strength of your argument and the overall quality of your paper, and it could end up costing you a lot of points off your grade. Stick with scholarly sources and sources that have gone through some type of vetting or review process.Scholarly sources, also called academic or peer-reviewed sources, are written and reviewed by professionals in their field.
Peer-reviewed journals are good scholarly sources. These publications are typically written by academics who have thoroughly studied the subject.
Magazine articles may be acceptable, depending on the nature of the article and the credentials of the author. For example, in a paper about bird migration, an article written by a widely-respected wildlife biologist would probably be a credible source.
If you need more sources you can often mine the works cited section of the academic sources you use. These are the works that the authors of your source consulted to write their paper(s).

, If you're down to the wire on a paper, it may be best to try and keep your paper relatively straightforward. That way you won't get bogged down with intricate sources or complex arguments within your paper. However, simple doesn't necessarily mean easy; you'll still need to incorporate specific ideas and address specific issues/concerns. The point is to work smarter instead of working harder, which sometimes means turning out an average paper instead of your best work.Remember that you only have to write two pages. Don't overthink it, and don't try to overcompensate by writing a longer paper than necessary.
Make sure at least some of your sentences are as specific and detailed as possible. Generalities are easier to write for filler, but your instructor will want to see some substance.You don't have to weigh the entire paper down with an endless stream of examples. Just be clear and creative with the ones you choose to include.
Stick with a straightforward argument that's easy to follow but still contains original ideas.
For example, instead of trying to write about every battle of a given war, focus on two or three major battles that are considered decisive in the war's outcome. Then you could build an argument around what those battles had in common or collectively accomplished.

, Attempting to work continuously through the night without taking any breaks will be incredibly unproductive. You'll get tired and run out of steam fairly quickly if you try to write a paper this way. The best approach is to break your work into smaller, more manageable chunks and schedule how much time you'll need for each section.One way to break up your work would be by paper section. For example, you'd estimate how long it will take to write the introduction, then the first body paragraph, then the second, and so on.
You could also break your work up by time. If you have 24 hours, break the sections of your paper into allotted time slots (say, for example, spending one to three hours on each body paragraph) by working your way backward from the deadline.
Be sure to take short breaks lasting about 15 to 30 minutes each, and space them out every two to three hours. Use this time to have a snack, drink some coffee, and try to get in 10 to 20 minutes of physical activity to help you stay awake and focused.
Once you have your sources lined up, try to budget your time where the work requires it most. For example, don't spend more than 20 minutes outlining your paper, and use the time you saved to focus on the body paragraphs of your paper., The introduction should ease your reader into the subject by providing any necessary background information or contextual material. The introduction should also clarify to the reader what your paper will attempt to argue.The introduction should lay out your thesis and any research questions that informed that thesis.
You may want to hint at how your paper will be organized so that your reader can more easily follow your logic within the paper.
If necessary, define keywords or concepts that the reader would need to know about in order to read your paper.
Remember that the introduction doesn't need to be very long or complex. It should essentially describe what you're going to talk about in the rest of your paper., Your body paragraphs should be built around the specific points you plan to make that will support your thesis argument. Each paragraph should be dedicated to one main point.For most school papers it is common to need at least three body paragraphs, but your instructor may expect even more, depending on the assignment.


It may be easiest to structure your paper with more general points covered first, then moving on to more specific points.
If you're having trouble writing the introduction, try writing the body paragraphs first. You can then introduce your main points in the introduction afterward.
You can include quotes from your research material, but keep them short and limited. Instead, focus on processing and summarizing the work you researched and provide citations for each source.
Depending on how you structure your paper, you may choose to revisit your thesis in the body paragraphs. This can be done by addressing each point's relevance to your overall argument.Try to begin each body paragraph with a mini-thesis based on your assessment of the topic. For example, in a paper about the Civil War, one mini-thesis might be, ""The industrialization of the north was a turning point that divided the nation.""

, The conclusion should be the last paragraph of your paper. It should wrap up the paper and make it clear to the reader that you've arrived at and proven your point. The reader should walk away from your paper with a clear understanding of what your paper argued for or against and how you supported that argument, and the conclusion is a good place to clarify any points that might remain unclear.If your research arrived at any significant findings, you may choose to briefly explain the significance of those findings in the conclusion.
Acknowledge any limits to your argument or any potential counter-arguments. A well-written paper should address questions like, ""What about _____?"" and ""Would that argument hold up if _____?""
End your conclusion with a relevant comment that makes the reader think deeply about your topic. For example, if writing about the U.S. Civil War, you might end the paper by saying, ""Had the Southern U.S. not relied on agriculture, perhaps the war could have been avoided."", Font type, font size, and margin size should all conform to what your instructor requested. If your instructor did not make specific requests, adhere to standard page layout guidelines dictated by the format in which you're expected to write.Your font size should be 12 point.
Choose a font type that is normal for a paper or report, such as Times New Roman, Geneva, Bookman, or Helvetica.
If using page numbers, make sure your pages are numbered sequentially.
The margin sizes you choose will depend on whether your paper is to be written using Modern Language Association (MLA) format or American Psychological Association (APA) format.

, Whether you use MLA or APA formatting depends on the class you're writing for. Generally speaking, MLA format is used in humanities classes (like English, creative writing, and theater courses), while APA is used in science and social science classes (such as psychology, sociology, and biology).APA format uses 1-inch margins at the top and bottom of each page and 1 to 1.25-inch margins on the sides.MLA format uses 1-inch margins on all sides.It's standard to double-space paragraphs in both formats. However, APA guidelines permit single-spacing when it would improve readability, like in titles, figures, and tables.
Both formats need a header in the upper right corner of each page that includes your last name and the page number. Both formats also require the author's last name and the relevant page number in any in-text citation.
You'll need a works cited or reference list at the end of your paper for either format. Both formats list authors alphabetically by their last name, written with the last name first (for example, John Doe would be written as Doe, John).
Both formats use a hanging indentation of 0.5 inches, meaning all lines of a reference/citation after the first line are indented one-half inch from the left margin., If you have time, you may want to review your paper and make any necessary revisions. How thoroughly you revise your paper will depend on how much time you have (if any) after you've finished writing it.Things to consider while revising your paper include, in order of importance:


whether your ideas are organized in a logical way that would make sense to readers and lead to your conclusion(s)
whether you used adequate details to support your more general claims in each paragraph
how well your ideas and paragraphs transition from one to the next
whether your sentences are structured correctly and use appropriate spelling and punctuation

, The thesis statement is your paper's central argument. While you may have a strong thesis statement going into the assignment, it's entirely possible that the research you conduct will disprove your thesis. If this happens, you have to decide whether to simply discuss the shortcomings of your thesis or whether you can make minor adjustments to your thesis so that it matches your findings.Changing your thesis after you've conducted the research and written the paper may be frowned upon by some academics. However, if you're just writing a minor assignment (and if the work won't be published anywhere) you may be able to get away with it.
Try not to radically re-write your thesis, as this may cause complications with the coherence of the rest of your paper.
For example, instead of saying that the cause of a war was simple and straightforward, you might tweak your thesis to say something like, ""Though the causes may seem deceptively simple and straightforward, there are many complex factors, including _____ and _____.""

, If you absolutely know that you won't be able to finish your paper or turn it in on time, it's best to let your instructor know. If you let your instructor know before class that your paper will be late, they'll know that it's still being worked on and won't assume that you aren't going to turn in any work at all.If you have a valid excuse, like a medical or family emergency, let your instructor know. Otherwise, it's best to avoid lying or making false excuses.
You can either email your instructor or ask to speak in the hallway before class to say that your paper will be late.
Whether you email your instructor or speak in private, be sure that you're polite and professional. Remember that you are the one who did not do the work, and your instructor has the right to reject late work or deduct substantial points.

Make an outline of your speech.,
Mention hobbies or outside interests.,
Sell yourself.,
Set yourself apart from your peers.,
Trim your speech down.,
Use short, simple sentences.,
Practice your speech.,
Memorize your speech.,
Determine your audience.,
Decide what's relevant.,
Consider the purpose and tone.,
Try to relax.,
Have good body language.,
Don't rush.,
Use humor if you make a mistake.",How to Write a Speech Introducing Yourself," Start by making a skeletal draft of your main points. Strip the speech down to its bare bones to determine what is most important to say, and in what order you should deliver those facts.This is the basic structure which you will build your speech around.


State your name in the very first sentence of your speech.This can be very straightforward: ""Good afternoon!/Good morning! My name is Deshawn Smith, and I am a computer programming student at the University of Arkansas.""
If the introduction is work-related, mention your interests and your career goals together in the same sentence. This will save on time and convey that your personal interests can serve your professional goals.For example, ""I am working on an app that allows people to order pizza from their Twitter account.""
You may want to mention your education or professional training background, if it is relevant and appropriate.""This is the fifth app I've designed. My second app, which helped people locate dog parks near them, won an award at my university."";
, Depending on the scenario, you may also want to mention any relevant hobbies or additional experience you have. Mentioning interests and hobbies could help cement your authority on a certain subject, or it could feel tangential, depending on the purpose of your introductory speech.


If you are explaining your passion or goal and how it helped formed your progression up to this point, that can help you tell a compelling story about yourself.For example, if you're writing a speech for your college speech class, you might want to explain how you got into computers at an early age and why they're important to you now as you pursue your career goals.
If, however, you are introducing yourself to potential clients at a business lunch, they are probably not interested in your hobbies. They will want to know what you are doing right now and what your skills are.
Try writing one draft with your experience/hobbies and one without, and run both versions by an objective listener who can give you feedback before your speech., If you are trying to make a good first impression in a professional context, it's important that your speech conveys your capabilities and skills. You can accomplish this without sounding self-congratulatory by tying your past accomplishments with your future goals and aspirations, letting others know that your anticipated contributions in the future are grounded in your contributions from the past.Highlight the qualities, skills and experience you have that are most relevant for the audience and occasion. For example, ""Because of my background in app writing and my extensive network of professional connections, I have a strong grasp of what today's young professionals are looking for. My apps offer convenience and immediate gratification.""
You are trying to present yourself as a professional while making a strong and lasting impression.
If you're trying to sell yourself to a group of new colleagues, you probably won't need to tell them about your family life, or anything outside of work that isn't directly relevant., Present yourself honestly, but do so in a way that makes your story stand out from all the rest. If you played an important role in a big project, mention that role. Go further by extrapolating what you have learned from the experience, and explain what ideas you have about how the project could be performed more effectively if it were to be repeated.


You can simultaneously demonstrate your skills and experience, while presenting yourself as a forward-looking person who is always learning and developing.For example, you could say, ""I spend a lot of time attending app conventions and conferences so I can learn what audiences are looking for. I pride myself on staying on the cutting edge of app design.""
Try to tie this into your broader outline of your career goals and personal development.

, Some career service advisors recommend keeping your self-introductory speech as short as two or three sentences.Others suggest aiming for five to seven minutes in length.If it is not possible to make your speech this short, or if time permits you to give a longer introduction, you should still trim down your speech to be as concise, yet informative, as possible.


Make sure that if this is an assignment, you stay within the assigned guidelines.
If your speech is supposed to be 3-5 minutes, a 7-minute speech and a 2-minute speech are equally inappropriate.
If you are giving a brief introductory speech in an interview, be certain that you don't go over the recommended time.

, Remember that your speech is going to be spoken out loud, and your audience will not be able to go back and re-read your words if something is confusing. Deliver your speech in such a way that no one will be uncertain of what you are trying to say.Avoid long rambling sentences, and use direct and concise prose as much as possible.
Think about your sentence structure carefully. Reading your speech out loud will help you determine when you have overly long sentences that need to be restructured.

, You should run through your speech out loud well before the actual introduction. Practice different inflections and experiment with how you pace yourself during the speech. You can practice alone by reading at first, but to get some feedback it's a good idea to perform the speech in front of a friend, family member or colleague.


Practicing in front of other people will enable you to gauge whether your speech captures the interest of your listeners.
Think about which parts of the speech were successful and which parts weren't.
Try to get as much detailed feedback as possible by asking specific as well as general questions after your speech.As well as saying ""how did you like the speech?"", ask specifically what parts were the strongest and weakest.
Check that you delivered a clear message by asking your practice audience what they took away from the speech.

, Know what you're going to say, and how you're going to say it, well in advance. Although in some instances it is common practice to read from a piece of paper, try to memorize your speech and read it with minimal prompts. Presenting without reading a paper can create a stronger impression of control, knowledge and confidence. It will also help keep your audience's attention.


If you are staring down at a piece of paper all the time, the audience might struggle to truly engage with what you are saying.
You can, however, bring an index card with bullet points, just in case you freeze up. You shouldn't write your whole speech on the card, just the main points you hope to cover.
Think of the card as a point of reference, rather than a backup for your speech., If you are writing an introduction for yourself in a professional setting, you will probably choose a different message, and use different language, than if you were introducing yourself to peers in a casual setting.Before you get started on planning your speech, ask yourself the following questions:


Who is the intended audience?
What is the purpose of my introduction?
What are the expectations others may have?, If you had all the time in the world, you could probably think of a lot of interesting and relevant things to say about yourself. But the key to a successful self-introduction is being brief and to the point. That means you will need to decide what are the things that are most important or relevant for your listeners to know about you. You will need to deliver that information in the shortest possible length of time.Stick to one or two main points you want to convey about yourself. You can always add more if time allows it.Depending on the audience and function of your speech, you shouldn't allow the focus to become too narrow. For example, if you're introducing yourself to a crowd of prospective investors, you'd focus on your skills to build their confidence in you. If you're introducing yourself to a general audience -- say, for a speech class in college -- you can be a bit more wide-ranging.
Remember that you're introducing yourself in general, and you want to present yourself as an interesting and rounded individual.That doesn't mean you should spend time talking about your love of baseball when you are introducing yourself in a professional scenario.

, Whenever you plan a speech, you should always be keenly aware of what your intended goals and outcomes are. Ask yourself what kind of message you are hoping to convey to your listeners. Is your self-introduction to network with others professionally, or just casually (with new friends)?


Are you hoping to win someone over to your point of view with this introduction, or to inspire/motivate someone to work hard under your leadership?
All of these will affect the things you say in your introduction and the way you say them., If you find that you get especially nervous before making a speech, you might consider using relaxation techniques shortly before you're due to talk. Find a quiet place and take a few minutes to prepare yourself. Take some deep breaths, focus on your breathing, and count the seconds that pass as you breathe in slowly, then exhale slowly.You can also try some visualization techniques to help ease your nervousness and give you confidence for your speech.
Imagine the way you will feel when you have finished delivering your speech and are met with smiling faces and resounding applause. Then channel that confidence into the actual speech you are about to deliver., It may seem like a minor point, but a slouching posture could make you appear less confident or less professional, and it may be distracting to your audience.Stand up straight and try to project a strong image. You may find it helpful to push your chest out and suck your stomach in a little to help you keep a straight back, but try to keep it natural-looking.Avoid crossing your arms or clutching your hands.Don't stare down at the ground or cling to the table or lecture in front of you.
Make eye contact across the room in a measured and controlled way. Avoid lingering on one person, but also avoid darting your eyes back and forth restlessly.
Try making eye contact with one person on the left side of the room, then one person on the right side of the room. Shift across the room, but in a controlled way that feels natural and relaxed., You don't want to drag out your speech, but you also don't want to stumble over your words or read so fast that nobody can understand you. Try to find a balance and speed that you are comfortable with. You need to speak slowly enough that everyone can follow along and understand what you're saying, but not so slowly that it makes your speech lag.


Aim for a comfortable, conversational pace of dialogue.Practicing your speech in front of other people, or recording it and listening back are great ways to judge the tempo of your speech.

, If you make a mistake while delivering your speech, don't panic. Apologizing profusely draws attention to your mistakes and makes them seem more significant. Instead, if you feel like you need to address the mistake, make a humorous remark and then let it go. This will show comfort and confidence.Self-deprecating humor can help you come across as humble and likable. For example, if you've accidentally skipped forward in your speech and have to circle back, you could say something like, ""And now I'm going to cycle back and tell you something I forgot before. If you wanted to get to know the ""real me,"" you're seeing it now!""You can also make a quick, humorous nod to your mistake and move on. For example, if you come out and you mess up the very first line, you could say something like, ""Wow, excuse me. Here I am so excited to tell you about myself that I've mixed up all my words. Let me try that again.""
Don't be too self-deprecating, however. You are still trying to ensure people remember you for your strengths and competencies. Move on quickly.

Spend a few minutes daydreaming about the world of your novel.,
Once you have a few general ideas about your setting, it's time to start writing your ideas down.,
Make your setting vivid.,
""Show, don't tell"" - it really does work.,
Keep it in mind that you shouldn't always show but not tell.,
By now, you should have a pretty clear mental picture of the world that your characters live in.,
Find a good feedback system that works for you.,
Keep going over it until it's perfect.,
If you really have a passion for the delicate craft of writing, then there's nothing you can't achieve.

",How to Write a Setting for a Book," Different writers find inspiration through different means. Some listen to music while mentally brain-storming setting ideas; some take a walk, waiting for inspiration to come from the real outdoor world; some simply sit in a quiet, peaceful place and think. Find what works best for you, and let yourself get lost inside your imagination.

, It doesn't have to be anything ground-breaking. You don't even have to write in full sentences if you don't want to - sometimes, writing down single words to describe your setting in the early stages of development is better than writing big chunky paragraphs. Write down anything that comes to mind, even if you're not sure it will work. You can easily scrap any ideas that you don't need later on. You could even roughly sketch your mental images of the setting, if that works better. Remember, do whatever feels right to you. There are no rules to follow. Let your ideas flow freely.

, You need to create a gaping hole in the page that drops us into your world. If your setting is a rainforest, your animals need to roar and shriek and squawk; we need to be able to smell the cloying scent of exotic flowers, feel the wind and the rain against our skin, taste tangy juice dancing and singing in our mouths as we take a bite out of a strange but wonderful piece of fruit. Always take all five senses into account, even if you don't plan on making a note on them all, and if you feel that it would add to the scene, comment on the weather. It's completely up to you.

, Writing something like ""It was warm"" doesn't leave much to the reader's imagination and will make it difficult to really connect with your novel. Instead, try experimenting with different language devices or unusual imagery ideas. Saying ""A cloak of balmy sunlight embraced me lovingly"" sounds much more interesting and engaging than ""It was warm"", doesn't it?

, When writing an action scene, you need to keep your description of the setting and what's going on clear but concise. Too many language devices at one time tends to get on the reader's nerves and distracts us from the main plot, so don't over-use them. Once you really get into your setting, it becomes much too easy to ramble on and on about the scene. Remember that you have an actual story to tell. Stay focused on the plot and the characters.

, If you're not 100% immersed in your novel's setting yet, you can always do a little warm-up exercise. Write a page or two about your setting as you explore it. Use whatever perspective that comes most naturally to you. You could take on the role of an existing character in your book, make up a new character, or you could even write an account of the expedition from YOUR point of view. Let yourself get lost in the setting that you've created, and, more importantly, have fun with it.

, You as The Writer don't always spot the same mistakes and inconsistencies that The Reader would. Show what you've written to someone you trust and ask them if your scene building is effective enough, or join an online writing forum.

, Most good writers go over certain pieces of their writing so much, they come to know it off by heart. You can cut details that don't work, add more details that you think would create a more vivid scene, or simply read.

, Now as a 'common man' you may have chosen comic or stories. A short book also can consist of a novel. Now you know your format or what you have to write about.

, A small book should consists of only good thoughts and can be written after too much, or too little thinking. Most people write whatever comes into their thoughts at last stage of their book. So don't be eager to complete your book too quickly. Patience is the key.

, Think of different ideas to be included in your book and sometimes ideas met in your mind automatically. Think perhaps, you just saw a bird and you got a good idea for your book. This all depends on your creativity.

,


A short book adheres to the same three-act structure as a full-length book. In fiction works, the sequence of events or escalation of suspense is often described as;

Chase the man to a house
Shoots bullets at the house


Set the house on fire.
In a nonfiction book, such as an instructional guide,

The first third of the text introduces the terms, tools and the amount of time a user needs to perform a task.
The second third provides him with exercises and simple projects to master the rudimentary skills.
The final third presents more challenging tasks that allow the reader to apply what he has learned.



,
What to do at the time of Famine.
Repair a PC at home

, It doesn't means that you copy that source! Add some of your own features, add some features from a good source and then join all things and write in that book.

, After knowing and collecting everything, create an outline.

Decide on the companions who will be along for the adventure.
The second thing is to decide where and when this conflict takes place.
The third thing is the task of peopling the plot with helpmates for both sides; i.e., the supportive friends and the evil accomplices.
Lastly write about how you plan to resolve the conflict in a way that will be plausible and satisfactory to your audience.
To build your working outline, refer to the three-act structure in Section 1 and make brief notes on what happens in each act to set up the conflict, throw in complications, increase the risks and move toward a resolution.


They can also be for short nonfiction texts.

Identify what your target readers already know. For example, they're brand new to building things with their hands, you'll need to explain what a hammer is, show them a picture of a hammer and show how it's used.
You can start the first third of your book with a more complex approach if your target reader already knows the basics.
Three-act outline for your nonfiction material, your challenge is to make each project a little harder than the one that preceded it.
At this time, you also need to decide whether the book will be straight text or accompanied by drawings or photographs to supplement the content.



, Output is different from time because even though you might commit to two hours of writing per day, you could still end up sitting in front of your monitor for one hour and 55 minutes and only manage to type only a couple of words. If, however, you commit to an output quota of one page per day, it doesn't matter if you write it in half an hour or take all evening. If you type only one page a day for the next 40 days --voila--you'll have finished your first draft in less than two months.

, Simply write.

, If you have a burst of enthusiasm and knock off seven pages in a single day, this is not an excuse to then do nothing for the next week.

, You still have to produce the minimum quota of a single, typed page. The good news, though, is that you're now actually ahead of schedule and will finish your book in less than the 40 days you budgeted.

One thing you should do is get acquainted with poetry.,
Write down key words on a scrap sheet of paper on what you are feeling.,
Then, jot down all the things that could be used, or could relate, to what you wrote down before.,
Think about what you wrote down just now, and think of the ways they can connect.,
Combine these ideas with a certain event in history or a certain circumstance.,
Not all poems need to rhyme or adhere to poetic forms.,
Some people prefer a muse.,
Now, begin to write.,
Lastly, when you are finished, read it a couple of times, edit it a bit, and be proud of it.,
Whether it's a haiku or an epic trilogy, remember to always put your heart into it.",How to Write a Splendid Poem1," A useful way to do this is to read poems by the most famous of poets, like Shakespeare, Edgar Allen Poe, Lewis Carroll, E. E. Cummings, Emily Dickinson... you could go on forever! After this, you could go on YouTube and search for poetry there. Once you've done all of this, you can begin the process of writing a poem.;
, If you are angry, you could write ""bursting, fury, rip, bite"", or if you are sad you could write ""dark, blue, drowning, hopeless."" Write down as many words as possible relating to how you feel.

, If you fell in love, but were cast down by that person, you could invoke the Greek myth of Daedalus and Icarus. (In that story Daedalus' son Icarus flew too close to the sun on wax wings, but the wax melted and he fell to his death in the sea.) Try this exercise and see what you can come up with.

, Can they blend to make a plot or story line, metaphor or simile? For example, ""Like the fool Icarus I was blinded by the sun's warm touch, my heart melted and I was cast down. Drowned in his lies, frozen inside the deep sea of his eyes.""

, If you are writing a poem on betrayal, you could connect it with Lady Jane Gray. (She was only Queen for nine days before her husband beheaded her.) Or if you're having a quarrel, you can connect it with the many wars of today (or yesterday for that matter). The possibilities are simply endless!

, They just need to have meaning. But Robert Frost once said that ""writing free verse is like playing tennis without a net"" — you have to really know what you're doing.

, Inspiration. Whether it's a person, song, object, or animal, they could inspire masterpieces. Some people's muses, for example, are sorrow and tragedies. What could be yours?

, It's useful to have an extended vocabulary. Include every part of you, fragments of your soul, a reflection of your being. Let it write itself, let the words glide along the paper like an eagle in flight, let it roll off your tongue and provoke laughter or tears. Choose every word carefully — it's your life tumbling onto the page, make it something other people will want to read.

, You have just written a marvelous poem.

, (You'll be the awe of all your peers, too.)

Recall the dream you had.,
Set aside 5 minutes every day for writing.,
Practice this over and over again to develop a readiness to make notes on your observations.,
OK, now you've practiced.,
Now you edit.,
Wait for the next ""revelation"".",How to Write a Splendid Poem2," You remember that fantastic dream of yours, where the world and the people in it dissolved into one another, blending impressions with memories and things you thought you would never dream of but still did? And that day when you were in a fever and things seemed uncannily present and still distant. OK, it was marvelous but now you only remember fragments of it´s splendor. Here´s how to make use of those experiences in writing.

, In these few minutes, sit down with your weapon of choice (pen and paper, computer, dictaphone, etc). Try to be as perceptive as possible. Write everything you perceive, quickly: sounds, words, motion, animals passing, planes crashing, flowers in pots growing. Avoid thoughts about the perceptions to get a focus on the events and the objects, not on your processing of it. ""A red car passing. Clock ticking. Steve, Steve! A man's voice. Doorknob. Black chairs stacked. What can I do for you today? A magpie. Two more magpies. Magpies taking off. Sunshine. Elderly couple passing. Checking account.... OK, you get the picture. Don't edit!

, This readiness is a powerful tool. Don't edit!

, Whenever that strange mindstream appears: in a fever, a dream, an unintended delay on a travel, make notes as objectively as possible. Don't edit!

, A lot. And again and again.

, Your readiness for writing objectively will show you the world.

Proofread for correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.,
Complete a word count.,
Share your abstract with a friend or colleague.",How to Write a Scientific Abstract," Authors usually write their abstracts after they have finished their research papers so that the abstract contains the major points of the article. If you need an abstract for a conference paper proposal before your paper is completely finished, be sure to have a draft or outline form of the paper from which you can create your abstract.;
, Highlight or underline the important points and copy and paste them into a separate document. After you finish reading your paper, review your underlined material and select sentences that help explain the research topic, research question, methods, results, and conclusion. Retain this material for your abstract., Remember that online databases have keyword search engines for finding abstracts. Note relevant keywords that will help researchers find your paper. Set these aside for use in your abstract.

, Using the material and keywords set aside from your paper as the basis, write 1-3 introduction sentences that explain the research topic, purpose of the study, and research question(s).The first sentence should be interesting, eye-catching, and draw the reader into your piece.As the shortest part of the abstract, your background should convey what already is known about the subject and how it relates to your paper. The background also explains what we do not know yet about the subject and thus what the study examined and/or what your paper presents.Think of the research paper as having investigated a particular scientific question. Other researchers will value knowing your research question.
Your background section should answer questions like: What did I study? Why is my research question important? What did my field of study know about my research question before I did this study? How will this study advance knowledge in our field?Try to use an active voice and reduce passive language throughout your abstract. For example, write: ""I interviewed Cassandra"" instead of ""Cassandra was interviewed by me.""
Minimize use of pronouns like ""I"" or ""we."" Write about ""the study,"" ""this paper examines,"" or ""this research"" instead of ""my study"" or ""I write about...""
Keep your abstract in the past or present tense but not in the future. For instance, do not write: ""this paper will examine"" but ""this paper examines"" or ""the results showed.""

, The second-longest section of the abstract, your methods section should explain in 2-3 sentences how you conducted your study and what exactly you did. Did you use qualitative and/or quantitative methods? Methods can include lab experiments, ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, surveys, and/or data analysis. Your methods section should answer the following questions:


What was the research design?
How long did the study last?
What was the sample size?
How did you recruit participants?
What was the research setting?, Write 1-2 sentences describing the results/findings of your study. Major findings include key quantitative or qualitative results or identified trends.Your results section is the most important part of your abstract because it explains what you discovered and the relevance of your work to other people's research. This is the time to elaborate and give details., In 1-2 sentences, iterate your overall summary of the project and its theoretical and/or practical impact on the pertinent field(s) of study. State whether your research has filled a knowledge gap. The conclusion should be data-based and very factual. Do not present unsubstantiated personal opinions.End your conclusion with a strong final sentence.

, Your title should summarize the abstract and convince reviewers or potential readers that the topic is important, relevant, and innovative. The abstract title can be the title of your paper. Be sure to include your name, institutional affiliation (if applicable), and contact information under the title.Some organizations, journals, or conferences require a special format for the title, which could be all uppercase letters, bolded, or italics., Your abstract should be short and concise but also flow smoothly. Make sure you have adequate transitions from sentence to sentence and consider adding transition words like ""additionally"" or ""furthermore."" Fix any problem sentences that represent your findings inaccurately or are unclear in their meaning.


Read the abstract as if you were another researcher deciding whether to read your paper. Do you find the abstract has the right information to help you decide whether to read it? If not, ask yourself what is missing.

, Consider printing out your abstract and editing it with a pencil or pen. Having your work in print versus on your computer screen can help you catch additional mistakes and envision how your abstract will appear in printed mediums. Because your writing style impacts readers' perception of your work, effective style and accurate grammar and mechanics are important elements of a successful abstract.


Be sure to place commas and periods within quotation marks, e.g. ""Milton said."" instead of ""Milton said"".
Do not end sentences with prepositions (of, for, about).
Vary your verbs and nouns from sentence to sentence and use a print or online thesaurus for synonyms in order to not sound repetitive.
Avoid vague adjectives like ""very"" and ""many."" Try to quantify your findings with specific numbers or conditions that offer comparisons. For example, ""135 interlocutors participated"" or ""Subject A's performance was thirty percent better than Subject B's performance.""
Written years should not have apostrophes. Thus, write ""1990s"" rather than ""1990's.""
Eliminate unnecessary content and add any missing important pieces of information., Make sure that your abstract is not too long or excessively short. Aim to have as close to the word count limit as possible, whether for example, 200 or 250 words. Some journals or conferences will reject abstracts that are too long so be sure to be accurate.

, Having another person review your abstract will ensure that your abstract makes sense to potential readers. If they have suggestions for changes, re-read your abstract and revise your work.

Hire some voice talent to read the commercial.",How to Write a Script for a Commercial," Generally, businesses write scripts for both television and radio ads. If you are unsure which type of ad to buy, hire a marketing consultant or ask your marketing department to report on what stations and media are targeting your ideal audience.;
, You will need to establish the length of the ad before you write the script. Choose the station that targets your audience and offers an attractive deal.


For example, some radio stations offer commercial matching. If you buy 20 ads, they will throw in 20 30-second ads for free.

, If you are looking for someone to write a jingle, convey a complex message or be witty with the script, you may want to inquire about the costs for a local copywriter or marketing agency. A 15 to 30-second commercial can be fairly inexpensive for a freelance copywriter.

, Establish the following points:


Decide what the goal of your commercial will be. For example, you might want to announce a new business, appeal to a different demographic, move sale inventory, get new clients or announce an affiliation with a charity or cause.
Establish an offer for your listeners. Decide what special item, discount or knowledge listeners could get for taking action after the commercial.
Pick a ""call to action."" Give the listener or watcher a single task. Make sure your offer motivates them to act. Try not to create more than 1 call to action. For example, only ask them to go to your website, instead of asking them to call your number, go to your website and email you.
Decide if you are following a certain branding or advertising path. If you are in the midst of re-branding, then make sure you have the style, message or motto listed as necessary elements for the ad.

, Allow them to ask you questions to try to identify further details about the company.

, Consider including the following things:


Start with an attention-grabbing sentence. The introduction is important, because it catches the listener's attention.
State the business name and offer several times. You may want to do this at the beginning, middle and end, by working it into the script in a natural way. Repetition helps the audience to remember your information.
Include a sentence about a special, limited or exclusive offer.
Follow with a clear call to action. Tell the listener what they must do to get the special offer. The motivation (offer) should be commensurate with the call to action. For example, a free sample of shampoo is probably not enough motivation to get someone to sign up online; however, a free pilates class that is a $20 value may be enough to create an online account.

, This is a script, so it should be written like a play, rather than in prose.

, Ask someone to read it out and use a stopwatch to see how many seconds it takes. Note whether information needs to be removed or added.

, Take into account that most people will not give their full attention. Remove unnecessary information and add pauses for comprehension.


Make sure it is not too clever. If the commercial relies heavily on sarcasm or another type of humor, you may want to try it out on a number of different audiences, to make sure it is not complicated or difficult to get across.

, Ask for comments before you begin recording or give the script to the station.

, Adjust the script to the actor if necessary. Practice until the actor is reading it correctly.

Justify your marketing strategy.While the specific reasons for a marketing strategy will vary, having a marketing strategy in place is important for any business or organization.,
Identify the customer.Unless you have a clear sense of who the target audience of the marketing campaign is, you will have difficulty writing an effective marketing strategy.,
Develop your vision.With your customer in mind, sit down with your team to think about how you can best market the product or service you offer.,
State the goals of and obstacles to your marketing strategy.When writing this part of the strategy, you might want to use a three-columned page with goals in the far left column, obstacles to the goals in the next column, and solutions to overcoming the obstacles in the far right column.,
Tell your brand story.Your brand story is the character of the brand you’re trying to develop with the marketing strategy.,
Propose teaming up with your partners.",How to Write a Strategy1," A written marketing strategy will provide a guide for future marketing efforts and reduce challenges when new marketing plans are developed.


Emphasize that with a marketing strategy in hand, your organization or business could improve its performance and operate more efficiently.
Since the marketing strategy is often reviewed by the head of the company or an executive, it is important to write a strong marketing strategy to ensure the marketing department receives adequate attention and resources.;
, If you are targeting multiple consumer segments, you might need to devote a section on each population.


For instance, if your product or service is aimed at both young people generally and Hispanics specifically, you’ll need to be clear about whether a single strategy is appropriate for both (it probably isn’t), and how the two campaigns will be developed.
When writing the strategy, lay out any evidence you have about who your core customer base is. Draw on polls, census data, and customer feedback surveys to establish the demographics of your consumers. Think about their age, race, class, and gender.

, Start brainstorming ideas about what customers might like in the future based on advertisements and imagery that you know they've respond to before. Write the best of these ideas into the marketing strategy so that you can reference them later.


Evaluate your current and past marketing campaigns to discover what worked and what didn’t. Include these findings in your strategy to help explain what future strategies should and shouldn’t do. Use this section of the strategy to find out who you are and who you want to be as an organization.
If you have trouble figuring out what your customers are interested in, write a list of possible steps you could take to find out more. For instance, you might recommend a more thorough data-gathering process during which the marketing team investigates similar brands and products, and evaluates how their marketing campaigns succeeded or failed.
You might also suggest more intense research like focus groups consisting of your core customers or a new customer market you’re interested in attracting. In focus groups, you can give questionnaires or conduct interviews with specific members of a relevant demographic to find out what they’re interested in. For instance, you might show two different ads to a group of Millennials and see which they responded more positively to.

, Think about both internal and external goals and obstacles when writing this section.


Internal goals include hiring more staff and creating more stable workflows within the marketing department.
Internal obstacles might be a lack of space or funding.
External goals might include improving the public’s image of a brand, product, or service.
External obstacles might be the stock market or consumer attitudes toward your product or service.

, What does your company or organization stand for in the eyes of the consumer? When you write the strategy, be sure you explain what the company is all about, and how the marketing strategy relates to the overall image the company is trying to develop. The strategy might express to consumers that the brand is hip, well-established, stable, dependable, or associated with some other feeling or idea. Write a strategy to communicate your brand story through:


Advertising (radio, online, and in television)
Social media (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram)
Web presence (a website and online store)

, Partners could be other corporations or agencies, or they could be customers. Customer interaction and collaboration can inspire feelings of loyalty and create new interest on the part of the consumer.In your written strategy, list your partners and suggest some projects that could include them to help build the brand.

Compile a proposal package.",How to Write a Script for a Comic Book," Plot first scripts, often called ""Marvel style"" scripts due to Stan Lee's preferred style, leaves out a lot of the detailed instruction and gives that creative license to the artist or illustrator. There are exceptions, of course, but typically a plot first script is chosen when the writer and the artist have a strong rapport from previous projects, or when the writer will also do his own illustrations, in which case the script serves more as an outline for what the artist/writer anticipates will happen.A plot first script will typically include the characters, narrative arc, and page instructions. This type of script generally leaves the details of the script, such as the number of panels, the arrangement of panels, and the pacing within the page, to the illustrator's discretion. Often times the particulars of a scene, such as dialogue and captions, are added by the writer after the illustrator has created the art and broken the various scenes down into their panels.Unless you intend to write and illustrate your comic, a plot first script works best when the writer and illustrator have worked together in the past and trust one another's vision for the comic.;
, A plot first script doesn't have to be as detailed as a full script, as the script serves as more of a template or outline of the comic's narrative arc. But there are still important decisions to be made, and a writer working on a plot first script must think in terms of storylines for the current issue as well as future issues of the comic.


A plot first script typically focuses on the characters and story arc involved in a given comic's issue.The script will focus on which characters are involved in that issue, what will happen to each character, and may include some notes about how the characters will interact with one another in that issue.Once the script is written, the artist illustrates the panels. Because the plot first script is so minimal, the writer often ends up giving the artist extensive liberty to determine how events unfold, and at what pace., Once the artist has illustrated the panels, the writer reviews the panels and writes dialogue to fit the sequence of events that the artist has depicted. The writer's dialogue is limited by the space provided for caption bubbles and by the imagery that the artist has chosen. For this reason, it is worth reiterating that plot first scripts work best when the writer and the artist have worked together in the past and have a shared vision for the style, format, and story arc of the comic., Unlike screenplays, there is no single standard format for full script comics.You may choose to follow a screenplay format, or you may wish to mimic the script format of a comic series that you really enjoy. Or you as the writer may choose to create your own format that makes the most sense to you. However you choose to format your script, be sure that it includes the following:


unambiguous directions that the artist will be able to followvisible page and panel numbersindentations or other visual cues in the script for dialogue, captions, and sound effects, Once you've decided how you want the script to be formatted, you may want to take a bit of time to determine how you want the comics to visually appear on the page. Just as there is no single standard format for a script's format, there is no single page layout that a comic must follow.Some comics progress from left to right like written sentences. Other comics use larger, page-wide panels that progress from top to bottom. Still others use entire pages as a single panel.Some comics will use one page layout - say, a series of panels read from left to right, top to bottom - and then throw in some variance for dramatic effect. A common tactic is to suddenly shift to a panel that takes up an entire page, for dramatic effect. This might happen during a dramatic death, an unexpected betrayal, or anything else that will shock or surprise your readers.

, Once you begin writing the script you'll significantly expand the ideas and develop your characters more thoroughly, but when you're starting your script it may be helpful to have an outline. This allows you to have a reference of your original intentions, in case you get too deep into expanding and developing. It also gives you a bare bones template that can help you plan out how a given issue's plot and story arc will relate to other issues of your comic.


Start by writing a single sentence for each turn of events in the story.Add in some brief notes on which characters are involved in each major event, and how those characters relate to one another.If you have ideas planned out for future issues of your comic, connect your notes for the current issue with other single sentence plot points for the future., Once you've plotted out your story's outline, you'll need to start planning for the script itself. Before you begin writing the script, think visually about the outline you've created. Don't just restrict yourself to the main sequence of events. You may choose to give a lot of creative license to your illustrator, or you may decide to give visual direction to the illustrator on how to depict the setting of your comic (including whether that setting's ambiance changes from day to night or from season to season). You'll also need to come up with concrete visual images for things like establishing shots, character closeups (including the style of dress and any traits or quirks of characters), and the general feeling you want readers to have about each character and the environment they inhabit.The best way to train yourself to think visually as a comic writer is to read a wide variety of comic books and graphic novels. Look closely at the style of each comic and the details given in each panel. Think about what kinds of written direction you would need to give an illustrator for him to design that scene/panel/character., The description lines will instruct the illustrator on how various parts of the comic should appear. This can be tricky, as it requires you to combine the visual imagery you've envisioned with detailed written instructions to the illustrator.Common directions given in description lines include instructions for the establishing shots in a given comic, closeups of characters or images, and background imagery.There are two common methods of writing description lines:



Page description provides the illustrator with the setting, mood, characters, and action sequences that are to appear on each page of the comic. The illustrator then decides how many panels will appear on each page, and chooses how best to represent those instructions in each panel.

Panel description gives detailed instructions to the illustrator on how each panel should appear, and what should happen in each panel. Some writers even recommend to the illustrator how to frame each ""shot"" of each panel.

, The writer should mention specific details about any visual elements that are important to the plot. This may include meaningful objects, characters who will be relevant later in the story, and even what season or time of day a given panel takes place in.Give any relevant information that the artist will need before drawing out each scene, such as time of day, expressions on characters' faces, and any objects or environmental details that will be significant later in the comic., Captions can be thought of as the voice of the disembodied narrator who informs readers of where the action is taking place, or providing ""voice overs"" during meaningful events in the comic. They appear in square or rectangular boxes, usually at the top or bottom of a comic panel. Captions should work in conjunction with the images drawn by the artist to help inform the reader or to elevate the reader's experience of the comic's narrative arc.Write captions in the order they should appear in the finished comic.Avoid captions that simply repeat or reiterate the visual cues from the comic. In other words, don't use captions to tell the reader what would otherwise have been inferred from looking at the comic., Dialogue is the actual conversations and soliloquies that characters speak during the course of the comic. Dialogue boxes are often depicted as a round or oval-shaped bubble, usually with a small ""tail"" to a character's mouth to indicate that that character is speaking.


Characters should appear in a panel in speaking order. In other words, the character on the left should talk first, with her dialogue bubble appearing above any subsequent dialogue bubbles. If two characters have a back-and-forth conversation, the character on the left should speak first, and the character on the right should respond with a dialogue bubble below the first speaker's text.One lengthy dialogue bubble or conversation between two or more characters should be contained in a single, still frame.Don't try to cram too much dialogue into one panel. Rather than cramming a panel so full of conversation that it blocks out the characters, you may want to opt for a back-and-forth conversation where one panel shows a closeup of one speaker (and her dialogue), and the next panel shows a closeup of the other speaker (and his dialogue).Once you've written your dialogue, read it out loud. Like any written dialogue, it may sound different when heard out loud, and you may notice some lines are difficult to read quickly or sound weird when paired with the action in that scene. Always read your dialogue out loud, and ask yourself if the dialogue (when heard out loud) conveys what it should be conveying in the scene.Don't get bogged down in verbal writing. The primary characteristic of a comic is the visual element, so remember the old adage, ""less is more."", This part of the script may be most similar to a film script in that it gives extensive detail about what will actually happen during the course of a comic. Some successful comic writers recommend writing for yourself first, and the audience second. In other words, don't compromise your vision for what your comic should look like because of what you imagine people do or don't want to see. Write a comic that you'll be satisfied with, and if it's a sincere and meaningful comic to you, it will most likely be meaningful to your audience.Each panel should develop a character or further the narrative story being told. In other words, don't be wasteful with your panels, and make the action count for something in your story.Remember that the primary action of your comic will be visual. As you write the action for the script, don't get too text-heavy. Just provide the illustrator with sufficiently detailed instructions on how the action should look., Once you've written the action, dialogue, and captions, you'll need to write how the illustrator should transition the comic from one panel to the next. This is important, as poor transitions can make the comic feel choppy, inconsistent, or even confusing. Regardless of the comic's pace, each panel should flow together smoothly and seamlessly. Some common types of transitions include:


Moment to moment transitions - the same person, object, or scene is shown in succession across multiple panels, with each panel showing a different (but not too distant) moment.This may be useful for showing transitions in mood as one character relays information to another character, for example.
Action to action transitions - the same person, object, or scene is shown in succession across multiple panels depicting different - yet still related - actions.This may be useful as a sort of visual montage to show the passage of time as a character trains for a fight or embarks on a journey, for example.
Subject to subject transitions - each panel depicts a different person or object, across a continuous scene.This is useful for breaking a longer conversation into smaller dialogue panels.Scene to scene transitions - the two panels in this type of transition show entirely different scenes, which may take place in differing environments or time periods and may depict different characters or actions.Aspect to aspect transitions - each panel in this type of transition shows different aspects or elements of the same place, people, or action.Non sequitur transitions - this type of transition makes a drastic jump from one scene to the next without any apparent continuity or connection from one panel to the next. Because of the potential for confusing readers, this type of transition is very rare in most comics that follow a continuous narrative arc., Do you see your comic being a stand-alone story, or part of a larger narrative? Does your comic's narrative follow a single person, a group of people, or multiple generations of people? All of these are important factors to determine before you try to get your comic published. If you go through a publisher, they will most likely want to know before publication what you see for the future of your comic. Knowing the ""mythology"" of your comic's universe will help you find a publisher who will make your dreams for your comic come to life., There are many different publication routes a comic writer can take. Which route you choose will depend on your vision for your comic, what kind of audience you realistically see the comic appealing to (niche audience or mass appeal), and whether you'd prefer to work with a smaller ""indie"" press or a larger publishing agency. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages, and no single choice is necessarily ""better"" than any other.Search for different comic publishers online and read about each publishing press's submission guidelines, contractual obligations, and monetary compensation. You should also look into whether or not a given publishing press accepts unsolicited manuscripts.

, Once you've done your research and you know what kind of press you'd like to work with, you'll want to put together a proposal package to send to a given publishing press. Include your name and contact information on every page of the package, in case any pages are lost or separated from the package.A good proposal package will include:


a cover letter that addresses the editor of a press by name and includes all of your contact information, as well as what your comic is generally abouta written ""elevator pitch"" that summarizes the plot of your comica detailed plot outline and elaborate character biographiesa rough estimate of your comic's length, format, and any ideas for future story arcsan introduction to your comic's setting (which is particularly important to know in the case of science fiction or alternate reality comics)a full script or, at minimum, a sufficient sample of your script to give the editor a good idea of how your comic will appear and what type of story it will beany illustrations you or an outside artist have come up with for your characters, setting, or action sequencesany relevant copyright/trademark notices"

Elaborate on your organization’s identity.What is your organization about?,
Make a tally of your resources.,
Define your goals.,
Confront obstacles to the strategy’s goals.Be as complete and honest as possible during this step.,
Set specific goals.",How to Write a Strategy2," What is your company’s vision and mission statement? Use these as a jumping-off point to write briefly about your organization’s purpose and values.


If you don’t have a mission statement, you should develop one. The mission statement should describe the company’s daily operations. For instance, an eyeglass manufacturing center might have a mission statement that reads, “Our mission is to provide quality eyewear at affordable prices.”
If you don’t have a vision statement -- a statement that describes the organization’s imagined future and ultimate goals -- encourage your organization to create one. For instance, the above-mentioned eyeglass manufacturer’s vision statement might be, “To push optometry forward and ensure everyone can live a full life.”
Mission and vision statements should be stable and long-term fixtures within the organization, and not subject to frequent change.

, Resources are not only financial assets. They also include staff, stockholders, volunteers, and partner agencies or organizations.Incorporate these resources into your strategy in order to give yourself a clearer picture of where you are and where you’re going. When writing your strategy, you should answer the following questions:


Who or what are your resources?
How can you better utilize your resources?
Are there resources you need, but do not have?
How can you obtain new resources?

, Write about short-term and long-term goals. Where do you see the organization in six months? Where do you see the organization in five to ten years?Together, these two perspectives will gives you a broad outline of where you want to be and what will come next when you've successfully executed your strategy. When writing about the goals of the strategy, answer questions like:


How will the organization or business change or expand? Will the company or organization be leaner in five years, with fewer employees and less real estate? Or will it be larger than it is today?
What will the organization’s finances look in five to ten years? Use prior financial gains to make predictions about the future.

, Even though it might hurt to confront the difficulties your business or organization faces, you can only move forward if you accept where you are. This part of the strategy should not only identify the obstacles to your organization, but also reflect on ways to overcome them.


How will the organization adapt to the changing market? If you’re in the museum world, for instance, you might need to address the fact that the number of museum visitors continues to drop each year.
Write a list of what stands in your way along with actions you can take to successfully overcome these obstacles.
Think about how to adjust marketing, payroll, sales figures and expenses.

, Set goals for each category and describe exactly what that category will look like when finished. For best results, a goal must be specific, quantifiable and reasonable.


Your goals should be quantifiable. For instance, a goal like ""Increase sales by 10%"" is a good goal because it is specific, and you can measure sales using actual data.
Recommend a timetable for each goal. For instance, you might say, “We should increase sales by 10% in the first quarter, and by another 10% in the second quarter.”

The strategy is composed of tactics -- steps you can take to complete the plan.They explain how to move from where you are to where you want to be. Together, tactics explain a process for action.
Goals are the individual desired outcomes. The strategy might accomplish several goals, or just one.

, The audience you’re writing for will determine the language and content you use when writing the strategy.


For instance, if you’re writing an internal strategy for your marketing department, you will need to focus on marketing-related issues, problems, and concepts. You could use terminology and jargon specific to people inside the marketing industry, since they will be the ones reading it.
On the other hand, if you’re writing a strategy about how to devise a marketing strategy for a general audience, you will not necessarily be able to write a strategy that uses the same kind of language, since your audience will not be marketing insiders.

, Only set goals that can be reached with the resources available.


For a business strategy, this might be ""increase advertising presence."" For a home improvement project, it might be ""paint the house on weekends.""
Setting goals you can't reasonably reach is worse than not having a goal. Not only where you not end up where you want to be, you'll also be discouraged by your failure.

, Once you have your goals, you’ll need to figure out how to get there. The tactics are the individual steps that compose a general strategy.Your tactics should be narrow, specific, and achievable. If you need help brainstorming what tactics can help you write your strategy, ask a colleague or a mentor (preferably one who has written a similar strategy).


If you’re writing a video game development strategy, for instance, talk to others who have written video game development strategies, or someone who has contributed to the development of a video game.
Create a plan for accomplishing each goal on time. Set a time frame for each goal based on realistic assumptions about the resources available and the length of time each goal will take to achieve.

, What could go wrong? Make a list of each potential threat, weakness, or obstacle. Include roadblocks to the company or industry as a whole, as well as difficulties related to specific steps.


For instance, a company that distributes movies to theaters might have to address the decline of the movie industry.
A weakness related to a specific strategy suggestion might be a lack of money to invest in new equipment.

, They should not only correct basic errors like misspellings and incorrect punctuation, but also look for content or ideas that are unclear, incorrect, or missing.


Keep your writing clear and understandable for the reader. Be direct and avoid making vague statements.

Research leadership.,
Define leadership in your own terms.,
Think about how you exhibit leadership in your life.,
Think outside the box when contemplating leadership.",How to Write a Scholarship Essay on Leadership2," Simply put, leadership is the ability of someone to guide their peers towards a goal or an outcome.In order to write a scholarship essay on the subject, you need an even deeper understanding of the trait. Look for books, articles, and Web sites that focus on the concept of leadership.


Web sites such as amazon.com and goodreads.com offer lists of leading titles on leadership.Some classics in the field include The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, by John C. Maxwell; Good to Great, by Jim Collins; and Strengths Based Leadership, by Tom Rath and Barry Conchie.A quick Internet search will provide you with countless articles on leadership, which will help you understand its core principles.

, Now that you’ve researched the topic, think about what it means to you.


Are you inspired by the ambition and risk-taking of good leaders? If so, focus on those in your essay.Maybe you are more interested in the fact that good leaders are knowledgeable of their mission and have a strong vision of how to attain it. You can highlight these traits in your essay.Don’t forget that good leaders also exhibit strong communication skills and are comfortable delegating duties to a dedicated team. Write about these characteristics in your essay as well., Most essays about leadership require you to reflect on ways you have demonstrated the trait in the past. By spending time brainstorming before you begin to write, you will make the writing process much easier.


If you are not yet in the work force, think about how you may have demonstrated leadership abilities in sports and on academic or debate teams.
Volunteer work and club memberships are other possibilities to consider when reflecting on your leadership experience.
If you are in the work force, think of projects or teams you were on that gave you leadership experience.
Some specific leadership traits you may be able to find in yourself include trustworthiness, reliability, and consistency.Be specific when thinking about your own leadership experience. Think of specific goals or successes that resulted from your leadership.

, You don’t always need to be in charge of something to exhibit leadership. For children and young adults, leadership can be shown by helping people, making the right choices, and being independent.You may have shown leadership in your neighborhood by helping older neighbors with yard work or organizing games for kids after school.
Another way you could have shown leadership is in your own family. Maybe you helped care for a younger sibling while your parents were working or taking care of an elderly relative, or you took on more responsibilities around the house during a difficult time.
You may have demonstrated leadership at school. Did you confront a bully for a classmate? Did you help tutor a friend after school?

Write an introduction that makes your audience want to read more.,
Sum up your argument in one thesis statement.,
Write three paragraphs of body text.,
Write a strong conclusion.",How to Write a Scholarship Essay on Leadership3," Your introductory paragraph should be three or four sentences that address what you will cover in the essay; in this case it would be leadership.


A good way to grab interest in the introduction is to provide an anecdote from your life that shows leadership. You could write something like, “My leadership abilities were on display when I confronted a classmate who had been bullying a friend.”
Alternatively, you could mention a great leader from history who has inspired you. It could be something like, “General Eisenhower showed great leadership when he gave the order to launch the D-Day invasion.”

, Explain what it is about leadership that you will be writing about.


Your thesis statement should appear in the introductory paragraph of your essay, usually as the last sentence.If the application asks a direct question about leadership, you will need to answer it. That will form the basis of how you craft your thesis statement.
A thesis statement should be debatable; you should take a side. An example would be, “A leader can be any individual whose characteristics and qualities people admire and try to emulate.”
Some examples of strong thesis statements are: “The most important trait for a leader is ambition;” “All strong leaders are good communicators;” and “Every great leader has overcome failure in his or her life.”
The rest of your essay should offer supporting evidence for the argument(s) you make in your thesis statement., The body text should support the argument outlined in your thesis statement. Following your introductory paragraph with three paragraphs of body text, and then a conclusion, allows you to follow the classic format for a five-paragraph essay.Each paragraph of the body text section should contain a different argument/evidence that supports your thesis. The first body text paragraph should feature your strongest arguments.
Each paragraph of body text should be between three and five sentences long.
Throughout your body text, be sure to offer examples and anecdotes that boost your arguments. For instance, if your thesis is “ambition is the most important characteristic of leadership,” give examples of how you or strong leaders throughout history have embodied this trait.
Use the information you gathered during your research when writing your body text.
If the essay application defines different requirements for your essay, such as longer or shorter, follow those instead of the five-paragraph model.

, Your final paragraph is your last chance to convince your reader of your arguments.Your conclusion should feature a re-phrasing of your thesis statement, as well as a summary of your supporting arguments.
Finish your conclusion with a final thought on the topic.
Do not introduce any new evidence in your conclusion."
"
Re-read your essay.,
Solicit feedback from a parent, teacher, or friend.,
Remember the “intangibles” that make an essay great.",How to Write a Scholarship Essay on Leadership4," Once your essay is written, step away for a few hours or, if you have time, a few days. Then, read it again with an eye toward whether it fulfills the application criteria and whether it needs any editing.


Does your essay answer the question(s) posed clearly and comprehensively?
Did you follow the format, style, or length requirements listed on the application?
Did you make any typos or grammar errors that need to be fixed?

, It is always helpful to have another person read what you have written. They will look at your essay with fresh eyes and let you know if there is anything that should be added or fixed., In addition to answering the questions posed and meeting the requirements of the application, you can create a great essay by incorporating some characteristics of good writing.


Active voice verbs are better than passive ones. Your text will be more compelling if you focus on this simple task.Be concise. If you can say something in a sentence rather than a paragraph, write it that way.Specific examples that support your viewpoint are better than general statements.Make sure your essay really represents you and your thoughts. By maintaining your individuality throughout the writing process, you will be able to bring your own unique perspective to the essay, setting it apart from all of the others."

Explore fear.,
Think of a topic.,
Learn about different age groups.,
Read a variety of scary stories.,
Write a strong beginning.,
Focus on building suspense in the middle.,
Pick a climatic moment.,
Have some kind of resolution.",How to Write a Scary Story for Kids," Scary stores are meant to provoke feelings of fear. In order to successfully craft a scary story for a young child, you need to learn about the kinds of topics that tend to provoke fear.


The unknown is perhaps the scariest topic of all. People do not know what comes after death, and so death is frightening. If the source of a noise cannot be identified, that noise can provoke fear. Playing with people's fear of the unknown and the unknowable can be an effective means to tell a horror story.Withholding information can be an effective means to write a horror story. Sometimes, leaving out precise explanations for certain mysteries can be more satisfying than a fully explained ending. Try to leave something to the imagination when crafting your scary story., Scary stories tackle a variety of topics and ideas. Choose a topic for your story that you feel is appropriate for the given age group.


Stories about paranormal activity are popular for children's scary stories. Such tails usually involve stories of ghosts, demons, and other otherworldly specters. Such stories are often told around the campfire. An example would be the legend of Bloody Mary, a story in which you can summon the spirit of an angry ghost by saying ""Bloody Mary"" three times while looking into the mirror.
Stories about monsters are also popular among children. Monsters from folklore, like witches and ogres, are often portrayed as posing some threat to a person or community and requiring defeat. The legend of Tailypo would be an example. The story is about a hunter who somehow cuts off the tail of a mysterious creature in the woods, only to be stalked by the creature each night with demands the tail be returned.Stories about murder and gore are also sometimes popular. An example would be the infamous campfire legend ""The Hook"" in which sightings of a serial murderer who kills victims with his hooked hand are reported in a given area. A couple or a group of friends are sitting alone in a car and one of the gang says they hear something, prompting them to drive away. Later, a hook is found hanging off the car's bumper. Such subjects can be very frightening and might be more appropriate for older children.

, Different topics might be more appropriate for different age groups. While it can be fun for children to occasionally feel frightened, you do not want to cause nightmares or intense distress.


For very young children, from ages 3 to 6, you might want to keep stories somewhat lighthearted and offer a happy resolution. Children in this age group may be more susceptible to fear than other ages. You should present a scary scenario, but find a way to leave off on a comforting note. The ghost that haunts the mansion turns out to be friendly. The monster in the dark woods is only roaring and chasing children because he has a stomach ache.For older children, there may actually be benefits to reading scary stories. Many fears, like loss of family and abandonment, can be healthily addressed in scary stories. However, it's important that some kind of lesson or positive outcome results from a scary story. The Harry Potter series, for example, is considered age appropriate reading for children 8 and up because it takes place in a moral universe where evil is punished and fought against. As long as your scary stories end in some kind of victory, even if there is sadness along the way, it is probably appropriate for children between ages 6 and 10.As children get into the young adult phase, ages 11 and over, they begin to question overly optimistic resolutions. It's okay, if you're writing for this age group, to leave certain aspects of a story open ended. Look at the Animorphs series, for example, very popular with a young adult audience. While the series ends with the heroes continuing to fight, the exact outcome of the final battle remains a mystery., The best way to brainstorm ideas for your own story is to read many examples. Browse through scary stories written for a younger audience to give you a sense of language, content, and length.


The Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a series of three books written for children ages 10 to 14. These stories adapt folklore and legends for preteen audiences and would be good reading material if you're looking to write scary stories for kids.Many fairy tales contain very scary aspects. In ""Hansel and Gretel"", for example, the witch nearly cooks and eats the protagonists. Reading a volume of fairy tales aimed at a young audience can give you a sense of how to balance horror with age appropriate content.Ask librarians and book store workers for recommendations on scary stories for children. They will have a good sense of what the bestselling horror authors for young children are in the current market.
You can also turn to television for examples. The 90s Nickelodeon show Are You Afraid of the Dark? was frequently praised by television critics for providing genuinely scary stories that remained age appropriate for a younger audience. While the series is off the air, you can watch episodes through many online outlets like Amazon instant video and also purchase DVDs.

, The key to a good horror story is a strong beginning. Your beginning should hint at the story's central problem and introduce one or two characters that will deal with that problem.


There are many ways to start a scary story. Some writers might start in the middle of the story and move back, opening with a scene involving the scary element. Others might start off using descriptive language
For example, say you're writing a story about two young girls navigating a haunted house. You could begin with a scene with the girls in the thick of their troubles, something like ""Sophie watched as the white, pearly hand swiped against Violet's cheek and then suddenly disappeared. She had known, a week earlier, there was something about Grandma Ida's house she simply did not trust."" You could also write using language and dialogue that foreshadows the house is haunted. For example, ""As the car pulled into their grandmother's mansion, the yard surrounded by black, lacy fencing, Sophie turned to Violet and said, 'Is it just me, or is there something about this place that just doesn't feel right?'""There are, of course, many ways to begin a story, but you should always aim to get the reader's attention. This is especially true if you're writing horror stories for young children, as they will likely be shorter and you have limited space to work with.

, As the story progresses, suspense and action should gradually build. Characters should be introduced and the central mystery or scary aspect should be brought out scene by scene.


When it comes to writing, ""Show don't tell"" is a good adage. Introduce the characters through dialogue and action. Let's return, for a moment, to the above example. Say Sophie tends to be more cautious while Violet is the more adventurous of the pair. You could illustrate this through a scene where the girls argue over whether or not to explore a mysterious moaning coming from the basement. Violet is eager to check it out, while Sophie would rather stay upstairs where it's safe.Gradually introduce mystery and suspense. If you're writing a story about a monster, build the monster scene by scene, allowing small glimpses into its powers and appearance with time. If you're writing about a haunted house, slowly introduce supernatural elements and exposition on why the house might be haunted.

, A story's climax is the height of suspense in that given story. This is the moment where the monster is fully revealed, the ghosts makes its presence known, or the murderer attacks. Choose a good climax that will scare and entice your audience.


There are no hard and fast rules for what makes a good climax, but make sure the path you choose is organic to the story. If you've spent the entire plot hinting that a ghost is in the attic, for example, don't have the big reveal involve a vampire hiding out upstairs. Readers will feel like their investment in the story has not paid off if elements change suddenly.The climax should ideally be the scariest part of the story and should fall around the middle of your narrative. Try to think of something truly horrifying. Going back to our example, a good climax would be Violet and Sophie finally seeing the ghost in its full bodied form after having only seen hints of the ghosts previously., A good horror story should have some kind of resolution. If you're writing for older children, it's okay to leave parts of the story open ended but make sure you do not leave readers hanging.


A resolution should involve some falling action in which loose ends are tied up and mysteries are revealed. Why is the monster running amuck in the nearby woods? What does the witch want from the townspeople? Why is the castle haunted? Questions like should be addressed shortly before the resolution.
Remember, children's stories should take place in a moral universe. Make sure there is some lesson to be learned through the story's resolution. Take our example. Sophie and Violet could learn the ghost remains in their grandmother's home because the house was built over a cemetery from the American Revolution. This teaches children it's important to be knowledgeable and respectful of history. A resolution that offers a positive solution could be the girls having the house turned into a museum honoring the dead."

Write your article before you begin the abstract.,
Re-read the introductory paragraph of your article.,
Put yourself in the place of your readers.,
Structure your abstract efficiently and logically.,
Write a rough draft of your scholarly abstract.,
Write your abstract concisely.,
Eliminate academic jargon and excess verbiage.,
Use the same language and vocabulary as in your full-length paper.,
Include keywords in your abstract.,
Review the rough draft of your abstract.,
Compare the focus and context of your scholarly abstract with others.,
Ask a colleague to read over your abstract.",How to Write a Scholarly Abstract," This may sound intuitive, but since an abstract is meant to describe the thesis, results, and methods of an article, you should complete the article first.This is especially important since the scope of your research or your thesis may have changed while you were writing the article.


To determine which information is valuable enough to be included in your abstract, read through your paper and list or highlight the details crucial to your project. Then, condense those points to make your abstract.;
, Since the introductory section already provides a condensed overview and summary, you can repeat many of these points in the abstract.


Remind yourself as you scan through your introduction that the goal is to reproduce in the abstract the main points you want to convey to readers., Since you will be very familiar with the subject matter and content of your paper or journal article, it can help to approach it from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with the work. Ask yourself what’s most important for your readers to know about your work, and add that to the abstract.


Focus on the opening portions that provide background information in addition to purpose and scope. Move on to the sections of your article that discuss the research methods, recommendations and the conclusion. Target and highlight only the most relevant data and leave out superfluous information.

, In an academic abstract, you won’t have any space to waste. Most abstracts are similarly structured; they begin by (1) introducing the topic, then move on to (2) indicate a gap in the current literature, and (3) state their methods, (4) mention the study results, and (5) offer a brief conclusion. To expand on this structure:The introduction to your paper topic should establish the topic. This should be no more than two sentences.
In order to show that your paper is helpful and relevant, point out a problem that the existing body of literature in your field does not address. Think of this as stating the “problem” your paper will solve. Try to keep this to one or two sentences.
Briefly address your study methods and the results of your inquiry. Explain how and where you conducted your study. This is generally done in no more than three sentences.
The conclusion should concisely recap your results (or thesis, if you’re writing in the humanities). This should be one sentence.

, At this point, you will use the information from those sections of the article that you highlighted earlier. Maintain the focus and intent of your journal article content while you are writing your scholarly abstract rough draft. The goal is to present a brief overview of your essential points to the reader through the necessary sections: introduction, problem statement, methods, results, and conclusion.


Use strong, clear, wording in the scholarly abstract. Keep the focus short and simple while maintaining appropriate, correct tone, and avoiding ambiguity.
Use the proper style for the discipline you’re writing in: APA, MLA, and Chicago are the most common.

, An abstract should never be a long document; many conferences and journals limit abstracts to 200 or 250 words. Your abstract should be concise and to the point. You need to engage your reader by describing what your article or conference paper is about.Don’t take the time to summarize your entire article or conference paper. Rather, set out your main argument, and the one or two most important findings from your research.

, In addition to taking up valuable space in your abstract, jargon or meaningless filler will confuse or frustrate your readers. Focusing on presenting a clear summary of your article’s arguments and thesis, not filling space with long-winded phrases.Avoid long-winded sentences like, “This article sets out to prove that the previous research on the behavior of nocturnal owls is inadequate to explain their predation behavior.” Instead, try, “Previous research on nocturnal owls inadequately explains their predation behavior.”
Write in the present tense (“My research shows…”) rather than future tense (“My research is going to show…”).
Make your language as concise as possible. Write in the active voice (not the passive voice), cut out adjectives and adverbs whenever possible, and don’t include verbiage that merely takes up space.

, If your research article or conference paper uses descriptive, technical language, use the same terminology in your abstract.Although it can be tempting, do not “water down” the technicality of your academic writing for the Abstract.


Do not copy any phrases or content directly from the journal article. Concisely rephrase the information.

, Depending on the journal or conference you’re sending the abstract to, they may request that you include keywords as a separate list or written into the abstract paragraphs.“Keywords” are a set of 4–6 words that capture your paper’s specific niche in the academic literature.


For example, if you’re writing about a study tracking owls at night, keywords could include “nocturnal,” “predatory,” and “flight pattern.”
The vocabulary and terminology used in the Abstract should prepare readers for the topic and language of your full-length paper.
The keywords will allow your abstract to be easily searched, when and if it’s entered into a database (this will happen if your paper is published).

, Since your abstract is short and will be the initial encounter that journal editors or conference-panel chairs have with your work, it’s important that you proofread as you work toward an edited, finalized copy.


Scan your abstract for proper grammar and style as well as typos, correct spacing, and punctuation.
Type a finished final draft of your scholarly abstract.

, Find abstracts in earlier copies of the academic journal you’re planning to submit to, and compare them to yours. Your abstract should resemble others found in previous editions of the journal, or found in Proceedings from earlier conferences.


If you’ll be presenting your paper at an academic conference, the abstract will likely be the only part published in the official conference Proceedings.It’s important that the abstract reflect your best writing, and also serve as “marketing” to draw interested readers to your panel.

, This should be the final step before you send your abstract to a journal or conference panel. Seeking feedback from a colleague can lead to constructive criticism to strengthen your writing. A colleague can also point out grammatical errors or typos you may have overlooked.It can be especially helpful to have your abstract read by a colleague in a different field. He or she will be less familiar with your specific discipline, and can tell you if your writing or conclusions are jargon-filled or unclear.

It seems obvious, but many people still write reviews without much first-hand knowledge of the product. Try it out, take your time, and get to know the product or service adequately enough to be able to speak authoritatively about it.;
, Gather details that you’ll need to write your review. For example, if you’re reviewing a restaurant, get the names and ingredients of certain dishes you’re trying. Take note of the décor. Jot down the name of your server.

, In some cases, your review will be enhanced by photos. Document your experience by taking pictures so that your readers will know what you mean when you say, “There was a giant stain on the ceiling in my hotel room.”

, If you are planning to submit your review to a particular website, blog or magazine, make sure you find out any specifications for the review. For example, there might be a word limit or a specific format.


Check the deadline too, especially if the review is for something timely, like a movie, album or book. Your review should coincide with the release of these types of items.

, Every review has a particular perspective. You are, after all, making an argument in your review. Determine how you want to talk about the product or service. Will this be a positive or negative review? What will you focus on?


This works especially well for a book or movie review, where you might pick out a particular theme and write your review around that theme.

, Think about who will read your review. Are you writing for a heavy metal music blog and your readers will already know various bands and songs? Are you writing a more technical review and your readers will understand jargon that you include?


If you are writing for a more general audience, assume that some readers will need more explanation about certain references or terms you use., In a couple of sentences or less, describe the product that you’re reviewing. You will reveal other details throughout your review, but the initial description will give your reader a sense of what you’re talking about.


If it’s a movie or book, don’t spend your entire review summarizing the plot. There’s no need to give the entire story. Just a brief overview in 1-2 sentences will suffice.

, Give lots of detail and evidence for the argument that you’re making. If you’re reviewing a music album, talk about the instruments or vocals on a particular track. If you’re reviewing a movie, talk about why the cinematography is groundbreaking and give examples from the film.

, Your review will carry much more weight if you write in complete sentences, rather than fragments that leave the reader wanting more. Don’t write things like, “okay food, terrible service.” This doesn’t tell the reader anything specific and therefore doesn’t make for a helpful review.

, Skip words like “meh” and “okay.” These words are not very useful in terms of describing a product. If you want to write a compelling review that gives the reader an idea of what you experienced, choose more descriptive words., Relate your review directly to your personal experience. Don’t use vague statements and generalities. People reading your review will want to know about your experience, so they can determine if they’d like to use that service as well. Tell a story about why you like to go to a particular nightclub or why you find your yard service so reliable., Think about where this product fits among similar products. You should certainly judge the product on its own merits, but people reading your reviews will find it useful to have a reference to a restaurant they’re familiar with. This makes the comparison – and thus, the evaluation of whether to try a product or service – easier for readers of your review.

, If possible, give your reader a sample of what you’ve experienced. This might be a picture of a meal that you ate, or it might be a link to a trailer for the movie, or it might be a snippet of a song from an album you’re reviewing.

, Be honest in your review. Don’t stretch the truth to fit with your argument one way or another. Don’t make up stuff or exaggerate to make your point. If you don’t have enough evidence to support a point you’re making, leave it out.

, You may have had a terrible experience with a particular plumber, but balance your review with what the plumber did right. If a meal was excellent except for the crud in your water glass, mention the negative part. People find reviews more credible if they admit the good and the bad together.

, The best reviews are ones that hook the reader and draw them in. Write in a way that is imaginative and that captures the essence of the product or service that you’re reviewing.Some reviews are written in different formats, even as poems or haiku. Other reviews are tongue-in-cheek, conveying the facts in a humorous way.

, Include information that a reader wouldn't have from checking out the service’s website or seeing an ad for the service. Provide information or details that you can only get when you’re using the service.

, Don’t overdo the review with over-the-top praise or criticism. Eliminate extraneous words so that your meaning is clear in the review.

, Take some time to read through your review carefully, checking for proper grammar and spelling. People will discount your review if it’s full of grammatical errors that make it hard to read.

, Give your review to someone to read before you post it online or publish it. It’s a good rule of thumb to have someone else read your writing to ensure that your writing is clear and your main points are adequately supported.

, If you are publishing your review with a magazine, blog or other source, send in your review. Your review may need to go through an editor and may take a bit of time to be printed or posted online.


If you’re submitting your review to a website like Yelp or Amazon, follow their review guidelines to ensure that your review will be accepted and posted."

Use company letterhead.,
Plan to keep your letter short.,
Address the candidate by name in the salutation.,
Thank the candidate.,
State your decision right away.,
Include something supportive.,
Finish with a salutation and a signature.,
Compliment the candidate.,
Talk about the decision-making process.,
Encourage the candidate to apply for other positions.,
Suggest areas for improvement.",How to Write a Rejection Letter," If you work for a large company, use your company’s letterhead. If you do not have a company letterhead, create your own letterhead by placing the company logo at the top of a Word document or including a header with the company's name on it., Rejection letters should be short and polite. The entire letter should be no longer than one to two paragraphs. Remember that the candidate has probably been anxious to hear something, so the letter should be as short and straightforward as possible., The job candidate’s name should appear in the salutation. Double check to make sure that you have spelled the candidate's name correctly.For example: “Dear Ms. Atkins”, or “Dear Mr. DeVos”.

, Be gracious and make sure to thank the candidate for applying for the position. Also, thank the candidate for taking the time to interview for the position and for wanting to join your company.


For example, your opening lines could look like: “Thank you for your interest in the writing position at ABC, Inc. and for all the time you have put into the application and interview process.

, Right after you thank the candidate, you will need to state your decision in a direct, simple way. Do not draw this out, just state your decision immediately after the first line.


For example, you might simply say something like, “Unfortunately, we will not be moving forward with your application at this time.”

, Make sure that you include something about the candidate's good qualities and/or qualifications. Let the candidate know that he or she was well-qualified, and that it was difficult to make a decision because of all of the high-quality applicants.


For example, you might say, “Your experience and educational background are impressive, and it was difficult to decide due to the many impressive applications that we received.”

, Wrap up the letter with a brief note of thanks, a courteous salutation, and a signature. Try to send the letter as soon as you have chosen another candidate, as many applicants will be waiting to hear back about the position and may be holding off on other applications while they wait.For example: “On behalf of ABC, Inc., I thank you for your time and interest in the position and I wish you the best in your future endeavors. Sincerely, Your Name.”
You may also want to include a contact number or email if the applicant has any questions about your decision.

, If you have a genuine compliment for the applicant, then you may want to include it in the rejection letter. This can help to encourage the applicant in his or her job search even more. Just make sure that the compliment is sincere.For example, you might add something like, ""You gave an amazing presentation!"" Or you might say something like, ""I was really impressed by your knowledge of the industry.""

, The candidate might be interested to know a bit more about the decision-making process. For example, if you received lots of applications, then you might mention that in the letter to help the person see how many people were competing for the job. If the candidate was one of your top choices, then you might mention that.


For example, you might say something, “We received 56 applications for this position and everyone who applied for the position was well-qualified.” Or, “You were one of our top choices for the position.”

, If the candidate is someone who you may want to hire for a different position or in the future, then you may want to encourage the candidate to apply to another position with the company.


Including this suggestion will also send a positive message to the applicant. This is important because you never know if the applicant may apply again in the future or end up working at the company in a different position.You may also want to let the candidate know if your company policy is to keep the resume on file for a certain amount of time.This can make it easier for the applicant to apply to other jobs with the company.

, Sometimes it may be appropriate to suggest that the candidate seek additional training or certifications before reapplying. If the candidate did not get the position because he or she lacked a certification or needed more experience, then it may be helpful to mention this in your letter. This may help the candidate move forward with his or her job search.


If appropriate, you can frame your suggestion as something like, “After you have gained some hands on experience in the field, we hope you will re-apply at ABC, Inc.”

Write all handwritten receipts with dark pen ink.,
Use a printed company stamp or preprinted blank receipts with your company name.,
Include all necessary information for the sales receipt.,
Make sure you have all the necessary information for a rent receipt.,
Consider printing out a free receipt template.,
Recognize the purpose of a receipt.,
Be aware of the four most common types of receipts.,
Understand the key elements of a buyer and seller receipt.",How to Write a Receipt," If you are handwriting your receipts, invest in a pad of carbon copy receipts so you can write one receipt and have two copies ready, one for you and one for the buyer.


Carbon copy receipts are often also labeled with the necessary information for a sales receipt, or they will have a lined template so you can write out the receipt properly and clearly.

, To ensure the receipt is legible, use a pen with dark ink. You want the receipt to be a permanent record, so don’t use pencil or light colored ink that could fade over time.


When handwriting the receipts, write in large, clear writing that is easy to read. If you are using carbon copy receipts, press down as you write so the ink bleeds through to the second or third copy of the receipt.

, To make the receipts more official, use a company stamp on the top of all receipts. You can also get preprinted receipts made with your company name and logo. This will make it clear to the buyer that the product(s) are coming from your business or company and will be a useful reference in the event the receipt needs to be referred to in the future.

, Whether you are handwriting the receipt, or creating a receipt template in a text document on a computer, your receipt should include several basic sections:


Vendor details.
Vendee details.
Date of the transaction.
The product details.
The amount of the transaction.
The method of payment.
Signature from the vendor and buyer.

, A rent receipt is useful for a tenant if the tenant is paying cash or cashier's check and wants to keep track of the payments. A rent receipt is also useful for a landlord as proof of rent paid, and some jurisdictions require landlords to provide rent receipts to tenants. If you are creating a rent receipt for your landlord, or for your tenant, your receipt of rent payment should include the following basic information:The total amount of rent paid.
Date the payment was made.
Tenant's full name.
Landlord's full name.
Address of the rental unit.
The pay period of the rent.
The payment method for the rent (cash, check, etc.)
The landlord's signature and the tenant's signature.

, If you would like to create printed receipts for your business or company, there are several free receipt templates you can access online.Simply print them out and stamp them with your company name to personalize them for your daily transactions.

, Receipts are important because they will help you keep track of your income for tax purposes. Save all your receipts, especially if you are running a business, as you may need to show proof of your expenses in your taxes. You should always provide a receipt for your customers if you are running a business, and most businesses will offer you a receipt for your purchases.When you purchase expensive items or services, it is considered mandatory for you to receive a receipt from the buyer or seller. This is a precaution in case there are legal issues around the transaction, as both parties can use the receipt as proof in court.

, In theory, you could write a receipt for almost any transaction, from rent payments to haircuts to landscaping services. There are four common types of receipts that you will likely come across at least once while making purchases and processing sales:A receipt of payment: In order to process a transaction, the seller of an item will draw up a receipt of payment. The receipt should include a receipt number, the date and the amount received. If the payment was cash, there should be a note that says “cash”. If the payment was check or money order, there should be a record of the check no. or money order no. If the payment was credit card, the type of credit card used should be noted (Mastercard, Visa, American Express) and the last four digits of the credit card.
A medical receipt: This is a bill of acknowledgement for a medical purchase, such as medicine, a prescription or a surgical instrument. This receipt should include the diagnosis code, the date of the visit, the consultation time, and the total payment amount.
A sales receipt: You likely receive this type of receipt all the time when you go shopping, and if you run a business, you will give a sales receipt to a customer after you ring in the sale items. The receipt will act as proof of purchase and should include the payment amount, the date of the sale, the name and price of the item(s), and the name of the person who processed the transaction.
A rent receipt: This type of receipt will be issued by a landlord to a tenant. It will act as proof of rent payment and should include the landlord’s name, the renter’s name, the address of the rental property, the billing period, the rent amount, and the start date and end date of the rental agreement.
If you purchase items online or sell items online, you will receive or create an e-receipt. E-receipts are digital receipts that contain the same information as a receipt of payment and act as proof of purchase for items bought online.

, For the purposes of this article, we are going to focus on receipts of payment made between a buyer and a seller. As the seller of an item or service, you will need to draw up a receipt that contains the following key information:Vendor details: This includes the name of the seller (or company name of the seller), the seller’s address and phone number or email address on the top of the receipt. You should also include the name of the store manager or owner of the business or company.
Vendee details: Include the first and last name of the vendee, or the buyer.
Date of the transaction: Include the day, month, and year, as this information will be useful for tax purposes.
The product details: Write a brief description of the items or services sold, such as the name of the product, the quantity, the product number, and any other identifying information. This element will be useful if you need to remember the sale in the future.
The amount of the transaction: Break down the total amount into the original price, the tax, any labor charges, and any discounts or promotions. The price breakdown will make the sale more valid and specific.
The method of payment: Note how the buyer is paying, whether it is via cash, check, credit card, or debit card.
Signature from the vendor and buyer: Once the receipt has been drawn up or printed out and the buyer has paid you, mark the bottom of the receipt as “Paid” and get the signature of the seller. You can also sign your copy of the receipt for your records.

Include any copyright or licensing information.",How to Write a Read Me," This is perhaps the most important part of the read me. Contact information allows users to contact you in order to suggest features, ask questions, report bugs, or make payments for the software. Include the company's name, website, email address, and phone number using just a few lines.


An example contact section might look like this:;
, This is a small but important step. Include a single line that has the year in which the software was distributed. This will alert users to check for a newer version or make sure the application is still supported if the date is not recent.

, Near the top of the read me file, include a line with the application's name and version number. Below that, include a line with the price for the full version. If you distribute the software using a physical medium, such as a CD, you can omit the pricing information because your user has likely already paid for the software.

, Using only a sentence or 2, include a brief description of the program. An example might be: ""This application determines the user's mood by logging their actions online, then alters the desktop environment to suit this mood.""


If your software application has a broader list of features, you can expand the description into a paragraph or more. Consider using bulleted lists to enumerate the program's features or capabilities.

, A good read me file should also include information about system requirements and installation instructions. If another piece of software is needed to run the program, mention that here. You can also include information about expected resource usage (for example, CPU usage).

, Finally, make sure to provide the copyright date and which software licensing agreement governs the use of the program.

Once you're done, edit your work.",How to Write a Realistic Story," The genre is an important part of your writing process. Here are some genres that you could write:


Action
Fantasy
Science- fiction
Romance
Adventure
Erotica
Comedy
Drama
Prequel
Sequel.;
, Even within fantasy, you can make the actions and world seem as real as the things that happen in the reader's own world every day. For fantasy and science-fiction, you will need excellent descriptive skills to bring the world and beings alive in realistic ways. If you are weak in this area, do some studying to strengthen your descriptive writing skills first.

, All famous books start off with a key idea. You can find ideas anywhere. Try listening to the radio for news stories that could give you ideas. Look up pictures on the internet that could give you inspiration. Maybe another book could inspire your idea. Even if you want to write a prequel or a sequel, you should still get your main plot. Try to notice all of the small yet important details in your daily life.

, Maybe you can keep a story writing journal or notebook go ensure that the ideas you come up with are not lost to poor memory. Or even keep a list of ideas on your computer. Although your story will be based on one main idea, to keep it realistic, you'll need to follow through with various smaller ideas, just as people experience in real life. For example, in real life a person's job may be a focal point, but so is their family life, their hobbies, their spat with the neighbor and their triumph in a local sporting group. Each of these threads forms the whole and even if the story is about Fred undermining Lotti to get a promotion at work, Fred will still have his daily life at home, his parental responsibilities, his weekly sports practices and his interfering in-laws to contend with all while trying to oust Lotti from the job he wants. No story is straight down the line, so keep all of your strands going in order to make a realistic tale.

, To develop your idea, start thinking like a writer. The development of the idea makes your story much more realistic. Ask yourself these questions:


How does it start?
Where and when does it take place?
Who are the characters?
What is the problem?
What caused the problem?
What happens in the middle?
How did or did not it get fixed?
How do the characters have connection to each other and the problem?
How does it end?

, Use all of your ideas as the story unfolds, as they offer you guidance in keeping the details realistic.


Use a pencil, pen, computer anything as long as your writing is neat.

, This is up to you but some authors find that they write with greater ease in one form of narration over another, so it might take you a little while to work this out. Which narrative you choose is an important part of adding realism to your work, as the extent to which you can explore the emotions, feelings, perspectives, etc. of the character in detail depends upon the form you've chosen. For some authors, first person narrative provides a better opportunity to sound realistic while for other authors, the third person narrative works better. It really comes down to what your own writing style is.


First person narrative: A character (or characters) narrates the story. He/she is involved in the story but reveals his/her own feelings and experiences much of the time through the use of ""I"" or ""we"" viewpoints.
Second person narrative: This is an attempt to make the reader become a character in the story, and the reader will be referred to as ""you"". It's not used a lot, as it is not an easy form in which to write.
Third person narrative: This is from the perspective of he/she or they and the author is simply narrating things in a usually uninvolved way. The narrator may be aware of the main character's feelings and thoughts only or the narrator may be aware of the feelings and thoughts of a wider array of characters. Or, the narrator may choose to simply observe things as they unfold without describing the feelings and thoughts of the characters. The third person form is the most commonly used and it can be subject to different approaches, depending on your writing style.
Mixing it up: It is possible to mix narrative forms if you're a good writer. However, you will need to plan this with care and introduce narrative changes at key points, and not jump around between them all over the place. For example, you might use third person throughout most of the story but for an intervening part or chapter, use the first person to give an overview or summary, then return to the third person.

, Apart from the advice already given, some of the things you can do to amp up the realism include:


Avoid cliché plot lines as much as possible. They are crutches and they're weak. Interestingly, real life rarely pans out in the way the writing clichés suggest, such as love at first sight, full knowledge at a glance, hiding an aspect of oneself only to have the one true love find it out before anyone else, and so forth. Life is more complicated than such clichés would admit to and while there is some neat niceness that these constructions permit of, they don't a whole story make. Move beyond these as much as you can.
Allow your characters to make mistakes and to be absolutely confused about how to fix them or make changes. Life isn't straightforward and the answers are often not there. Sometimes it takes a lot of hard work and experience to work out what to do next. Avoid turning your ordinary characters into super-beings that have one simple solution; instead, let them work things out for themselves in the way you or your reader would likely do––messily and often requiring compromises.
Include references to the more banal things the characters must contend with. This increases the sense that, in spite of being a spy/heroine/outlaw/villain, etc., this person still has to eat, go to the bathroom and contend with long queues. It provides a sense of what every reader knows to be true.

, The story could start with a problem, a special event or a lazy Saturday afternoon. The starting is the most important part, as it lets the reader figure out if they like the story.


Don't make the beginning too boring or else the reader wouldn't want to read the rest of the interesting parts.
If you're struggling with the start, don't dwell on it for now. Come back to it after writing the story more, as it will likely come to you eventually.

, Once you get to the middle of your story, keep making the story as interesting as you can. The middle of the story is the part when the reader knows the problem and knows the characters better. This is where you should be asking yourself ""When should I make it so that the problem is fixed?"" Near the ending the problem should be fixed.

, As with the beginning of the book, seek to end your story well. Provide it with a good wrapping-up sentence or paragraph that leaves the reader reacting and thinking.

, A good idea would be to have spellcheck on your computer. However, editing isn't just spelling and all aspects of grammar are important to a smooth and good reading experience. If all the answers to the following questions are in the affirmative, then you can show your story to the world:


Do all the sentences make sense?
Did I spell the words correctly?
Is the grammar okay?
Do I have the right punctuation?
Can I combine some sentences?
Are there some unnecessary parts that I could delete?

Don't rant just to rant.,
Keep it as clean as possible.",How to Write a Rant," Ranting about an unfamiliar subject is a great way to embarrass yourself and may even inadvertently win points for the issue or topic you're trying to rail against. Only rant about things that you're already familiar with.


It's usually a good idea to do a little research to back up and bolster your already-familiar experience with the topic or issue. Even if you think you're sure, make your rant air-tight with specific facts.
Even if you think your opinion about an issue is iron-clad, try to make sure to bolster your strong opinion with facts, so your rant doesn't end up looking foolish. You may even end up becoming a passionate advocate for the other side, if you dig around in the issue.;
, The difference between a good rant and a whiney blog post has to do with stakes. If you're going to rant effectively, there needs to be some deeper issue or cause behind the thing that you're ranting against. There needs to be a reason to complain. Find it before you start complaining.


The stakes of something like hydraulic fracking and mountain top removal mining may be obvious, but may be less obvious about what so-and-so wore to the red carpet. That doesn't mean you can't rant about both effectively, you've just got to dig a little deeper.
Rants can be cultural, political, social, and address issues of class, race, sexuality, and any number of different topics. Find the serious issue behind the surface if you want your rant to go deeper.

, What really gets under your skin about that particular topic? Before you launch directly into your rant, it's a good idea to brainstorm a list of irritations from which you can build an effective rant. The more specific, the better.


A personal story can lend a great amount of pathos to a rant. Do you have any personal experiences that could be used to your advantage? If you were recently stopped and frisked by a police officer for no reason, it might make your rant much more passionate to include the story.
Stick with your subject until you find something serious at the center of it. So reality TV annoys you. So what? Stick with it until you find something more interesting.

, When you rant, you want to direct your rant exactly where it will hurt the opposition. Don't shy away from contradictions, fallacies, and other failures of logic that you find in the subject you want to rant against.


What is it that just doesn't make sense to you about your little irritation? If you can't stand the sitcom ""Two and Half Men,"" you may instinctively want to say, ""It's just stupid,"" but keep going to find the weak spot. Why is it stupid? What's stupid about it? How can you articulate the stupidity?
You might decide that the show you hate presents stereotypical versions of men and women. Start looking for examples of this to back up your rant. Pick on them specifically and your rant will be super-strong.

, Bad rants will list the same idea fifty times and won't prove a thing. You can tell us in a strongly worded way that ""Two and a Half Men"" is the worst show of all time because ""it's stupid,"" or you can start showing us how and why it's so terrible.


Every time you make a claim in your rant, get in the habit of asking yourself, ""So what?"" Then answer that question.
Highlight contradictions or logical fallacies. The best way to rant is to skewer the topic at hand by pointing out all the ways in which it's completely wrong, ridiculous, or terrible. Connect the dots for us.

, Bad rants will tell us that something is ""really really really stupid"" and good rants will tell us something more specific and accurate: ""The so-called humor on 'Two and a Half Men' is so insipid and juvenile, it makes 'Beavis and Butthead' seem like beloved characters from Shakespeare. The show is colossally stupid.""


It's important to bolster your railing with specific examples. You can only tell us something is bad so much without bothering to prove it to us. Give us quotes, specific examples, and discuss the thing in as much detail as possible.

, Sarcasm is the ranter's playground. Make good use of verbal eye-rolls by ramping up the sarcasm and embarrassing the opposition. Your target will be sorry it ever raised your ire if you launch sarcasm bombs like this:


""The creator of 'Two and a Half' men says that the show is 'populist.' This is true. The show should get full credit for being so populist as to be the best show on television that appeals to the sexist, racist, dunderheaded caveman instincts in its knuckle-dragging audience.""

, One great way of ranting against something and thoroughly skewering it in words is to mock it more subtly. If you can do an impression of your target and mock the style, you'll be a ranting pro.


If you want to rant against the twee stylings of Wes Anderson movies, say, you might try writing in an overly cutesy way about the panda bear you had to care for at short film camp, and how you locked eyes with a Brazilian folk singer doing covers of Kinks songs on a thumb piano.

, Good rants make mountains out of molehills. Connect the small thing you're noticing and feel the need to rail against to a larger social, cultural, or political issue. If it bugs you when your friend checks Facebook every five seconds while you're trying to have lunch, what could this tell us about interpersonal relationships in the digital age? What's the end result of all this Facebooking? Where are we headed as a culture of heads-down phone-watchers?


There's a fine line between an effective rant and a big exaggeration. You want to get as close as possible to it without going over. Saying that Facebook ruins dates and makes it more difficult to relate to one another, not easier, is right within the constraints of a good rant. Saying that Facebook is probably responsible for Ebola? That's a stretch.

, Twitter and Tumblr make it easy to be completely unfiltered in a very public way. If you're going to rant hard on a subject that you feel passionately about, feel free to do it, but don't post it online until you've had a chance to think about it for a while.


Good rule of thumb: give it 24 hours. If you still feel the same way about the issue, and just as passionately, and are willing to stand behind it if you're called into question, post it.
If you were called onto national television and asked to defend your opinion, would you want to do it? If the answer is no, you might think twice about posting it for all the world to see online., Ever see the video of protesters holding anti-Socialism signs who are asked to define Socialism, and can't? You don't want to be them. You'll be on a fast-track to embarrassing yourself if you go out and start ranting about an issue you know nothing about. Get smart before you start making noise.


Again, it can't be stressed enough, if you're not informed about a particular issue, we don't need your opinion about it. Keep it to yourself.

, Ad-hominem attacks are directed at the character of a particular person, not the work or the words that came from that person. It's a good idea to mock the creator of ""Two and a Half Men"" for the terrible show he's responsible for, but not because ""he has a dumb face and bad clothes."" That doesn't have anything to do with the subject at hand. Avoid the temptation to attack the character.

, Your rant has to make sense, even if it's running on its passion. Be familiar with the basics of creating an argument and sustain it with good points and logic, or your rant will fall apart. Every argument should include:


A clear thesis
Supporting evidence
Good examples
Warrants and backing logic
A summary or conclusion

, It's important that you save a good rant for something that you're going to be able to dismantle with surgical precision, not something that just rubs you the wrong way and which you feel like making noise about.


The bus was late again? Ok, so what? If you can answer that question with a good example, that it made everyone on your bus late for work, say, then you've got a good rant on your hands. If the only consequence is that it took you five minutes more to get to the coffee shop, save it.

, Four-letter words are like cayenne pepper: they can add a little spice to a dish, but nobody wants to eat fistfuls of the stuff. If you do decide to throw in a couple of curse-bombs into your rant, make them count, don't make them the center of attention.

Determine your idea or problem.,
Do your research.,
Write a problem description.,
Explain your solution.,
Outline a plan.,
State possible objections.,
Mention needed materials and/or personnel.,
Conclude with the primary benefits.,
Have a co-worker read it.,
Revise.,
Submit it to management.",How to Write a Proposal to Management," Whether you want to write about streamlining operations or reducing costs, figure out what the key issue is. Often, the idea might be clear to you. If, however, you are trying to make a mark or troubleshoot, be observant.

, Before writing a proposal, be sure to check all the facts. Talk to relevant people whether co-workers, managers, or customers. Read about similar companies and see what they do differently.


For example, if you think the management should change its caterer, talk first to the kitchen staff. What do they think? Have they worked in other places with different caterers? What do your co-workers think? Maybe your disgruntlement is a matter of personal taste rather than quality.

, To start your proposal, describe what is happening at present. Include all relevant facts (who is involved, dates, locations). In this part, do not issue judgement; rather, just explain things as they are.


For example, you might write “Company X has been using Caterer Y for the past seven years. During this time, the number of available entrees has decreased from five to two. The amount of vegetarian-friendly items also has decreased with some days there being none.”

, After identifying the problem, write specifically what you propose to do. Lead with your key point. Show what your findings are based on your research.


For example, you might write, “I recommend that Company X switch to another caterer. Company X has several other caterer options. Caterer W and Caterer Z both offer larger menus and have comparable costs to our existing provider. Furthermore, because Caterer Z offers daily vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free entrees, they could better meet the needs of our workforce. Caterer W offers fewer vegan-specific items but also could be a good choice. A survey completed in 2011 showed that 40% of our employees are vegetarian, 10% are vegan, and 2% are gluten-free.”

, Describe each step and its related implementation times or costs. Be clear with what you know and what remains to be seen. Consider writing numbered steps. Then offer more details. Do not overestimate the value of your change but do suggest what you think the results could be.


To switch caterers, we will need: 1. To end our contract with Caterer Y 2. Ask Caterers W and Z for trial tastings 3. Choose one of the firms 4. Sign a contract with the chosen firm. The costs should be comparable to our current costs with Caterer Y. As long as we finish our contract term with Caterer Y, there should be no financial penalties. Furthermore, if our employees like the new food more, their workplace satisfaction is likely to improve.

, Show your awareness of any possible hitches to your plan. Will there be resistance among employees? For instance, some people might love your current caterer. Could you have to convince a government agency that your new product idea is safe? Talk about steps you would take to convince others of your project.

, If your change requires the purchase of materials or the hiring of new employees, include this after the steps. Also, mention needed time, as that too is a resource. Create a checklist of sorts. For example you might write:


Needed: sub-committee for caterer evaluation (4 people from different parts of the company), 2 hours for tasting, 3 hours to write the report.

, Whatever change you plan to implement, repeat it once at the end. Rehash your three main points and then offer a concluding sentence. Think of this as your executive summary. For example:


”As this proposal demonstrates, Caterer Y has decreased its entree offerings over the past seven years. Caterers W and Z offer comparatively priced, more diverse options. I recommend that we do trial tastings with these caterers in order to choose a new food supplier for this office. This in turn likely will boost employee satisfaction and retention”
Mention specific monetary or quantitative benefits. For example, will your innovation cut costs? Say so.
Outline qualitative benefits. Sometimes a company benefits in ways we cannot quantify with hard facts or numbers. If you will increase employee happiness, mention this. These improvements can be just as valuable as quantitative ones.

, Preferably, ask a peer to read and give you feedback on your proposal. Perhaps they agree. If they do not, think about their objections. If you think they are valid and perhaps override your proposal, consider revision. Instead, if you see the validity of their points but disagree, add their sentiments to your objection section.

, Once you have crafted your proposal and have had a friend read it, revise it for flow, grammar, accuracy, and word count. You do not want too long of a proposal or your managers might not read it! Aim for one to two pages if possible.

, After you feel your proposal is ready, determine to which person you should submit it. In some organizations, it is clear who is in charge and makes decisions. In other companies with more lateral structures, it can be trickier to know who the real decision-makers are. Do a bit of background research into your firm to determine the right person.


Once you know who that person is, see whether an in-person meeting is possible. Oftentimes, people respond to requests for change better when speaking face-to-face. Otherwise, send a paper copy or if not possible, an email.

Know what you want.,
Assess your goals and mission.,
Determine your budget.,
Put together a timeline.,
Read other RFPs.,
Establish the projected scope and boundaries of your project.,
List your “must haves” and your “like to haves.” One way to know what you really want in response to your RFP is to make a list of your needs and your wants.Each of your needs or “must haves” should be included in your RFP.,
Decide who will read the proposals and award the project.,
Specify a candidate’s minimum qualifications.,
Draft a scorecard that you will use to evaluate proposals.,
Include all relevant details.,
Be specific, but not too specific.,
Organize the RFP effectively.,
Request references.,
Proofread your RFP before sending it out.,
Send RFPs to reputable consulting firms.,
Limit the number of firms or individuals you send your RFP to.If your RFP goes out to anyone and everyone, you will either receive too many proposals to realistically consider or your RFP will not be taken seriously.,
Give an adequate amount of time for individuals to put together a quality proposal.,
Stick to your deadline.",How to Write a Request for Proposal," The first step is knowing the type of outcome you would like from a project. Having a vision will help you ask the right questions about a consultant’s services.


Identify the type of project you are doing and list the steps that you will need to accomplish the project.
Determine the type of help you think you need. Are your needs technical, design-related, or both? Will you need one person or a team to work on your project? Can the work be done remotely or do you need to find someone locally with whom you can meet in person?
Ask yourself what kind of developers or specialists you need to hire to accomplish your project.
Having an initial vision does not mean that the project has to (or will) turn out exactly like you have envisioned it.;
, Your company’s big-picture goals and mission may be as important as the details of the project itself.Re-read your company’s mission statement, even if you wrote it yourself.
Be explicit about how the project will serve the company’s mission.
Change your vision for the project if it does not keep with the company’s overall goals.
Identify how the project will improve your company, meet the needs of stockholders or shareholders, or serve your clients.
Write a statement about how this project will meet the company’s goals. You may need to include the statement in your RFP, but it will also help you focus your own goals for the project.

, You need to have a concrete number for the amount of money you will be able to spend on the project. Being upfront with your allowed budget will help your relationship with the consultant you hire in the long run.


Talk to your accounting or finance department ahead of time. Don’t just assume you know how much money you will be able to spend on a project.
Be sure you are including all parts of the project and all individuals you will need to hire to help you meet the needs of your project.
Plan for extra expenses. Projects—particularly big projects—rarely come in under budget. Leaving yourself some extra room for unexpected expenses from the beginning will help keep you in the black.
Offer a competitive rate. Remember that paying less often leads to poorer quality. At the same time, overpaying may not get you a significantly better project than simply paying the “going rate.”

, You will need to put together a detailed timeline with deadlines for both the proposal and the project itself. You may want to break the project into steps or stages and assign a different deadline for each step.


Make a reverse calendar. Start with the final deadline for the finished project and work backwards, determining individual deadlines as you go.
Assign a deadline for the proposal that is 2-6 weeks after you send out your RFP, depending on the level of detail and customization you need.Assign yourself a deadline for writing the RFP as well.

, One of the best ways to write an effective RFP is to read other people’s requests. This will give you a sense of what information should be included, what kind of layout is easiest to read and follow, and what kind of supplemental visuals should be included.


Search online for sample RFPs. There are many samples available that detail the structure and important information.
Read actual RFPs from other companies. Pretend that you are a consultant who is trying to put together a proposal. Read other people’s RFPs and notice if there is any information missing that would help you write a better proposal. Be sure to include that information in your RFP.
Try to find RFPs from companies that match your business profile. If you have an acquaintance at another company, ask if they have any old RFPs that you could look at as a model.
Look at RFP templates online.They may be a good starting place, but you can use them to learn how to write your RFP and then do it on your own to have greater flexibility for formatting and detail.

, Before writing the RFP, you should know the scope and boundaries of your project.You may need to re-scale the project if you realize that you are asking for too much in too little time.


It may help to keep a list of things that this specific project will not address, even if you plan to return to the ideas in the future. (You probably will not include this information in the RFP.)
Being clear about the scope of the project in your RFP will enable consultants to put together better proposals for your project.
Be realistic about what outcomes you can expect given the budget and time constraints you will put on the consultant.

, You may want to include some or most of your “wants,” but be sure your RFP does not become unrealistic or too cumbersome.


You may want to clarify in your RFP which items are necessary and which are preferred.
Too many preferred (want) items may scare off potential consultants who feel that they are unqualified based on the idealized description.
Keep your “like to haves” list for evaluating proposals once they come in.

, The person who will read the proposals that are sent in response to the RFP should probably at least read, if not write, the RFP before it goes out.


Be sure the person’s expectations are stated clearly in the RFP.

, In addition to project-specific needs and wants, you may want to delineate your expectations about the background, education, and experience, of consultants who will be working on your project.

, Doing this before you send the RFP out can help you fine-tune your needs and expectations before you write it.This way, you will be sure to include and emphasize the most important factors in your RFP.


Determine a rating system for proposals. Consider multiple categories with a 1-10 scale and a total score.
The proposal(s) with the highest score(s) will meet your needs most clearly and will likely be chosen.
Some categories to consider including on your scorecard are aesthetics/design, vision, implementation, budget plan, experience and references, ability to meet deadlines, integration of your business model into their design, innovation, use of technology, professionalism, response to constructive feedback, and communication ability.

, While you may not want to overwhelm the readers of your RFP with unnecessary information, you should include all relevant details.These may include:


Who you are and what your company’s goals are
Why you need a consultant for your project
What outcomes you expect at the end of the project
How you will work with the company
How much you are able to pay
How and when to submit the proposal
How you want the proposal to be formatted
When you will need each stage of the project completed
How you will evaluate and select proposals
When you plan to notify the selected consultant or firm
Who to contact in case of questions

, While you want your RFP to be clear and specific about the type of project and consultant you expect, you do not want to make it so specific that you exclude good candidates. Finding a balance can be tricky.


If you are not specific enough, you will likely receive a flood of proposals that may be vague or not in line with your vision.
If you are too specific, you will not receive enough proposals and you may not feel like you have enough choices.
You may need to rewrite your RFP if the proposals are too vague or you do not receive enough of them.

, Because you are providing a lot of information in a short amount of space, organization is the key to an effective RFP.


Provide clear sections. Having sections can help organize the different parts of your proposal into easily-digestible “bites” of information.
Use bolding and underlining to emphasize the most important points, but do so sparingly. Less than 10% of the text should be bolded or underlined.
Break up long sections of text with bullet points, or divide into several shorter sections.
Add a few well-designed graphics to add visual interest and break up text.

, Be sure to request references as part of your RFP.You should be able to find out whether past clients have been happy with both the process of working with a consultant or firm and with the final project that they received.


Be sure to actually call the references that the consultant provides. Ask whether the past client would hire the consultant again, and be sure to address process as well as product in your questioning.

, Sending out an unclear RFP or one that is riddled with grammar errors and typos is unprofessional and could cost you some good proposals. To be taken seriously as a company, you should send out a quality product.


Have someone else proofread your RFP as well. It can be difficult to spot your own errors.
You may want to try having someone outside of the project or even outside the company read your RFP for clarity of purpose.

, Though big firms often have many different consultants working for them, they will try to protect the image and reputation of their firm, so they are unlikely to have employees that perform below their levels of expectation.Search for reviews of the firm online. Online reviews aren’t perfect, but they are often a good place to start. Take negative reviews with a grain of salt, however. Be sure to read the specifics of any complaints and ignore any emotional language.
Ask a co-worker or an acquaintance from a company similar to yours who they recommend sending your RFP to. Even competitor companies are likely to give you an honest recommendation for reputable firms.
Call a firm and ask them for references. It is not uncommon to ask individual consultants for references, so a firm should be willing to provide references as well. Be sure to ask the reference specific questions about the process of working with the firm and whether they would use the firm again for future projects.

,


Developing a proposal takes a significant amount of time, and a firm or consultant is unlikely to be willing to take your request seriously and spend the time working on it if they see your RFP pop up in too many different venues.
Focus instead on targeting fewer proposals of higher quality.

, Giving firms and consultants enough time to read and absorb your RFP, create their own vision for the project, and put together a quality proposal will give you a better sense of what the final project will be like. , A firm that sends in a proposal late is likely to also be late on project deadlines. If you are serious about your deadlines, do not consider proposals that were submitted after the deadline passed. If you are less concerned about deadlines than a quality product, you may want to still consider late submissions.

Think of a story idea.,
Include solid, believable and interesting characters.,
Include strange, curious, daunting or dangerous lands.,
Note that every quest starts with someone going alone or a pair of persons going together.,
Be sure to include conflicts in the plot.,
Finish the tale with a believable resolution.",How to Write a Quest Story," Be sure to have a thick plot because the quest story is not only about the outward physical journey but also involves the protagonist's inner struggles, and often feeds into a much bigger picture, such as saving a kingdom, rescuing a leader, solving a bigger puzzle, and so forth.


Consider using flashbacks. These are formed when you take out a few events from a sequence of events and place it somewhere else to create a flashback or to account for such ""time slips"".;
, Your characters must each have definite characteristics, such as being bold, mild, curious, misbehaved, confused, and so forth. It helps to create character sheets ahead of writing, to help you to realize the whole of this person and to help imagine how he, she or it would progress throughout the tale.


What weaknesses, problem behaviors/attitudes or less-than-stellar aspects does each character have? Choose things in need of resolving, or that can be made much of, even if unresolved.
Include at least one character who is somewhat lost/confused/befuddled and is a bit of a seeker. Seekers tend to go on quests, to fix internal issues as much as solving external problems.

Avoid the Mary Sues, those ""totally perfect"" people. If you think that you know such people in real life, remind yourself to take off your rose-colored glasses.

, A quest usually involves crossing through an area of land, realms or such places. However, you don't have to make it just land; it could actually be a dreamscape, a drug-induced haze state, a parallel universe or a metaphorical ""place"". That all depends on how clever you are with consistently writing about alternate realities. If you would like to keep it slightly less complicated (although still complex), lands or realms work well for the quest meme.

, Along the way, the person or pair encounters various people and creatures who help and later join the character on the quest. Eventually, a small contingency is formed and is dedicated to the quest. Of course, each character comes with his, her or its own reasons and baggage for being part of the quest, just to add to the tensions, the excitement and the disappointments that form part of quest lore.


If you send out someone on his, her or its own, don't make this person or creature perfect from the get-go. Your story will fizzle quickly. It may well be that this person is viewed as courageous, amazing or incredible by the local townsfolk or whomever, but that's all the more reason to show this person or creature has many weaknesses and bring them to the light throughout the journey.
If a pair goes, be creative about their reasons for being together. Love is not enough; if that is used as the initial motivator, you will need to find the flaws in that love and test it to its absolute extreme to keep things interesting. Possible pairings could include: siblings, parent and child, neighbors, two diametrically opposed individuals, master and apprentice, leader and foot soldier, rich and poor, and so forth. If you make them equals, there needs to be something uniquely fascinating about their individual characters to keep them interesting.

, Conflicts make the quest the interesting read that it is. Things are bound to go wrong, unusual things crop up and now and then, members of the party tend to lose one another. Conflicts can include disputes, dislikes among the members of the questing group, discomfort, meeting enemies and running or fighting, magical transformations that create havoc, practical jokes, rifts in the traveling party, another love interest, animal/magical beast attacks, and so forth. Mix the conflict up, to keep the pace edgy, exciting and unique.


Intersperse the conflicts with some quieter times. During these times, don't cause a lull of boredom; instead, use these to explore the feelings, thoughts and desires of the characters and to fill the reader in on much-needed news about how the bigger picture story is progressing (such as whether Kingdom X has almost expired due to the quest object not being back there yet, or the way ahead becoming more treacherous than anyone in the traveling party has yet comprehended, and so so forth).

, It's completely up to you whether or not it's a happy ending with a successful resolution to the quest. That's certainly one way of writing it. However, shades of ""happiness"" are probably more realistic, such as perhaps finding the intended reason for the quest, only to realize that it hasn't resolved internal longings or needs, or that it's not quite what everyone expected it to be, and so forth. Remember that life goes on after a quest and while wrapping it up neatly is enjoyable, some glimmer of the future eruptions can be a good way to segue into your sequel.

Introduce the work.,
Describe how the author supports the thesis.,
State the purpose of the piece.,
Describe the intended audience.,
Read the original piece.,
Summarize each section.,
Restate the thesis.,
Write the précis.,
Review and revise.,
Inquire about the length.,
Be concise regardless of length.,
Write in the present tense.,
Avoid direct quotation.,
Leave out your own opinions.",How to Write a Precis," The first sentence of the précis must include the name of the author, the genre, the title of the work, and the publication date. Follow this information with a rhetorically accurate verb and a ""that"" clause introducing the thesis.


In most cases, you only need to introduce the author by his or her full name. If you need to include certain facts about the author's life in order to accurately summarize the content of the piece, you may also follow the name with a brief clause describing that information. Doing so is rarely necessary, though.
The genre refers to the original piece's primary classification: article, essay, novel, poem, short story, play, etc.
Write the original publication date in parenthesis and include it directly after the title of the original piece.
A rhetorically accurate verb must describe the sort of action the author takes. Examples of such verbs include ""assert,"" ""argue,"" ""prove,"" ""disprove,"" and ""explain.""
Note that the author may or may not directly state the thesis within the original work, in which case, you'll need to interpret it yourself. The thesis should be a concise summary of the author's primary point or claim.

Example: John Doe's article, ""How to Write a Précis"" (2015), asserts that individuals can learn how to write a rhetorical précis.;
, The second sentence must provide readers with a brief explanation of how the author develops the thesis.Focus on the rhetorical method used by the original author rather than the exact details he or she offers. Avoid restating specific details from the work.
Authors have several ways of supporting a thesis. They may provide several separate arguments or one long chain of linked arguments. They may also elaborate on the thesis by simply defining the key concepts involved.

Example: Doe makes this argument by outlining the structure of the précis, describing the most effective writing process, and providing additional considerations regarding the form of précis text.

, The third sentence should summarize the original author's purpose in writing the piece. Use an ""in order to"" clause to draw attention to this purpose and its desired effect.


The purpose of the piece is not the same as its thesis, even though the former may reflect the latter. Instead, try viewing it as an explanation of the author's motive in writing the piece.
When writing this sentence, state the author's purpose, followed by the ""in order to"" phrase, followed by the intended effect on the reader.

Example: Doe's purpose is instruct readers on how to write a précis in order to allow them to do so when the need arises in their own lives.

, The fourth and final sentence of the précis should state the original author's intended audience and explain the author's position or relationship with that audience.


The author rarely states his or her intended audience, so you'll need to determine the identity of that audience based on the language of the work, the references used, and any other knowledge you have about the original author.

Example: Considering the language used in the article and the nature of the topic, Doe primarily writes for an audience of students other academically-minded individuals.

, Read through the original work multiple times, taking notes on any key ideas as you read. Repeat as needed until you feel comfortable with your understanding of the work.


Skim through the text before reading through it. Mentally divide the work into sections based on headings, subheadings, and shifts in the discussion.
Look for any unfamiliar terms while skimming, too. Look up anything you don't know using a dictionary, encyclopedia, or similar resource.
After skimming the work, read through it more carefully, taking careful notes as you go along. Pay attention to the tone and purpose of the work, and label sections that are too detailed or too confusing. Disregard the detailed points while writing and clarify the confusing points before progressing further.
You may need to read through the work two to five times, depending on how familiar or unfamiliar the information seems. Continue as needed until you feel confident about how well you understand the text.
Each time you re-read the work, compare it with your existing notes and any summaries you've written, including summaries of the thesis and separate sections. Verify that your written explanations match your current understanding of the text., Use your notes to write a brief summary for each section or paragraph, restricting the length to one or two sentences.


Each sentence summary should only include the key point and pieces of evidence. Avoid including minor details, regardless of how interesting those minor details seem to you.Try to summarize each section without needing to return to the text itself. Between your notes and your own understanding of the original piece, you should be able to explain the main point of each section on your own. Summarizing without returning to the text should also make it easier to write the ideas in your own words.

, Identify the author's thesis, whether directly or indirectly stated. Rewrite this thesis in your own words without changing its overall meaning.


Use the summary sentences you wrote to help clarify the author's thesis. The thesis statement should encompass all of the author's key points and provide a clear idea of what the original work conveys overall.
While determining the author's thesis, reflect on his or her purpose, as well. Ask yourself what argument the author makes and what the author hopes to convey in making that argument. Make a note of this purpose in a separate sentence.

, String together the thesis, supporting evidence, and other key information in your own words. Follow the basic outline described in this article.


Depending on how well you crafted your thesis statement summary, you might be able to include it word-for-word in your précis.
When following the standard four-sentence structure, you'll need to trim down your summaries of the supporting evidence into one detailed yet concise sentence. Focus on the type of evidence used rather than the actual specifics.

, Read through your précis. It should clearly express the original meaning of the text while retaining the same basic tone and proportions of the original work.


Verify that your précis follows the basic précis structure. It must also be grammatically sound, coherent, and accurate.

, In most cases, a précis summarizes the reading within one paragraph varying in length between 100 and 200 words. Use the four-sentence structure outlined in this article when writing a précis of that length.


In some instances, however, your instructor may want you to write a longer summary in précis form. Find out the exact length before you begin writing—usually, it will be approximately one-fifth to one-sixth the length of the original piece.When writing a longer précis, you should still include all of the information indicated within the four-point structure. You'll need to expand each supporting point of evidence into its own brief paragraph, however, while keeping the rest of the information within the introduction. Restate the thesis in your concluding paragraph along with a one-sentence description of the previously-stated supporting evidence.

, The term ""précis"" literally means ""cut short"" in Old French, and as that meaning suggests, the information you provide in the précis should be brief and to the point.


When writing a four-sentence précis, the text should fall within 100 to 200 words. For a long-form précis, the text should still fit within two single-spaced pages.

, Write the précis in present tense and maintain that tense throughout the paragraph. You should also use active voice instead of passive voice.


For instance, you should write ""John Doe argues"" instead of ""John Doe argued.""
Apply all actions to the author or authoring organization instead of the inanimate text. In other words, you should write ""John Doe states"" instead of writing ""the article states.""

, Ideally, you should not include any direct quotation within the précis. Summarize the original text and related information in your own words.


In rare instances, you may need to quote a specialized term. You'll need to follow the quotation with an appropriate citation according to the style guide you're currently following (MLA, APA, or Chicago).

, Even though you should use your own words when writing the précis, you should not evaluate the text, hint at your own opinion of it, or build your own argument from it.


Remember that the précis is nothing more than a type of summary, so it should only describe what the author of the original work claims. It is not your duty to support or deny this claim.

Journalists, bloggers, and other media outlets often receive several press releases daily. To make sure that yours stands out from the crowd and is compelling, be sure it contains actual news.


Is your band embarking on a new tour or releasing a new album? Those are genuinely newsworthy topics. If you are just merely trying to publicize your band’s existence, that is not considered newsworthy.
Other reasons to write a press release are when the band starts to record new material or decides to collaborate with another musician or musical group.You should also consider writing a press release when the band chooses an album title, finalizes album art, or releases a video.
If you send out a press release that is not newsworthy, the recipients will disregard that one and possibly future ones you send to them.;
, If you are new to writing press releases, it is a good idea to find some examples to help you understand how they typically are written and appear.


You can find numerous examples of well-written press releases on distribution sites like PR Newswire or PRWeb.There are also distribution sites specifically for music industry press releases. These can also be helpful to read to see how others in the industry are crafting their releases., After you spend the time crafting a well-written, attention-grabbing press release, you need to be sure it lands in the right hands. Otherwise, all of your efforts will have been wasted.


It is easiest to start with local news and media outlets. Identify local journalists or bloggers who write about musicians and events.You can call your city’s newspaper and radio stations and ask who covers music or entertainment.Work to develop other contacts in the press or in the music industry. If those writers feel a connection to you or are familiar with your band, they will be more receptive to the news you send them.It is useful to keep a database or contact list for sending out your press releases. You can always add to this list, but having the information in one central location will save you time as you send out more releases in the future.
In addition to newspaper and television or radio stations, consider adding to your contact list magazines that cater to your style of music or to those in the industry; arts, lifestyle, and entertainment sections of newspapers; Web sites; bloggers; and others active in social media., In years past, most press releases were faxed or mailed to media outlets. Today, however, most press releases are distributed via e-mail or on your band’s Web site.


Ask your contacts how they prefer to receive press releases.
If you e-mail your release, include your press release in the body of the message, since many journalists may be wary of opening attachments.
Press releases distributed electronically or on a Web site can include links to a clip of a recent concert or some brief audio downloads.
If you personally know the journalist you are contacting, make the subject line of your e-mail personal. That will increase the odds of your press release actually being read.
Follow up e-mailed press releases with a phone call to your recipients. This personal touch can help you ensure that your press release did not end up in their junk folder.
Your e-mail text can also include an offer to send a copy of an album for review or a press pass for an upcoming show.

, You want to be sure that you give the recipients time to act on and use your press release. Don’t send out a press release an hour before your performance, for example.


For print media or bloggers, send out your press releases in the morning. For television and radio stations, a good time to send them a release is late morning or early afternoon., There is no need to reinvent the wheel when crafting your press release. Every strong press release follows a basic structure that is easy to read and quick to the point.


A typical press release is one page long on standard 8½” x 11” paper.
At the top of your press release, put “For Immediate Release,” or, if you want the information held, write “Hold for Release Until…”.The headline should follow, centered and written in bold letters or initial caps.
Include a dateline with your location information and the date of the press release. Many publications will only feature bands from specific areas.The press release should contain a strong first paragraph that features the most critical information, followed by a few paragraphs of body text that add more detail.
Include your contact information at the bottom of the press release.
Type the word “end” at the end of your press release.

, Your headline is the most important part of your press release; it will help the reader decide whether to spend the time reading the rest of the release.A strong headline may be, “Band X Opens New Tour Next Thursday,” or “Band X Covers Hair Metal Classics on New Album.”

, Many people don’t even read past the first paragraph, so make your important points up front.The first paragraph should be no more than three sentences; cut extraneous information and stick to the main point.
Write your first paragraph in the style of a newspaper reporter, being sure to clearly answer the essential news questions of who, what, where, when, how, and why.Include full city and state descriptions (like Portland, Oregon, instead of just Portland) and also include full dates (month, day, and year).Use third person, like “the band” or “they” instead of first person (like “we” or “us”).
A first paragraph concerning an album release would include information like the title of the album, when it will be released, and where it can be purchased.
Likewise, for a tour announcement, your first paragraph should include the name of the tour, the dates it begins and ends, the city where it will start, and ticket information.

, Following your initial paragraph, you should include two or three more paragraphs to offer more context about the tour or album. You can also include a band bio.


If you have any, include quotes in your body text.A quote could be from a club manager where you previously performed or from another popular musician who enjoys your work.
The last paragraph of your press release usually contains boilerplate information, like when your band was founded, the names and instruments of all members, any major tour or album information not already covered, influences, style, etc.

, Your press release is more likely to be successful in gaining favorable media attention if you include high resolution photo of the band.Good band photos usually are against a plain background, black or white, to place the focus on the band (rather than the setting).Performance shots, even from a practice, also are good for band photos. They show your members concentrating on their craft rather than staring into the camera.It is useful to include both a landscape- and a portrait-oriented photo so that the editor or writer will have more options to use it.Print media usually utilizes black and white photos, so it’s best to send that style to newspaper and magazine writers., A poorly written, disorganized press release filled with grammar or spelling errors will quickly find its way to the recycle bin. You must deliver an error-free product to be taken seriously.Have your other band members read over your copy to ensure it includes everything necessary and has no grammar or spelling errors.
If your bandmates are not strong writers, enlist the help of a friend or relative who is a strong writer or editor.
Double-check all dates and addresses listed in your press release. It is easy to make a simple mistake like Thursday, June 4, instead of Thursday, June 5.

, If your press release is successful, your recipients will want to follow up with you to get more information.


Include all relevant information, including phone numbers, URL for the band’s Web site, and an e-mail address.
Be sure to check your e-mail often and reply quickly. Similarly, if you include a phone number, check your voice mail and return calls promptly.

Start the official broadcast.",How to Write a Radio Program," No matter if you’re writing a story or a news report, you’ll have to talk to people and catch the attention of an audience that you can engage only with words. Start with your favorite literary works, articles, and interviews, then study the pieces that are popular. Figure out why they grab your attention.


Search online for guides and discussions or get popular books from a library or bookstore.
A nearby college may offer classes, many of them specialized to unique focuses such as literary writing or newscasting.;
, Practice this before starting a program script. Find a person who seems lively or create your own character. In as few sentences as possible, express the character's life and personality as vividly as possible. Use an important, unique detail while trying to hook the reader. It takes practice to be able to convince your listeners they should care about this person and listen to a program that includes them.Pretend that the character’s life existed before you began the story. It is helpful to take key information from before the story to set up the character’s current situation.
Instead of reciting facts, insert emotions with stories and explanations. Explain the impact of a soccer game between two conflicting groups, for example. What does the game represent? How did it affect the lives of those in it?

, Radio audiences can only hear what you’re saying, so long and elaborate sentences will confuse them. While you do practice writing assignments, such as character sketches, go through and cross out all the unnecessary words. Change the complicated words. Keep the tone of your writing active instead of passive.


“Newspaper editor Kurt released the article without permission” is stronger and more direct than “The article was released by Kurt, editor of the newspaper.”
Most audiences will be diverse, so avoid jargon as much as possible. Explain it if you have to use it.

, When you set out to write your program, you’ll first need to know the time slot and the format you will use. Is this a one-time program or a series? Will the topic continue in the next episode? You’ll need to know how much time you have to fill and whether your subject can fill it.Make each episode self-contained. If you’re preparing a series, start the next episode with fresh examples and a new approach to your subject matter.

, Your program will be available to a wide variety of people and you’ll need to be able to capture the attention of as many of them as possible. Search online to find who listens to the station at your time slot, if you have one, and tailor your wording to appeal to them.The time slot matters. For instance, if your program comes on at the end of the work day after a block of music, you’ll need to get people to keep listening. You can try including comedy or appealing to their musical taste.
It’s okay to target your message to the group that most tunes into your time slot, but never stereotype your audience.

, Tune into popular shows and discover what makes them popular. The shows you like have some method of capturing your attention and keeping you listening. Note what parts make you lose interest, too. Examples can be found on standard radio, online shows, or podcasts.

, You can keep a list of important points you need to cover when speaking to someone. Look up information on the person you’re speaking to if you can, such as details about their work. Once you’ve gotten the basic information in discussion with your interview subject, try to ask your questions in a way that gets you an honest answer. Sometimes this means asking the same question several times.This is your program. Practice how to be a confident, strong, leader of it so you can keep guests from controlling it.
If your program seems to be going off-topic, interrupt with questions such as “Do you have an example of that?” in order to get the information your program needs.
Once you've done an interview off camera, practice cutting the audio files and inserting them at key moments into a program.

, Out loud, read a story you or someone else has written. You can start by using a mirror and projecting your voice through an empty room before practicing with an audience. You’ll need to speak clearly and in a way that both conveys authority and appeal. Always sound interested in the story you’re telling.Vary your pace. Like how you’d get bored listening to a bunch of songs that sound the same, your voice needs to vary to convey action and mood.
Try interviewing friends or even people on the street. This gives you an opportunity to learn how to interact professionally with a wide variety of people.

, The most powerful topic you can choose is one that’s meaningful to you and has a lesson to offer listeners. Writing about a unique topic, such as a personal story about bullying, makes it easier for you to speak in a way that sounds personal, which keeps people interested while also making them feel like they gained meaning from listening.It’s important to choose a topic suitable to your audience. For example, people coming home from a day of work may get more out of a program with comedic elements rather than one that feels too serious.

, On paper, write down the basic parts of your script. Break the program down into segments. Note how long each segment will be and in a few words write down the points you want to make in each one.Include any breaks you’ll take and soundtracks you’ll play. All of these take up time.

, The introduction needs to seize the attention of listeners. Decide what makes your program newsworthy. Use this to set up the plot of the story in as few words as possible. Your introduction should give the story context but also not reveal too much about the story.For example, episode 588 of the NPR podcast This American Life starts by saying, “The first thing you need to know about Laurie is that she’s normally not the kind of girl who does these kinds of things at all.” This makes you want to learn what she did and why.
The introduction’s style should match that of the rest of the story. Don’t try to deceive listeners by switching tones. If the program goes on to talk about Laurie’s confliction, express the buildup to that in the introduction and maintain an informative tone.
Don’t forget to introduce yourself and your program by name.

, The people that you will speak of are driving forces in the program. You most likely established the main one in the introduction. Now continue to grow them, having them perform actions or undergo situations that have an impact on their lives. Continue to introduce new characters as they come into the story.


For example, if Laurie fell in love with a man in a magazine picture, begin to talk about how and why she did that and what consequences she experienced.
Use literary tricks. For example, create suspense by mentioning that some people are in way over their heads to foreshadow that Laurie will face unexpected consequences.

, Transition from the introduction to the body of your program by expanding upon the subject. Fill in the outline with details streamlined enough to be understood by the audience but vivid enough for them to imagine the events in the story and feel stronger emotions because of it.


Show creative examples and comparisons, such as vividly describing Laurie’s infatuation with the man in the picture and her awkwardness when he called her at a later date.
When you perform your program, include enough details in your outline to keep the conversation flowing. It isn’t necessary to write a complete script when you’re having conversations with guests but you do need to help them relay their message to the audience.

, Once you’ve started filling in the details, the tone of your writing will come together. Keep the tone consistent throughout and match it to your audience while telling your story from start to finish.For example, if your goal is to address children about bullying, make sure your tone is enthusiastic, professional, but simplified enough for children to grasp.
Often it is acceptable and even beneficial to mix in brief tone changes such as comedy to express Laurie’s having gotten caught in an amusing lie. You wouldn’t do this during commentary about a serious current event, so use your judgment.

, A story functions when a main character has a strong opposing force. This goes for non-fiction, too. Let the subject of your interview and their opposition have a chance to express their side of the story. Include both viewpoints in your program without offering any sort of judgment unless your program is designed to include commentary.Always be respectful at interviews. Listen to the person, show enthusiasm, and be polite. Try to speak to them on a personal level.

, End your script by addressing the main point from your introduction. The ending should not be a stock phrase such as “We’ll have to wait and see.” Make your ending forceful by summing up your program and concluding on a fact. Afterwards, repeat your name and the name of the program.During an interview, you can ask your guest about what they expect from the future and sum up those expectations.

, For advertising or online categorizing, you’ll need to come up with a title, a description, and keywords. Keep the title brief, six words or less if possible, while explicitly stating what the program is about. Keep the description short and focused but have it make your script sound appealing. Your keywords should describe your program and help potential listeners search for it online.Avoid looking unprofessional. Don’t use all capitalization, profanity, or the same words for every program.

, If your program is recurring or a series, it helps to build a sense of unity. Edit the end of your program to introduce the next episode’s topic, if you have one. Give a brief sentence or two about the topic and link it to your current episode. If this episode links to the last one, edit your intro to remind listeners of the common thread the episodes share.


Don’t forget to sign off with your name, the title of your show, and any other relevant information about the show or the next episode, such as when it will air.

, If you’ve made recordings such as interviews or reporting, listen to the tape. Make annotations identifying who’s speaking, what they’re saying, and how long the parts of the recording are. Save the one you want to use in your broadcast., Load up all the songs, sound effects, and audio tracks you plan on using. These you should have ready at the push of a button so that your program flows freely. Test these files out to see if there are any volume or distortion issues that need to be fixed.If you’re going to have guests in person or calling in, make sure they can be heard if you plan on playing the files while they speak.

, Choose a time when your studio is quiet and record a test as if it’s the real show. Run through the script, playing any audio files you plan on using. Test out call-in phone lines if you’re using them. After you’re done, play back the recording, listening for weak phrases, sound file errors, and other mistakes you can improve.


If you’re going to have a guest, now is a good time to include them. Conclude how and when they’re going to call in or visit. If you can, run through the script with them.

, Right before you begin, double check to make sure all of your audio files are ready and your equipment works. All that’s left is to wait for the time when the show starts. If it isn’t a live program, you can start it as soon as you feel ready.


Schedule a time when your environment is quiet and you’ll have enough time to finish the broadcast.

Introduce yourself and your country.,
Explain the topic and how it affects your nation.,
Try to engage other nations to see and accept your position.,
Once you have more common points, introduce your solutions.,
Conclude by stating why this problem is so important.,
When talking about human rights, include one or two stories of violated rights.,
When talking about economics, mention your country's industries.,
When it comes to health, research is important.,
Consider that war is a very sad and complicated topic.",How to Write a Position Paper for Model UN," For example: ""Fellow delegates, I will introduce myself as the delegate of Finland"". If you don't like to be very formal, talk about your country's advantages. For example: ""Finland is a nation in Northern Europe that has a great health care system."";
, For example: ""For the Maldives, global warming has always been a top priority, over the years, the sea levels have been rising, putting my delegation in risk of sinking.""

, For example: ""Recently, Bangladesh has begun to experience an increase in floods and has observed and recorded higher sea levels too.""

, Remember that you should make solutions that involve everyone and benefit everyone, as much as possible. If you do so, more people will consider you as the committee's leader.


For example: ""Introducing new alternative energies will help to reduce emissions, slowing the release of emissions that contribute to global warming and helping to prevent the continued melting of glaciers and sea-level rise being experienced around the world. It will also support the American economies that are trying to make businesses from alternate energy production. If these services are also established in Africa, there would be increased work opportunities and better economic outcomes.""

, Finish with how your country's resolutions can go a long way to solving the problem. There is no example, it is all up to you.

, Demonstrate how could they be avoided with your country's solutions.

, Also try to mention as many statistics as possible, as it will make you sound more professional and reflects that you have done your homework.

, In this case, try to mention what cures have eventuated from collaborative research efforts and which research/medical organizations are the most helpful and why.

, Analyze your nation's priorities––people?; money?; weapons?; territory? After analyzing it, try to apply it in a friendly way to your position paper.

Schedule a meeting to sign.",How to Write a Partnership Agreement," In the absence of a partnership agreement, your state law will provide default rules that govern the partnership.The purpose of the partnership agreement is to replace these default rules with rules of your own choosing.


You can find a copy of your state’s partnership act by typing “Uniform Partnership Act” and your state into a web browser.;
, One benefit of drafting a partnership agreement is that it encourages the members to think upfront about a variety of issues, such as the purpose of the partnership, its day-to-day operations, and what members want their own role to be in the partnership.Accordingly, it is a good idea to meet with all future members of the partnership and discuss the following:



Business purpose. What service will you be providing, and will the partnership eventually provide additional services or move into new areas of business altogether? How long do members anticipate the partnership operating for?

Business identity. What will the partnership be called?

Start-up capital. How much will it cost to get the partnership off the ground? Who will contribute what? Do people want to retain title to any real estate they contribute?

Allocation of profits. Will profits be divided equally? Or will they be divided according to the amounts of capital contributed? Do people want the ability to make monthly withdrawals to be deducted from annual profits?

Liability. Under state law, each individual partner is responsible for the debts of the partnership collectively. This means that, should the partnership owe money to a supplier or lose a lawsuit, any individual partner could be personally sued for the debt. Do partners want to limit their liability?

Decision-making authority. Who will run the day-to-day business operations? What decisions do people want to be involved in? Will people have assigned tasks, such as handling accounting or marketing?

Growth or dissolution. Do people foresee the ranks of the partnership growing? How will the partners decide on admitting new partners? How will the partners decide to dissolve the partnership?

, For convenience, one person should take notes and then draft a preliminary Partnership Agreement. The person can then distribute drafts for comment and revision.

, An experienced business attorney can help you identify areas of your partnership that need to be addressed in a partnership agreement. Even if you do not want to pay an attorney to draft the agreement, you could still sit down with the attorney and run through the general outlines of your partnership agreement.


The cost for an attorney to draft a partnership agreement is between $500-2,000, depending on complexity.By contrast, a half-hour consultation to talk about the business could cost $100 or so.
Some partnership provisions will require an attorney’s assistance. For example, if the partners want to allocate profits in a way that does not correspond to the ownership interest, then you will need a tax attorney.An attorney can also help you clarify whether or not you really want to form a partnership. A key feature of partnerships is that each partner is personally liable for the debts of the partnership. If limiting liability is a concern for you, then your attorney may recommend that you form a limited liability company instead, or a limited liability partnership (if your state offers that as an option).

, You should begin the Partnership Agreement by identifying the document as such. At the top of the page, center the words “Partnership Agreement.”

, A partnership agreement should begin with the names of the partners and their willingness to be bound by the partnership agreement.After listing the names of partners and their places of residence, identify how they will be referred to in the document. Type: “Hereinafter referred to collectively as ‘Partners.’”State that they agree to the following terms and conditions: “The Partners agree as follows:”, Underneath the names of the partners, identify the type of business the partnership will be.For example, “The partners voluntarily associate themselves as partners to perform the general business of and any other type of business from time to time as agreed to by the Partners.”

, Next, identify the name of the partnership: “The name of the Partnership shall be .”Typically, partnerships use the names of the partners: “Smith, Jones, and Weston, Partners”.
You may also use a fictitious name. Be sure that the name has not already been taken.You should contact your county clerk’s office to check whether the name is already in use.If you are registering as a Limited Liability Partnership, then contact your state filing office and ask how you can check if the name has already been taken., An important piece of identifying information is the partnership’s location. Identify it using the following language: “The principal place of business of the Partnership shall be and such other places as may be agreed upon by the partners.”, Here, you will identify when the partnership began and when it is scheduled to end. A partnership agreement does not need to list an expiration date.You can type something like the following: “The Partnership shall commence on . Unless terminated sooner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Partnership shall continue without defined term.”, Partners often provide unequal resources at the start of a partnership. You should list the partners, the amount that each contributed, and the type of contribution (whether cash or property).


Include language like the following: “Each partner shall contribute to the Partnership an initial contribution of capital.” Then list each partner and specify how he or she will make the contribution.

For example: “Michael J. Smith. Capital contribution shall consist of cash in the amount of $50,000.”
Capital contributions can be made in cash, property, bonds, or securities.


The partnership agreement should document the cash, property, and services that each partner will contribute. Specify the types of contributions each partner makes. For example, “Partner 1 shall make a capital contribution of 10 acres of land. This land is valued at $50,000. An additional cash contribution of $10,000 will also be made by check.”, Property contributed to the partnership becomes the property of the partnership. Also, any property purchased by the partnership belongs to the partnership as well. You should specify this in your partnership agreement.


Use language like the following: “Unless provided otherwise by this agreement, all property paid to, brought into, or transferred to, the partnership or subsequently acquired by the partnership shall be partnership property. Unless otherwise provided, the title to all partnership property shall remain in the name of the partnership.”You can also identify exceptions. Some partners may want to retain title to their property. You should state these exceptions. Identify the property, the name of the partner who owns the property, and the date that it will be returned to the partner.

For example: “It is agreed that the warehouse at 210 Rockwell Road is being made available to the partnership by Melissa Smith solely for the use of the partnership and is to remain the property of the lender. It shall be returned on January 1, 2020 or when the partnership is dissolved, if prior to that date.”, These can be based on the percentage of contribution to the startup of the partnership. However, you might want to use some other percentage. For example, a person may contribute a large sum of cash at startup but not do any work for the partnership. Accordingly, the partners may agree to allocate a smaller portion of the profits to this person.You should list the partners and then their ownership percentage.Then state that profits will be distributed, and expenses assessed, according to this percentage: “Generally, gross cash distribution will be made in proportion to Partner’s percentages of partnership interest. Operating expenses will also be shared generally at the time those expenses are realized in proportion to Partners’ percentages of partnership interest.”Also determine whether profits will be distributed once a year or whether each partner will be entitled to periodic draws (withdrawals). If you allow periodic draws, then state the amount that may be withdrawn. For example: “Unless and until modified by the unanimous written consent of the partners, will be entitled to a monthly draw of $_____.”
Draws could also be calculated as a percentage of anticipated profits for that month., During the normal course of business, countless decisions will have to be made, big and small. The partnership agreement shall identify who can make those decisions.


You can agree to make all decisions by vote or empower each partner to make certain decisions. You can also blend these two options: state generally that management and operation will be by vote but then create specific job descriptions of partners.
Generally, you can state, “All decisions respecting the management, operation, and control of the Partnership shall be based upon a majority share of the partnership in favor of the decision.”Then you can specify specific duties each partner will have. For example, a partner may be in control of marketing. You then can assign him or her power to make marketing decisions without needing the consent of the partnership as a whole.
You may also list matters that will require unanimity. Common matters requiring unanimity include assigning partnership property to creditors or others, submitting a partnership claim or liability to arbitration, suing the partnership, borrowing money in the name of the partnership, conveying partnership property, and transferring an individual interest in the partnership., Absent an agreement to the contrary, any partner can bind the entire partnership to a contract or other agreement.You should therefore use the partnership agreement to clarify who has the authority to commit the business to contracts and other obligations.


For example, you could grant all partners the ability to form contracts under a certain dollar amount. For contracts over this amount, state that the partner must have the express written consent of all other partners., You can also limit the work that each partner performs outside the partnership. You may want to clarify that the partners will not engage in business that conflicts with the partnership.


You can include language like this: “No partner, so long as this agreement is in force, shall pursue directly or indirectly any business or occupation which is in conflict with the partnership or which is in conflict with the partner’s duties to the partnership.”, The language can be general. For example, “Additional partners may be admitted to the partnership on such terms as may be agreed upon in writing between the Partners and such new partners. The terms agreed upon shall constitute an amendment to this partnership agreement.”, Partners may leave the partnership in several ways: by retiring, by withdrawing from the partnership, or by being expelled.


Provide mechanisms for retirement or withdrawal: “In the event any Partner shall desire to withdraw or retire, or becomes disabled to the extent that she or he is unable to fulfill necessary obligations to the partnership as outlined in this agreement, then such Partner shall give ____ days’ notice in writing, by registered or certified mail, to the other Partners. If any Partner is judged incompetent or insane, then his or her legal guardian shall provide notice in the same manner.”Explain the grounds for removing a partner. List them individually.

Common grounds for expulsion include: failure to make a capital contribution; failure to fulfill an obligation under the agreement; disability; legal insanity or incompetency.Also explain the process for how the partnership can expel the member. For example, “Upon a majority vote of the Partners, any Partner may be expelled from the membership in the Partnership upon the occurrence of any event listed in this section. The defaulting partner shall be provided ____ days’ notice of the expulsion.”, You must define when dissolution is triggered as well as what happens to the accumulated property and capital after dissolution.


For example, many partnerships dissolve when any of the following happen: a partner withdraws, retires, or is expelled; a partner dies or enters bankruptcy; a partner becomes incapacitated; all partners unanimously agree to dissolve.Detail what happens at dissolution. For example, the remaining partners may elect to continue the business. You can list this as an option: “On dissolution, the remaining partners shall have the right to elect to continue business under the partnership name, by themselves, or with any new persons that they choose.”Alternately, the partnership may be wound up and liquidated. Under this scenario, partnership assets are applied to liabilities owed to creditors and other partners. You should specify the order in which debts will be paid: typically creditors go first, then partners owed money for something other than capital contributions and profits (such as a personal loan); then partners for their capital contribution; and finally profits owed to partners., Dissolution is often triggered by the death of a partner. However, partners often want to continue the partnership even if one dies. You should clarify what happens. Also specify how the partner’s estate will share in the net profits or losses.


For example, you could state, “Upon the death of a Partner, the Partnership shall not terminate, and the business of the Partnership shall be continued to the end of the fiscal year in which the death occurs. The estate of the deceased Partner shall share in the net profits or losses of the Partnership for the balance of the fiscal year. The estate of the deceased Partner shall have no voice in the affairs of the Partnership. At the end of the fiscal year, the surviving Partners shall have the option either to liquidate the Partnership or to purchase the interest of the deceased Partner.”Clarify whether the vote to liquidate must be unanimous or by majority and when the vote must be taken. Under the Uniform Partnership Act, a partnership will be dissolved within 90 days of a partner’s death if a majority of surviving partners vote for dissolution., Typically, it will be the law of the state you do business in. You may state, “This Agreement shall be controlled by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of .”, You will want to include a “merger” clause which states that the agreement contains the entirety of what the partners agree to. This clause helps preempt a partner from later claiming that there were oral agreements between the partners that were not included in the agreement but which should be enforced.


Type: “This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto and may not be modified or amended except by a writing signed by the parties.”, Include space for partners to sign their names and write the date.You may also want to get the agreement notarized. Not all states require notarization. However, having the agreement notarized can provide added protection in case a partner later claims that he or she didn’t understand or sign the document.
To have the document properly notarized, sign in front of a notary. Notaries can be found at most large banks but also at courthouses. Be sure to bring sufficient identification, such as a valid driver’s license or passport.

, Once you have finished drafting the partnership agreement, share a copy with all partners and ask for feedback. If changes are minor, you can incorporate them into your master document.


Make sure changes are in Track Changes or in redline so that they stand out when you redistribute the draft.
If there are fundamental, major changes (such as ownership percentage), then you may need to call another meeting to work through the disagreements and hammer out a new draft.
If you find any member too difficult to work with during the drafting stage, you may want to reconsider forming a partnership with this person. Personalities and communication styles tend not to change simply because a business entity is formed. If you find someone difficult to work with now, you may want to bow out of the partnership altogether.

, If you didn’t meet with an attorney at the start of the process, then schedule a meeting with a business lawyer to go over the draft. The lawyer may identify ways to clarify language or identify areas you missed.

, All partners should gather to read through the document together and then sign. Partners can make their capital contributions at that time.

Proofread one final time.",How to Write a Personal Statement," While you should not include a straight list of achievements in your personal statement, some of your most significant achievements do deserve to be mentioned. Writing out a list of your achievements will help you to recall each one and determine which to include.


Formal achievements can include:

Academic degrees and certifications
Scholarship awards
Awards or honors from academic institutions
Workplace promotions, reviews, and evaluations
Speaking at a conference, convention, or workshop
Published works in your field of expertise
Official recognition for community service or contributions

;
, These goals allow the reader to know that their contribution will have a significant impact. You do not need to describe all your goals in your final statement, but list as many as possible during the brainstorming stage.


In order to thoroughly cover your goals, ask yourself a range of questions like:

How will this university/academic program/scholarship/job position/client directly impact my future?
What is my ultimate career goal?
Where do I see myself in 1 year? 5 years? 10 years?
What are the steps I need to take in order to reach my ultimate goal?
What are other goals I hope to accomplish along the way?



, Jot down a list of experiences and turning points in your life that led you to develop your goals or present set of interests.


Questions worth asking yourself include:

When did you originally develop an interest in your field of choice?
What do you love most about your field of choice?
Why do you think your field of choice is important?
What experiences have you had that have provided you with experience in the field?
Has there ever been a time that you nearly gave up on this dream?
Had you given up any other dreams or expectations in order to chase after this one?



, Challenges and difficulties often make the hero of the story—you—seem more endearing. Everyone loves an underdog, and many people will be willing to assist you if they see that you have already worked so hard to reach the position you are currently at.


Possible challenges worth exploring include:

Financial difficulties
Social status difficulties
Prejudice
Learning disabilities
Physical disabilities
Family problems
Medical problems
Unexpected tragedies



, You will likely have plenty of competition, so you need to thoroughly describe whatever it is that sets you apart from the rest of the crowd. Before you can convince the reader of your uniqueness, you need to convince yourself.Ask yourself a range of questions, such as:

What personal qualities (leadership skills, organizational skills, self-control, etc.) do you possess which make you a valuable asset?
What experiences and beliefs have shaped your present character?
What are some of your proudest ""unofficial"" accomplishments? (Emphasize accomplishments that demonstrate a positive character trait.)
Have you had any turning points that redirected your life in a positive way?
Why would you choose yourself over other candidates? Why should anyone else?



, While the basic structure and purpose of a personal statement remains the same, there are different aspects of your life you will need to focus on describing based on the type of situation this personal statement will be used for.If writing a personal statement for undergraduate schools or scholarships, focus on how your interests came to be, your high school achievements, your community involvement, and your positive character traits.
If writing for an undergraduate transfer, focus on your current academic and community record with your present school and describe your reasons for wanting to switch universities.
If writing for graduate school, focus on your long-term plans for the future, your undergraduate experiences, and the reasons you plan to further your education.
If writing for a job, portfolio, or to gain a particular client, focus on your past work experiences, the experiences you gained academically within the past five years, and your positive character traits.

, Before you write your personal statement, do a little digging to find out what the reader will find important.


Look into the institution's or organization's:

Mission statement
History
Star students or employees
Recent accomplishments or news stories



, Sometimes, an institution or organization will provide a list of specific questions or topics they want you to address. If this is the case, review the list carefully and write out answers that directly answer those concerns.

, While several institutions or organizations may share similar concerns, you should resist the urge to use the same personal statement for each. Instead, write a fresh personal statement tailor-made for each institution. Some differences may exist between your statements, but each one should be a little different in some way.
Note that you can, however, use the same notes you took during your brainstorming sessions.

, Your first paragraph must grab the reader's attention. A strong introductory paragraph will clearly introduce the thesis or theme of your personal statement while avoiding cliches or overused phrasing.


Avoid starting with phrases like, “The most important moment in my life was when...”
A better way to introduce that “important moment” would be to simply start describing it. Explain that, “The summer I turned 17 would leave me a changed person,” or, “When I first started working at XYZ Company, I never imagined that my belief about widget manufacturing would change so dramatically.” Directly break into the narrative instead wasting time alerting the reader that you intend to do so.
Provide as much detail in the first paragraph as possible. Introduce the main idea of your personal statement and describe the conditions of that idea. Save any elaborate details or related notes and experiences for the body of your essay, though.

, In general, a one-page personal statement should only elaborate on two to four main issues. Choose issues that are both relevant and meaningful.


Never share your entire life story.
Write about what interests you. You will be able to write more convincingly and more passionately if you write about events, goals, experiences, or ideas that you already feel passionate about.
Address issues specifically brought up by the institution or organization. If there are any topics that the reader demands to see, then make sure that those are included in your personal statement.

, Keep in mind that the purpose of a personal statement is to introduce yourself to the institution or organization you send the statement to.



Do not be vague or general.

Do tell the reader about experiences, goals, and ideas unique to you.

, You can and should address specific concerns brought up by the institution or organization, but you should not write your personal statement with the sole purpose of impressing the reader.


Do not attempt to be the “perfect match.” You have no definitive way of knowing what the perfect match would be like, and attempting to create a skewed image of yourself will only cause problems in the future.

, Write in an optimistic, confident tone.


Avoid uncertain or weak phrasing like, “I'm not sure but I think I would probably be a good fit for your program.”
Even when discussing challenges or difficulties you faced, focus on your triumphs over those problems rather than attempting to paint yourself as an unfortunate and helpless victim.

, Your first draft can be as long or short as you need it to be, but many institutions and organizations have word count or page count limits on personal statements. If yours exceeds the word count, cut information out. If yours is not long enough, add more information.


When trimming your personal statement down, scan the essay for any parts that do not directly address your point or those that only serve to provide “background information.” Also consider reducing your number of main points if one point does not seem especially significant.
When expanding your personal statement, look for ways to elaborate on the information you already have. Include more detail to create a fuller picture. Alternatively, you could introduce another main point to discuss.

, Reading the piece out loud will give you a more accurate idea of how it sounds.


As you read, listen for errors or clunky wording.
Note any sentences or paragraphs that seem displaced.
Also ask yourself if it sounds like your natural voice. If you were describing these things in person, would the way you speak sound like the way you wrote out your thoughts?

, Having another set of eyes proofread your personal statement is a good idea because another person may be objective enough to analyze the statement's strengths and weaknesses honestly.


Accept constructive criticism graciously and try not to take anything personal.
When asking for constructive criticism, first go to professional sources like:

High school teachers
University professors
Internship supervisors
Academic advisers
Trustworthy colleagues


After your professional sources have been exhausted, you can ask friends and family for their thoughts.

, Once you have your own ideas and the ideas of others in hand, revise your personal statement by fixing any weak parts and adding or removing detail as needed.


Note that it is perfectly normal to go through more than two drafts of your personal statement.

, Once you feel satisfied with the content of your personal statement, proofread it one last time for basic spelling and grammar errors.


Once you fix these problems, your personal statement is ready to mail out.

Use the self-evaluation as an opportunity.",How to Write a Performance Appraisal," Before you begin reviewing an employee's performance, you should double-check that employee's description in your employment files. If the position's requirements or functions have changed at all in the last few years, that description will need to be updated.It would be unfair to the employee to evaluate them based on outdated position descriptions.
Recognize the work that employee has done and the work they're expected to do this year, not in years past.
Update the description to include any special skills or knowledge required to do the work and/or any specific tools or equipment needed.;
, In addition to reviewing the position description, you should also review the essential performance functions of that position.These functions will help you identify your own expectations for that employee. Performance functions vary by job, but they generally include:


Accountability: This covers whether the employee is reliable and consistent. Accountability may include punctuality, ability to meet deadlines, respect for the organization and its employees, and ability to meet or exceed performance expectations.Production standards: These should be objective, measurable accomplishments performed within specific time frames. For example, a person picking stock in a distribution center might be expected to pick 100 pieces an hour.
Job knowledge: This may include the employee's professional skills, ability to assist coworkers, and willingness to continue developing their knowledge and abilities. Required knowledge might also include operating, maintaining, and instructing others with special tools and equipment.
Communication: This may include communication skills, or it may cover an employee's ability to work collaboratively and seek feedback from other employees.
Interpersonal relations: This generally deals with how the employee treats their colleagues, and whether the employee is tactful and respectful of others.
Customer service: If the employee's position involves customer service, you may want to include evaluations on patience, approachability, reliability, and the employee's commitment to following up with customers as needed.

, As you prepare to assess an employee's performance over the past year, it's important to review what you (or perhaps another manager) said about that employee last year. There may be significant improvements made, or the employee's performance may have gotten worse; either way, you should know in advance where things stand.Look into performance reviews for the past three years, especially noting whether such reviews have been performed by other people. Note any employee comments about past reviews.

, The best way to begin a performance appraisal is to document the work that a given employee has done. Take note of both what the employee has done in their position and how they did it, whether the things you document are good or bad.Reviews should be as objective as possible based upon viewable, measurable results. If subjectivity is required, note justifications in the review.


In order to complete a performance appraisal, you will need to decide on some type of measurable, quantitative method of documenting and evaluating performance.Any time an employee commits an infraction, it needs to be documented in that employee's personnel file. These infractions should be reviewed and compiled during that employee's performance appraisal.Tie any performance praise or infraction reprimand with specific rules and policies at work. Make sure all rules and policies are enforced equally for all employees.

, An important part of the appraisal process for many employers is seeking feedback from each employee's coworkers and from the employee himself or herself. This allows managers to get a better feel for how an individual views their job and how that employee's coworkers view their performance.Ask an employee's coworkers how that individual performs at work, both independently and in collaboration with others.
You should specifically ask about both the accomplishments of that employee and any areas that their colleagues believe need improvement.
Remember that co-workers' comments are always subjective and often based upon their relationship with employee. Rather than relying upon single interviews, indicate the use of 360-degree appraisals.

, Your employees should not go into their performance reviews feeling blindsided. If there are elements of an employee's performance that need improvement, let that employee know in a casual (yet professional) way. Likewise, if an employee is doing a good job, give that person praise when you see them at work.The employer should have written history of any reviews and feedback, with evidence that the employee understands the reason for a negative comment and the expectations for improvement.

, Before you begin an employee's performance appraisal, you'll need to decide how to review that employee's work. There are several different ways of organizing/structuring your appraisal. Three of the most common include:


Open-ended: Rather than using a rating scale, an open-ended appraisal is an open-ended written evaluation that can include any thoughts that the appraiser chooses to include. This format is preferable if you only manage a small number of people.
Structured response: The structured response appraisal is a middle-ground between open-ended and checklist evaluations. It consists of a series of topics/questions within a set of performance parameters, which you fill in according to the employee's performance.

Remember that these responses need to be based on observation of results, not speculation of motive or attitude.


Checklist: The checklist appraisal is generally used by managers with a large number of employees to evaluate. It consists of a list of performance appraisals and a numerical ranking of how a given employee performs in each category (for example, on a scale of 1 to 5).
Ranking employees in groups against others can be an effective way to recognize low performance. Many company automatically terminate the lowest 10 percent if no improvement is made.

, It can be very easy to confuse accomplishments and achievements with activities. Activities are what workers perform on a day-to-day basis by coming to work; accomplishments are the results or outcomes of an employee's activities and hard work.As you assess an employee's performance, you'll need to distinguish between that employee doing their job and actually accomplishing things for the company.
Make a point of praising good work on the employee's part, but have concrete accomplishments to praise.You should especially praise good work if the employee is doing the work of multiple people. Many employees get saddled with extra work after downsizing, yet they never get recognition for that extra effort.Focus on the entire reporting period (most likely a year). Focusing on one bad incident from the last month and ignoring the last 11 months of flawless work is unfair and unhelpful for most employees.

, It may seem obvious, but a performance appraisal is only valuable to the employee if it provides specific feedback on areas that need improvement. It should also address specific things the employee is doing well, and provide encouragement in all areas of performance.Dedicate time to each individual objective being reviewed.Be honest and fair in your assessment, and don't play favorites among your employees.
Support every score on the evaluation, whether good or bad, with written comments and feedback.Make sure your criticism (if any) is constructive. It's not helpful to tell someone they're bad at doing something; instead, tell them how to improve that aspect of their job.
As a manager, ask and focus on how you can help employee reach goals. In other words, be people-oriented to achieve high standards, rather than process-oriented.
Focus on each employee's strengths and weaknesses, and be sure to give your employee new performance goals for the coming year.Let employees know that improvement can lead to benefits like a salary increase or a promotion to a better position.

, If the employee has areas that need to improve, you'll need to give that individual the tools to improve their performance. The best goals are called S.M.A.R.T. goals, an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.Specific goals should use exact language and target the precise aspects of performance that need improvement. For example, instead of saying ""Make better sales calls,"" you might suggest that the employee work on their tone and pitch with customers.
Measurable goals should be easily tracked. You should have a clear indication of what needs to be done, how much change needs to be made, and when it needs to happen by.
Attainable goals are realistic and feasible for an employee to accomplish. Rather than expecting an employee to single-handedly turn the company around, you should expect that employee to improve their sales numbers, for example.
Relevant goals link the employee's performance with quantifiable results that relate to their function in the workplace. For example, a customer service employee may be asked to increase the number of disgruntled callers they're able to keep as customers.
Time-bound goals have a specific start and end date. For example, a time-bound goal might be to improve customer satisfaction ratings within the next six months.

, Even the most critical performance appraisal should end with something positive. As a manager, you'll have to evaluate the work an employee has done to find something positive you can commend.It's typically easier to take critical feedback if the review ends with something positive.
Think about everything that employee has done over the last year, including how that employee interacts with other colleagues, to find something positive you can praise.

, While annual reviews are very common, some managers like to follow up with employees between those big reviews. These may be done quarterly or at the mid-year point, but the goal is to evaluate each employee's progress so that the employee isn't blindsided by more criticism during the next annual review.You can follow up with employees through formal performance appraisals, or informally through a one-on-one conversation with each employee (if this is feasible).
Praise improvements and corrective changes the employee has made. Give them credit for all their hard work.
Point out any performance aspects that have not improved with your recommendations or have gotten worse since last year's review.

, Your self-evaluation may be what your manager basis your performance review on, or it may simply be a tool to assess how you feel you're progressing. Either way, it's important that you think carefully about what you want to say about your work.You should never rush through a self-evaluation. That appraisal may end up in your personnel file, or it could be reviewed when you're up for a promotion, so make it count.
You shouldn't need weeks and weeks to plan a response, but you may want to take at least a day or two to look back on everything you've done in the last year.

, Your self-evaluation shouldn't be a giant pat on your own back. It should be an honest assessment of your performance over the last year, factoring in both the good and bad aspects of your work.Avoid false modesty and take credit for your achievements.
By the same token, though, make sure you don't inflate your performance assessment either.
Try to frame your shortcomings as learning experiences. For example, you might say, ""I lost three customers this year; however, in the process, I learned more efficient ways of keeping customers satisfied with our performance, which will help keep future customers with us.""

, In any self-evaluation, it's a good idea to begin by acknowledging what is expected from someone working in your position at your employer. This helps establish a baseline by which your performance can be evaluated.


If using an open-ended format, spend a few sentences addressing what your position entails. Then address how you actually meet (or fail to meet) those responsibilities, and suggest ways you might improve your work.
For example, you might start by writing a sentence or two on what's typically expected from your position. Then spend the rest of the paragraph talking about how you meet, fail to meet, or exceed those expectations.
If using a structured or checklist format, your evaluation should already include some general markers of what's expected of your position (usually included in the questions). Rate your work based on how well you actually meet those expectations.
Include performance competencies for both your professional skills and your behavior in the workplace, no matter what format you're using.

, Your self-evaluation should include some aspects of your performance that need work. You shouldn't be self-loathing in your assessment, but you should be able to realistically identify things that you could be doing differently.If you're not sure about how to write about areas of improvement for yourself, ask a trusted colleague or manager how to proceed with this part of the evaluation.
The key is to write about your shortcomings as a learning experience. For example, instead of saying ""I lose a lot of clients,"" you might say, ""One area in need of improvement is managing ongoing client relationships. I've learned from experience that ______ is the best approach.""
Talk about specific instances where you struggled with a project but managed to learn something valuable (ideally after succeeding with that project)., While different employers use self-evaluations in different ways, one thing is common: you can use this space to talk about what you want for your professional future. Don't be pushy or demanding, but offer hints of where you see yourself in the next few years at that company.Talk about the aspects of your current position that you find most exciting.
Suggest some different ways that you can focus more time and attention on the things that excite you.
Ask about being included in meetings that deal with those exciting job elements, or request time and/or funding to enroll in some type of continued education or training opportunities.
For example, you might say, ""Because of my interest in _____ at my current position, I think I might find working in _____ highly rewarding. I believe my skills could significantly help the _____ department.
Use these discussion points to subtly hint that you'd like to take on more responsibility at your workplace. Over time, taking on more responsibility could lead to a promotion or a raise.

Calm down.,
Read the assignment guidelines.,
Research your topic.,
Find the best sources.,
Pick a few pieces of good evidence.",How to Write a Paper That Is Due Tomorrow1," It might sound strange, but the first thing you need to do is relax a little bit. If you've just remembered this assignment, you're understandably pretty stressed out. But that's not a good state to be in when you're trying to write a paper. So take some deep breaths, and make a plan.Deep breathing can help lower your blood pressure and and your heart rate. This can physically help you feel more confident about tackling your problems.Try doing a few basic yoga stretches or turning on some soothing music for a few minutes. These methods can help you feel more calm and in control.;
, If you have decided that it is best to try to complete the paper in a short amount of time, your first step is to make sure you have a clear understanding of the assignment. Make sure that you have a clear understanding of what you are supposed to write about, and how many sources you will need.Look for keywords that will let you know the goal of the paper. For example, if you see the word ""compare,"" you will know that you need to compare two ideas, texts, etc. Writing a paper about just one isn't an option in this case. However, if you see the word ""analyze,"" you may be able to write about just one topic or text.It may be tempting, but it's generally not a good idea to email your professor with questions about an essay due the next day. This lets your professor know that you didn't start well in advance and will make a bad impression. In addition, your professor may not check her email outside of business hours, so that email at 10:45PM is likely to go unanswered.

, Once you know how many and what types of sources you need, you can begin researching. Since your time is limited, you'll need to search efficiently for the sources that will be most helpful to you. Try using your university library as your first step in researching. If possible, head to the library. If it is closed, use the webpage., For a college paper, scholarly resources are your best bet. Use the online database to search for books relating to your topic. If possible, look for ones that have electronic versions available. You can also use the library webpage to find scholarly journals that will contain articles about your topic.


Read efficiently. As you read your sources, don't try to absorb every single word. You will get bogged down. Instead, try reading for specific information that will help you write your paper. Scan, and take notes when you find something that is useful.The introductions of books and abstracts of journal articles contain useful information that summarizes the overall argument of the text. Start with these.

, Because you're working on a tight deadline, your research will not be as complete as it would be if you had started working earlier. Pick a few key pieces of evidence that you will use to support your argument.A good rule of thumb is to have at least one piece of evidence per ""claim"" in your paper. Generally, each body paragraph will put forward a claim that works to support your overall thesis. Thus, in a five-paragraph essay you would need at least three pieces of evidence, since you are likely to have three claims (one for each body paragraph).


Look for quotations that are meaningful or impactful. Find a key fact or data point. Make sure that your evidence helps you answer your guiding question (the one that your thesis addresses).
Make sure that your evidence fulfills the requirements. Some teachers may require a certain number of sources, a certain type (e.g., a scholarly journal or a recent book), or a certain balance of primary and secondary sources. Read the assignment carefully."
"
Write your thesis statement.,
Create an outline.,
Write the body of your paper.,
Write your introduction.,
Cite your sources.",How to Write a Paper That Is Due Tomorrow2," Your thesis (or argument) is the most important part of your paper. It should be 1-2 sentences long and directly answer the question posed in your assignment. A thesis should take a specific stance on the topic, and not just a vague summary.To write a thesis statement, try starting by posing a question about your subject. Once you have answered the question, turn this into a declarative statement. For example: ""Due to his persecution of the Native people, Christopher Columbus should not be honored as a hero by history.""
Make sure to place your thesis very early in your paper, usually in the introductory paragraph.

, An outline is key to making sure that your paper is organized and well-structured. Before you begin writing the actual paper, get an outline down on paper. Make sure it is thorough and detailed. Your outline should include your thesis statement, and indicate the subject for each of your body paragraphs.Include references to your sources in your outline. This way, you will not have to hunt for your citations during the writing process.

, Each paragraph in your paper should directly relate to your thesis. If the paragraph does not in some way support your argument, it does not belong in your paper. Each body paragraph should include a topic sentence and specific examples that support that topic sentence.Make sure to use transitions between each paragraph, so that your reader clearly understands when you are moving to a new topic.
Some examples of transition words are: ""similarly"", ""on the other hand"", or ""meanwhile""., It may seem backward, but it's usually a good idea to write your introduction (but not your thesis) last. This way, you know exactly how your argument has developed throughout the essay and you can use the introduction to preview this development. Your introduction is important to get right because it lets your reader know your topic and what your stance on the matter is.Make sure that your introduction serves as a road map for the rest of your paper. It should clearly indicate to your reader where you are headed.
Try using an interesting anecdote or controversial quote to pique your reader's interest. Your introduction should be both informative and entertaining.

, Citations give credit to ideas or statistics or words that are not wholly your own. You must give credit to any idea or concept that you did not create. You also need to cite statistics and direct facts. If you are not sure whether you need to cite a piece of information, go ahead and include a reference, just to be on the safe side.Your assignment guidelines should indicate which citation style you should follow. Some common forms are APA, MLA, and Chicago. If you don't know which one to use, ask your instructor or a classmate.
Once you know which system to use, make sure to familiarize yourself with the rules for that specific style. Guides are available online.

"
"
Edit carefully.,
Read it out loud.,
Get some rest.,
Review the guidelines.",How to Write a Paper That Is Due Tomorrow3," Once you have a draft, you need to start the revision process. First, check your content. Make sure that your ideas are clearly explained and that you have used appropriate word choices in each paragraph. Ensure that your essay flows together in a logical order, rather than feeling jumbled or thrown together.


Next, check for spelling and grammatical errors. You'll need to correct them, as mechanical errors will greatly detract from your reader's ability to trust you as an authority on your subject. Make sure that your spell check is also set to check grammar and style., Reading your paper out loud can help you catch errors that you may have missed by reading silently. When you hear the words spoken, you are more likely to notice any awkward phrasing. This is a great method to use when editing any paper., By now, you are probably pretty tired. It's a good idea to get some rest (sleep, if possible) before you give your paper a final look. Rest will help your brain recharge and your focus will be more clear. If you don't have time for a nap, take a few minutes to just rest your eyes. Your body and your mind need to recharge.

, After you've rested, it is time to give your paper one final look. Make sure that you have completed all of the required components. Now you can hand your paper in with confidence.

"
Review the late policy in the syllabus.,
Contact your professor and ask for an extension.,
Be honest.,
Follow-up with your professor.",How to Write a Paper That Is Due Tomorrow4," The syllabus contains all of the important information for the course, including your professor's policy on late papers. If you professor accepts late work, it is possible that you could actually be better off handing in your paper a day or two late. For example, a 5% or 10% deduction on your grade might actually be better than the grade you could earn from handing in a hastily written or poorly researched paper., If you determine that it would be better to accept a late penalty, your next step is to reach out to your instructor. Send a polite, professional e-mail to your professor. Explain your circumstances, and be honest.


Make your request as clear as possible. Try saying something such as: ""Dear Professor Smith, My name is Bill Brown and I am a student in your Psych 101 class, which meets on Tuesdays at 1:00 p.m. I am writing to you about the paper due September 30 at 5:00 p.m. As I am looking over the assignment, I realize that I have not allowed myself enough time to properly complete the paper. It is important to me that I perform well in your class. I am requesting an extension of the due date. May I please turn in my paper on October 3 by 1:00? Thank you for your consideration.""

, Do not try to make up an excuse when asking for a deadline. Your professor is likely very intelligent, and she is also a human being capable of understanding problems. She will probably see through an excuse, but if you're honest, that will work in your favor. She will appreciate that you are being proactive and truthful.Nearly all schools, colleges, and universities count lying to a professor as a type of academic dishonesty, which can come with hefty penalties or might even get you expelled. Do not lie to your teacher.

, When your professor responds to your e-mail, make sure to thank them for their reply--even if it wasn't what you want to hear. If your request for an extension was granted, make sure to note that when you turn in the paper.


Include a brief note reminding the professor that she granted you an extension, so that she is not wondering why she has a stray paper stuck underneath her office door.

"
Pick your topic and angle.,
Get your facts straight.,
Keep it user-friendly.",How to Write a Notable Editorial1," Editorials are meant to influence public opinion, promote critical thinking, and sometimes cause people to take action on an issue. Your topic should be current, interesting, and have a purpose. There are generally four types of editorials:



Explaining or interpreting: This format is used to explain how and why a newspaper or magazine took a certain stance on a controversial subject.

Criticizing: This format criticizes actions or decisions made on a third party's part in addition to offering a better solution. It's more to get the readers to see that there is a larger problem at hand.

Persuading: This type is used to move the reader to action, concentrating on solutions, not the problem.

Praising: This format is used to show support for people and organizations in the community that have done something notable.;
, An editorial is a mix of fact and opinion; not solely the writer's opinion, but the opinion of the entire staff. Your fact collection should include objective reporting and research.


A good op-ed needs to contain at least one ""point of enlightenment"" which can be described as ""an observation that is fresh and original.""So, get your facts from a number of different sources, pointing out patterns, impending consequences, or a hole in current analysis.

, Typically, editorials are for a fairly quick, captivating read. They are not meant to go on for pages and pages, belaboring the point. Nor are they meant to make the average Joe feel as if he's missed something. Make sure your editorial isn't lengthy or overly esoteric.


Keep it to about 600-800 words.Anything longer and you risk losing your reader. A short, snappy, fiery piece is much more captivating than a wordy lecture.
Eliminate the jargon. Your audience is reading your article for information on something they seek to understand; using technical terms or specific jargon may be off-putting and make your article difficult to take in. Keep the lowest common denominator in mind.

Open a new blank document.,
Set the margins to one inch.,
Set the font to Times New Roman and set the size to 12-point.,
Select the ""format"" tab.,
Add a header to the document.,
Make your heading.,
The title of your paper should be at the top of the essay, centered in the middle, with the font set the same as the rest: Times New Roman, 12 point, that's it.,
When mentioning other works in your paper, adhere to the following:


Novels, movies, television shows, plays or other major works should be italicized with the first letter capitalized.,
When integrating a quote in your essay, follow three main steps:


Introduce it.,
If you have written papers in MLA format before, click on the ""print preview"" button and look at the view it gives you here.",How to Write a Paper for School in MLA Format,";
,


If you are in middle school, you are probably somewhat new to MLA format, but you should be able to figure this out by clicking on such tabs as ""view,"" ""format,"" ""layout,"" or simply the ruler at the top of the document, if you have that feature enabled.

,


On older versions of Microsoft Word, you may not have to change the font or size, as Times New Roman 12-point is often the default for 2003 or older.
On newer versions, the defaults are different. In 2005, the default size is 11. On 2007, the default is Calibri 11. Always check the settings.

, On 2007, click the expand button under paragraph. On 2005 or older, click on paragraph. The dialogue boxes that result from these actions are similar. Set the spacing to ""double."" Most teachers prefer double spacing no matter what format you write in, because it allows them to make corrections or comments.

,


The header should be justified to the far right. Type your last name and then add page numbers to the header. You may now escape from your header.
It is no longer necessary to put page numbers on the bottom, where they often interfere with text.

, Your heading should consist of:


Your full name (first and last, don't use nicknames)
Your teacher's name
Your subject and class, and possibly also grade, as needed (period 1, the name of the class with your class color if the teacher color codes their classes, etc.)
The date.

The date is most commonly written in the day, month, year format.

, Do not bold, underline, italicize, highlight or otherwise make your title stand out.

,
Poems, short stories, episodes of television shows, periodicals or other lesser works should be in ""quotations"" with the first letter capitalized.

, Say something like, ""As the author admits..."" to literally introduce another person's words into your writing.
Insert and document it. It should be in quotation marks, but DO NOT put a period inside the quotation marks to end it. Just put the quotations.

Then document it. The author's last name and page number should be in parentheses, without punctuation between the two.


Finally, analyze it. Why is it important to your point? How does it prove what you want to say? What information can you draw from it?

Start your editorial with a thesis-like statement.,
Lead with an objective explanation of the issue.,
Present the opposing argument first.,
Present your reasons/evidence that directly refute the opposition.,
Make your solution known.,
Conclude your editorial with a punch.,
Proofread your work.",How to Write a Notable Editorial2," The introduction--the first one or two paragraphs--should be designed to catch the reader's attention. You can start with a rich question, a quote, or you can summarize what the whole editorial is about.


Clearly state your argument. The rest of your editorial will be based on supporting this opinion. Make it as striking as possible. However, in doing so, never use ""I""--it diminishes the strength and credibility of the paper and sounds rather informal.

, The body of your work should explain the issue objectively, as a reporter would, and tell why this situation is important to the reader or community as a whole.Include who, what, when, where, why, and how. Cover all your bases and pull in facts or quotations from relevant sources. This ensures that every reader has at least a base knowledge (and an non-skewed one) of the topic at hand.

, Make sure to identify the groups who oppose you or else the movers of the debate will become foggy. State their opinions objectively, using accurate facts or quotations. Never use slander.


It is fine to state positive things about the opposing side, if they are factual. It shows that you are taking the moral high road and giving a balanced overview. If you neglect to air the good side of your opposition, your editorial will come off biased and uninformed.
Give the opposition an actual argument, and a strong one at that. You gain nothing from refuting a non-issue. Make it clear their beliefs and what they're advocating.

, Begin this section with a transition, clearly flowing from their argument to yours. Utilize facts and quotations from others who support your opinion.


Start with strong reasons that only get stronger. Don't feel limited to existing opinions--add your own, too. Whatever your reasons are, make sure to clearly come down on one side of the argument; there is no room for gray area here.
Literary allusions are appropriate. It can lend to your credibility and learnedness.Call to mind images of persons or times in the past that present an imagery to your reader.

, This is different than reasons and evidence. If you believe cutting the defense budget is wrong, what would you rather cut instead? Putting your solution out there is imperative to addressing the problem. If you don't have one, any solution is better than yours.


Your solution needs to be clear, rational, and doable. It cannot only work in a vacuum. What's more, it should be compelling. Ideally, your readers will be drawn to action with the information and answers you've presented.

, A note-worthy statement would forever engrave the editorial into the reader's mind. Use quotes or a question that would make the readers think hard. (e.g. If we will not take care of the environment, then who will?)


End with a hard-hitting summary; you may have a few readers who scanned your piece absent-mindedly. All in all, your audience should leave feeling more informed and moved to do something further about the issue.

, A great piece is not great if it's riddled with spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Have someone on your team look over your work; two minds are always better than one.


If you're working as part of an organization, make sure you haven't misrepresented their viewpoints. Allow your group to go over the piece to make sure everyone (at the very least, the majority) is behind the arguments you're about to make public. They can, simultaneously, present questions or ideas that you may have missed or glossed over.

Make a list.,
Discuss a pivotal point.,
Make it relevant.,
Choose a common theme, if you're stuck.,
Avoid being too sentimental.,
Avoid controversial topics.,
Read sample statements.",How to Write a Personal Statement for Medical School1," Write down all your hobbies, volunteer projects, classes you've taken, and similar experiences. Think about your experiences with each, and come up with several different options before choosing one to write about.When brainstorming, write down every idea you have – even if it seems silly at the time. Sometimes those odd thoughts can inspire a great idea.;
, Find a moment when you had to make a choice. Explain why you made that decision, and why your choice illustrates the kind of person you are, or want to be., Choose an incident or a period in your life that explains why you want to go into medicine. You could describe the person who inspired you to become a doctor, or talk about the specific moment when you decided to become one., If you don't have an original theme that you really want to work with, it's okay to go with the tried and true. Many medical school personal statements are based three common themes. Then flesh out your essay with original details that are specific to you – you can't afford to be boring.Why you want to be a doctor
Why you are an extraordinary person
Why you are completely qualified (for medical school, or for the medical profession)

, Avoid overly personal topics such as a romantic breakup, your parents' divorce, or a relative's illness. Choose a subject you can discuss openly without resorting to melodrama or cliché.Your essay does not need to be really heavy and serious, or describe an event that few people have experienced.
The central theme of your essay can be light. It just needs to illustrate the points you are trying to get across.Avoid discussing the death of a beloved grandparent who was a doctor. Instead, explain how you were inspired by interactions with their patients during a summer internship at their office.
Avoid discussing how you dressed up in scrubs for Halloween in 3rd grade – your early childhood dreams have little bearing on whether you are right for medical school, now. Instead, you might talk about how you learned the value of hard work and attention to detail by restoring a boat with your father last summer.

, Since you don't know exactly who will be reading your essay, or what their personal politics or beliefs may be, it's best to stick to neutral topics. If you do mention something that is potentially controversial, make sure your tone is neutral and you aren't being preachy or judgemental.Avoid discussing politics or religion, because you don't know the views of the person who will be reading your essay.
Try to avoid any subject that commonly makes people angry or defensive.

, If you need inspiration, there are many sources online that have sample statements you can look at. Just be sure your statement is your own work, and isn't too similar to something you've read."

Choose how you are going to write these notes.,
Be consistent with whatever method you chose from Step 1 above.,
Keep your note system with you wherever you go.,
Write your reminder, idea, thought, et cetera down as soon as you have it.,
Store the notes to yourself in a safe place.",How to Write a Note1," You have a wealth of options for writing yourself a note. You will have to decide what method works best for you to help yourself remember things.


You could choose the traditional pen-and-paper method: Options here include sticky notes, a small notepad, an agenda, a journal, a diary, or a spiral-bound notebook.
Alternatively, you could choose a technological method: You can try the Sticky Notes program on Windows, a notepad app on your smartphone, a reminder app on your smartphone, or your preferred online calendar, such as Google Calendar or iCal.;
, Some people find it a challenge to use one method only for notes and reminders. The problem here is that too many systems for writing yourself reminder notes gets messy and confusing.


When you need a particular note to help you remember something, you will likely have no idea where it is if you use sticky notes, a calendar, a journal, and an app on your smartphone, as an example.
There is no way to organize your notes to yourself when you use many different systems. You might have the urge to write something down when it is inconvenient to do so using the system you normally use for that type of thought (e.g. you always write recipe ideas down in your journal, but you get an idea when you are not at home).
Your reminders and notes are simply more likely to get lost when lots of systems are involved. That may not always mean physically lost; it could also mean mentally lost (i.e. forgotten).

, This is easy if you choose a technological system using your smartphone, because most people have their smartphones on them at all times. However, if you choose a pen-and-paper method, figure out how to have that with you at all times.


When the urge strikes to write down a note to yourself, you have the tool you need to do so handy.
Your notes will stay organized all in one place if you always have that tool with you.

, Now, “write” could be figurative here, if you choose a technological method, in which case you would type it.


Writing it down immediately ensures you will not lose that thought.
If you chose an option like sticky notes, be sure that you keep the sticky note in a safe place until you can put it wherever you choose to safely store them, if you are not near that place.
You do not necessarily need to use complete sentences when writing a note, as long as you are confident that you will know what you meant when you come back to look at it later.

, Just as it is important to only have one system to writing yourself notes, it is just as important to keep all of your notes to yourself in a safe place.


If you keep notes to yourself on your smartphone or computer, they will always be there. However, if you choose to use a word processing program for writing notes to yourself, remember to save the documents.
You might want to keep all of your notes to yourself in something like a journal or diary. Always have that with you or know where it is so that you can access it when you need it.
Keeping your notes on or near your desk is usually a pretty good idea, as that is one place you likely spend much of your day.
Sticky notes work really well for some people, but they get messy quick. They also lose their stickiness eventually, causing them to fall from wherever you stuck them and potentially get lost. Keep this in mind if you use sticky notes!

Use active voice and clear language.,
Consider your audience.,
Grab your readers' attention right away.,
Show, don't tell.,
Avoid jargon.,
Avoid being overly modest.,
Don't hold back.,
Avoid making excuses.,
Avoid opening with a quote.,
Avoid clichés.",How to Write a Personal Statement for Medical School2," You are trying to show the school who you really are, so try to use a natural tone when writing.Use the active voice as much as possible.
Don't be too casual. This is a professional academic paper, not creative writing.
Don't be too stilted. When you're finished writing, go through and change any words you've chosen that you wouldn't ordinarily use.

, When writing, bear in mind that many people will probably read your personal statement. Medical school admission decisions are usually determined by a board or committee made up of professors, school administrators, and local doctors. Imagine your essay as seen through their eyes., The person reading your personal statement will probably be reading dozens of others in the same day. Be sure yours stands out from the crowd and gets noticed.Imagine you are advertising yourself. List all your “selling points.”
Put the most impressive information at the beginning.

, Personal statements are best when you include concrete actions rather than abstract descriptions. Instead of describing your personal moral code, give an example of a specific incident when you acted on principle.Think of the “interest equation” when writing: personal experience + specific details = interesting., Resist the urge to show off the medical knowledge you have already acquired by using technical terms. Not everyone reading and judging your essay will be a medical professional., If you don't like to boast, or feel uncomfortable talking about yourself, you'll need to put aside those feelings. The whole point of the exercise is to make yourself look good.This can be tricky, but you need to find the right balance between confidence and humility. You don't want to come across as boastful or arrogant.

, Your statement needs to be an expression of who you are – how your mind works and what you believe in. Be as honest as you can in your statement, so you will expose your true character., Unless there is something on your permanent record that you feel requires an explanation, avoid making excuses in your essay. Play to your strengths, don't point out your inadequacies., Resist the urge to begin your essay with a quote from your favorite author or scientist – it will just sound pretentious. The admissions board wants to hear what you have to say, not what a famous person had to say., When writing your essay, avoid using overused phrases that sound trite. This comes across as lazy writing and poor use of language.Common clichés include: “a clean slate,” “a thirst for knowledge,” “go the extra mile,” “as luck would have it,” and “it goes without saying.” If you aren't sure if something is cliché, it's best to avoid it.

Understand the purpose of the personal essay.,
Follow instructions to the letter.,
Use standard formatting.,
Think about your interview.,
Prepare to defend it.,
Get feedback.",How to Write a Personal Statement for Medical School3," Schools are looking for very specific things when they read your personal statement. Make sure your submission succeeds in illustrating the qualities the advisory committee is looking for.Proven achievements
Critical and analytical thinking skills
Language and writing skills appropriate to this level of education
Evidence that you'll be a successful medical student
Evidence that you'll be a good doctor

, Each school has its own requirements for writing your personal statement. Find out what they are, and follow them to the letter. Ignoring even a small detail will make you appear careless and unprofessional, and therefore a poor candidate for medical school.Be sure your essay is the appropriate length by using the “Word Count” function in your word processing program.
If you are applying through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), there is a 5,300 character maximum limit. This is about one and a half pages, single spaced., If the school lists specific formatting guidelines, use those. Otherwise, you can use standard formatting to create an essay that is easy to read on the page.Type your statement single-spaced. Double space between paragraphs.
Leave at least 1” margins on both sides, top, and bottom.
Use a 12 pt. standard font such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.
At the top of the page, center the title of your essay if you have one, or simply type “Personal Statement.” You can also include your name, if you wish.

, If your essay impresses the board, the next step will most likely be a personal interview. Since you will probably be asked to discuss your essay, be sure you've written about things you will want to talk about during the interview., Go through your essay, and be certain you can defend every point. Try not to exaggerate your accomplishments, and don't pad your statement with fictional details. The school may verify the information you provide, especially if your essay seems too good to be true. If you're caught in a lie, you will definitely not be admitted., When you finish your final draft, ask a few people to read your essay and give you their honest assessment. Ask a favorite professor, a current medical student, or your doctor.Don't ask too many people to read it, or you may end up with too many conflicting opinions.

Decide how you will leave notes for someone else, like a significant other, parent, sibling, or friend.,
Clarify what your note is about.,
Leave the note in an easy-to-find place.,
Follow up with the recipient to make sure he/she received it.",How to Write a Note2," These will likely be quick notes that you use to remind them of something or to give a brief message.


Using a technological tool for leaving notes likely will not work when trying to leave a note for someone else, so it is best to choose a pen-and-paper method.
Always have something ready for writing notes, like a small notepad, sticky notes, or some scrap paper.

, As you write the note, be sure to stick to your reminder or message.


Keep it short and simple. It does not necessarily have to be written in complete sentences, but make sure the recipient will understand what it means.
Avoid getting off-topic, especially if it is a reminder note. The recipient may get confused about what you are asking him/her to do if you get off-topic.
Adding a time and/or date to the note will help if it is time-sensitive. This will help the recipient understand when you left the note and how much time he/she has remaining to take care of the task.

, This seems like a common sense suggestion, but sometimes, notes are left in inconvenient places and are never found. Here are some common helpful suggestions.


On the refrigerator or freezer door
On the kitchen counter
On the dining table
On the bathroom counter
In his/her lunchbox
On his/her desk
On the seat of his/her car

, Simply leaving the note is not enough to make sure that your recipient will receive it. You want to follow up with him/her to verify.


If he/she follows up with you first, then there is no need to ask about it again, unless you asked him/her to complete some sort of task that you want to ensure got completed.
Be polite and friendly without being pushy. Asking, “Did you see my note this morning? I hope I left it in a convenient place for you” or “Do you have any questions about my note?” are some examples.

Compose your sympathy message.,
Conclude your note with a closing.,
Prepare the envelope for mailing.",How to Write a Note3," It can be a plain card, or it can have an appropriate design, if you choose.

Your card can be small or large; your note will only be a couple of sentences, so make sure it is at least big enough to fit those.

, There are a variety of situations that require a sympathy note, but the point of a sympathy note is always to express your condolences. It should be no more than 2-3 sentences in length.


“I am sorry for your loss. I send my condolences to you and your family in this difficult time.”
“I want you to know that I am thinking about you while you work through this challenging time. Please let me know what I can do to help you.”
“I know that this was unexpected, and I am here for you however you need me.”
“You might not feel like it right now, but you are strong, and you will get through this.”
“You are not alone. You have many relatives and friends who are ready to support you and help you get through this.”

Visit the doctor.",How to Talk About Daily Stress with Your Partner," You might be the kind of person who likes to talk as soon as you get home, but you should recognize that not all people are like that. Consider your partner’s communication style and how chatty or not chatty they are after work. Identify a time to talk that will work best for the two of you.For instance, perhaps during dinner or an hour after you both get home will work best.;
, Before you begin talking, ensure that you are able to be fully present. Avoid watching television or using your phone during this time. Don’t have these daily talks around the time that you will have to give the kids a bath or when your partner is responding to emails., Remember to keep on topic for the duration of your talk. Use this time to talk about the stress you are having apart from your marriage. Talk about work, the kids, or your friends. Work to actively not make this time about the issues that you two are having and recognize that your partner has a life and identity separate from you., Once you are ready to begin having these conversations, approach your partner. You might want to approach it casually by saying something like “Hey honey, wanna talk about how work was today?” This simple question can open the floor for a larger conversation about stress., Talk to your partner about your own stressors of the day. Be honest and open with your partner about how you feel. Talk about any stress or frustrations that have cropped up in your day.


Say “My day at work was rough. My boss changed my deadline on a project from next week to this Wednesday so now I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.”

, Another good way to open up the conversation about your mutual stress is to rate yourselves from 1 to 10 based on how stressed you are. A score of 10 can constitute as the most stressed, and a 1 can be the least stressed.Say something like “Yeah babe, I’m at a 5 today. It wasn’t so bad. What’s your score?”

, Actively listen to them about their stress. Avoid interrupting or interjecting. Comfort them in their stress and avoid trying to solve their problems until they ask for advice.Try repeating back to them what they said to indicate that you are listening. Try something like “So it sounds like your boss is targeting you for that one time that you were late.”

, Try to set a limit on how long you are discussing stress. Consider taking one hour to do so. Know also that it is good to talk about your frustration, but don’t only talk about stress. Find some time to also talk about successes and any fun that you have had during the day.


For instance, perhaps your partner has recently received a promotion at work. Take some time to celebrate together.

, Continue to keep updated on each other outside of just discussing stressors. Talk to your partner about their hopes for the future, any goals they might have, vacations the two of you would like to take together, or just any items of interest in general like a new book they are reading.


For instance, you might begin the conversation by saying “Do you think you’ll want to stay at this job for a few more years?”

, Work together to create a list of things that you can do together to work through your frustrations. Perhaps you and your partner enjoy cooking, reading, or watching a particular show. Make some time to do those things together.Consider exercising together as well.

, See if your partner needs any help at all from you with anything. Maybe the kids have been acting up at home while you are away or need more help with their homework. Step in more and help take some stress off of your partner if you can. See if they can also help take some stress from you., Continue to show affection to your partner and do kind things for them. Pick up their drycleaning or do the dishes after dinner. Bring home food so they don’t have to cook. Make sure that you are keeping up with your own responsibilities around the house so your partner doesn’t have to pick up the slack

, Though it is important to help your partner, it is also important that you receive help, too. If you need a little help around the house, are looking for advice, or need help with a project, ask your partner. Allow yourselves to become closer through mutual kindness and thoughtfulness.


For instance, you might say “Can you pick up the kids from school this week? I need a bit more time at the office to work on my presentation.”

, If your stress becomes beyond what you can control, consider visiting a doctor. Perhaps your stress as work is so intense that it is raising your blood pressure. In addition to medical treatment, try to employ other tactics like deep breathing or taking some vacation time to destress.

Be patient.",How to Talk Dirty to a Guy," How comfortable is he with physical affection and romantic touching? How does he behave when you fool around? Is he fairly conservative, or does he love trying new things? What sort of language does he use in everyday life — is he okay with cussing?


What you say while talking dirty will depend largely upon your partner’s personality — if he’s very conservative and/or doesn’t like swearing, you’ll want to be subtle.
For example, instead of saying “You look so hot right now, I can’t wait to get you alone,” you could say “Looking good!” and then give him a quick flirty kiss on the lips or — if he’s not into public displays of affection (PDAs) — on the cheek.;
, Get a sense of how open to dirty talk he is but starting with things that aren’t overtly sexual. Dirty talk doesn’t have to be filthy. It can be as tame as texting him, “I can’t stop thinking about last night ;)” the day after you’ve fooled around.


You can even start with simply complimenting him more, for example, saying things like “That shirt looks great on you” or “I like that dimple there, that shows when you smile.”

, Many couples aren’t physically affectionate outside of the bedroom. By touching him more often, you might be able to increase his desire and make him feel more comfortable with you and, as a result, open to trying new things., If your partner is open to it, talk to him about what you’d like to try. Be respectful with what you say. Most importantly, never talk about making out right after you’ve done it, as this could make him associate your physical romance with having serious talks.Example: “I love/really like/enjoy being with/etc. you, and I’d like to feel more connected to you. I was thinking maybe we could experiment a bit with talking dirty to each other.”You could even be more casual, and just say “What do you think about dirty talk?” You could say this while washing dishes together, making dinner, going for a walk — just NOT in the bedroom or after you’ve made out!

, If you’re finding it very difficult to bring up dirty talk, you might consider getting a book on it and bookmarking some of the pages. You could even tell your guy that you feel embarrassed talking about it, so instead you’re showing him what you want to talk about with a book., It may feel really silly, but practising the phrases you'd like to say to him might help you feel more comfortable with saying them when you’re actually with him.If you aren’t comfortable talking dirty when you’re by yourself, you can also just practise being more vocal in everyday life — for example, if you eat something delicious, let out a little sigh of delight, or when he kisses you, make a happy little “Mmm” sound.

, What you say and how you say it will depend on the result you’re hoping to achieve.


If you’re away from each other — perhaps both at school or work — and you just want to tease him a little, you could send him a text like, “I can’t stop thinking about how good you looked this morning/last night/etc.”
If you’re making out and he does something that you like, you could say “I love it when you do that.”

, Whether paying a compliment, sending dirty texts, or talking dirty in bed, make sure that you mean what you say. Done right, talking dirty can improve intimacy and strengthen your relationship. Faking it will do the opposite.

, Don't bust out an R-rated text in the middle of a conversation about his family, dead dog, or otherwise inappropriate topic. If you want to initiate dirty texts, do it tastefully. Start off with something like ""I wish you were,"" or ""I wish I could be with you right now.""


The key is to give him a chance to reciprocate before getting into the racier stuff.

, It may be the 21st century, but bad grammar will never be sexy (i.e. ""I want u 2…""). If you have something good to say, spend the extra couple seconds it takes to spell it out completely.

, Once you’ve established that he's into dirty texts, you can get dirtier and more explicit. If you're unsure of what level to take it to, take small steps and parallel what he does.


Ending flirty texts with a winking emoticon ( ;) ) is common practice.If he doesn’t respond in kind to your text, it might be that he really doesn't get the hint, but it also might be that he doesn't want to go there. You’ll need to gauge his response based on what you know about him. It might even be that he’s acting like he doesn’t get the hint just to be funny. Example:

You: “I’m excited for dinner but part of me just wants to skip straight to ‘dessert’ ;)”
Him: “Yeah! The restaurant has the best fudge brownie sundaes!”
You: “Hehe well I’m excited for those too — but that wasn’t really the ‘dessert’ I meant :P” or if you’re really unsure, you could just respond with “:P” which is vague enough that it should give him the hint you meant something else, but not completely confirm it (lest it makes him uncomfortable).



, What you send will depend on the relationship — it could be anything from a cute picture of you smiling to something that shows more skin.


Try sending him a photo striptease: send a photo of yourself looking naughty with your clothes on, then photos of articles of your clothing (your shirt, your pants, etc.) as you take them off. Don’t send him a pic of yourself naked — let him imagine that!, Never assume that your private photos will be kept private. If you are concerned at all about everyone seeing you in compromising positions, don’t take the photos. At the very least, consider leaving your face out of the photos.


Contrary to popular belief, Snapchat is NOT a safe way to send sexy pictures of yourself. Apps exist that make it possible to permanently save Snapchat photos.
Even if you completely trust your partner and believe that you will never break up, understand that if something goes wrong in the relationship, you might not be able to get those pictures back, and you won’t have control over who sees them — it’s possible that he could share them with others. It’s not fair, and ultimately it’s not your fault, but it’s a reality that you need to acknowledge.

, Not only will you run the risk of getting caught in the act, it is also completely inappropriate. Keep in mind that some companies use keystroke loggers or other modes of surveillance to monitor productivity.

, If things are just getting started, it might feel unnatural to break out the dirty talk right away. If you don’t already do it, try moaning and sighing more while making out to express how good he makes you feel.


If you’re uncomfortable with moaning or you’re not sure how it should sound, start paying attention to the sounds you make on a regular basis — for example, maybe you let out an “Mmmm” or a little happy sigh when you eat something delicious. That can work in romantic situations, too!

, If you are normally on the quiet side when you’re making out, you probably aren't ready for full-on sentences yet. Start off with just one or two words at a time to show him you're enjoying yourself.


Examples: “yes,” “that’s nice,” “oh god” (if you’re religious, you could say “oh my gosh” instead).

, How you say things is as important as what you say — for example, if you say “I love that” in a bored, monotone voice, it probably won’t sound sincere to your guy. Speaking in a breathy or lower pitch can help you sound a bit sexier. Whispering things in his ear is also nice!


There is no need to cuss when engaging in dirty talk, so if you're really not comfortable with swearing, just don’t do it! “You’re so #@$!-ing hot"" can be just as affective as “You’re so hot.”
If you decide to speak in a lower pitch, be sure not to go too low — you don’t want to sound like your possessed!

, Instead of saying “do you like it when I XYZ?” (XYZ meaning “fill in the blanks”) or “do you want me to XYZ?” do something and then ask him if he likes it.

, Men have a lot of pride when it comes to romance. If he does something in bed that you enjoy, then say so. It will not only make him feel good, but will also encourage him to do it again in the future.


Examples: “yeah, just like that”, “that feels amazing/so good”If you want him to do something but are too afraid to ask, say ""I love it when you XYZ.”

, Knowing that you're enjoying yourself will make him enjoy himself even more than he already is. Examples of what to say:


“I’ve been craving this all day.”
“I’m so crazy about you.”

, Want to send him over the edge? In a poll conducted by Cosmo magazine, men voted that the #1 hottest thing to say in bed is ""I'm coming.""Men love hearing this because a) it boosts their pride; b) it turns them on to know you’re going to come; and c) it lets them know that they can stop holding back and come too.


Be sure that you’re actually coming before you say these words. If you say it when you don’t mean it, you’re not only lying to him, but if he comes as a result of it, you might end up stopping (or at the very least pausing) your make-out session!

, If moaning doesn’t feel natural to you, it might be tempting to act how you think you should feel instead of how you actually feel; this can lead to over-acting. You don’t need to scream or gasp or be otherwise over the top to show how excited you are — doing so might even make you sound fake.

, If he enjoys what you’re doing, he’ll likely moan or tremble lightly, or even stop for a moment to collect himself before continuing to make out with you.


If your partner is uncomfortable with what you say, he might also stop, but for different reasons, and it will likely be clear just from his body language — pulling away from you, not smiling, losing his hardness.
If you two are able to communicate easily, he will likely just let you know verbally that he didn’t like what you said.

, Figuring out exactly what to say when talking dirty to your guy could take some time. As you try out more words and phrases, you’ll discover what works and what doesn’t.


While moaning, sighing, and words like “oh god” and “yes” are generally well received, more extreme phrases (ex., phrases using swear words or explicitly describing sex acts) could make him uncomfortable.
With open communication and attention to his body language, the two of you will figure out what works!

Obtain at least 6-8 pages of double-sided lined/writing paper.,
Choose a time and location when and where you will write your short story.,
Start writing!,
Choose which days to write.,
Bend some rules if you want to.,

Finish your story.",How to Write a One‐Sentence‐a‐Day Short Story," This is just what you'll write your story on, so it's suggested to purchase a journal, planner, or binder in order to keep your writing safe. Some people may prefer to write in a digital format, but since part of the goal of this activity is to write just one sentence a day, without editing or changing your direction from past days, writing on paper is preferable in many ways, so you're not tempted to change past sentences.

Pick paper or a notebook that you'll be able to keep safe and whole for several weeks or months, and that has plenty of room for a complete story.;
, Ideally, this should be a place that you spend time in every day and a time that will allow you to think about your sentence without anxiety. Here is where you'll write each sentence every day. The place does not have to be poignant or significant to you personally (in fact, some of the best writing is done in the drabbest and boring of places). However, it often helps to pick a place and stick to it, so writing a sentence a day becomes part of your routine.

On the Subway in the morning or afternoon.
During a slow class. (If you choose to write during class, make sure that being distracted with the project won't hurt you academically, and be subtle enough to where you aren't being disrespectful or obtrusive to the class.)
During a free period, tutorial, break, or independent study.
At a coffee shop or library that you go to frequently.

, You don't need to have a plot, layout, or big-picture idea of the story, just an idea to go off of each day.

For instance: One day, a person dies and discovers that life is heaven, and the afterlife is hell (and everyone's clamoring to get inside a soul to live again). Do you have a sentence? Great! Write it down, and close the book for tomorrow and carry on with your day!

, Here are examples of days you should consider not writing:

The weekend: If you aren't going to the location (school, work, the subway, etc.), you may not want to write that day. It is paramount that you confine your writing to your schedule, or everything will fall apart.
If you feel ennui: Feeling bored is natural, and may facilitate the writing process. However, if you feel a meaninglessness of life or overwhelming negative emotions, it's likely not a good time to write. While taking your pains out on your story may seem like it'll spice it up, more than often, you derail the story or make it too personal.
If unable to function creatively: Hemingway didn't sip down those ""Death in the Afternoons"" before writing his stories, only after (to quell his roaring feelings of despair). Similarly, if you're feeling too anxious or tired, your sentences will suck.

, More than halfway done with your story? Feeling stuck and need to switch it up? It might be time to get creative with the approach:

Write more than one sentence a day.
Write really, really, really long sentences.
See fragments and participles as viable sentences.
Write under distress or extreme emotion.
Quote random books, articles, images, or real-life dialogue.
Change the perspective: Get meta! Write from the perspective of the writer, or from an omniscient god-like figure, or maybe even a cat (Virginia Woolf often wrote from different perspectives, and with the ""stream of consciousness"").
Write using surrealist qualities.
Write in an ergodic style. Use the format of writing to convey or communicate some idea outside the range of literature, or just confuse the heck out of your audience.
Switch the protagonist for the antagonist.
Do anything that you want!

, It will probably take 6-7 months. Look back in glee at the amazing literature that you have created. You can choose to edit your piece or leave it raw.

Pros of editing: You refine the story in order to fix glaring grammatical mistakes, omit superfluous sentences, repair the structure, or use better quality diction.
Cons of editing: The story will not be entirely truthful to you or your readers because you will have fixed it in post.

Keep your cool.,
Request a conversation with him/her in private during a social situation.,
Nip the behavior in the bud as soon as possible.,
Surround yourself with other mature couples.",How to Tactfully Ask Someone You Love to Stop Behaving Immaturely," You may want to lunge across the table and grab him/her by the shirt collar however in order to maintain some shred of dignity remain calm and let your maturity shine.


Make eye contact with your loved one and shake your head to say, “no.” The best way to intervene without outwardly calling your loved one out on the behavior is to gain eye contact and covertly shake your head and/or mouth the word “no.” Try to get his/her attention non verbally by locking eyes and looking sternly at your loved one. This may do the trick if he/she know the behavior is immature and bothers you.
Divert the conversation away from him/her. The minute you detect the behavior guide the conversation away from his/her behavior and onto a new topic--preferably one that does not provide an opportunity for your loved on to act like a child.
Ask others to bring up stories or lead the conversation. If your loved one is telling insane stories, making goofy faces or noises, turn to another person in the group and ask him/her about work, family or a topic that does not involve what your sweetheart may be doing.
Excuse yourself if you can’t take the heat. If you in the middle of a social situation and your loved one isn’t not getting the hint, walk away if you feel as though you are going to explode with anger. Letting loose in a group setting will only make you look like the crazy person, especially if others find your loved one to be funny or amusing.;
, The best way to diffuse immature behavior quickly is to pull your loved on aside to get him/her to refocus.


Quietly and calmly identify the inappropriate behavior and explain why it was a bad idea. Whether it was his/her barrage of sex jokes with your boss or making goofy faces at dinner, calmly ask him/her to stop the behavior because it is not only embarrassing you, but is calling negative attention toward him/her.
Don’t be condescending in your tone. Never treat your partner like a child (even though he/she may be acting like one) when requesting a behavior revision. Instead just say that the behavior may be detrimental to your (and his/her) reputation and bring negativity to the encounter.
Suggest an alternate way to act. Perhaps the immature behavior resulted from low self confidence and not being sure how to act at the moment. Instead of telling inappropriate jokes consider asking him/her to instead discuss a safe topic such as the reason for the social gathering or a new band or movie he/she liked.

, If you cannot pull your loved one aside during a social situation, address it in private at the next opportunity.


Find time to talk immediately following the social encounter either later that evening or the next day. Wait until you are alone and can talk in a calm, quiet setting. Avoid a crowded bar or restaurant as the topic you are attempting to address is delicate and can be misconstrued or prompt your loved one to become defensive.
Explain the position his/her behavior put you in during the situation. He/she needs to understand that even though he/she may not care how the behavior is perceived, the actions impact how others view you.
Ask what he/she hoped to achieve with the behavior. However, try to ask this question in a non-confrontational manner in order to avoid having him/her get defensive. Perhaps when the behavior is actually examined your loved one will see that even though he/she hoped to accomplish one thing, the result was something entirely different.

, If you hang out with a bunch of goofballs, chances are someone is going to continue the behavior into other situations. Although you may be looking for a more mature exchange remember that it doesn’t have to be super serious and grim--you can still have fun and some laughs without acting like a child.


Meet people with similar interests. One of the best ways to get your loved one to act more like him or herself is to hang out with people who share the same interests. For example, if you are animal lovers, consider meeting people at a dog park or sign up to volunteer at the local animal shelter.
Embark upon couple activities. Take a cooking class together or join a co-ed volleyball league. Find fun activities that allow you to unwind and be together but provide you with the opportunity to meet others at the same time.
Introduce him/her to some of your more mature (but fun) friends. If you have fun friends who don’t feel the need to launch into a routine filled with the sophomoric humor, make some introductions. Perhaps just being around more mature, but fun people may be helpful in showing your loved one a better way to approach a social situation.

,


What do they do or say that gets you every time? Once you know, you can protect yourself emotionally or take other measures to avoid being affected.
Do you need more people in your life? Are you lonely? Sometimes maybe all is is that you need more friends to fill your life with and have been looking to one person to fill that void.

, If you are trying to avoid romantic feelings, then you should avoid scenarios with potential romance.

, Don't hang out with them as much and limit your communication with them. If your situation forces you to interact with them, keep actions and conversations professional.

, Are they too clingy? Do they treat your friends poorly? Are they too secretive?

, This may sound silly, but if they dominate your daydreams, you've fallen for them. Try to do some extracurricular activity that keeps your mind busy. Sports or other clubs will help. Develop a passionate hobby, and pretty soon, that will be your only passion.

Let her know you like her.,
Introduce yourself, or say hello.,
Don’t avoid certain words.,
Pause between words.,
Ask her questions.,
Tell her about your stuttering.,
Make a statement about her.,
Build your self-confidence.",How to Talk to a Girl if You Have a Stutter1," If you’re so stressed about the possibility of stuttering, the girl you’re talking to might never know that you like her. Smile at her, and look her in the eyes. Making eye contact with a girl lets her know you want to know her better.Lean in closer to her when she’s talking. This will reassure her that you’re interested in what she has to say.
Tilt your head towards her. Look down every now and then, so that you can look back up at her face. Try not to look around the room, or over her head, as this will make it seem you’re more interested in finding someone better to talk to.;
, If you already know each other from school or work, you won’t have to introduce yourself like you would someone you’ve never met. Be confident and casual in your language, using words that don’t tend to cause stuttering problems. However, if you should stutter when saying your name or greeting her, don’t panic. Instead, move slowly through the word, taking all the time you need.Keep your words simple, relying on your body language to do most of the communication. Say something like, “Hi, I’m Joe. What’s your name?”
When she tells you her name, smile and repeat it. Even if her name starts with a letter that’s difficult for you to say, such as a P or a D, you can turn it to your advantage. After all, this is a good way to confidently introduce your stutter.

, Most stutterers are aware of certain sounds or words that are more likely to be blocked by a stutter. If you’re trying to talk to a girl, talk at your normal rate of speed. When you feel yourself like to stutter on a particular word, slow down. If the word doesn’t come, allow yourself to stutter gently and slowly.You’ll want to keep your lips, tongue and jaw moving gently, maintaining a sense of relaxation in your brain. Take all the time you need to get the word out.
The most important thing is not to panic. She’s not likely to mind your stutter if you don’t.

, Some speech therapists recommend that a stutterer pause briefly after the first word of a sentence, and then again every 2-5 words. This might sound unnatural, but the girl you’re talking to isn’t likely to notice if you’re confident about what you’re doing.Pausing happens naturally during speech anyway. For example, “This...is maybe the most...boring...class party ever.”
You can use eye contact along with your pauses, and finish the statement with a smile.

, You could ask questions about the situation you’re in together. For example, “What the name of that song that’s playing?” Or “What’s up with these snacks?” You can ask questions about her interests, such as, “I like your tee-shirt. Have you heard that band in concert?”You can ask more open-ended questions after an initial introduction, such as “What do you do for fun on the weekend?”
The more open-ended your question, the broader her response might be.

, Be honest and forthright. If you’re dreading stuttering in front of her, you’re more likely to get stuck in a stutter. You can talk about when you first began to stutter, and how it feels to stutter. You might want to tell her some of the interesting aspects of stuttering, such as the fact that about 1 in 100 people worldwide have a stutter; this fact remains the same regardless of culture.There are a lot of famous people who had persistent stammers into adulthood, including Charles Darwin, Isaac Newton, and Winston Churchill.
There is not a cure for stuttering, but over the years many entertaining treatments have been devised, including having people talk to the beat of a metronome or to draw an 8 with their finger as they talked. One famous “cure” had people eating carrots while they talked!

, Making an observation about her might spark a conversation between you. You could use this opportunity to pay her a compliment, or to bring up a shared interest.The hazards of paying a girl a compliment are that she might become flustered and not know what to say in response. Be prepared with follow-up question in case this happens.
For example, you might offer the statement, “You seem like you’re in a good mood today.” If she doesn’t respond, follow it up with an open-ended question, such as, “What did you think of that last song?”

, If you remember that your stutter doesn’t define who you are, you’re more likely to be able to bring a sense of self-confidence into a conversation with a girl. Try to remember that everybody has feelings of inadequacy at times, no matter how confident they may appear in public.Try identifying with others, rather than comparing yourself with them. After all, you can only see what they appear like on the outside - inside, they may be struggling with insecurities that you can’t see.
Feelings of self-consciousness interfere with your ability to engage confidently with a girl.

Prioritize.,

Stay in large groups.,
Don't let any one person take the number one spot in your life.",How to Stop Falling in Love2," Make a list of the things you value most in your life. If a 'significant other', or other similar moniker, is high on the list, move it farther down. Throw yourself passionately at the other things on the list. The less time you think about having someone by your side, the better.

, Simply be busy. Join a club, or start one. The less time you have in your schedule, the less likely you can make time for a single person.

, Unless you are alone, try to be with a large group of friends or family. It is easier to fall in love when you are singled out with one other person.

, Love yourself more than anyone else if you need to. Spoil yourself every once in while. Take your best friend out or take your younger nieces and nephews to an amusement park.

Never ignore a caring person.,
Make time.,
Help your children.,
Be humble.,
Be a good friend.,
Listen.",How to Show That You Value Relationships," Firstly, never ignore a person who really cares for you. In this day and age, it really is quite hard to make time and prove to people that you really do care about them. Whoever that is trying to care for you is going out of their way to do so. Don't ignore them and don't hurt their feelings. This person is worth your time.;
, How many times have you heard, ""Sorry, I can't come out sightseeing with you, I've got no time"". The person that asks you to hang out with them has the time, so why don't you? If your day is filled with activities that are really quite useless, get rid of them and make time for your partner. Try going for a walk to somewhere really beautiful with them. They'll appreciate it and so will you.

, Instead of just ignoring your children and letting them get on with life alone, help them up when they fall. Go into their rooms at nighttime, tuck them in and read them a bedtime story. Let them fall asleep to the sound of their mother's/father's voice. If they need help with their homework, talk them through it. don't just tell them to ask a sibling. They want you to help them. Also, let them tell you their silly gossip stories from school, it helps them build a close relationship with you.

, This step applies quite well between workers and bosses but can easily be carried across to all the other types of relationships. Being humble doesn't only mean being kind. It means helping people out in a time of need, it means talking to others when they need to tell you their issues and it means trying to make sure that everybody is happy. If you are humble with others, people are most likely going to be humble with you.

, Everybody needs friends in their life. Friendships are one of the best kind of relationships. It can be hard to find a good, sincere friend these days but that doesn't mean that they're non-existent. When you do find a friend that is good to you, you must be good back to them to keep them as your friend. If you don't ever help them and just ignore them, they won't want to be your friend for much longer. Always be there for your friend when they need you and they'll surely return the favor.

, Whether it's your mum, your dad, your teacher or your friend, to understand the importance of a relationship you must listen to their opinions and respect them. Without listening to them, you won't ever get to maintain a relationship long enough to fully understand how your relationship with them will affect your and their lives. Always keep your ears and your mind open to new ideas.

Practice voluntary stuttering.,
Practice stutter modification.,
Improve your listening skills.,
Find a support group.",How to Talk to a Girl if You Have a Stutter2," If you react to your own stuttering with fear and panic, it will be difficult for you to talk to girls. One way to get over your fear is to intentionally practice stuttering with people you feel comfortable around, such as your parents or a close friend. This is called “voluntary stuttering” or desensitization. Voluntarily stuttering gives you the sense that you’re in control of your stuttering.Talk to a close friend or relative for about 5 minutes, and stutter on purpose at least 5 times in a clearly noticeable way. Stutter in the very first part of the conversation to put your stuttering in the open right away.
Go to a fast-food restaurant or store, and intentionally stutter when asking a question or giving your food order.
The goal with these exercises is to practice feeling confident through a stutter. This won’t eliminate your stammer, but it will help save you from feeling terrible about stuttering when you’re talking to a girl you want to impress.

, One of the challenges of stuttering is that you’re likely to feel confused, embarrassed, and unable to think when a stutter comes up. One way out of this is to stretch out the initial sound of a word (where the stutter usually occurs), allowing you to pull through the stutter to the rest of the word.For example, in the word “soda,” intentionally linger on the s-sound, and gently pull through to the o, as “s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-oda.”
Repeat this practice with your parents, or a trusted friend, intentionally slowing down the consonants at the beginnings of words. For example, ”Wwwould yyyyou like to go out for ddddinner tonight?""
Try challenging yourself by intentionally stuttering on words or consonants that tend to be difficult for you to say without stuttering.

, If you’re so intent on getting through your own speech without stuttering, chances are you’ll miss out on what a girl has to say. She’ll notice this, and assume that you’re not interested in her - which might be far from the case! By learning to pay close attention to what she’s saying, you’ll be a better conversational partner.One way to put aside your self-consciousness about speaking is to intentionally stutter right away in a conversation. Then you won’t have to worry about when it might crop up.
Once you’ve stuttered, notice her response. Did her way of interacting with you change once you stuttered? Or did she seem not to mind?

, Other stutterers will understand the difficulties of talking to girls when you have a stutter. Support groups can offer self-motivation, and are a good way to learn and practice new skills.The National Stuttering Association (NSA) offers groups specifically for teenage stutters, as well as groups for children, and groups for adult stutterers.
Sometimes attending a support group is the first time a stutterer meets others who share their problems.
Groups are often open to parents, friends, and families of people who stutter, as well as professionals who want to learn more about stuttering.

Find out your partner’s “love language”.,
Pay attention and listen to what your partner says he or she needs or wants.,
Carve out time for just the two of you.,

Give your partner gifts on holidays and important occasions.,
Be physically affectionate with your partner.",How to Show Love to a Partner," According to some, there are different “love languages” that people primarily use to express and receive love. These languages include: love expressed through words, love expressed through time spent together, love shown through gifts, love expressed in physical touch, and love done through acts of service. Typically a person will mainly feel loved through a couple of these love languages and not just one. One way to know what your main love language(s) are, is by thinking about how you show your love to others.Knowing how you and your partner express love and feel loved can be really important to your relationship because partners can show love in very different ways.
For example, if you give gifts to show your love while your partner feels loved through time spent together, consider taking an evening to spend together to show him/her your love instead of buying him/her something nice.
You should ask your partner what makes him or her feel loved, or you can think about what they have said means a lot to them when it comes to feeling loved. Once you know what your partner likes, make a conscious effort to show your love in those ways.
Communicate with your partner the things that you need to feel loved.;
, You should also notice little things that are going on with your partner. For example, if you notice your partner is cold, find a sweater for him or her. Or if your partner seems like he/she is getting sick, make them soup or buy them the medication they need. These small gestures can go a long way to show your partner your love.If your partner says he or she doesn’t want something, don’t do it anyway. For example, if you buy your partner a hat they don’t need because you think that they do, they might become bitter about the present.
Write down what your partner says makes them feel loved and consult it when you are trying to decide what to do for him or her. Or ask your partner’s close friends about the things they like or need when in doubt.
Notice the ways your partner changes and grows. For example, if your partner has become more health conscious and changed his or her diet, don’t make them the food they liked before. Make or buy new food for your partner to show that you support their new lifestyle.

, Establish little routines that show your love. Go to bed at the same time, go on a walk together, kiss them before you leave the house, and send them a good morning or goodnight text if you are away from each other. To show your partner love, you should also find a time where you can put away all of your electronics, including your phones, and spend time with your focus on each other. Plan a special date or activity for you to do together. For some partners, quality time is how they feel the most loved.


Because it is time just for the two of you doesn’t mean that you have to be alone. You can go to a bowling alley, go to the beach or do something fun- just make sure that your main focus is your partner while you do your activity.

, Taking and giving space could seem like the opposite of showing love, but it can be key to loving your partner well. For some people, giving and taking space is hard to do. But if you talk about it before you take or give space- you can build a stronger relationship. Some examples of times you or your partner could use space include, after you have spent a lot of time really close together, if you have gone through something intense and emotional together, or if one of you is really stressed about something you have coming up that needs a lot of focus. This can mean going away for a couple of days, not talking as much, or texting less.


Explain to your partner why you think you two need space. For example, you can say something like, “I think I should go to my sister’s for the weekend because I want to give you space to do your project. What do you think about that?”
Taking space doesn’t mean that you are going to see other people. It simply means that you are giving each other distance so you can focus on something or let your partner focus on something he or she needs to do.

, Tell your partner how attractive you find them. Tell them they are beautiful or handsome, and also tell them the little things you find sexy or cute about them. For example, if you are walking somewhere you have never been in a new city with your partner, and he or she finds the way to get to where you need to go without any problem, tell him or her, “I think your sense of direction is sexy.”


If your partner has done something for you- thank him or her for it. Write a little note of thanks for him or her and put it in their bag. Or you can send a text message that tells him or her how much you appreciate what they did with a picture of you looking silly and happy.

, Tease your partner and notice the little things that they do. Always laugh at your partner’s jokes or tease him or her for the joke, and encourage your partner when he or she is being silly. If your partner has painted her or his toenails, for example, you can ask something silly like, “Have your toenails always been that enchanting color?” The more you make humor a part of your relationship, the more comfortable and fun you can be together.


You can make funny observations to your partner based on where you are. Look around at the environment that you are in, and say something about it that is exaggerated, or point out something curious. For example, if your car is really cluttered and you are giving your partner a ride somewhere, you can ask, “So are you going to break up with me now because of my car?”

, Be your partner’s emotional support. Encourage your partner to tell you the things he or she cares about and the things he or she is going through. You can ask your partner something like, “So how have you really been lately?”. When things are hard for your partner, remind him or her of the things that he or she has done well and all the ways things are going to be okay. Tell your partner that you are there for him or her.


Try to accept your partner for who he or she is including both the good and the bad. Realize his or her faults as well as their strengths, and love him or her for the whole thing.
Be prepared to forgive your partner for the mistakes he or she makes, and be ready to encourage him or her to keep trying. Also try to be forgiving because you are going to make mistakes, too.
Don’t try to change your partner. If you are trying to change your partner, you won’t be able to fully love him or her because you will be worried about changing him or her. However, if there is self-destructive behavior, you should talk to a professional and get help.

, Your partner needs to hear these reassuring words from you often. You can also vary “I love you” with, “I like you”. Tell your partner I like you or I love you when you see them do something that you enjoy or are proud of. Your partner will appreciate hearing they are loved for a variety things. Try to be unexpected with it sometimes, for example, when you are standing in line at a grocery store with your partner, you can whisper “I love you” in your partner’s ear before he or she goes up to pay.


Send a random text that says I love you to your partner.
Be careful of saying I love you so often that it loses its power.

, One of the best ways to learn how to show someone love is to ask what is working for him or her. You can’t read your partner’s mind, and sometimes, the best way to show your partner love is to talk directly about how things are going. Whether it is in sex or in your relationship- you should check in with your partner every so often to ask him or her for feedback. Every couple of months, ask your partner to have a conversation about your relationship. Find a time and place you can have a real conversation. This can also happen on special dates when you are at dinner or having a drink. You can say something like, “I want to know how you are feeling about our relationship so we can make our relationship even better.”


Ask your partner something like, “What do you like about our relationship, and what can I do better to show my love for you?”.
Share your own feelings and feedback about the relationship with your partner. Tell your partner the good things that you have enjoyed in your relationship, and also tell him or her the things that he or she could do to make you feel even more loved.
Consider having these dates regularly if you are in a long term relationship.

, Often in relationships, it is hard to stay patient with your partner because you spend a lot of time with him or her. Or when you are together, you are busy or stressed. However, don’t take your frustration out on him or her by shutting down things your partner says because you are feeling irritable or aren’t paying attention. For example, if your partner says to you directly something like, “I don’t know what I should get?” when you are ordering food, don’t ignore your partner because you are frustrated. It can be easy to snap and say something like, “You never know what to get.” or say nothing at all. Say something helpful like, “What did you get last time?”, or you can be playful and kiss her or him on the cheek to acknowledge him or her.


If you are genuinely busy, tell your partner that you would like to talk later. Explain that you can’t respond right now because you are doing something that needs your full attention. You can kiss your partner on the forehead and give him or her a genuine smile to let him or her know that you care.

, You can add to this bank by telling him or her loving things or by doing loving things. You want to make your partner feel rich in love. There is no one way to make your partner feel loved- it takes persistent work and listening to him or her to make your partner feel really loved. However, being aware of this imaginary balance might help you remember that you need to do things to show him or her your love.


Do not hold the things you do for your partner over his or her head, and give to this account without expecting a return.
Check your motivations when you are doing things for your partner. Do things because you want to do them and not because you want something from your partner.

, This act of love can mean a lot to your partner. When you see his or her family, ask your partner’s family questions about your partner, find common ground you share, and try to laugh with them. Even if your partner doesn’t have a great relationship with his or her family, you should still try to have a good relationship with them.


Whomever the important people are in your partner’s life, get to know those people.

, Doing something sweet for your partner doesn’t have to take very much effort on your end but will make your partner feel really loved and can do a lot for your relationship. For example, you can go out and get them their favorite tea or coffee in the morning unexpectedly, and buy a sweet treat they like to go with it. Or you can put a sweet note for your partner in his or her purse or bag. Also, some partners really like it when they get something romantic even if it is cheesy. For example, a bouquet of his or her favorite flowers or a box of their favorite sweets will make his or her day.


You can get your partner something that benefits everyone. For example, maybe your partner is really craving chips and salsa from a certain Mexican restaurant. Go to that restaurant and pick up chips and salsa and surprise your partner with them at lunch with the family.

, Schedule regular times in your schedule to devote to doing something for your partner. For example, on Sunday mornings, you might wash the dishes, make them him or her a present, buy the groceries, or do any of the tasks that your partner normally does for or with your partner. Especially try to tackle projects that your partner doesn’t like to do like cleaning cobwebs or the bathroom for your partner.


Do side by side activities that your partner wants to do with your partner. For example, if your partner likes to go to Bible study at your church, attend Bible study with him or her, and then go to a coffee shop after and talk about the study. Or if your partner likes board games, play one of his or her favorite games with them.
You can try doing couple day activities for each person in the relationship. On one day, or for a period of time, one person in the relationship gets to pick all of the activities that the couple does for that day.

, For some partners, this is the way that they show love and the way that they feel loved. If you receive presents from your partner that you can tell he or she put lots of time and effort into, you may be with someone who cares about gifts. With that in mind, make sure that you also put time and effort giving them gifts back. Think about something that your partner is interested in or cares about and find a gift that they would like. For example, if she loves coffee, get your partner a special coffee maker and mug.


Be careful not to buy your partner that special coffee maker because you like coffee. If your partner notices that you benefit as much or more from the gift, he or she might not find the gift as nice.

, In studies, physical affection is highly connected to overall satisfaction in the relationship. In addition, conflict is more easily resolved when there is a good amount of physical affection between romantic partners. There are different ways to be physically affectionate (not including sex) including massages and back rubs, holding and cuddling, kissing on the lips, kissing on the face, holding hands, and caressing and stroking.You should smile and make eye contact with your partner when you are physically affectionate.


Even for people who are not as obvious about their need for physical touch, physical affection is a key part of a healthy relationship. When it comes to sex, ask your partner the things that he or she likes, and work on making sex good for both of you.
Touch each other in passing. If you don’t have a lot of time to spend together, make sure you make physical contact with your partner when you get a chance. Simply giving each other a good hug when you first see each other or when you leave can help make you feel more connected.
Spend time cuddling. Plan to have a night where you spend time cuddling while you watch a movie or spend time together on the couch.
Some men in particular are very visual and will enjoy it when you do things to suggest doing other things with him. For example, you can bend down and tie your shoes while you make flirty eye contact with him.
Do sweet things like kiss your partner on the forehead. This can give your partner the “I’m here for you vibe.” Give them small kisses throughout the day, rub his or her neck and shoulders, and while you are standing or walking, casually put your arm over his or her shoulder, or around his or her waist.

Research your topic.,

Compile all your facts.,
Create an article outline.,
Know your audience.,
Find an angle.,
Interview people.,
Start with the lead.,
Give all the important details.,
Follow up main facts with additional information.,
Conclude your article.,
Check facts before publishing.,
Ensure you have followed your outline and have been consistent with style.,
Follow the AP Style for formatting and citing sources.,
Have your editor read your article.",How to Write a News Article," To begin writing a news article you need to research the topic you will be writing about extensively. In order to have a credible, well written, well structured article, you have to know the topic well.


If you’ve ever written a research paper you understand the work that goes into learning about your topic. The first phase of writing a news article or editorial is pretty similar.
Begin by asking yourself the “5W’s” (sometimes “6W’s”).Who - who was involved?
What - what happened?
Where - where did it happen?
Why - why did it happen?
When - when did it happen?
How - how did it happen?



,

Once you can clearly answer the “5W’s”, jot down a list of all the pertinent facts and information that needs to be included in the article. Organize your facts into three groups:

1) those that need to be included in the article.
2) those that are interesting but not vital.
3) those that are related but not important to the purpose of the article.


This fact list will help prevent you from leaving out any relevant information about the topic or story, and will also help you write a clean, succinct article.
Be as specific as possible when writing down all of these facts. You can always trim down unnecessary information later, but it’s easier to cut down than it is to have to beef up an article.
It’s okay at this point to have holes in your information – if you don’t have a pertinent fact, write down the question and highlight it so you won’t forget to find it out
Now that you have your facts, if your editor has not already assigned the type of article, decide what kind of article you’re writing. Ask yourself whether this is an opinion article, an unbiased and straightforward relaying of information, or something in between.







, Your outline, and subsequently your article, should be structured for like an inverted triangle. The inverted triangle allows you to build your story so that the most important information is at the top.If you’ve ever heard the term “burying the lead”, that is in reference to the structure of your article.The “lead” is the first sentence of the article – the one you “lead” with. Not ""burying the lead"" simply means that you should not make your readers read several paragraphs before they get to the point of your article.
Whatever forum you’re writing for, be it print or for the web, a lot of readers don’t make it to the end of the article. When writing a news article you should focus on giving your readers what they want as soon as possible.
Write above the fold. The fold comes from newspapers where there’s a crease because the page gets folded in half. If you look at a newspaper all the top stories are placed above the fold. The same goes for writing online. The virtual fold is the bottom of your screen before you have to scroll down. Put the best information at the top to engage your readers and encourage them to keep reading.

, In order to write a great news article you need to know exactly who you are writing for. Your audience will dictate the voice and tone of your article and help you to know what you should include.


Ask yourself the “5W’s” again, but this time in relation to your audience.
Questions like what is the average age you are writing for, where is this audience, local or national, why is this audience reading your article, and what does your audience want out of your article will inform you on how to write.
Once you know who you are writing for you can format an outline that will get the best information to the right audience as quickly as possible.

, Why is this article unique to you? What is your voice? These questions will help you to make your news article unique and something that only you could write.


Even if you are covering a popular story or topic that others are writing about, look for an angle that will make this one yours.
Do you have a personal experience that relates to your topic? Maybe you know someone who is an expert that you can interview.

, When writing a news article, interviewing people and getting a first hand source on your topic can be invaluable. And while reaching out to people and asking for an interview may seem daunting, it can greatly affect the credibility and authority of your article.People usually like to talk about personal experiences, especially if it will be featured somewhere, like your news article. Reach out through a phone call, email, or even social media and ask someone if you can interview them.
When you do interview people you need to follow a few rules: identify yourself as a reporter. Keep an open mind. Stay objective. While you are encouraged to ask questions and listen to anecdotes, you are not there to judge.
Record and write down important information from the interview, and be transparent with what you are doing and why you are doing this interview.

, Begin with a strong leading sentence. News articles begin with a leading sentence that is meant to grab a reader's attention and interest them. This is one of the most important parts of the piece, so start with the good stuff when writing a news article. Remember the inverted triangle.


Your lead should be one sentence and should simply, but completely, state the topic of the article.
Remember when you had to write essays for school? Your lead is like your thesis statement.
Let your readers know what your news article is about, why it’s important, and what the rest of the article will contain.

, The next important step to writing news articles is including all the relevant facts and details that relate to your lead statement. Include the basics of what happened, where and when it took place, who is involved and why it's newsworthy.


These details are important, because they are the focal point of the article that fully informs the reader.
If you are writing an opinion piece, this is where you will state what your opinion is as well.

, After you've listed all the primary facts in your news article, include any additional information that might help the reader learn more, such as contact information, additional facts about the topic or people involved, or quotes from interviews.


This additional information helps round out the article and can help you transition to new points as you move along.
If you have an opinion, this is where you will identify the opposing views and the people who hold them.
A good news article will outline facts and information. A great news article will allow readers to engage on an emotional level.
To engage your readers, you should provide enough information that anyone reading your news article can make an informed opinion, even if it contrasts with yours.
This also applies to a news article where you the author don’t state your opinion but present it as an unbiased piece of information. Your readers should still be able to learn enough about your topic to form an opinion.

, Congratulate your readers for sticking with you to the end by giving the reader something to take away, like potential solutions to the problem or challenges expressed in your article.


Make sure your news article is complete and finished by giving it a good concluding sentence. This is often a restatement of the leading statement (thesis) or a statement indicating potential future developments relating to the article topic.
Read other news articles for ideas on how to best accomplish this. Or, watch news stations or shows. See how a news anchor will wrap up a story and sign off, then try to emulate that.

, Whether you’re writing a news article professionally or for a school assignment, your article isn’t complete until you’ve checked all your facts. Having incorrect facts will immediately discredit your article and could hinder you as a writer.


Be sure to double check all the facts in your news article before you submit it, including names, dates, and contact information or addresses. Writing accurately is one of the best ways to establish yourself as a competent news article writer.

, There are several styles of news articles and journalism from objective reporting to Gonzo (A style of journalism where the reporter describes the events in a subjective manner, usually through a first person narrative).If your news article is meant to convey direct facts, not the opinions of its writer, ensure you’ve kept your writing unbiased and objective. Avoid any language that is overly positive or negative or statements that could be construed as support or criticism.
If your article is meant to be more in the style of interpretive journalism then check to make sure that you have given deep enough explanations of the larger story and offered multiple viewpoints throughout.

, Journalists, and therefore news articles follow AP Style for sources and citations in most cases. The AP Stylebook is a journalist’s textbook and should be consulted for proper formatting.When quoting someone, write down exactly what was said inside quotations and immediately cite the reference with the person’s proper title. Formal titles should be capitalized and appear before a person’s name. Ex: “Mayor John Smith”.Always write out numbers one through nine, but use numerals for numbers 10 and up.
When writing a news article, be sure to only include one space after a period, not two., Even if you have gone through your story several times and think that everything is squared away, you should let another pair of eyes take a look at it. In addition to finding any spelling or grammatical errors, your editor will be able to help you trim down certain sections and simplify awkward sentences.


You shouldn’t submit any news article for publication without first letting someone take a look at it. An extra pair of eyes can double check your facts and the information to ensure that what you have written is accurate.
If you are writing a news article for school or your own personal website, then have a friend take a look at it and give you notes. Sometimes you may get notes that you want to defend or don’t agree with it. But these should be listened to. Remember, with so many news articles getting published every minute you need to ensure that your widest possible audience can easily digest the information you have provided.

Consider how you perceive your mental illness.,
Determine the ideal time frame for the reveal.,
Practice your reveal.,
Choose the right setting.,
Prepare information and answers.,
Don’t assume the worst.,
Be casual and confident.,
Create an opportunity for reciprocal self-disclosure.,
Be honest and forthcoming.,
Give your partner time and space to respond.,
Accept rejection if it occurs.,
Accept support if it is offered.,
Keep talking or keep trying.",How to Reveal Mental Illness to a Prospective Partner," It will be even more difficult to have an honest discussion about your mental illness with a romantic interest if you have not fully accepted its reality yourself. Any sense of doubt or shame that you still feel or stigma that you continue to place on your illness may be further amplified and “confirmed” by similar responses from your prospective partner.Before being truly honest with others, you need to be honest with yourself. Work to understand and accept your illness, with the help of mental health professionals and supportive loved ones. At the same time, never doubt that you deserve to have a healthy, fulfilling romantic relationship.Especially if you have been recently diagnosed, you might possibly find it easier to start the dating process by seeking out others who have similar experiences with mental illness. There are niche online dating sites focused on such individuals. This may not be the best path for you, though, so consult your mental health professional first.;
, While you may occasionally hear specific advice such as “the first date is always too early” or “don’t wait much past the fourth date,” the fact is that there is no universal “right” or “wrong” amount of time into a relationship at which to disclose your mental illness. You can and should seek out advice from trusted sources, but only you can decide when your relationship is at the “just right” stage for this conversation.Generally speaking, you don’t need to disclose a mental illness right off the bat on the first date. Wait until the level of commitment and/or intimacy builds to the point that it feels wrong to wait longer, then plan the discussion., You’ll want the conversation to feel natural and comfortable, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t practice the content and style of your delivery beforehand. You will be hesitant and nervous when it comes time to reveal a mental illness, and adequate preparation beforehand can help you to navigate and push through those barriers to a healthy conversation.Consider practicing what you will say with your therapist or psychiatrist, who can give you guidance on how to approach the subject. Practicing with a trusted friend or loved one, though, may be more comfortable for you. Give both a try.

, This is a conversation that is best made in a calm, relaxed, private setting, not in a corner of a noisy bar or during an aggravating car ride together. It doesn’t have to feel like a business meeting, but also shouldn’t be too romantic either — you should probably both be fully clothed, for instance. A quiet evening on the couch may be just about right.Also, have the conversation during a time when you are managing your illness well, or consider delaying it for a bit if necessary.

, Revealing your mental illness should feel like a true back-and-forth conversation, not a lecture. That said, you should have some informational materials (books, websites, etc.) about your particular condition at the ready. Offer them when appropriate as per the flow of the discussion, but don’t foist them upon the other person.Have answers to some likely questions ready as well. Think about the questions you had when you were first diagnosed with this condition.

, If you go into the talk assuming that this revelation will cause the other person to immediately reject you and walk away, you are sabotaging your chances of having a healthy, positive conversation before it even begins. And, if that is the response you would get from the other person, would you want to be in a relationship anyway?


Studies indicate that the odds are in your favor. About two-thirds of partners are at least initially supportive when informed about the other’s mental illness, while only about five percent break off the relationship on the spot. It is true that 60% of people with mental illnesses say that the revelation has caused an eventual breakup, but 60% also say that revealing this truth strengthens both the relationship and personal well-being., As it does with so many aspects of life, preparation pays off when revealing information of such a personal nature to a prospective partner. The more you plan, practice, and anticipate beforehand, the more relaxed and confident you will be when it comes time to reveal your mental illness.Don’t start things off by saying “I have something important to tell you” while you display an expressionless face, or with a “Come over. We need to talk” call or message. Although you’ve planned ahead, let it flow out from the context of a positive interaction — “While we’re in the sharing mood, I have something I’d like to talk about with you.”
The key is to not be so casual that you seem to think this reveal isn’t a big deal (which it is), but not so serious that it seems like the end of the world (which it isn’t). Your level of comfort and confidence will impact how the news is received by the other person.

, Self-disclosure — offering personal information and insights as a sign of trust and comfort — is essential to any relationship. Research indicates that the benefits are maximized for both parties in a relationship when disclosures are made in a reciprocal manner (that is, I tell you a secret, you tell me one). Incorporating your mental illness revelation into a larger discussion, then, may make things both easier and more beneficial in the long run.If it helps you, you can “get the ball rolling” by disclosing less vital information — why you hate cold weather, why you are so competitive with your sister, etc. — and let the back-and-forth carry you to your mental illness reveal. This also gives you the opportunity to “abort the mission” and save the big reveal for another time if the situation doesn’t seem to be playing out right (the other person is distracted, you aren’t expressing yourself very well, etc.).
Don’t demand or force reciprocal disclosures. Just give the other person the opportunity. Consider the viability of the relationship if the other person never shares deeper truths, though.

, Once you begin actually describing your diagnosis and the nature of your mental illness, provide a thorough, truthful portrait. Don’t minimize the fact that you face many challenges due to your condition, and that some days are better than others for you. You don’t have to lay bare every breakdown or relapse in excruciating detail, but don’t elide the fact that they have occurred and will do so again.Of course, you can also be forthright about the steps you take to effectively manage your condition — your medications, your therapy sessions, etc.
Present your condition as you would a non-terminal, chronic but manageable physical ailment. Establish the fact that the illness is a part of you, but it doesn’t define you., Few people will immediately reject you and walk away when informed that you have a mental illness, and, if so, good riddance. Many people will offer immediate support and a strong desire to continue the relationship, but that enthusiasm may wane before long. Don’t discount your prospective partner’s immediate reaction to your revelation, but also allow some time for the fuller picture to be revealed.Offer the other person time to think as you are making your revelation: “I know this is a lot to take in, and I don’t expect you to make any decisions about our relationship right this second. Take some time to think about what we’ve discussed, and take a look at these materials on my condition if you’d like.”

, Even if the odds are low that your prospective partner will break things off with you on the spot, it is possible that your mental illness revelation will trigger the end of the relationship. If this happens, don’t regret that you told the other person; regret that this person was too scared, selfish, or uninformed to see that your mental illness does not wholly define you and that a meaningful relationship was possible.You should actually be relieved that you found out your prospective partner couldn’t handle your truth before things got more serious. That doesn’t mean being rejected won’t hurt, though. Seek out the solace of your “mental health team” of friends, loved ones, and professionals.
The end of a budding relationship doesn’t prove that your mental illness makes you undateable. Instead, it shows just how much you are like everyone else trying to find a lasting, healthy, romantic partnership.

, It is difficult to handle being dumped because you have a mental illness. It can also be difficult to accept the help and support of your new romantic partner. You don’t have to feel like you are becoming a burden or asking too much of a new significant other. Accept this display of generosity graciously and take it as a sign of growth in your relationship.The other person will probably make a general offer like “I want to be there for you. Let me know what I can do to help.” If so, don’t be afraid to specify what you do need and want. If it was a false offer, you’ll find out soon enough.
If the other person starts saying things like “I know this doctor you have to see” or “You need to try this herbal supplement I’ve heard about,” you don’t need to feel obligated to accept this type of help. You need to remain in control of how you address your mental illness.

, If the other person is genuinely supportive of your status and eager to continue the relationship, you should be eager to make your revelation an ongoing discussion. Your mental illness will continue to be with you, and you will go through ups and downs, so keep your new partner informed with regular chats about your condition and your feelings.If things don’t turn out so well and the relationship ends, get back out there and give it another try with someone else (and someone better). It will never be easy to reveal your mental illness to a new romantic interest, but you will become more comfortable doing so over time.

Find a place to hold the support group meetings.,
Obtain the books or resources you will need from a respected source.,
Place posters around town and advertisements in the Announcements section of the local newspapers.

Don't bring in professionals to run the support group, as they often have their own agenda and may not allow the group to run on its own.,
Allow the support group members to create the rules and move the group along, don't allow yourself or another person to own or ""take charge"" of the group.

Ask about their well-being.,
Understand that they don’t have much mental energy right now.,
Stay positive.,
Be willing to listen or to help them find a therapist.",How to Support Someone Whose Child Is Hospitalized1," You know your loved one is upset, anxious, scared, and a variety of other emotions. However, it’s still important for you to ask them how they are. They are likely so focused on their child that they aren’t concerned about themselves.A simple, “Hi, friend. How are you feeling today?” could be all it takes to let them know it’s OK to talk about what they are going through. They may not feel comfortable discussing what they are experiencing because they don’t want to detract anything away from their child.
Asking shows you care and lets them know you are genuinely concerned. However, stick around after their initial answer—it may change once they feel they can actually talk about how they really feel.;
, Don’t expect them to entertain you when you visit the hospital. Realize that they are likely going through the hardest time of their life at the moment. They won't interact with you in the same way that they usually do. For example, your friends might not have the energy to make small talk or laugh with you.Don’t force anything when you visit. Trying to maintain a conversation may be too much for your loved one to handle right now. Sometimes just having someone to sit with in silence is a huge offering of support.

, Your loved one may feel like their world is crashing down all around them right now. Seeing you could be the breath of fresh air they desperately need. Smile, offer hugs, and try to stay positive when you’re around them.Feel things out when you get to the hospital. You can determine your energy and positivity level based on how things are going in the room. Adjust your behavior accordingly. For example, if your friends seem light-hearted it may be okay to tell a light joke about the hospital food or the parking. But, refrain from light-heartedness if they are crying or upset.

, Someone with an ill child may experience stress, isolation, fatigue, or other more serious symptoms of mental health issues. Offer to listen to the parent as often as you are able, but also keep in mind that just being there during these times may be helpful enough. If you think the parent may require more help than you can provide, then connect them with the appropriate resources, such as a therapist. Psychotherapy would allow the parent to talk through their feelings and increase their motivation to take care of themselves. Some common emotional issues that the parent may be having with their child being hospitalized might include:

Anger and frustration
Grief and sadness
Guilt (maybe feelings that they could have done something different to prevent their child from being hospitalized)
Anxiety and fear, such as worry over financial difficulties, or the possible death of their child.
Isolation and loneliness
Declining physical health and strain, illness, and physical and mental exhaustion.

Offer to be the contact person that gives updates on your loved one’s child. Doing so allows them to focus on their kid as much as possible.Ask your loved one if they feel comfortable with you taking on this responsibility. You can say, “I want to take as much stress off of you as possible. I would be happy to be the person your friends and family contact for updates, if that’s OK with you.” They will likely be grateful to have this sometimes overwhelming task removed from their plate.

, Your loved one is likely spending all their time in the hospital. As such, their household chores are likely falling by the way side. Offer to take care of what you can.


For instance, this could mean taking out the garbage, mowing the lawn, feeding and caring for their pets, cooking meals, doing laundry, and performing other tasks. Knowing that these responsibilities are taken care of could provide your loved one with a certain amount of relief., Your loved one may not be able to leave the hospital often. Help out by bringing essential items with you when you come to visit. Doing so can make their hospital stay much more comfortable.


Call your loved one before you come to visit and ask what you can bring. Offer to bring them a change of clothes, healthy food, books, games, and other items that can keep them occupied during the hospital stay. , Offer to spend time hanging out with their other kids, if they have any. You can also volunteer to take them places like school, sports, and playdates. Your loved one likely feels guilty that they are focusing all of their time and energy on their sick child. Spending time with their other children may make them feel better.


You could also volunteer to sit with the child in the hospital so that they can spend time with their other child. Getting out of there and being able to concentrate on something else for a little while may be exactly what your loved one needs right now."

Avoid talking about all the fun you’re having.,
Keep your opinions to yourself.,
Check in often.,
Encourage them to take care of themselves.",How to Support Someone Whose Child Is Hospitalized3," Hearing about your amazing weekend getaway is probably the last thing your loved one wants to hear right now. They’ve been stuck in a hospital room for a certain length of time and likely don’t want to listen to how great your life is going. Try to remain respectful and considerate of their situation.


Keep this kind of conversation to a minimum, even if your loved one asks about it. Hearing your stories may serve as a distraction, but you don’t want to make it seem like you’re bragging., You may see inserting your opinion on the matter as helpful, but your loved one may see it as you being bossy or critical. They have likely done everything they think they should. Having you state your opinion may seem like you are doubting what they’ve done.


Instead, let them know that you support them and the decisions they’ve made. Tell them they are doing an excellent job hanging in there. This will mean more to them than hearing what you would have done differently., You may think that you are bothering your loved one if you call or text each day. However, your contact may make give them the encouragement they need to get through the day. Don’t back off: your concern shows you care.However, be considerate of what your loved one needs right now. Keeping them on the phone for an hour a day may take up too much of their time. Feel things out when you check in and then decide what works best for them, whether it’s a text, a quick drop by, or a daily phone call.

, Tell your loved one it’s OK to leave the room to get a change of scenery, particularly if the child is sleeping. Their physical and mental health is important right now and something they may not be concerned with. Be their reminder."

Attend a conference.",How to Write a Mystery Short Story," A short story is usually between 5,000 and 10,000 words, but may be as long as 20,000 words (80 pages, double-spaced). The author H.G Wells said that it's a short story if you can read it in half an hour.To write a mystery within this limited space means that you'll have to make every word count. Furthermore, you'll have to make sure your mystery short story includes these elements:


A crime of some sort, usually a murder.
A sleuth or detective.
A criminal.
Clues that the writer will drop along the way for the sleuth to find.
The other elements of a short story include: location (or setting); time period; dialogue; character development. These are also present in the mystery short story.;
, Most often, mystery stories are centered around a crime of some sort.The crime, and the solving of that crime, is the central plot point of the mystery novel.


To think of your crime, you may find it beneficial to ask yourself ""What if...?"" questions. For example, ""What if...there an unexplained murder in the house?"" ""What if...someone went missing unexpectedly?""
You can often find ideas for your mystery story in news headlines or daily activities. If you're writing a historical mystery, you might find yourself intrigued by unsolved mysteries of the past.
Once you start to generate ""What if...?"" questions, you may find it difficult to stop!

, Your setting should be described in sufficient detail that the reader has a clear mental image of the location, whether it's a lady's parlor or a battlefield. Your mystery short story may be set in one room, one house, one city, or around the world; regardless, make sure that you provide a detailed and vivid description of the setting for your mystery short story.Recognize that the size of the place will influence the development of your story. For example, in a large city or busy public place, you will have lots of opportunities to introduce witnesses. However, in a “locked-room mystery” (one where all the characters seem to be present in the same room throughout the occurrence of the crime), you will likely have no external witnesses, but may be able to draw upon your characters opinions and biases of each other.
Focus on the elements of your setting that are essential to the story. For example, is weather essential? If it is, write about it in great detail. If it is not, only mention it briefly or leave it out altogether.

, Does your mystery story occur in the modern day, or in a historical era? Deciding on a set time period for your mystery short story will enable you to include period-specific clues (such as what characters might be wearing or what their occupations may be). This will help with the development of detail in your mystery short story.A short story won't have a lot of time to spend describing historical detail. If your setting requires a lot of explanation, consider using a longer form.
Be prepared to do all the necessary research to make your setting compelling and realistic to the reader.

, The surprise of the mystery story is enhanced by the realistic setting and details that the reader can easily place and recognize. For example, if your mystery story takes place in a school, include convincing details: the smell and taste of chalk dust; the sound of a teacher's high heeled shoes; the rusty taste of the locker that the detective is hiding inside.You can use these details to establish setting, offer clues, and make characters more realistic.
Because you're writing a short story, make sure each detail functions in at least 2 of these ways.

, In a mystery, you'll want to make sure each character is both realistic and easily identifiable. Make sure their names are distinct, that each has uniquely identifying features, and that they have ways of acting or speaking that are unique.Some characters should be potential suspects for having committed the crime (and at least one should actually be guilty of the crime), some should be supporting characters that serve to make the storyline interesting (a love interest or meddling mother-in-law, perhaps), and one (or more) should be focused on solving the mystery.
Well-written characters will have motives for acting in ways that further the plot.

, Your detective should be interesting, with a strong personality. Think of the detectives you've read in other stories: each one of them has a strong personality, a signature style, and a unique outlook on life. Usually, a mystery story is told from the detective's point of view.Keep track of all the traits of your sleuth. Know his or her personality, physical characteristics, tendencies, habits, best and worst qualities, and signature style (among other things). Even if you don’t reveal all of her characteristics to the reader, it is important to be consistent throughout your short story.
Consider developing your sleuth around yourself or around someone you know. This can help you decide on certain features and traits that will result in a thorough description of your sleuth.
Think about including weaknesses and foibles.While you may want your sleuth to have superhero-like mental capacity or razor sharp intuition, there might be some things that they struggle with as well.This will make your character more relatable to your readers.
Ensure that your sleuth is unique.If you have trouble determining this, think about what makes you unique and add some of that character into the character of your sleuth.

, What is the sleuth's reason for wanting to solve the mystery? What was the villain's reason for committing the crime? If your answer is only ""money"", your reader is unlikely to be interested enough to continue to read.Remember that your reader is not getting paid to read your story, so your reader must also have an emotional investment to continue to read.
A good sleuth will have an investment that gives him motivation to go above and beyond the standard nature of the job. He should have a deeply personal connection to solving the crime.

, Who is the “bad guy” (or gal) in your mystery short story? To add some extra spice to your story, you may want to consider presenting a few potential villains with suspicious characteristics. This will leave your reader guessing as to who is the real antagonist in your story.Describe your villain well, but not too well. You don’t want your reader to guess right from the beginning of the story who is the culprit. Your reader may become suspicious if you spend a disproportionate amount of time describing one character.
You may want to make your villain someone that has been slightly suspicious all along. On the other hand, you may want to make the revelation of the culprit or criminal a complete shock. “Framing” someone throughout the story is a surefire way to keep your readers hooked to your mystery short stories.
Instead of a villain, consider including a sidekick. Maybe your sleuth has a friend or partner that will help her sort the clues and point out things that she misses.No one says the sleuth has to do it all alone! What if the sidekick and villain end up being one in the same?

, Create a situation in which a crime can reasonably occur. Did all the power go out in the city due to a thunderstorm? Was a door or a safe accidentally left unlocked? Paint a vivid picture of the situation surrounding the occurrence of the crime that will be the focus of your mystery.


Don’t underestimate the power of the “backdrop” for the crime.An intricate understanding of the setting in which the crime takes place is an important tool that will help when it comes to developing your narrative.
In a short story, the ""opportunity"" may well have happened before the story begins. In this case, the triggering event will be the detective's first decision to get involved.

, As the author of a mystery short story, you should keep a list of clues that your sleuth and your reader will discover.Deciding on your clues and when to allow your sleuth to discover them is tricky, but is an essential part of a mystery short story.


Present a clue early on in the book that your sleuth (and your reader) won’t recognize as a clue.This will make your reader go back and think “AH! That’s what that meant!”
Lay out false clues.Lead your reader (or your sleuth) in the wrong direction to create an extra exciting story.
Build tension through clues. Has your sleuth gone a long time without finding a clue? Does he have seemingly conflicting clues? The more puzzled you can make your reader, the more intriguing they will find your story.

, A good analogy is to think of your short story like a roller coaster: you want your readers to be leaning in one direction and then suddenly whipped the other way.This is sure to leave your readers wowed.


While surprising, your conclusion should also feel inevitable when looking back over the arc of the whole story. Using a “deus ex machina” ending that seems to come from nowhere is less likely to be interesting to the modern reader.
Many mystery writers decide on the ending first, before writing the rest of the short story.Knowing your ending will allow you to better plot the story, which builds towards the revelation at the finish.

, A good strategy for writing a mystery short story is to lead your readers one way throughout the whole story, and then suddenly change direction at the end (see the rollercoaster analogy above). Include “red herrings” that will intentionally mislead your reader, but be careful not to overuse them.You should ask yourself several important questions:Who does your reader expect committed the crime?
Why is it unexpected that the actual criminal committed the crime?

, Magazines such as Ellery Queen, Sherlock Holmes Mystery Magazine, Spinetingler Magazine, The Strand Magazine, and others publish mystery short stories. If you want to improve your writing skills, read as many different writers of mystery short stories as you can.You can also read collections of short stories by your favorite mystery writers. Short story collections by Jonathan Kellerman, Edgar Allan Poe, Lawrence Block, and more.
Collections of well-crafted mystery short stories are published every year by the Best American Mystery Stories.

, Many cities or universities have continuing education classes in writing mysteries, short stories or general writing instruction. Learning more about the craft of writing clear sentences, strong characters, compelling plots will help you write better mystery short stories.If you're not sure whether a class will help you with your particular interest, ask the instructor prior to signing up.
You'll probably be able to see a course's reading list (or syllabus) before you sign up. This can be a good way to help you decide whether or not the class will be good for you.

, Most cities have informal writing support groups that meet in libraries, bookstores or other community settings Joining a writing group is a good way to stay motivated, and to learn new skills.You can also find writing groups listed on bulletin boards, online listservs or Craigslist. Meetup.com also lists writing groups.
A writing group can help you meet other people who may have more experience publishing their work. You can learn from their experience.
Online writers' groups are increasingly popular. Look on social media sites such as Facebook or Tumblr.

, Mystery writers are a specialty writing group, and have their own conferences at which the technical nature of mystery writing is discussed. For example, Mystery Writers of America hosts an annual conference (Sleuthfest) that provides information sessions on subjects such as forensic techniques.There's also the Nancy Drew Conference, the Left Coast Crime Conference, CrimeFest 2016, and more.
An online search for mystery writers conferences may help you locate a conference in your area.
Conferences are also great ways to meet agents who can help you market your work, or discussions about the merits of self-publication.

Add creative style elements to help you resume stand out.,
Experiment with non-traditional formats.",How to Write a Neat Resume," There are three common types of resumes: chronological, functional, and combination. Figure out what type of resume you want to write before working on your resume.


A chronological resume lists your work in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent position and working backwards. It's main advantages are that it's easy to read and allows employees to get a sense of the full scope of your work history. However, it also highlights any employment gaps so you should refrain from using this resume type if you have gaps in your work history. It's best used to emphasize career growth over time and how you've developed a specific skill set in one career path.A functional resume focuses on skills and strengths that may be important to potential employers. It omits dates, places, and timeframes in order to downplay a work history with a lot of employment gaps. It can allow you to highlight specific strengths and skills that may be hidden in a chronological resume, but many employers dislike this kind of resume as they feel you're intentionally trying to hide employment gaps, underemployment, or a lack of a career progression. It's best to only use a functional resume if you're a new graduate or a changing careers or looking for freelance work.A combination resume is some combination of a functional and chronological resume. It usually includes a chronological work history and also a separate section highlight specific skill sets, volunteer work, and any relevant coursework. This is a great resume type to use if you're making a career change but have a lot of experience applicable to your new career. However, do not use this type of resume if you have limited experience as employers may think you're trying to obscure a spotty work history.;
, There is certain basic information every resume should include. When writing a resume, make sure to include the following:


Your contact information, like your name, phone number, address, and e-mail, should be included. Spell out abbreviated words, such as avenue and boulevard. Use a professional e-mail address, one that includes your full name.List any schools you've attended and graduated from. You should also include your school if you are currently enrolled. List your GPA, major, and expected graduation date. If you received any academic awards or took any relevant courses, that should also be included. For example, if you're looking for work in a medical field and you took a CPR certification class this would be something include in your education section., Your resume should not be a listing of every job you've ever had. It should be a document that shows evidence of a certain career trajectory and skill set, so pick and choose what parts of your employment history to include.


Cater your resume to the job you want. If you want to work in marketing, for example, include any and all experience you have related to marketing in your resume.Many recent graduates make the mistake of include all of their work history, including jobs that are irrelevant to the job they're seeking. If you're looking to move to New York City and work in a publishing house, your employers will not be impressed that you tended bar over the summers to make ends meet. However, they will want to hear about your internship at Random House and the 3 years you spent working on your college's literary journal.If you're changing career paths, including relevant experience can be tricky. Even if you've been consistently employed for years, omitting irrelevant employment history might make it look as if you have major employment gaps. However, you can try to frame your existing experience in a way that would be appealing for your new career path. Say, for example, you're moving from the service industry into advertising and you spend 3 years working as a waiter in an upscale restaurant. Rather than omitting your service experience, try to present as a hands-on learning opportunity where you were able to interact with customers and gauge what real people value in the restaurant market. This is an invaluable skill for marketing., Do not reduce your resume to your employment history. Add supplemental information about your skill set to impress potential employers.


You can have a section labeled ""Additional Skills"" and use that to include anything that does not quite fit into your employment history.If you speak any foreign languages, include that. If you have any certifications or licenses, list them. However, do keep with the theme of including relevant information only. If you're applying for a law, for example, being CPR certified might not be worth mentioning.Any awards or publications look great as well, especially if you're applying for a job in an academic field.Software skills are vital for almost any job position, so include a listing of any software you have professional experience using., Many times, you have general skills from previous jobs that may not directly apply but are transferable to a variety of fields. For example, if you're a recent graduate you may have lots of waitressing experience, meaning you have experience in customer service and communication. The job itself, however, may not be relevant. Consider adding a general skill section and spinning your skills in a way that highlights skills you've accrued over the years from jobs you may not include in your experience section.


Focus on interpersonal communication in your general skills section, as nearly every job will require working with others in some capacity. If you've held any service job, you have some experience with active listening, resolving differences, expressing opinions respectfully, and working one-on-one with customers.Talk up your ability to plan and organize. ""Organizational skills"" is an attribute many employees ask for, and a necessary for even low wage part time jobs. In your general skill section, talk about your ability to solve problems critically, meet deadlines, multi-task, and complete tasks.Leadership is another word found in many job listings, so talk about any leadership experience you have in a general skill set page. If you've ever had to instruct a new employee, talk about your ability to coach or counsel others, for example.Experience with social media is something most employees look for these days, and even if you just have your own independent blog or small Twitter following these things might be worth mentioning if the content is work appropriate., Your resume is your place to brag about yourself. Make sure you use words that sound impressive and accurately convey the value of your experience.


You can find lists of resume buzzwords online, often broken down into categories. Words like oversaw, remedied, clarified, maintained, inventoried, and more are powerful terms on a resume.It can be helpful to jot down a few of your duties at a given job and then reword them to sound more impressive. For example, say you worked as an editorial assistant for a magazine and one of the main components of your job was copy-editing. You might write down, ""I read articles from contributors and checked them for grammar and clarity. I discussed my changes with authors and editors.""Expand on the above statement to make it sound more impressive. For example, ""I reviewed an array of content from regular contributors for clarity, ease of reading, and basic grammatical structure. I collaborated with authors and fellow editors to enhance existing content."", Resumes should not just list general skills. You should strive to be as specific as possible when you can.


If you work in business, do not say ""I increased company revenue between 2012 and 2013."" Include exact amounts. For example, ""I increased company revenue from $120,000 in 2012 to $340,000 in 2013.""Include numbers whenever possible. If you're a teacher, do not say ""Taught English to a group of high school students."" Instead, say, ""Taught English to a group of 18 high school seniors 5 days a week, teaching 4 sessions lasting 1 hour each.""If you work in a job where quantity is hard to qualify, focus on time. If you're in a creative field, for example, talk about the general duration of your projects to highlight your proficiency. If your job was performance-based, tell employers how long your practiced each day leading up to the performance. If you worked in writing, talk about word count. Give employers a rough sense of how many words you wrote per day.

, Resumes can be written narrative style, when a brief paragraph appears after your work history explain your skills. They can also be written with bullet points listing each applicable skill. It's best to use a combination, stating the general job description in a couple of sentences and then listing your general duties in bullet points., For the most part, resumes should be kept to a single page. This is one of many reasons you should be wise about what content to include. When employers must move through multiple resumes to select candidates for an interview, they might not even look at a resume that goes over a single page., You should always use a legible font of an appropriate size when writing a resume.


You should use a common font that is easily legible. Cursive or decorative fonts are a bad idea for a resume.Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman, and Georgie are safe, highly readable fonts appropriate for most resumes. If you're applying for a job in a more creative field, however, consider choosing a slightly more artistic font but one that is still readable. Examples include Bookman Old Style, Garamond, Goudy Old Style, or Century Gothic.Using smaller fonts can allow you to include more information. However, do not go smaller than size 10. If your resume is hard to read, an employer might choose to simply not read it., There are no universal rules for punctuation in a resume, but whatever punctuation choices you use should be used consistently.


Bullet points in a resume are often written in sentence fragments, so you may or may not decide to add a period. While there's no strongly preferred method among employers, do not be inconsistent about your choice. Do not end bullet points with a period in the ""Employment History"" section but then choose to omit them in ""Additional Experience.""White space is important in a resume. While omitting all white space can allow you to fit more experience, it can make the resume difficult to read. You should include some white space between each section but keep the amount consistent throughout the document.If you're using bullet points for your work experience section, use the same type for your additional experience section., While resumes should be professional in appearance, they should not be boring. Certain creative additions to a resume can help your stand out from the pile.


Subtle use of color is a great way to make your resume stand out. You should not choose gaudy or difficult to read shades, like bright primary colors or yellows. However, adding deep shades of blue, purple, or read for your headers can make your resume more visually appealing.
If possible, create an online resume or personal website to direct prospective employers. This is especially vital if you work in a creative field.
A monogram of your initials in the upper corner of your resume is also a nice touch.
You can find a variety of creative resume templates online if you're looking for a way to make your resume stand out from the bunch.

, While a traditional format is a safe bet, if you want your resume to stand out you may want to experiment a little. If you're applying for a job in a creative field especially, an unusual but easy-to-read format could help your resume stand out from the pile.


If you're working a field where formatting documents is important, like graphic design, a dull and traditional resume may not impress an employer. Try to cater to the job you want. Many people get interviews by creating a custom resume based on the field they're applying to. For example, a young woman looking for a job in the scrapbooking industry designed a resume with the look and feel of a scrapbook page, complete with a pink stationary background and graphics resembling a paperclip and label gun strips. While she did not get the job, the resume attracted a lot of attention and interviews.If you're not looking for a job in a particular industry, you can always just pick an usual and attractive design for a general resume. Many templates and examples can be found online. Sites like Flickr and Pinterest provide great examples of creative resumes.Be careful, however, about getting too creative with your resume. While an interesting design can help you stand out, you do not want graphics and format to overwhelm and blot out content. Make sure your resume is still readable regardless of design."

A GAF score of 1-10 indicates that the patient is a danger to himself and/or others., Your recommendations should be based on your narrative summary and assessment. Your treatment goals must be measurable with specific time frames for completion. Compile a list of treatment goals. Examples:reducing risk factors, decreasing functional impairment.Indicate planned preventions with patient participation. Examples would be anger management, parent training, problem solving. , Your assessment should conclude with a statement about the patient's understanding of the course of treatment and its goals. This portion of the assessment shows that the patient is aware of the decided course of treatment and is willing to work with it.Patients report better outcomes to their treatment when they're in agreement with their practitioners about the course of treatment.Ensure effective interventions by implementing a negotiations process between patient and mental health care provider."

Be careful where you get your relationship advice and role models.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Learn to evaluate relationship advice.,
Find a positive role model.,
Go to therapy for unresolved childhood issues.",How to Stop Bad Examples from Hurting Your Relationship1," You can get advice about your relationship anywhere – from your friends, family, and even so-called “experts” – but take it with a grain of salt. Likewise, be aware that bad relationships are all too common, and it’s probably not a good idea to try to model your relationship on anyone else’s.Every relationship is different because of the individuals in it. Advice that works for one couple may not work for another.
Some relationships that look fine on the surface may have problems underneath. Don’t assume somebody has a perfect relationship, even if they try to present it that way.;
, Don’t expect your partner to act like your best friend’s significant other or the love interest in a movie you just saw. Instead, accept your partner as the unique, imperfect person they are. Understand that your partner won’t do everything right or always know what you want, just like you won’t always live up to their wishes., Become a more cautious receiver of advice when it comes to your relationship. Generally, you'll want to shy away from advice that is unsolicited. You also want to avoid listening to those who seem to have ulterior motives. Take advice from people who are relatively impartial and not trying to steer you one way or another.


For instance, a friend who just went through a nasty breakup tells you ""All men are cheaters. It's best if you get out now before you're hurt."" This advice is guided by your friend's own emotional experience and is, therefore, biased.
Great sources for advice might be an older mentor, spiritual advisor or a relationship counselor., If you'd like to look to another couple for guidance in your relationship, choose carefully. Find people who share similar relationship values as you and your partner. Also, look for people who can testify to trials and triumphs in their relationship versus a couple who pretends to be perfect.Even if you choose a couple with a more realistic portrayal of their relationship, you must keep in mind that these people are only human. Never take all your advice from them, as they have faults just as you do.

, If you or your partner are children of divorce or abuse/neglect, you may need to see a therapist. If you were not raised by healthy relationship role models you might repeatedly get into bad relationships or sabotage your current one.See a counselor either individually or a couple to work through unresolved issues from your childhood that may impact your relationships now.

Pick your moment.,
Be suggestive, not exhaustive.,
Be aware of your pacing.,
Think about your narrator.",How to Write a Narrative2," This is not your life story. Your narrative should be something that happened to you that changed you or was significant in some way. The event doesn't have to be huge -- au contraire; sometimes the smaller, simpler events make for more moving outcomes -- but the consequences or your thought process behind it should be. It could be a childhood event, achieving a goal, a failure, or a good or bad deed.If it'd be easy and interesting to write, odds are it'd be a good read.


Make sure you have a point. Just like writing a paper, your narrative should have a ""thesis."" After all, if you don't have a point, why should your audience listen to you?There should be a lesson learned or some significant outcome that leaves an impression with your readers.
Make an outline of the basic parts of your narrative. Because the experience is (most likely) from your memory, there are hundreds of little pieces of information you have to sift through to organize and possibly throw out. Creating an outline will give you the bare bones of your story and help jog your memory in a chronological fashion.

, The reader's imagination needs to fill in some of the details. You know how you absolutely adore a book and then you go to see the movie, and it's not as good? Part of that is because you got to see it for yourself with your imagination. Let the reader take it to where they want it to go.


This is a very, very fine line and even the best of writers may struggle with it. You want to avoid both spelling everything out for the reader (every exhalation of breath, every slight change in color) but you also want to provide vivid details (events need texture, after all). Try to zero in on what's meaningful and what caught your attention. Don't go about fabricating details to achieve poetic eloquence -- you've probably forgotten those things for a reason.

, This doesn't mean setting your treadmill at a certain speed and never deviating from it -- this means knowing when to speed up and slow down. Again, another fine art. But, if the experience is yours, you should have a good idea of when to gloss over the details and when to zero in on what's happening.


Think of episodes as pearls on a string. Make the pearls full orbed; keep the string stringy. The reader dwells in the episodes, but she needs to be oriented to them, and that is the function of the transitions.

, This is where the narrative gets interesting. Remember that the narrator isn't necessarily the writer (though it can be) and you can be in the story without narrating it. This gives your narrator the ability to sidestep certain factors (pivotal or otherwise) and be misinformed or flat out wrong. Or even evil.


When the narrator tells the story in first person, but details in the story lead the reader to suspect that the narrator is not reliable, the result is irony. Irony is a narrative condition in which the reader and the writer share a common judgmental attitude toward the narrator, or when the reader knows more than the narrator and characters in the story.

Get started.,
Stay organized.,
Use your senses.,
Employ consistent and clear language.",How to Write a Narrative3," Get started right out of the gate. Writing isn't a horse race -- you can't really come up from behind. Get right into the action. Especially at the beginning, avoid long and lengthy descriptions.Your reader needs to be pulled into what's going on -- they won't be appeased by your vocabulary or verbosity.


One technique you may want to consider is introducing the experience at the very beginning but holding out on explaining the significance until the end. Your reader's will hopefully be hanging on your every word, waiting for resolution., It's easy in a narrative to get wrapped up in your thoughts and flashback to related circumstances or jump to the end and leave questions unanswered -- after all, you were there; it's hard to know what you know that others don't. Your outline will help you do this.


You are the master of your own narrative, therefore you have all the control and can guide it where you desire. Make sure you're conscious of the fact that you have your entire audience following you, though; don't lead them astray. Have a clear introduction and conclusion.

, All of them. This is where detail gets vivid and good. If you're having trouble describing a person, turn of events, or object, think of your five senses. What do you recall that struck you?


You may want to start a chart on a piece of scratch paper to get your mind rolling. Have a column each for smells, sounds, sights, tastes, and touch. And just because it's something that's normally attributed to one sense (or two), doesn't mean you can't expand. For example, you can see and hear and feel rain, but the sentence ""Virginia rain smells different from a California drizzle.""is even more evocative. How would sunscreen taste? How do you see your morning cup of coffee? What did the weather that day feel like?

, Much like the descriptive essay, narrative essays are effective when the language is carefully, particularly, and artfully chosen. Use specific language to evoke specific emotions and senses in the reader. Also, keep your audience in mind. A group of sixth graders will appreciate and perceive different things than a group of business professionals.


If your narrator isn't you, be especially careful not to slip into your mannerisms. You may not even know what they are! If you are using a third person that has a definite personality or point of view, make a list of their attributes and how they would ""talk."" Are they biting? Informal? Crude? Pedantic? Once you know these characteristics, you can monitor your writing for them.

"
"
Take a break.,
Have someone else read your work.,
Revise and rework.",How to Write a Narrative4," After your work is done, of course. Taking a break is pivotal to refreshing your mind and renewing your eyes. In all the time you've spent writing, your brain has become oblivious to the errors and flow (or lack thereof) in and of your work. Get up, walk around, watch some TV, and come back. You'll notice things you didn't before.


When you come back, look for errors, yes, but also look for ways that you could be clearer and whether or not your writing helps the readers picture your scene accurately and effectively., Two minds are always better than one. Have a friend or family member who wasn't there read your work -- you need an unbiased opinion that has no prior knowledge. This way, they're only using your work as a guide.


If they're handy with the written word, have them check for spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. But also ask them if any questions have been left unanswered, if they can follow along easily, and if they understand the significance of your narrative.

, There will probably be some parts that need more detail and parts that need less. Discuss this with your friend -- they're the closest thing you'll get to your real audience.


Identify and consider removing any information that seems to distract from the focus and main narrative of the essay. It may make sense to you but only confuse the reader. In addition, think about whether you've presented the information in the most effective order. Would it work backwards? Would it work in pieces?
You may want to title your work. Do this after your narrative has been completely formed -- a title at the beginning may not be the most apt at the end. Check once more for spelling and punctuation errors and submit your work!

Cool off before you talk.,
Remember that you are on the same side.,
Express yourself clearly and directly.,
Stay calm and open.,
Cooperate to build a plan for moving forward.",How to Stop Bad Examples from Hurting Your Relationship2," Keep tabs on your feelings, and notice if you’re getting angry with your partner. If that happens, take a break and calm down before you address the problem. Breathe deeply or take a walk until you feel level-headed enough to handle a discussion without losing your cool.Don’t try to argue when you’re angry. You might say something hurtful that you’ll regret later.
Be mindful of your triggers. Pay attention to how you feel physically. For example, you might note things like shallow breathing, tensed muscles, and a racing heart. If you do notice anything like this, take time to calm down before you talk with your partner.

, Your partner isn’t your enemy – your mutual conflict is. No matter how irritated you feel with your partner, keep your focus on resolving the conflict so both of you benefit., If you’re upset with your partner, be honest. Let them know how you’re feeling and why. However, don’t say anything inflammatory or accusatory. Use “I” statements to take the edge off your message.For instance, instead of saying, “You embarrassed me,” say, “I felt embarrassed that you put me on the spot in front of my co-workers.”

, Listen to your partner’s perspective on the conflict, and don’t interrupt or argue with them. Accept that you may have contributed to the conflict, too. Prioritize solving the problem instead of trying to prove that you’re right., After you talk a problem out with your partner, work together to create a solution. Create some clear guidelines that you can both live with. Write down your plan, so that you can reference and add to it later.Making a plan is especially effective for resolving ongoing conflicts such as how to raise your kids, manage money, or divide chores.

Improve your ratio of positive to negative interactions.,
Avoid holding onto grudges.,
Use conflict as a tool for learning.,
Look for your partner’s best traits.,
Avoid complaining.,
Make time to connect.,
Share experiences.,
Listen carefully.,
Use technology thoughtfully.",How to Stop Bad Examples from Hurting Your Relationship3," As a rule of thumb, it takes five positive interactions with your partner to make up for every negative interaction. If you and your partner frequently squabble or criticize each other, change the tone of the relationship by expressing more affection, gratitude, care, and humor.Even small positive interactions can have a big impact on people’s happiness in a relationship. Try giving your partner a hug when they come home, texting them just to say hi, or thanking them when they do a chore you dislike.

, Old mistakes and hurts are in the past, so commit to leaving them behind you. Instead, focus on enjoying the present moment with your partner. Appreciate your partner’s good qualities, and don’t let yourself waste time thinking about things that are over and done., If you are patient and reflective, then you can use conflicts as a way to learn and grow. Try to be aware of your history and any baggage you might be carrying when you enter into a relationship. Also, be aware that your partner likely has some of their own baggage.

Try to let down your guard and be willing to open yourself up to this new relationship. Remember that it is an opportunity to learn new things, experience more intense joy, love, and peace, and to grow and heal together.

, Instead of waiting for your partner to impress you, practice noticing when their positive traits really shine. If you start to feel negative towards your partner, remind yourself of all the good things they’ve done lately. Give your partner positive feedback. Say something like, “I love how caring you are. You always make me feel better when I’ve had a bad day.”

, It’s normal to need to vent a little sometimes, but complaining too much just brings you down – as well as everyone else around you. If you’re prone to complaining, it can grate on your partner, so make an effort to see the bright side of life instead. Look for solutions instead of focusing only on your problems.If your partner is a chronic complainer and it bothers you, talk to them. Tell them how their complaining makes you feel, and help them come up with alternatives.
For instance, say something like, “I want to help you fix your problems, but when you complain so much, it wears me out. Maybe we could set aside ten minutes every evening just for venting, and then move on.”

, Talk with your partner daily, even if you can only spend a few minutes together. What you talk about isn’t actually that important – it’s fine to make small talk, as long as you’re not ignoring bigger issues in your relationship that need attention. Just focus on connecting with each other in a consistent, positive way.For instance, you could chat over coffee in the mornings, talk on the phone during your break at work, or catch up while cooking dinner together.

, When you do things with your partner, you’ll stay close and have more to talk about. A few simple ways to share experiences include going for an evening drive, arranging your schedules so you can have meals together, and watching a TV show or movie when you both have an evening free., When your partner talks to you, give them your full attention, even if you’re not discussing something important. Pay attention to their tone of voice and body language, not just their words. Make sure you’re understanding their message and their emotions, instead of just waiting for your turn to talk., Technology can help you communicate with your partner, but it can also drive a wedge between you. Reflect on how you can best use technology to stay connected, and avoid letting your phone and other electronics become a replacement for face-to-face time with your partner.For instance, if your partner has to travel for work, talking to each other over Skype might help you feel connected while you’re apart.

Plan time for research.,
Determine who your customers are.,
Identify the size of this market.,
Get a sense of your competitors.,
Overview what your business does.,
Explain why you chose your market.Aim for two to three sentences.,
Describe your intended customer base.,
Evaluate the values and interests of your potential customers.,
Review competitors.,
End with a product review.,
Revise for flow.",How to Write a Market Description," Before launching your business, schedule some time to compile information about your competitors, potential customers, and the industry or sector you are entering. Use government databases, like those available from the U.S. Small Business Association, for information. Business magazines, academic or trade associations, and local business bureaus can also be helpful.Before writing a market description, be aware of the “iceberg principle.” The majority of the iceberg is underwater. This represents your research time and spent energy. Only the tip is visible. The small tip is your output, e.g., website, advertising, brochures, and business cards.Your market description forms part of your business plan overall. For tips on writing a thorough business plan, see Write a Business Plan.;
, When conducting market research, it is key to identify your customers. What are the demographics of this group? For example, do they live in urban, suburban, or rural settings? Are you marketing your product to men, women, boys, or girls? Who will use your product (whether a human or animal)? What are your customers' interests? What is missing from their lives that your product could fill? How do their budgets look?For example, let's say you are starting a high-end laundering service. Your customers could be professional workers with high amounts of disposable income. They are both men and women, some with children and some without children. Your customers like to spend their time with their families and working out or taking cooking lessons. What they lack is free time.
Your potential customers would probably not include families with low amounts of disposable income, individuals who work at jobs that don’t require high-end laundering of their wardrobe, etc.

, You want to have an idea of how many customers you can expect to draw with your business. For example, if your potential customers are professional workers with high amounts of disposable income, you need to make sure that there are sufficient numbers of people in your area that match your description. If your target market is too small, your business will have a hard time remaining profitable.


Do some demographic research on your area. The SBA is a good place to start, but chambers of commerce and other offices in your community can also help. How many people matching the description of your target market live in your area? Do they tend to live in one area, or spread out?

, What is the quality of your customers’ product or service? How is their pricing? How often do their customers change? Is their website well-designed? What about their advertising? Aim to identify your competitors’ weaknesses and design your product or service to fill the hole the competitors are leaving.Try to find some of their existing customers to interview. You also could look at your competitors' reviews on websites like Yelp or tripadvisor. About what things do their customers complain? What do their customers praise?


For instance, your competitor could offer laundry services with delivery. Customers are annoyed, though, that they have to drop off their laundry. Could you create a profitable model that combines pick-up and drop-off delivery services?

, Share with your reader the purpose of your business. Explain its basic tasks or services. Write what sets it apart from the competition. Aim to provide a short, concise description of 1-2 sentences.For example, ""Petra’s Pick Up and Drop Off Laundry offers a full range of laundry services, e.g., washing, drying, ironing, dry cleaning. Our business prides itself on being the only business in the Luxesville area that offers both pick up and drop off delivery services.""

, You might talk about the ease of entry into the market, e.g., lower business taxes. Any conditions, whether financial or demographic, should be mentioned here.This section should give a clear idea of the future outlook for this market and why the need for your business exists.For example: “Our market research has shown that there are too few laundry services available to Luxesville’s highly professional population. Only two businesses exist for a population of 125,000 people and they are both located in the same neighborhood. We would like to offer our services in the up-and-coming south end of the city where young, busy professionals are flocking. Because of market trends, we anticipate demand for our services will increase by 20% in the next two years.""

, Provide an overview of your customers’ demographics.Use statistical findings to demonstrate how your product fits the market you’ve chosen. What is it about these customers, whether their age, incomes, marital statuses, sex, sexualities, etc., that makes your product well-suited for this market? You might have all these facts through official means like surveys or customer questionnaires or through observations.For example, you might write: “Because 80% of Luxesville’s residents work over sixty hours per week and thus have limited free time, laundry services are particularly attractive. Additionally, as the median income in Luxesville is $175,000, we ascertain that residents have enough disposable income to afford our services. 60% of those workers earning above the median income are women, meaning that this area has a large number of professional women. In fact, only 14% of households have a stay-at-home spouse. This means the traditional relegation of laundry to an at-home partner is less likely to occur. We plan to target professional households with high disposable income between the ages of 25-55.”

, Discuss the lifestyles, values, and behaviors of your potential customers.In this section, you define features of your product that will appeal to your customers on an emotional or personal level. You describe the benefits you are providing. For example, you might help a person’s work-life balance or improve their quality of life. You also show customers’ current opinions on existing products or services related to yours and their buying behaviors. Describe how these products are working or failing.Give concrete examples.


For example, “Luxesville’s professional population is highly educated, overworked, and extraordinarily stressed. Many of these people value any free moment of time they have to exercise, spend time with their children, or visit restaurants. They do not want to waste time on mundane tasks like grocery shopping or laundry. They are frustrated that the only laundry services available require customers to drop off their laundry during business hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Many of these professionals are not home until 8, 9, or 10 p.m. Thus, having the ability to have their laundry picked up and dropped off and to order such services online is a huge attraction.”

, Evaluate what your competitors are doing right or wrong. Some of this information might have appeared in your customer overview. That is okay. Use this moment to point out any additional points. Research your competitors and their customers, and then map out your data onto three important areas: cost, service, and technology.What are your competitors' costs, and what are they charging? What services do they provide? What technology are they using?


You can also use surveys to ask your competitors' customers about their perceptions, ask suppliers in your industry about orders, and use online tools to do market research.Provide any details about your competitors that can make your entry into the market stronger.For example, you might write, “Our competing launderers, “Drop and Sop” and “Clarity is Wearity,” are serving their maximum amount of customers. As previously noted, they both operate in the Hedgefund Forest neighborhood. Because they are family-owned enterprises, which is a positive point to some customers, they offer restricted hours and both close at 6 p.m. This does not serve the professional community. Their decision not to offer pick up services also has left many customers disgruntled. Thus, by beginning our business in the south end of the city, we hope to build a strong base and eventually expand towards Hedgefund Forest to pick up the slack of other launders.”

, Reiterate what you have to give to the market. In this section, you state your business goals through clear steps and plans. In a sense, this is your selling point. You have set up what the market is and what it lacks. Now you say how you will fill the gaps.


Examine the larger context of your products or services. You might offer information on pricing, other consumer metrics, or any other information that strengthens your point.

, Read your plan out loud. Cut down any excessive information (e.g., superfluous adjectives, too many transition words). Stick to the point but don’t forget to tell a story. Market descriptions are often persuasive. Especially if you are seeking investors, you want to sell your product but more so why your product fits the market you are trying to enter.

, (A whole list of mystery writers can be accessed on Wikipedia at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mystery_writers.) Highlight the passages, words and phrases you like best. Don't use a highlighter pen in a beloved book, just put bookmarks in to mark the pages you want to remember or sticky notes, or light pencil marks that can be gently erased. Read the highlighted parts again to nourish your mind and help you to get inspired.

, Now that you've been inspired by others, it's time to work out your own ideas and make the most of that inspiration. For a mystery story, consider these important elements:


What is the mystery?: Is something or someone missing? Has a dead body been found? Are people or pets mysteriously disappearing? Has an odd new person turned up in the town/school/local volunteer's group and caused havoc? Are things glowing a weird color at night? Is someone dog-napping? Has a supernatural event taken place? Do the neighbors seem possessed? Has a mysterious person turned up claiming to be royalty (think Princess Caraboo)? Has something precious being stolen? And so forth...
Develop a hook to get the reader reeled in from the beginning.
Who will the characters be? Who are the main protagonist and antagonist? Will you narrate in first or third person?
What is the problem and the ultimate solution? Will there be mini solutions along the way?
What clues will you lay along the trail as you write? Don't forget the red herrings too, those hints that seem like clues but are actually designed to put the reader right off the scent. For example, a good red herring is the alibi the accused doesn't wish to reveal, for fear of being embarrassed or entangled in another totally unrelated issue, but which makes the accused appear guilty in relation to the mystery needing solving.
Will the ending resolve everything or leave things on a cliffhanger? What about bringing everything to a climax midway, only to then have the reader's expectations dashed and have to get to the end before everything really becomes clear?
Will you introduce flashbacks?
What is the ""action"" element of your story? Will you include travel, transportation (think fast cars, trains or jets), fighting, wit-challenging discussions, chases, hiding out, parkour, or whatever else?
What twists will occur, such as a good character turning out bad, and vice versa?
Write out descriptions of the mystery, the setting, the characters, to help you to develop the world in which your mystery will unfold.

, After reading, think for hours. Think of the three basic parts of your mystery action story, then plot out the mystery from start to finish in your writing plan. You might like to use an app for developing a timeline or similar device to assist with the creation of your plot. Also be sure to developed well fleshed-out characters, working out now what sorts of traits they have and their roles in the mystery.


The beginning –– in what way will you introduce the characters, the mystery plot and the setting?
The middle –– seek to avoid any sense of lag or too many tangents. While a few tangents are essential to throw the reader off the scent, too many can make it over-complicated, unwieldy and overly heavy for the reader. Some lighter moments, even humor, can help to ease the tension and keep the book flowing nicely too. After all, whether or not there is a mystery involved, people still need to eat, sleep and get along together.
The end –– solve the mystery, wrap up the story and decide which characters are for the chop and which are for the sequel. The best ending in a mystery is the unexpected, so work on developing logical twists that hold water.


Once you have decided on these, you can work on developing your characters, locations and those mysterious and action packed elements.

, Try to write every day if you are planning to write a novel. Ask for and accept help from others. This may include family, friends and teachers.


Writing help can be found on wikiHow, with such articles as how to write a novel, How to overcome writer's block and How to write creatively.

, Focus on enjoying the writing journey as much as completing it, so as to gain fulfillment from the experience. This is a labor of love, so don't rush it if that's not your thing; however, it if does come to you quickly, that's fine too. If you reach dead ends while writing, retrace your steps to work out which direction would be better to take at the stage where the story seems to go stagnant or awry.

, If you get to points in your writing where you're not sure if it's mystery or plain obvious subterfuge, talk it through with others. Explain the story thus far and the dilemma that you've placed the character or characters in and whether your suggested solution or next step is plausible. Talking about it out loud can help you to clarify the sense of its direction and those listening to you may have some excellent suggestions for strengthening the mystery tale.

, After you've finished writing the story, have a break from it to gain some perspective. After the break, go through it sincerely and objectively. As you read it again, consider whether there are pieces that you could honestly have written better. Rewrite these if required.

, Take on board the elements of their suggestions that you consider would improve your story, making it more robust and believable.

Finished.",How to Write a Marriage Proposal Scene in a Novel," Your couple is getting married, and in many novels, it wouldn't make sense for them to marry a person they'd never even met before with no explanation as to why. Make sure you've written in backstory to this proposal before writing it, as it will make the proposal make a lot more sense.


Not every wedding is because the couple is in love. Some weddings are arranged marriages, while others are for ""the greater good"" - for example, one character is being threatened by a powerful villain and the only way to stop the villain is to marry someone, possibly even the villain!
Even if your story has an aspect that makes it so that strangers get married - for example, if a person in the novel's universe grows older than a certain age, they're automatically married to someone regardless of whether they know them or not - make sure that the readers are aware of this. If it's put in the book with no warning, the reader will just be confused.;
, A proposal in a fast-food joint might be humorous, but it's not very classy. The scene doesn't have to be romantic, especially if it's a forced marriage, but it should at least make sense for the situation. And if the character is nervous, show it! As shown in the examples below, it's important to write in your character's emotions. Most stories don't have romances between emotionless robots.


Rain was pattering down onto the ground and sliding down the window - the same window that Brad and Lisa had been poised at, watching the rain. Brad's hands were clenched in his pockets - one pocket being the one that held a small, velvety ring box. Now was the perfect time to propose - he knew that, he'd seen it all the time in those romance stories. But how did someone go about doing that? Did they just pull out the ring and go, ""Will you marry me?"", or wait for the other person to talk first? There were so many questions left unanswered for Brad, all of which left his heart hammering in his chest, but the biggest unanswered question for Brad was, Will she even say yes?

It was Kaori's first time out with her girlfriend since the two had gotten together, Allison remembered. No wonder Kaori was so afraid. A small prickle of guilt tugged at the blonde girl - she'd thrown Kaori's life for a loop and had forced her into dating her, just because the Shadow had threatened to hurt everyone she ever cared for unless she destroyed her engagement with her arranged fiancé. She didn't even want to marry Kaori - she didn't see the autistic girl as more than a close friend - but she knew she had no other choice. She knew it was for everyone's safety - for everyone's survival.

, Don't make the scene boring, such as the character saying, ""Will you marry me?"" and the other one automatically accepting. Put in a twist to the writing, and detail the scene well. Take a look at the examples below for some examples of better writing of a proposal scene.


""Lisa,"" Brad said suddenly, and his girlfriend turned to look at him. He was sweating, it was obvious, but he didn't care; this was his moment of bravado. He whipped the ring box out of his pocket so fast that Lisa couldn't make out what it was, and rapidly changed his position from sitting on the couch to kneeling on the floor with the box in his hands. Lisa's eyes widened and her mouth gaped as Brad sputtered, ""I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?""
The blonde-haired girl turned to Kaori, who was wringing her hands around the rubber band she often carried. ""Kaori. What if we got married? If we got married, I could break off the engagement my parents arranged for me."" But Kaori stood there silently, looking at her girlfriend uncertainly. The look of sheer terror on her face at the idea left the other one stunned. ""And I really do love you, Kaori,"" she added softly. ""I'll love you no matter how you answer this question: Do you want to get married?""
""Fool,"" the Shadow snarled in William's face, drool splattering the corners of his mouth. ""Fool! I could kill you! I could destroy the world! I'm giving you one chance to save everyone you love - one chance - and all you have to do to save everything you've ever known is marry me!""

, Not all marriage proposals end in a happy, tearful ""yes"" - some end much differently. Feel free to experiment around, but try to make sure it fits how the character would most likely react.


Lisa had her hand cupped over her mouth to try and hide her shock, but Brad could see from her eyes that she was smiling. Slowly, her head bobbed up and down in a nod, and she kneeled down, pushed the ring box down a bit, and kissed her now-fiancé, waiting for him to slide the ring onto her finger.
Kaori diverted her gaze, starting to rock back and forth on her feet, like she always did when she was nervous. ""I... Allison, you..."" She turned her head back towards Allison, but didn't quite meet her eyes. ""I mean, I accept, but... why?""
William delivered a sharp slap to the Shadow's face, leaving him stunned. ""For the record,"" William started, the boy's high-pitched voice breaking the angry fog in the room, ""I know you're a liar. I know you can't do any of the things you say you can. And I'm not going to give up my life for a liar - for an abusive, awful person. No, I won't marry you.""

, It's always important to proofread what you've written to make sure you don't have any errors. Go through the scene at least twice - once looking for obvious errors or plot holes, and the second time looking for smaller things such as spelling mistakes, grammar errors, messed-up punctuation, and so forth.


If you're writing on a computer, turn on your spellchecker. This can help you discern typos and grammar mistakes much more easily than if you have it off. Software meant for writing, such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs, will usually have this on by default.

, It's quite easy to overlook something when you've written it yourself. Get a friend with good language skills to proofread the scene, and ask them to mark any mistakes they come across.

, After you've had your friend proofread your story, go over what they marked and correct the mistakes. You may be surprised with how many mistakes your friend noticed!

, Your scene is now complete and you can move on to the next part of the story.

Consider the significance of the topic to you personally.,
Think about a specific memory pertaining to your topic.,
Think about the more vague memories or repeated events in your memory that pertain to the topic.,
Research an outside perspective on your topic.,
Consider the historical significance of the topic from an outside perspective.,
Make connections between researched perspectives and your own personal memory.,
Develop a cohesive point that is supported by your memory as well as outside research.,
Begin writing, revising, peer reviewing, and editing.","How to Write a Memoir (""The Call to Write"" Method)"," Determining a specific focus or topic for your memoir is the most important aspect, otherwise your memoir slowly turns into an uninteresting autobiography. You should focus on something that is important to you and your past, that way you can reflect meaningfully on how your subject has impacted your life. Consider what your interests/passions, memories, and concerns are, and see what subjects possibly fit in multiples of those categories, and which ones you feel like you could write extensively about.

, Take a moment and just flesh out everything you know about that topic, specifically what memories you have involving it, what you know about its history, what role it has in culture, how it is portrayed, etc. Once you write down everything you can remember, you will have an easier time organizing what exactly about your topic you would like to make a point about involving your memory.
, Take a break from your writing and just think for a few minutes. Why is this topic important to you? Why did you pick this topic? What comes to your mind when you think about all the things you exhaustively wrote? Can you come up with a cohesive or underlying theme or idea associated with this subject and, specifically, your relationship to it?

, Flesh out all the details. Now that you've pondered the significance of this topic to you personally, what big memories come to mind about this subject? Select one, or even a few that you remember very clearly, and begin to flesh out all the details. Focus on sensory details and really capturing the moment. For help with getting all of the details, check out the specific exercise ""Starting from Solitude"" in the Tips section below.

, Now that you've thought about your specific memories and given all the details, begin to think about the memories that might be cloudy or imperfect, or memories of habits and repeated events in your lifetime that prove to be relevant to the subject. These memories will be just as important in conveying to the reader what your past was like.

, Now that you've exhausted all your personal memory and perspective on the subject, it's time to get it from a different perspective. By using effective research strategies, find some credible articles and analysis of your subject or events. This information will able to be weaved into your memoir to give a sort of historical context or outside framing, which will increase the credibility and interest of your own information.
, As you find and read articles and other perspectives on the matter, consider what the general consensus is about how society views your subject as a whole. Is it controversial, with two clear sides, or is it more of a majority-driven view? Why is this subject important in the eyes of history, society, and your reader?

, Now that you have information regarding what you remember as well as information from outside viewpoints, make connections between the two. How was how you remember an event different or the same from the outside perspective's documentation of the event? How is something that was significant to you not significant historically, and vice versa? These connections will help you form a cohesive point about the subject

, What can you take away from your connections and say about your relationship with your subject? This is the important point of your piece, so it should be something that is eloquent and thought-provoking.

, Your planning is done! Now you just need to write what you have brainstormed into thoughtful paragraphs and a solid cohesive point. Make sure to revise multiple times and peer review your work to make sure it is as good as it can possibly be. These are your ideas, reflections, and assessments. You should give them the respect they deserve!

Decide on a suitable topic to write about.,
Gather a lot of ideas related to your chosen topic.,
Choose the format or type of listicle that you're aiming to write.,
Write down the list in the format you've chosen to follow.,
Flesh it out.,
Be considerate about your target audience.,
Consider the following made-up list by way of an example of a listicle.",How to Write a Listicle," Try to think of it in terms of numbers, such as ""7 Things to Do Before You Leave the House"" or ""97 Ways to Leave Your Boss"" as a way of inspiring you or think more broadly about topics you like and want to give a snapshot of, such as gardening, career advice, cooking or politics.

, Don't worry to begin with whether or not they make sense or fit the topic perfectly. When you have amassed a list of many things, then you can work through it and discard what doesn't look great but keep all the super things you have found. You might find you'd originally intended to make a list of 10 things but found 100 brilliant things to share instead, so stay open-minded.


Be sure to choose a few really unique, curious and interesting elements that your readers are either not likely to know yet or may only have an inkling about and appreciate you clarifying for them.

, There are three main approaches, namely:


Ranking the list: You might make a judgment about the value of the items being listed, from worst to best, or deadliest, or most interesting, or least creepy, etc.
Giving the list a theme: You might simply write about a theme of interest to you without specifying an exact order. For example, writing about growing large trees in a small garden or visiting relatives who live overseas.
Making a random list: Lacking in both theme or ranking, this one just throws around ideas and leaves the reader to draw their own conclusions. Probably best left to a good writer or this one will tend to leave the reader irritated by the lack of conclusions.

, Some things to consider include:


Use an odd amount of items in the list. These apparently perform better than evenly numbered lists.Go for prime numbers. Namely, ""Three secrets to keep"" or ""Five things to get excited about"".Prime numbers likely to be useful for a listicle's purpose include: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 and 23. You can look up others if you're list is really long.
Consider making lists that claim to be the ""ultimate"", ""best"", ""top"", ""major"", etc., Add the meat to the list's bones by writing something interesting about each item in the list. It's up to you what writing style you adopt, such as witty, joking, informative, disparaging, bored, etc.


Are photos going to be part of your list? If so, tell a story with them and ensure that they're good quality and interesting. Photos are an absolutely perfect way to match the message to the image, and may of themselves suggest to you what the list should consist of.For example, a bunch of photos of grumpy camels might be turned into a listicle about dealing with co-workers or fellow club members ranging across the negative spectrum, while a bunch of happy bunnies might suggest a listicle about carefree things to do during spring.

, Listicles are considered to appeal to the younger audience.This may mean that if your readership tends to be mostly older persons, the listicle should be used sparingly. On the other hand, if you're attracting the younger readers, listicles are it!

Wrap up the commentary with a summary of your thoughts.,

Confirm the commentary follows a clear outline.,
Review the commentary for spelling, grammar, and punctuation.",How to Write a Literary Commentary," Start by reading the passage once out loud to yourself and once in your head. Take the time to read each word and each sentence slowly. This will help you get in the mindset of analyzing the text and ensure you understand each detail of the text.Make sure you have a hard copy of the passage so you can mark it up as you read it. Jot down any initial thoughts or questions you may have about the text as you read it several times.

, Take a pen, pencil, or highlighter and mark any words that feel important in the text. Look for words that are bolded or italicized in the text, as this likely means they are important for the author and key to understanding the text. You may also highlight words that you do not understand or have questions about. You can then discuss these terms in your literary commentary.You should also look for words that are repeated in the text, as this means they are likely important. Notice if the same word is used in a different context in the passage and highlight each mention of the word.

, Literary commentaries follow a very simple outline and unlike an essay, do not require a thesis statement. Instead, you should analyze the structure, content, and form of the provided text in detail. The outline should look like:Introduction section: Identify the text
Body section: Discuss the main features of the text
Conclusion section: Summarize your thoughts on the text

, Begin the literary commentary by noting the basic details of the text. State the title, author, date of publication, and genre of the text. This should appear in your introduction section. You can also mention at what point in a larger work the passage occurs, if relevant.For example, you may note, “Published in 1966, Seamus Heaney’s ‘Blackberry-Picking’ is a poem that appears in his poetry collection, Death of a Naturalist.”
If the text is from a larger work, do not write about the overall plot of the larger work. You should also not include details from the author’s biography or the historical period when the text was written, unless it feels relevant to the passage.

, In the body paragraphs, think about what the text is about. Who or what is the text focusing on? What are the main ideas in the text? What is the overall purpose of the text? Who is the text written for?For example, in Seamus Heaney's poem, ""Blackberry-Picking,” the subject is two people picking a large quantity of blackberries.The themes of the poem could be nature, hunger, and decay or rot.
The poem begins with a dedication to “Philip Hobsbaum,” which means he could be the intended audience of the poem, the “you” addressed in the poem.

, The genre of the text is tied to its form, or how it appears on the page. Is the text a poem, a piece of prose, or an essay? Does the text fit in a specific genre, such as fiction, nonfiction, poetry, travel writing, or memoir?The genre and form of the text will also help you determine the structure of the text. For example, Seamus Heaney's ""Blackberry-Picking” takes the form of a poem and fits in the genre of poetry. It uses a familiar poetic structure, such as short lines of text and is broken into two stanzas.

, Ask yourself, who is speaking in the text? Identify the speaker or narrator in the text. Then, think about how the voice of the text is reflected in the word choice, the language, and the diction in the text.For example, in Seamus Heaney's ""Blackberry-Picking,” the speaker uses the first person voice. The speaker then addresses a “you” in the text, indicating there are two characters in the poem.

, The tone of the text is how the author expresses their attitude in the writing. The tone may shift or change throughout the text, such as moving from a light-hearted tone to a serious tone or from a friendly tone to a sinister tone. It is usually expressed through the diction, the point of view, and the word choice in the text. The tone also reflects the mood of the text. The mood is the atmosphere of the text, or how the text makes you feel as you experience it.


For example, in Seamus Heaney's ""Blackberry-Picking,” the tone in the first stanza is nostalgic and light. The tone then shifts in the second stanza to be more serious and dark.

, Literary devices like metaphor, simile, imagery, and alliteration are often used in writing to deepen the meaning of the text. If you notice any literary devices in the text, discuss them in the literary commentary. Name the literary devices and use them to discuss key ideas or themes in the passage.For example, if you are discussing Seamus Heaney's ""Blackberry-Picking,” you may look at a simile like “You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet/Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it.” Or you may discuss imagery like “a rat-grey fungus” or “fruit fermented.”
You can find a complete list of literary devices in literature online., Support your discussion of the text by quoting lines or sentences in the passage. Use quotation marks to note when you are quoting the text directly. Only include quotes that will support your discussion of the text.For example, if you are discussing themes of decay in Seamus Heaney's ""Blackberry-Picking,” you may quote a line like “I always felt like crying./It wasn't fair/That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.”

, End the literary commentary with a brief conclusion that reinforces your main points about the text. Discuss the relevance of the passage within the larger work. Restate your main ideas about the text but do not add new information or new thoughts in the conclusion.For example, you may end your literary commentary on Seamus Heaney's ""Blackberry-Picking” by noting how the poem fits into the poetry collection and reflects common themes in Heaney’s work.

, Once you have completed a draft of the literary commentary, read it back to yourself aloud. Listen for any sentences that sound awkward or long winded. Revise any confusing or convoluted phrases. Make sure each sentence is clear and easy to understand.You can also read the commentary aloud to someone else to get their feedback. Ask a peer, a friend, or a family member to listen to you read the commentary and then ask for their feedback.

, To do this, you can try making a reverse outline using the commentary as a guide. Make sure the commentary has a clear introduction section, body paragraphs, and a conclusion section. Confirm it follows your original outline.


You can go through the commentary and write down “introduction” or “discussion of text” next to the relevant paragraphs in the commentary. Doing this will ensure you cover all the necessary information in the commentary.

, Try reading the commentary backwards, focusing on each word to ensure it is spelled correctly. Circle the punctuation marks in the commentary and ensure you use them correctly, such as a period at the end of every sentence or a comma between words, when needed.If you are using a computer to write the literary commentary, you can use the spellcheck option in the computer program. However, you should not rely on spellcheck only to go through your work. Make sure you also do a close review of the commentary for any errors before you hand it in.

Add content, not fluff.,
Don't be afraid of ""over-explaining.""",How to Write a Lot," If you want to write more, start by putting pencil to paper and doing a free-write to get your first ideas out. This isn't going to be the final draft, so it can be helpful to get the mess that's in your mind sorted out to get a more complicated main point out to start with. Start with your opinions, even if your teacher has forbidden ""I"" statements (she's not going to see this!) and any other initial thoughts about the topic.


Try a timed writing, say ten or fifteen minutes. Don't stop moving your pencil or typing until the time is up. You can produce a lot in that amount of time, and use what you've produced to mine for main points and possible entries into your paper or essay.;
, Start with your main idea in the center of the page and draw a circle around it. This might be something general, like ""World War II"" or ""Zelda"" or something more specific, like ""Gun control in the American South."" The point of the exercise is to get your topic more specific as a way to write more.


Around your center topic, write associated main ideas that came up in your initial free-write. Aim for at least three and no more than five or six.
Around those main points, start writing associated words and ideas that those main points raise in your mind. As you see connections between them, start drawing lines to complete the ""web."" In this way, you can start to see how your argument can be created, and the relationship of the ideas that you can start explaining in your writing.

, Organize your free-writing into a series of main ideas that are unique and complicated. One way to make sure you write more, or write a long enough draft, is to thoroughly and specifically outline these ideas. What information does the reader need to know first? How can you best organize your main points into an argument that will prove what you say is true?


Often, coming up short is a result of rushing straight to the points you want to make without setting them up first or giving the reader the kinds of information they need to know what you're talking about. Outlining can help change that.

, A thesis statement is the main point that your essay is trying to make. It should be debatable, complicated, and specific. A thesis needs to ""take a stand"" on the issue or topic that you're discussing.


A good thesis should give you a lot to write, because it'll take a lot to prove it. A bad thesis would be something like, ""Zelda is the best video game."" According to who? How is it the best? Who cares? A good example of a thesis statement might be: ""By providing an immersive and complex world to explore, the Zelda series of games appeals to gamers' sense of adventure, allowing them to act out heroic fantasies ingrained in Western culture."" Think of how much that gives you to write about!

, Some teachers teach what's called the five-paragraph form in essays, though it should be taken with a grain of salt (there's no magic number). Still, it can be helpful in expanding your argument and giving you enough to write about, by aiming for at least three different supporting points to use to hold up your main argument.Each essay should have at least the following paragraphs:


Introduction, introducing your topic, summarizing your main ideas, ending with your thesis statement
Main point paragraph 1, in which you make and support your first supporting argument
Main point paragraph 2, in which you make and support your second supporting argument
Main point paragraph 3, in which you make and support your final supporting argument
A brief conclusion, summarizing the main point, showing us what you've proven

, If you've got a good thesis, one with enough complication and unique ideas, writing a lot shouldn't be a problem. If you're having trouble coming up with enough pages or words, look to revise your thesis and make it more complex.


Think of your thesis like a table top: the point of your essay is to hold it up, or it's just a useless hunk of wood. Your main points, evidence, and references act as the table legs that hold up your thesis, making it a useful piece of writing.

, A helpful and informative way to expand an already-good draft of your essay and start beefing it up a bit is to provide more context for the topic and your perspective on it.


If you're writing about Zelda, you could jump immediately into your thesis and your first points about the intricacies of the Ocarina of Time, or you could push the pause button for a minute and give us some context. What other games were out when Zelda was released? What other games from that time are still around? What do we need to know about the culture of gaming in general?

, Provide other voices in your paper, both to support your points, providing credible references and also to give you more to explore and argue with. Quote essential material and discuss the importance of the point being made to give your points more content and word-count.


Add opposing viewpoints and take the time (and space) to prove them wrong in your paper.

, Often, when you get back a marked-up paper, it will have lots of questions written in the margins, primarily questions beginning with ""Why?"" or ""How?"" You don't need to be Stephen King or Shakespeare to guess that your teacher will be looking for places to ask those questions, and you can learn to ask them yourself.


Learn to interrogate your points. Look over each sentence and ask ""Why?"" or ""How?"" depending on the point being made. Does the rest of the paragraph answer your question? Could it do more to clarify this question for a reader less informed about Zelda than you, the expert? If the answer is no, you've got more to write.

, It's easier to write a lot if you write less on a lot of different occasions. It's really hard to write a thousand words all at once, without giving your brain a break. Start working on your paper early to give yourself the time necessary to do it right.


Start well ahead of time and try to write 250 or 300 words (about a page) each day. Plan it out so you've got enough written before you can revise it and make sure it's long enough and good enough to turn in before the due date.
Try timing your work. Work for 45 minutes and then give yourself a 15 minute break to get a snack, watch TV, or play video games. If it's Zelda, call it ""research.""

, If you've got the draft together and you're still coming up short, and you can't rack your brain for anything else to say, consider adding more experts to the conversation. Research reliable sources and let them have longer quotes. If you've only taken snippets of their language, include longer quotes and ""unpack"" them by explaining what we've just read.


After each quotation, you need to explain why you've included it. You might start with ""In other words"" to elaborate on the point and connect it back to your main point. Teachers often look for ""abandoned"" quotations, which students will use to pad their page count, but if you connect it to your main points for a reason, you're making the quote worthwhile.
Don't overuse quotes. In general, for longer essays, there should be no more than a few sentences of quotation per page. In shorter essays, probably no more than one per page.

, Sometimes your brain moves faster than your reader does, and your points will blur together. Look for the places in which you transition from one point to another and see if there's an opportunity to summarize the point that's being made and preview the next point to come, giving you more words and your reader a helpful guide in the reading.

, Look for long points you've just made, or complicated places in the essay and rephrase them in simpler and more specific language. Use phrases like, ""In other words"" or ""Basically"" to start a new sentence following these portions of the text.


Avoid doing this for simple sentences and obvious points, or it'll seem like you're just fluffing up a thin essay. Unless you want to get dinged by your teacher, you don't need to write, ""Zelda's popularity in the early 90's was unmatched. In other words, there were no more popular video games than Zelda from '92-'93. Basically, Zelda was the most popular game.""

, Page counts and word counts aren't arbitrary things your teacher picks to be mean. If you're having trouble writing enough, it's because your topic and your angle on it aren't specific enough and you're not doing enough to illustrate them in your writing. So, if you're trying to write more, you need to look for solid content to add and prove those points, rather than fluffing things up with asides and pointless rambling. Fluff includes things like:


Using two or three words when one will do
Excessive use of adverbs and adjectives
Using the thesaurus to ""sound smarter""
Repeating points
Show-off attempts at humor, or ranting

, Many student writers will frustratedly exclaim that the answers to the ""Why?"" and ""How?"" questions the teacher is asking are ""obvious"" or that they don't want to beat a dead horse. Again, if this is really true, it means the thesis isn't complicated enough, and that you've got more work to do in coming up with a complicated topic. A good topic will never be over-explained.

, Once you know what you want to say with your letter, you'll have a few stylistic choices to make. Because thank-you letters are often personal, the exact style you choose will be up to you. Consider some of the following stylistic options to get an idea of how you might want your letter to look:


If you have clear handwriting, you may want to consider writing your letter by hand.
Typing and printing the letter can help make it easily readable.
You may want to consider the type of paper you are using. Different colors, textures or thicknesses can all help make your letter unique.
You should decide if you want to send your thank-you letter on paper or on a card.

, Your first step in creating your thank-you letter will be to write the opening lines. This opening will address your teacher and help set the tone of the overall letter. Carefully consider how you want to start your letter off to help make it personal, meaningful and appropriate.You'll likely want to address your teacher formally by including their honorific title and their last name. For example “To Mr. Stephenson” would be a good way to address your teacher by name.
You might start by listing a few characteristics you admire about your teacher and describe them in more detail in the body of the letter. ""Mr. Stephenson, thank you for always being so patient and helpful."" would be a nice start to your thank-you letter.
You might simply begin listing the things you are thankful for. ""I can't thank you enough for all of your help with math this year."" could be a good opening line.

, The main part of your letter will discuss the action or actions you are appreciative of. You'll want to think of what exactly it was your teacher did to help you and include that in your letter. Letting them know how they helped you is a great way to let them feel appreciated. Take a look at some of these examples to get an idea of what you might want to focus your letter on:""Thank you very much for allowing me to turn in my assignment after the due date.""
""The extra credit you offered was such a big help. Because of the extra points, I was able to pass and I have you to thank for them.""
""I can't thank you enough for your support and help while I was dealing with bullying.""

, You'll likely want to include the impact your teacher's help has had on your life. Letting them know what a positive impact their actions have had on you is a great way to show your appreciation. Try to think of the ways in which their help has made a real change in your life to let them know that they are appreciated. To help get you started, try looking at some of these examples:""Because of your help with my math homework, I feel like I'm actually looking forward to the next math course.""
""After your class, I'm certain that I want to pursue a career in chemistry.""
""I never really believed that I could do well in school. Thanks to your help, I'm doing better than I ever have.""

, When writing your letter, you may want to include certain aspects of your teacher's attitude or personality that you enjoy. These might be small personal details that you have found helpful, encouraging, inspiring or pleasant. Letting them know that you appreciate them for who they are, not just what they've done, is a great touch in your letter of thanks. Take a look at some of these examples to get an idea of what you might include in your own letter:""Thank you for always making your classes so exciting.""
""I really appreciate your sense of humor and the jokes make class a lot of fun.""
""Because of you, I find biology much more interesting than I did before.""
""I wanted to say thank you for making us students always feel welcome in your class.""

, Once you've written the body of your letter, it's time to think of a closing line. Your closing line will act as a brief summary of the letter, letting your teacher know what you're appreciative of and telling them just how much their actions meant to you. Try wrapping things up with a final “thank you” and by wishing your teacher well to complete your letter.You might write something like “Thank you again for all of your help this semester! It really was a huge help.”
Generally, you will need a closing word before signing your name. Use something like “sincerely”, “gratefully” or “respectfully” to end your letter.
Make sure you sign your letter by hand.
If you have difficulty signing your letter by hand, you can write or type your name instead.

, Before you get your letter ready to send off, you'll want to take another look at it. It's a good idea to check it over again and make sure it says exactly what you want it to. You may want to remove parts of your letter or add something else in. It can also be a good idea to check it over for any spelling or grammatical errors. Since you can't take the letter back, take your time and make sure it's perfect before sending it.


You might ask someone else to read your letter over to check for errors or offer suggestions.
Once you're sure the letter is in good shape, you can put it in an envelope and send it.

, After proofreading your letter and deciding that it's ready to send, you can deliver the letter to your teacher. The exact method you use to deliver the letter will depend on your own unique situation. However, you'll want to pick a delivery method that you feel most comfortable with.


If you wrote your letter digitally, you can try emailing it to your teacher.
If you see your teacher regularly, you might deliver it to them by hand.
You could try leaving the letter on your teacher's desk for them to find.
You can try asking your school's secretary to leave your letter in your teacher's school mailbox.
If you've graduated, you can try sending the letter to the school your teacher works at.

Proofread your essay.",How to Write a Life Story Essay," An autobiographical essay, also called a personal narrative essay, should tell the reader about your life, personality, values and goals. The essay should tell the reader what is important to you, what your values are, and any life experiences that influenced the way you experience the world.If you are writing a personal essay for a college application, it should serve to give the admissions committee a sense of who you are, beyond the basics of your application file. Your transcript, your letters of recommendation, and your resume will provide an overview of your work experience, interests, and academic record. Your essay allows you to make your application unique and individual to you, through your personal story.The essay will also show the admissions committee how well you can write and structure an essay. Your essay should show you can create a meaningful piece of writing that interests your reader, conveys a unique message, and flows well.
If you are writing a life story for a specific school assignment, such as in a composition course, ask your teacher about the assignment requirements.;
, Writing down your story in chronological order can be a good brainstorming tool and help you highlight the key moments in your life.Include important events, such as your birth, your childhood and upbringing, and your adolescence. If family member births, deaths, marriages, and other life moments are important to your story, write those down as well.
Focus on experiences that made a big impact on you and remain a strong memory. This may be a time where you learned an important life lesson, such as failing a test or watching someone else struggle and succeed, or where you felt an intense feeling or emotion, such as grief over someone’s death or joy over someone’s triumph.

, Once you have all the facts of your life down on paper, think about an experience that carries a theme. The theme of an essay should be the major idea you are trying to convey to the reader.The theme should be woven in throughout your essay and serve as a touchstone for your essay as a whole.Consider questions like:Have you faced a challenge in your life that you overcame, such as family struggles, health issues, a learning disability, or demanding academics?
Do you have a story to tell about your cultural or ethnic background, or your family traditions?
Have you dealt with failure or life obstacles?
Do you have a unique passion or hobby?
Have you traveled outside of your community, to another country, city, or area? What did you take away from the experience and how will you carry what you learned into a college setting?

, Another way to pinpoint key moments or experiences in your life is to look through your resume or C.V. Check your education and work history, as well as any special accomplishments or awards you have received.Remind yourself of your accomplishments by going through your resume. Think about any awards or experiences you would like spotlight in your essay. For example, explaining the story behind your Honor Roll status in high school, or how you worked hard to receive an internship in a prestigious program.
Remember that your resume or C.V. is there to list off your accomplishments and awards, so your life story shouldn't just rehash them. Instead, use them as a jumping-off place to explain the process behind them, or what they reflect (or do not reflect) about you as a person.

, If you have friends who have gotten into prestigious colleges, ask them if you can read their life story essays. Talk with your guidance counselor, too; often, they have sample essays you can look at, or instructional guides that include examples.


The New York Times publishes stellar examples of high school life story essays each year. You can read some of them on the NYT website., Choose one major theme to focus your essay. Think about a past experience that holds a certain theme, and try to relate it to the program or position you are applying for.For example, you may look back at your time in foster care as a child or when you scored your first paying job. Consider how you handled these situations and any life lessons you learned from these lessons. Try to connect past experiences to who you are now, or who you aspire to be in the future.
Your time in foster care, for example, may have taught you resilience, perseverance and a sense of curiosity around how other families function and live. This could then tie into your application to a Journalism program, as the experience shows you have a persistent nature and a desire to investigate other people’s stories or experiences.
Similarly, all the time spent in the kitchen with your mother, making family recipes and dishes, could be tied to your passion for uncovering and preserving ancient histories through an archaeology degree.

, The best way to make your essay stand out is to keep your story authentic and true to you. Many applicants do not have a spectacular story to share, but they can still be successful by writing about an everyday occurrence that is meaningful to them.Certain life story essays have become cliche and familiar to admission committees. Avoid sports injuries stories, such as the time you injured your ankle in a game and had to find a way to persevere. You should also avoid using an overseas trip to a poor, foreign country as the basis for your self transformation. This is a familiar theme that many admission committees will consider cliche and not unique or authentic.Other common, cliche topics to avoid include vacations, ""adversity"" as an undeveloped theme, or the ""journey""., A thesis statement will convey to your reader the points or arguments you are going to make in your essay, including the theme of the essay. It acts a road map for your paper and should answer the question, “What is this essay about?” It should show that you have thought about your experience you are going to share and have drawn conclusions from your reflections.Try to phrase your thesis in terms of a lesson learned. For example, “Although growing up in foster care in a troubled neighborhood was challenging and difficult, it taught me that I can be more than my upbringing or my background through hard work, perseverance, and education.”
You can also phrase your thesis in terms of lessons you have yet to learn, or seek to learn through the program you are applying for. For example, “Growing up surrounded by my mother’s traditional cooking and cultural habits that have been passed down through the generations of my family, I realized I wanted to discover and honor the traditions of other, ancient cultures with a career in archaeology.”
Both of these thesis statements are good because they tell your readers exactly what to expect in clear detail.

, Begin your essay with a hook that will draw the reader in, such as a striking anecdote or fact that relates to your experience.An anecdote is a very short story that carries moral or symbolic weight. It can be a poetic or powerful way to start your essay and engage your reader right away. You may want to start directly with a retelling of a key past experience or the moment you realized a life lesson.
For example, you could start with a vivid memory, such as this from an essay that got its author into Harvard Business School: ""I first considered applying to Berry College while dangling from a fifty-food Georgia pine tree, encouraging a high school classmate, literally, to make a leap of faith.""This opening line gives a vivid mental picture of what the author was doing at a specific, crucial moment in time and starts off the theme of ""leaps of faith"" that is carried through the rest of the essay.
Another great example clearly communicates the author's emotional state from the opening moments: ""Through seven-year-old eyes I watched in terror as my mother grimaced in pain.""This essay, by a prospective medical school student, goes on to tell about her experience being at her brother's birth and how it shaped her desire to become an OB/GYN. The opening line sets the scene and lets you know immediately what the author was feeling during this important experience. It also resists reader expectations, since it begins with pain but ends in the joy of her brother's birth.
Avoid using a quotation. This is an extremely cliche way to begin an essay and could put your reader off immediately.If you simply must use a quotation, avoid generic quotes like “Spread your wings and fly” or “There is no ‘I’ in ‘team’”. Choose a quotation that relates directly to your experience or the theme of your essay. This could be a quotation from a poem or piece of writing that speaks to you, moves you, or helped you during a rough time.

, Though the essay should be professional and not too casual in tone or voice, it should also reflect your personality. The essay is a chance for you to express your unique perspective to the reader and give them a sense of who you are.Always use the first person in a personal essay. The essay should be coming from you and should tell the reader directly about your life experiences, with “I” statements.For example, avoid something such as “I had a hard time growing up. I was in a bad situation.” You can expand this to be more distinct, but still carry a similar tone and voice. “When I was growing up in foster care, I had difficulties connecting with my foster parents and with my new neighborhood. At the time, I thought I was in a bad situation I would never be able to be free from.”

, One of the biggest mistakes writers make when writing their life story is forgetting that their readers weren't there to experience it with them. Give your readers plenty of sensory detail and contextual information so that they can understand what your life was like and how it has shaped you.For example, consider this statement: ""I am a good debater. I am highly motivated and have been a strong leader all through high school."" This gives only the barest detail, and does not allow your reader any personal or unique information that will set you apart from the ten billion other essays she has to sift through.
In contrast, consider this one: ""My mother says I'm loud. I say you have to speak up to be heard. As president of my high school's debate team for the past three years, I have learned to show courage even when my heart is pounding in my throat. I have learned to consider the views of people different than myself, and even to argue for them when I passionately disagree. I have learned to lead teams in approaching complicated issues. And, most importantly for a formerly shy young girl, I have found my voice."" This example shows personality, uses parallel structure for impact, and gives concrete detail about what the author has learned from her life experience as a debater.

, Avoid passive sentences or weak sentences. Use active verbs and show when possible. Only tell the reader something, for example, “I was in the basement when this happened” when you are summarizing an experience.An example of a passive sentence is: “The cake was eaten by the dog.” The subject (the dog) is not in the expected subject position (first) and is not ""doing"" the expected action. This is confusing and can often be unclear.
An example of an active sentence is: “The dog ate the cake.” The subject (the dog) is in the subject position (first), and is doing the expected action. This is much more clear for the reader and is a stronger sentence.

, This tactic will help you develop your essay so it flows smoothly from section to section, or paragraph to paragraph.Lead the reader INTO your story with a powerful beginning, such as an anecdote or a quote.
Take the reader THROUGH your story with the context and key parts of your experience.
End with the BEYOND message about how the experience has affected who you are now and who you want to be in college and after college.

, Once you have completed an initial draft, step away from it for a time to get some distance and perspective. This will help you return to the essay and read it with a critical eye. It will also help you put yourself in the shoes of your reader., Focus on individual sentences to see if they sound obvious, trite, or banal. Note any long-winded or confusing sentences and mark them so you can edit them down. Avoid starting every sentence with “I” and make sure you vary your sentence structure throughout the essay.For example, a sentence like “I struggled during my first year of college, feeling overwhelmed by new experiences and new people” is not very strong because it states the obvious and does not distinguish you are unique or singular. Most people struggle and feel overwhelmed during their first year of college. Adjust sentences like this so they appear unique to you.
For example, consider this: “During my first year of college, I struggled with meeting deadlines and assignments. My previous home life was not very structured or strict, so I had to teach myself discipline and the value of deadlines.” This relates your struggle to something personal and explains how you learned from it.

, Focus on spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Read your essay backwards so you only pay attention to the words themselves and not their meaning within a sentence.It can be difficult to proofread your own work, so reach out to a teacher, a mentor, a family member, or a friend and ask them to read over your essay. They can act as first readers and respond to any proofreading errors, as well as the essay as a whole.

Take care of the technicalities.,
Begin with a title page.,
Include the abstract after the title page.,
Understand how to format the different levels of heading.",How to Write a Manuscript in ASA Format1," There are a number of small technical features that are characteristics of ASA. Although they are only minor details, it is very important to get them correct. Remember to:


Choose a legible font; it should generally be 12 point.
Set margins to 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) on all sides, unless otherwise specified.
Double space the lines of the text.
Number your pages beginning with the title page. Number graphs or tables in order, as well.
Only use one space after end punctuation.
Use italics to place emphasis on a word.
Use footnotes or endnotes to add more information.;
, Center the title horizontally at least five lines down from the top of the page. Use title case for capitalization, meaning you only capitalize the important words. Don’t capitalize prepositions, articles, or conjunctions unless they are at the beginning or the end or follow colons. Besides the title, you should also include the author’s name, as well as the university or organization the author(s) are affiliated with. It’s standard to include a word count on this page.


An example of a title case capitalization would be: “The Mad Dog in the Fog”.

, If you need to include an abstract, it should go after the title page. The abstract is a short summary of your paper. It should include your thesis, your main ideas, and your conclusions, all written as concisely as possible in about 100 words. You want to give your reader enough of your argument so that she knows if she wants to read the whole thing for her research.


Begin the text of the paper on a new page. Use the title again here.

, You generally use three levels of subheadings in papers. With the top level, capitalize all letters in the heading. With the second level, use title case. With the third heading, use sentence case for capitalization, meaning you only capitalize the first letter of the heading and the first letter after a colon. Don’t use a bold font for any heading, but do use italics for the third level. Also, the third level should be pushed all the way to the left. The headings levels look like this:


LEVEL ONE HEADINGS
Level Two Headings
Level 3 headings

"
"
Stay objective and professional.,
Speak of research in the past.,
When using an acronym, spell it out the first time.,
Be careful with numbers.",How to Write a Manuscript in ASA Format2," When writing a manuscript in ASA format, it’s very important that you remain objective and professional while writing the paper. Specifically, pay attention to the following:


Use third person. In other words, don’t use “I,” “we,” or “you” unless allowed by your professor.
Try to keep the language as simple as possible. Don’t use unnecessary jargon or vocabulary.
Avoid using gendered words. For instance, use “humankind” instead of “mankind.” Similarly, avoid any racist language.
Use original thought. Don’t steal other people’s ideas without crediting them.

, Generally, when writing a scientific paper, you give a literature review. All that means is that you provide a summary of research that has been done on similar topics to your own. Since that research was done in the past, use past tense verb tense to write about it.


For instance, you would say that “Roberts researched rats,” (past tense) rather than “Roberts researches rats” (present tense). Also, use past tense when describing your own methodology.
However, you are free to choose past or present tense for your results section. Just be sure to stick with what you choose throughout the section.

, For instance, this article uses the acronym “ASA” to stand for “American Sociological Association,” but it was spelled out above before the acronym was used. Normally, you would even spell it out in a title if it hasn’t been used in the text.


However, you should always spell out names of states, countries, provinces, and so on, instead of using abbreviations.

, As with most style guidelines, write out numbers one through nine and numbers at the beginning of a sentence, but use numbers for 10 and above.


Also, use numbers for decimals (9.82) and other measurements but not for fractions (two-fifths).
For very large numbers, use “million” or “billion” instead of using numbers for all of it (5.3 million).

"
"
Understand how to do in-text citations.,
Learn how to do citations on the “Works Cited” page.,
Cite a journal article.,
Alphabetize your works cited page by the authors’ last names.",How to Write a Manuscript in ASA Format3," For in-text citations, always include the last name of the author or authors and the year of publication. Use the author’s name at the beginning of the sentence to introduce the author (“Roberts (1982) wrote that…”) or at the end of the sentence as an in-text citation (“The sky is blue (Roberts 1982).”).


Include a page number when you are directly quoting from somewhere else and when you are paraphrasing.
Whether at the end or beginning, the page number follows the date with just a colon in between and no spaces: “Roberts (1982:171) wrote that ‘The sky is blue.’” or “’They sky is blue’ (Roberts 1982:171).”

, For the end of the paper, begin a reference with the last name of the author, followed by the first names or initials and a period, like “Roberts, Grace D.”


Next, add the date: “Roberts, Grace D. 1982.”
Follow it with the title of the book. Use title-case capitalization and italics: “Roberts, Grace D. 1982. All the Colors of the Rainbow.”
Finally, use the place of publication and the publisher, separated by a colon and a space: “Roberts, Grace D. 1982. All the Colors of the Rainbow. Grandbury, Oklahoma: Books for Nerds Press.”

, For a journal article, follow a similar format to the book example. Begin with the author’s name, last name first: “Grace, Roger.” Follow it with a period.


Next, add the year: “Grace, Roger. 1999.” Also use a period here.
Now, add the journal article’s name in quotations with a period. Use title-case capitalization (capitalize important words): “Grace, Roger, 1999. ‘Green Is the Best Color.’” Follow that with the journal’s name in italics, also in title-case: “Grace, Roger, 1999. ‘Green Is the Best Color.’ RoyGBiv Journal”
After the journal title, place the volume number (without any punctuation) and the issue number (in parenthesis), followed by a colon: “Grace, Roger, 1999. ‘Green Is the Best Color.’ RoyGBiv Journal 57 (2):” Most of this information can be found on a database’s biographical page for the journal article or at the front of the journal (if not actually on the journal article).
Finally, include the page numbers for the article: “Grace, Roger, 1999. ‘Green Is the Best Color.’ RoyGBiv Journal 57 (2):267-298.” Don’t make a space between the colon and page numbers, and end it with a period.

, Also, double space the page just like the rest of your paper.

Check for problems with formatting or quote incorporation.",How to Write a Language Analysis," The purpose of this type of essay is to identify the persuasive rhetorical devices used by an author of a specific piece of writing. This involves a thorough analysis of many portions of the text that seem to be particularly persuasive.


For a language analysis, the text to be analyzed is usually chosen for you by your teacher. So you won't have to panic about choosing an appropriate text to analyze.;
, To prepare yourself to write a language analysis essay, it is crucial for you to fully immerse yourself in the source and uncover all of the moments in the source in which the author is using language to persuade.


The effectiveness of this type of essay depends on your ability to parse through the source material and uncover the moments of persuasion present, identify these moments, and explain their effectiveness to the reader. To this end, you must familiarize yourself with different kinds of rhetorical devices and persuasive techniques used by writers.

, In the end, the main reason someone writes a language analysis (other than the fact that the professor assigned it!) is to identify how an author attempts to sway another person or group of people to feel a certain way about a subject through the use of rhetorical persuasive devices.


Some common persuasive techniques include logical fallacies and rhetorical appeals (to ethos, pathos, or logos).

, Typically, the language analysis assignment includes specific source material in the form of articles or other texts. The first step to writing your language analysis is to read over these thoroughly and make notes.


Try an initial scan, followed by a more thorough detail reading. Reading once broadly and another time in detail can help you to define the overall ideas of the article or articles. Then go back and focus on the details you want to use in your language analysis.

, Identify the places in the text where the author uses persuasive language. You'll need a way to effectively mark these elements to identify the aspects that you want to use. Highlighting is a common way to do this.


Taking notes as you go (by highlighting or underlining) will save you a lot of time later when you want to go back to the text for details to support your claims.

, The point of performing a language analysis is to identify how an author uses language and rhetoric to persuade their readers about a certain idea. Determine what their point of view is so that you more easily identify their rhetorical techniques.


Understanding an author's intention and point of view will help you organize your own thoughts and formulate your analysis.

, It is essential that you understand all of the factors in the situation surrounding the text you are analyzing. These elements combined form the rhetorical situation of the issue.Rhetorical situations usually involve employing language that is intended to persuade someone toward a particular view or belief. That is why rhetoric is important in a language analysis essay. These types of essays aim to uncover specific language used by authors in order to persuade readers.

, Diction and word choice are very important in language analyses. Authors choose specific words for specific purposes and it is important to be able to identify the differences in meaning that result because of these choices.


For example, if an author uses the word terminate to indicate an ending, this has a much more final, definite ending than to simply say that something is finished or came to an end. Choosing this word over others is a deliberate act on the part of the author, one that can be interrogated in a language analysis essay.

, These techniques are often implemented in arguments to help persuade the reader to believe the author's opinion.


An appeal to ethos is an ethical appeal that emphasizes the reliability or credibility of the author and their sources to prove a point.
An appeal to logos is a logical application of evidence that appeals to the readers sense of logic or reason.
An appeal to pathos is a rhetorical technique that weighs on people's emotions to sway their opinion one way or another.

, Logical fallacies are errors or weaknesses in an argument.There are many different kinds of logical fallacies, but they all serve the same purpose: to persuade the reader to agree with the author's viewpoint.


One example of a logical fallacy is a hasty generalization.This fallacy involves reaching a conclusion before you have gathered adequate evidence on the subject. An example of a hasty generalization would be that all cows are black with white spots because you've seen three cows and all three of them were black with white spots.

Another example of a logical fallacy is a slippery slope argument.This fallacy involves arguing that if one event is allowed to happen, it will inevitably lead to an extreme and undesirable result. An example of a slippery slope argument would be: If we allow one hotel to be built on the lake, pretty soon the whole place will be worse than Las Vegas.


,


In his play As You Like It, William Shakespeare’s Jacques famously says, All the world's a stage, / And all the men and women merely players: / They have their exits and their entrances.This is a metaphor that compares the action of real life with the action of a theatrical play. Shakespeare says that world is a stage and all the people are actors, not merely that they are like actors.

, Analogies are comparisons between two things that intend to help the reader understand a situation or event. Usually, authors compare a known thing with a lesser known thing to help the reader understand the lesser known thing. Unlike metaphors that compare a thing by saying it is another thing, analogies say that something is like something else.


For example, saying she was as quiet as a mouse is an analogy that lets the reader know something about the subject, she, by relating a fact about her to a fact everyone knows (that mice are quiet).

, Your thesis statement will be a concise idea that sums up your author's view/claim in the work you are analyzing. The thesis usually appears at the end of the introduction paragraph. Having this idea in mind early on in the reading process will help guide your reader through the rest of your essay paper.


A good thesis statement is concise and clear. It tells the reader what the point of the paper is and why it's important. The thesis must make a claim of some sort.For this type of essay, your thesis claim will probably be something like this: Through his use of ______ (whatever rhetorical technique you think your author employs), this author attempts to _______ (whatever you think the purpose of his persuasion is).

Here is an example of a strong thesis statement: Excessive meat consumption in America is the leading cause of pollution today, and, thus, is a significant influence on global warming. This thesis makes a claim (specifically a cause and effect claim) about a debatable topic with a narrow enough focus to create an interesting, manageable argumentative essay.
Here is an example of a weak thesis statement: Pollution is a problem in the world today. This is not a debatable issue; few people would argue that pollution is not a problem. The topic is also too broad. You can't write a paper on every single aspect of pollution.

, This format is constricting and limits the shape your ideas can take to being contained in three basic body paragraphs. Without the three-part thesis statement, your ideas can expand more freely and incorporate ideas that might not fit exactly into the three parts.


An example of a three-part thesis statement might look something like this: Global warming is caused by industrial pollution, automobile exhaust fumes, and waste dumping in the oceans. In this case, you would expect to find three body paragraphs: one about industrial pollution, one about car exhaust fumes, and one about trash in the ocean. Any other causes of pollution would not fit anywhere in this essay, which restricts the meaning and the message of the paper.
Changing the thesis to avoid this form will make for a much more functional essay that is written at a more advanced level. A more effective thesis would be something like this: Due to increasing global temperatures and rising ocean levels, global warming has become an issue that needs to be acknowledged by a wider audience in order to begin reversing the effects.


, This section should briefly explain the essay topic and include relevant background information to familiarize the reader with the topic. As previously mentioned, your thesis statement should typically appear at the end of the introduction.


A good introduction should give enough background information that the reader feels intrigued and knows what to look for in the rest of the paper.

, Carefully present information that supports your thesis claim that this author is utilizing certain rhetorical techniques to achieve a certain goal. Outline each instance where you see this happening and explain your logic/reasoning to your readers. Identify the purpose of your essay (why it's important to understand the author's rhetorical appeals) and the point of the text being analyzed (why the author wanted to persuade their audience to begin with).

, The aim of this section is to reassert your argument and persuade the audience to support your claim. Try to connect the essay topic to the interests and values of the audience.


Be sure to review your main points and restate your thesis. But make sure not to introduce any new information in the conclusion so that you can effectively wrap up what you've already said.

, Often, it's possible to get so wrapped up in your own writing that it's easy to skip over obvious errors and mistakes. Take a break from writing for at least a few hours. Sometimes leaving your work for a couple of days can be incredibly beneficial as well. Looking at your work with fresh eyes will allow you to see the errors you previously overlooked because you were so involved in the writing that you could only see what you meant to say rather than what you actually said.

, Developing a creative, original title is a fantastic opportunity to hook your readers into wanting to read more of your paper before they even get to the introduction. Writing it after you have completed your essay adds a bit of polish and helps you encapsulate the entirety of your argument.

, Re-read the assignment (if you were given a handout), then re-read your essay. Be sure that your argument flows, that you prove the thesis you set out to prove with solid textual evidence, and that you are doing everything that the assignment asked of you.

, Here are some of the most common grammar mistakes:


Sentence fragments.Fragments are incomplete phrases that cannot stand alone as a sentence because they are missing either a verb, a noun, or a complete thought.
Parallelism.Errors in parallelism occur when words or groups of words do not appear in the same format or structure within a sentence.
Subject-verb agreement.Errors with subject-verb agreement happen when an incorrect verb form is used with a particular subject. For example, he know instead of he knows.


, If you use sources, formatting quotes properly allows your reader to easily find the information you are referencing. It also adds to your credibility as an author.

Choose a broad category.,
Do some preliminary research in the narrowed field.,
Choose resources based on your level of study.,
Continue to explore the topic.,
Make sure your topic is not too broad, but not too narrow either.,
Begin by organizing your research.,
Look at previous studies that focus on what you want to do.,
Determine what part of the experiment you will manipulate.,
Based on your research, predict how the experiment will turn out.,
Write a formal hypothesis.,
Be as specific as possible.,
Have someone read over your hypothesis.",How to Write a Hypothesis for an Essay," Hypotheses are mainly used in the sciences, but you still need to narrow down the field. If your class is in organic chemistry or botany, you still need to narrow down the field even further. Choose a particular aspect of the field, such as genetics in botany.;
, It’s fine to use Wikipedia at this point, but you shouldn’t stop there. Look at online articles in databases, accessible through your library, library books, and journal articles.


It’s easy to use the library database at your local library. Once you locate the library’s databases, you should pick out ones that are focused on science articles.
Most libraries have some form of EBSCOhost, and if you use advanced search, you can select the databases you want, such as Science and Technology or Science Reference Center.
Once you’ve decided on databases, you can use search terms to find what you need. Ask your librarian can help you if you’re having trouble.

, More basic articles will be helpful when you’re just getting started. In fact, if you can find chapters from other textbooks, that can be helpful. However, also looking at studies others have done can give you an idea of what you want to do.


As a high school student, you’ll want to stick to more basic stuff; you can find databases geared towards your level, and your librarian should be able to point you in the right direction.
If you’re a college student, you should be able to use most of what you find in the academic databases. You can also use your textbook to help you decide what you want to study, as well as whose theories you will base your own experiment on.
For instance, maybe you want to study Gregor Mendel’s techniques with genetics and plants.

, Read articles in databases and books in the library. Be sure to take notes and remember to note down where each piece of information came from, including the author, title, date, publisher, city of publication, and page number. You need this information so you can make a bibliography later.


It’s best to keep all of the bibliographical information together so you can find it again. Just make sure you jot down the name of the author when you begin taking notes from a source, so you know what bibliographic entry it came from.
You should also note where you found the article or book, as well, so you can go back to it if you need to do further research.

, You want something manageable, not something that could end up being multiple projects. Be realistic - you won’t be able to cover genetics and psychology and eating habits in one paper. Your paper needs to cover one topic only.


It is possible to be too narrow, but it is easier to expand it a bit if you need to rather than to condense it after you’ve tried to tackle too much research. If you are a younger student, such as a high school student, you may just want to repeat Mendel’s experiments to see how they work.
If you are an older student, such as a graduate student, your work will need to be more original. You will need to put your own spin on plants and genetics. Maybe you want to study how splicing together two plants changes the genes of the plant over time.

, That is, pull together like ideas. Walden University suggests making categories for your research.That is, with a paper on hybrids, you might want to make one category on Mendel’s research, one for newer studies that are similar, one for splicing, and one for the type of cucumber you are using.

, That is, make sure you know what has already been done in your field. Find similar studies that are relevant to your research.

, What you manipulate is determined by what you want to study. For instance, with the splicing of plants, maybe you want to focus on how to manipulate cucumbers to produce a particularly crisp fruit through splicing.


To conduct the experiment, you will splice plants that manifest certain characteristics to see which produces the desired results. In this case, you are manipulating genes by picking plants for certain characteristics.
According to Explorable, the point of an experiment is to change one variable while controlling other ones and watching for changes.That is, with the cucumbers, you would need a control, such as splicing one set of cucumber plants at random, noting its characteristics, instead of choosing for a particular characteristic. Then you compare the fruit each type of plants produce.

, In the case of splicing plants, it seems likely that if you are always picking the plants that have the crispest fruit, you will end up with crisper fruit over time.

, Begin with what you want to test. In this case, you’re testing a theory about splicing plants, crisp cucumbers, and how genes change over time.


Also include how you plan to carry out the experiment and what you expect to happen. Because a hypothesis is a guess about what will happen, you have to spell out for your reader what you're thinking.
Start putting it together into a formal sentence. Basically, your hypothesis is how you tell your reader in one concise sentence what you are going to do. You are boiling it down as much as possible.

, For instance, if you are specifically looking at Armenian cucumbers, you should include the scientific name. Basically, you need to write out your guess in a formal manner, using specific details.For instance, for this experiment, you could write something like, “This experiment will test the hypothesis that selecting Armenian cucumbers (scientific name Cucumis melo var. flexuosus) for crispiness and splicing those plants together will, over time, produce a crisper cucumber, and this hypothesis will be tested by selecting cucumbers for crispiness to splice with cucumbers with similar traits, along with a control group for comparing results.”
This hypothesis is specific, it tells what you want to do, and it gives an idea of how you are going to do it.

, Usually, your teacher or professor will have no problem reading your hypothesis to see if you are on the right track.

Be sure to have a great intro.,
Use descriptive language!,
Create your conclusion.,
Start your story in a way that grabs the reader's attention.,
Evoke your reader's five senses.,
Describe your character(s)' thoughts and emotions.,
Show don't tell.","How to Write a Good, Descriptive Story"," It'll pull the reader into the story. For example, ""I stood there on the great mountain fortress, waiting, watching. I wasn't sure what I was waiting for, but I knew I had to be there. It was like it was meant to be."";
, Adjectives are beautiful descriptive words like red, soft, slimy, magnificent, horrid, or scaly. The reader will be able to easily picture what's going on in the story. For example, ""The red, slippery snake slithered in between the two thick, green thickets of leaves.""

, A catchy ending. Do NOT use ""The End"". It's boring! Use something great; something that no one has ever used before. For example, ""As I realized my journey was over, I looked into the velvet blue sky. The clouds were black as night. I still had won, but I didn't get my last wish which was for me to find my mother.""

, Unless you're writing a fairytale, you typically don't want to start by saying ""Once upon a time..."" Instead, go for something immediately grabs the reader's interest like ""Mary dropped to the ground as an explosion tore through the forest."" The reader is immediately introduced to the main character and to the main action.


Don't start with exciting action only to segue immediately into several pages of backstory and exposition. The reader will be irritated that their interest was piqued only to slog through the boring parts.
For example: if you start your story with Mary and the explosion, continue with that, without going into pages of description of what the forest looked like and what it was doing there and what Mary looked like and Mary's entire history. Instead, get on with what Mary is doing in the forest and what caused the explosion.

, Describe what things look like, what they smell like, what sounds can be heard, and what sensations can be felt. This way the reader will feel like they are directly apart of the action and can easily visualize what is happening.


For example, describe Mary feeling the burning heat of the explosion, have it singe her hair so that she can smell burning hair. Have Mary choke on the acrid smoke and cough. Have Mary's ears ring from the force and the noise of the explosion (and this can be a plot point, for example having Mary get captured, because she couldn't hear her attackers over the ringing in her ears).
Of course, only describe the things that are important to your story. You can do a little setting of the stage, giving the reader a sense of what the area looks like, but don't overwhelm your reader with every single little detail. Trust your reader to have some imagination.

, Allowing the reader insight into your character(s) will make them empathize more with the character and feel more connected to them. Talk about how the events of the story make them feel. How do they change emotionally because of what happens to them and what they make happen because of that?


For example: Mary might be feeling horrified by the explosion in the forest, because she's dedicated her life to preserving forest habitat, or because one of her friends is near the center of the explosion. Maybe she's devastated because of the explosion, or angry. Or horrified, devastated, and angry.
Reflect how their thoughts and emotions change over the course of the story. You don't want a static character who does not change at all, neither do you want a character who changes in completely nonsensical ways. For example: Mary might start of the story ashamed that she did not stand up against the people who created the explosion, and over the course of the narrative develop strength and courage that allows her to defeat the bad guys.

, This is the big rule that creative writing teachers and authors across the world bring up. You do not want to spoon-feed your reader your story. You want to use words and language that get across what you're trying to say without having to come right out and say it.


For example: instead of saying ""Mary was angry about the explosion"" you could say something like ""Mary's hands curled into fists as she saw the smoking ruin that had once been her beautiful forest. She hardly felt the sharp points of her fingernails digging into her palms. Everything that she had worked so hard to maintain, was gone. It wasn't only the acrid smoke that made her eyes water.""

Put it on paper.,
Consider your audience.,
Do a little pre-writing.,
Open the letter clearly.,
Share your feelings with your reader.,
Have some moments of lightness as well.,
Talk about them.,
Offer your support, if necessary.,
Use strong words specific details.,
Keep it short.,
End the letter appropriately.,
Recopy the letter if necessary.",How to Write a Heartfelt Letter," A handwritten letter conveys sincerity from the moment it arrives. Your reader knows you mean it. You have to wait a few days, but this usually isn't bad. The payoff is worth the delay.


If you can't write a hand-written letter, for some reason, then word-process it and print it out if at all possible. E-mails aren't usually the best way to have serious, heart-felt communications, but it'll also be fine in a pinch if it's necessary. Just make sure your copyedit all e-mails and follow the rules of usage and grammar, as if you were writing for school.;
, To begin, think about the person you are writing to and why you want to write them a letter. Is it an apology? A thank you? An invitation? Condolences? Whatever it is, make sure you know why you are writing to this person. If you don't know why you're writing the letter, the won't know why they are reading it.


What are your intentions for the letter? It's also very important that your biggest goal is to express yourself, not to induce a certain outcome. For example, if you are writing a love letter, your goal is to express how much you care about this person. Your goal in writing this letter isn't to start a relationship, so don't write to them as if that's your goal.

, For some it is easy it just spill out what is felt on the inside. In order for your writing to have any meaning you need to focus on your truthful feelings and emotion. On a piece of scratch paper or a notepad that's sitting around consider who you are writing your letter to and the topic of the letter. No matter how heartfelt you are in your writing, if the person receiving the letter does not see the importance of what you are trying to get across they may not respond the way you would like them to. Once you have full confidence in what you want to say and you get your thoughts all sorted out start writing.

, Don't beat around the bush. Start your letter by telling them why you are writing them a letter. If you already know, it's important to share the reason with your reader. Write something like: ""I'm writing to you because I haven't seen you in so long. I miss you and want to catch up.""


Formatting-wise, begin the letter by writing ""Dear _____,"" at the top of the letter, adding in their name or names.
This works, regardless of your intentions in writing the letter, or if you're writing for multiple reasons: ""I heard about the passing of your mother, and I am so very sorry.""

, If you're writing an apology, you might feel scared that they're still angry or worried that you hurt them too badly to recover a relationship. If you're writing a thank you, you might feel grateful to have friends who care about you. If you're writing an invitation, you might feel excitement at the thought of spending time together. Whatever it is that you're feeling, express that here.

, If someone has passed away, you can write a funny or nice thing you remember about the deceased. If you're trying to reconnect with someone after a long time, you might want to share a story about something that's happened to you recently. A heartfelt letter does not have to be serious the whole way through, although sometimes they might be. When thinking about a story, ask yourself if this is something you truly want to share with them. If you do, it'll come across on paper. If you don't or don't feel like a story is appropriate, leave it out.

, Truth is, even the sincerest, most loving people think about themselves a lot and like to hear about themselves. If you put important stuff in the middle of a ramble about your life, your news, your feelings, your reader may miss it and get the wrong message. Bad!


If your feelings are an important subject in the letter, state them succinctly. If possible draw connections to your reader's role in those feelings. Don't assume you know your reader's feelings. ""I hope you feel..."" is fine. So is ""If you feel..."" ""I know you feel..."" is not. Give them room to have their own feelings.

, If this person is going through something difficult, you might want to let them know that you are there and want to offer your support. Be specific if you can. You can say something like ""Give me a call whenever you like,"" or ""Let me know if there's anything around the house that needs doing.""


If you're writing an apology, you can offer them your regret and willingness to listen. No matter why you are writing, make sure that your offer is sincere. It should be something you truly think they might need or like, otherwise it'll come off as hollow.
Think of this as a chance to extend yourself toward them. It's up to them whether they want to grab your hand and talk, meet up, join you, accept help, forgive or whatever their reaction might be. This way, they know that you aren't offering empty words, and they might feel more comfortable reaching out.

, The most important thing when you're writing any letter is to use not fancy words, complicated words, or long words, but to use the right words. Writing your heart out means that you need to use correct words to express what you're feeling. Use vivid details to make your intentions clear.


It's good to use good words, but don't get addicted to the thesaurus. Sometimes, saying that you were out for a ""stroll"" might be the most appropriate word, but most of the time calling it a ""walk"" will be a lot

, Letters are best when they're clear, concise, and heartfelt. Depending on the purpose of the writing and the reader, it's usually best to keep most letters to no more than a few pages. Short also encourages a call or meeting, which is good for anything important.


There's no right length for a letter. Go as long as the letter takes to express everything that you need to express.

, To close, think of an appropriate salutation. Sincerely is always good, as is ""Yours sincerely."" If you are close, you can use ""Love."" Other choices might be ""Your friend,"" ""With gratitude,"" ""Thinking of you,"" or ""Thank you."" This is one more opportunity to express your feelings to them. Then sign your name, and you have finished your heartfelt letter.

, You may go back and read your letter before sending. You can correct, add or take out, but only do so for the sake of clarity and hand-writing.


If you're written anything defensive or aggressive, take it out. Even if you are expressing anger, there shouldn't be any aggression in the letter.

For example, if you were writing about your best friend your topic sentence might be something like this: ""Allie is a really great friend."";
, The tomato is going to be a detail. A detail should some how connect with the topic sentence. An example is: ""Allie is always there for me, no matter what.""

, The cheese is going to be another detail that connects with the topic sentence. An example is; ""Allie is a really good friend because she helps me with my homework.""

, The burger is just another detail that connects with the topic sentence. An example is: ""Allie is lots of fun when we play together.""

, An example is: ""Allie is a really good friend because she makes me happy when I am sad.""

, The onions will be the last detail that connects with the topic sentence. An example is: ""Allie shares her lunch with me, when I forget mine.""

, It will wrap up the whole paragraph. An example is: ""I am really glad Allie is my friend and I would not be the person I am today without her.""

, Here's our example in all its glory.
Allie is a really great friend. Allie is always there for me, no matter what. Allie is a really good friend because she helps me with my homework. Allie is lots of fun when we play together. Allie is a really good friend because she makes me happy when I am sad. Allie shares her lunch with me, when I forget mine. I am really glad Allie is my friend and I would not be the person I am today without her.
If you think your paragraph is of a similar structure and quality as this example, well done, you've written a hamburger paragraph.

,
My friend Allie is really great, always there for me when I need her, no matter what. If I need help with my homework, Allie helps me. We have fun playing together too, lots of fun. Allie always makes me happy whenever I am sad, even if I am sad because I'm hungry! Allie shares her lunch with me if I have forgotten mine. I am really glad Allie is my friend: I would not be the person I am today without her.

Do not use abbreviations in the glossary.,

Italicize or bold the terms in the glossary.,
Place the glossary before or after the main text.",How to Write a Glossary," Start by reading over the main text with a pen or highlighter. Underline or highlight any terms that may be unfamiliar to the average reader. You may underline technical or academic terms that may need to be further explained in more detail outside of the main text. Or you may decide a term needs to be clarified further, even if it’s a term the reader may be familiar with.For example, you may notice you have a technical term that describes a process, such as “ionization.” You may then feel the reader needs more clarification on the term in the glossary.
You may also have a term that is mentioned in the main text, but not discussed in detail. You may then feel this term could go into the glossary so you can include more information about the term for the reader.;
, You may struggle to identify terms for the glossary on your own, especially if you know the content well. If you are working with an editor on the text, such as an editor at a publication, you may ask them to help you identify terms for the glossary. They may be able to spot terms in the text that may be confusing or unclear to the average reader, especially if they are not an expert in the area you are writing about.For example, you may ask your editor, “Would you mind helping me identify terms for the glossary?” or “Can you assist me in identifying any terms for the glossary that I may have missed?”

, You can also ask a reader to look over the main text and highlight or underline any terms they find unfamiliar. Get someone who has an average reading level, as you want the text and the glossary to be as helpful as possible for the average reader. Ask a friend or family member to be a reader for you. You could also ask a classmate, a peer, or a colleague to be a reader for you.


You may tell the reader to look out for any terms they find unclear or unfamiliar in the main text. You may then get several readers to read the main text and note if the majority of readers chose the same terms for the glossary.

, Once you have read over the main text and gotten your editor or readers to look over the text for terms, collect all the terms together in one document. Analyze the terms suggested by your editor and by readers. Make sure the terms listed will appeal to the average reader and cover any concepts or ideas that may be unfamiliar to them.


The glossary terms should broad and useful to a reader, but not excessive. For example, you should have one to two pages of terms maximum for a five to six page paper, unless there are many academic or technical terms that need to be explained further. Try not to have too many terms in the glossary, as it may not be useful if it covers too much.

, Once you have identified the terms in the main text that need to be in the glossary, sit down and write out a brief summary for each term. The summary should be between two to four sentences total. Try to keep the summaries for each term short and to the point.You should always write the summary yourself. Do not copy and paste a definition for the term from another source. Copy and pasting an existing definition and claiming it as your own in the glossary can be considered plagiarism.
If you do use content from another source in the definition, make sure you cite it properly.

, Make sure the definitions are clear and tailored for the average reader. Do not use technical terms to define a term, as this will likely just confuse your reader. You do not want to sound like a dictionary or use language that is overly academic or technical. The definition should explain what the term means in the context of the main text in the simplest terms possible.For example, you may write a summary for the term “rigging” as: “In this article, I use this term to discuss putting a rig on an oil drum. This term is often used on an oil rig by oil workers.”
You may also include a “See ” note if the definition refers to other terms listed in the glossary.
For example, “In this article, I use this term to discuss putting a rig on an oil drum. This term is often used on an oil rig by oil workers. See OIL RIG.”

, Abbreviations should go in a separate list called “List of Abbreviations.” They do not belong in a glossary, as doing this can end up confusing the reader. If you have a lot of abbreviations in the main text, they should go in a list separate from the glossary.If you only have a small number of abbreviations in the main text, you can define them in the main text.
For example, you may have the abbreviation “RPG” in the text one or two times. You may then define it in the text on first use and then use the abbreviation moving forward in the text: “Role-playing game (RPG).”

, Once the definitions for the terms have been completed, you should place the terms in alphabetical order, starting with “A” and ending with “Z.” Having the glossary terms in alphabetical order will make it easier for the reader to flip through the terms to find the one they are looking for.Make sure you order the terms by first letter and then by the second letter in the term. For example, in the “A” section of the glossary, “Apple” will appear before “Arrange,” as “p” appears before “r” in the alphabet.

, You should also separate each term using bullet points before each term so they are easy to read. Or you can use one space between each term so they are not jammed together in the glossary. Choose one formatting style and stick to it so the glossary looks clean and polished.You may also have sub-bullets within one glossary entry for a term if there are sub-concepts or ideas for one term. If this is the case, put a sub-bullet under the main bullet so the content is easy to read. For example:
“Role-playing games: Role-playing games are games where players assume the role of a character in a fictional setting. They are a big part of nerd culture in America. In my article, I focus on role-playing games to explore how inhabiting a role can influence a social group.”

“My Little Pony RPG: A sub-group of role-playing games that focus on characters in the My Little Pony franchise.”



, You can also format the glossary to be more user friendly by italicizing or bolding the terms in the glossary. This can make the terms stand out from the definitions and make them easier to spot in the text. Choose either italicizing or bolding for the terms and stick to one formatting style so the glossary appears uniform.For example, you may have the following entry in the glossary: “Rigging: In this report, I use rigging to discuss the process of putting a rig on an oil drum.”
Or you may format the entry as: “Rigging - In this report, I use rigging to discuss the process of putting a rig on an oil drum.”

, Once you have formatted the glossary, you should place it either before or after the main text. Make sure the glossary appears in the Table of Contents for the paper as “Glossary” with the appropriate page numbers.If you have other additional content in the paper, such as a “List of Abbreviations,” the glossary will traditionally be placed after these lists as the last item in the paper.
If you are creating a glossary for an academic paper, your teacher may indicate where they would prefer the glossary in the paper.
If you are creating a glossary for a text for publication, ask your editor where they would prefer the glossary to fall in the text. You can also look at other texts that have been published and note where they place the glossary.

",How to Write a Hookup Ad," If you are going to send or receive e-mail related to hooking up it is a wise idea to create a separate e-mail account. Do not use your primary or work accounts. It is not advisable that you use your real name in the body of the e-mail address or as the name displayed when you send something.;
, Your age, your height, your weight and/or body type description as well as the colour of your hair and eyes. By doing this, you can avoid posting a photo publicly.

, Sometimes in a hookup ad people will mention something about the size or characteristics of their sexual organs. If you choose to do so be matter-of-fact but not profane. Also, be honest in regards to such topics as penis size. You don't want to look like a liar later on.

, Be matter-of-fact but not profane.

, It would be a wasted effort to e-mail someone back and forth only to find out that you're not looking for the same thing. By mentioning what you are not looking to do, people can take this into account before contacting you.

, It is not your intention to waste the time of others in your search for a hookup, therefore it is advisable to let potential responders know your personal preferences. Popular things to mention might include an age cap (ex: Maximum age of 30, 40, etc.), geographic location preference, body type or ethnicity.

, If you have an STI be forthright and mention this in your ad for two reasons. First, you don't want to infect anyone new. Second, you might be able to meet someone with the same STI whom you can consort with. You may fear getting no responses, but it's always better to be honest in this scenario.

",How to Write a Good Plot," At this point, a good notepad may be the best way to get the ideas flowing. It's useful to write long sentences, loose words, or entire paragraphs, because all can come in handy when you tackle the actual plot. Reading is also very important, as it is the main source of inspiration, although films, television, paintings, and even people can also inspire.


Identify what you want to write about. Think whether it should be a comedy, action, mystery, romance, adventurous, or nonfiction.





;
, Once you think you have enough ideas to start building the plot, you can join the ideas. Diagrams are of great use in this process. For example if you have pineapples and elephants, you could have an elephant eat pineapples.

, What would be unexpected if this happened? What will get people to read this book? Would I be interested in this book? What is missing? What do people want to hear in a good book?

, Characters at this stage are very simple, and are very much alike. You should not worry as much with their creation now, as to their function on the story. Who's the protagonist? Who's the villain? Does the story have a villain? If yes, is he truly horrific, or just a nuisance? Those are the questions that need to be answered at this point.

, Although not publicized, some plots are non-linear, which means they can go back and forth in time without things like time machines being needed. If you choose to write such a plot, make sure that every excerpt is chronologically coherent with the rest. You don't wanna say that he was in the cave (in the future), and then get to that point, and leave him being in his backyard. In non-linear plots, it's better to leave time references out of the question until the end of the book, to avoid confusion.

, The plot will need to take place somewhere, and as such, the place you set it is as important as who features in it. If you intend to place your story on an already existing place, it'll be easier, as you only have to imagine little parts, and not have to focus on the big picture, as that is taken care by reality, and you can jump the next step. If by contrast yours is a story taken place in an entirely fictionalized setting, keep on reading.

, In creating a new setting, it will require that you imagine every single detail. Don't oversee little things like where people shall work, or how people walk down the street, as those can be of great value in the future. You'll probably get much more details than you'll ever use, but as always it's better to get more than less. In science fiction and fantasy stories, things like the physics that control the world, society stratification, and the average person are all to be taken in account as serious matters.

, Here is where you truly create your characters, leaving no thing to be said. As in creating a setting, you'll get much more than you need, but that may come in handy if you then reuse the character later. Once again, a notepad will do greatly in getting the character as developed as possible. Ask questions like ""What is the reason why he dresses this way?"", and then get the answers down. Take in account also that a good character is one that evolves over time, so try to make them as flexible as possible (not overdoing it, or they'll seem unsure of their own choices). Try to imagine possible interactions between characters, and links like friendship or family. Get the best out of every character.

, Every action has a reaction, and as such no events are random (unless the point is to illustrate the randomness of it all, of course).

, By now you should have probably started writing, although it is not strictly obligatory, and as such you should get the main conflict, or in other ideas, what makes the characters do what they'll do. In the beginning no such guideline is needed, but it is required later on, for the progression to be logical.

, Rising action is the sequence of events that ultimately leads to the climax. It is normally longer than it's counterpart, the falling action, and shows development in the characters personality. This should be the portion of the plot you should worry most, as it is the one that leads to a weak climax, if not written correctly. As such, have your characters face several challenges, in which they can either be shown with their full potential, or even expand it.

, This is the moment in which your characters will face their ultimate challenge. All fiction stories have a climax, at some point, except for somewhat humorous ones, which resolve in anti-climaxes (normally a resolution that is too simple, and thus sound unsatisfactory: ""I faced the dragon with my sword, but it died out of breast cancer"" please don't use one of these). Normally it involves all of the characters, and occurs near the end of the story (except if the plot is non-linear, by which case it can occur nearly anywhere, even in the first few lines) and is a moment in which the protagonist seems defeated, and suffers an almost miraculous recovery.


Avoid ending the book with the answer given. Leave it with a mystery, or something that has not been answered yet. This will get them searching for more of your books, perhaps asking you to make more! They want to know the answer, and of course, you will get more viewers this way.







, Before the end of the book, if you feel like it, you should let the action smooth in a little, and tell the readers what has happened to the characters since the climax. This is where the things start to get into place once again, and life is calm again. Do not underestimate the importance of it though, as stories that don't have a proper conclusion can be the most revolting thing you'll ever see.

, By this point, you should have the basic outline of the full plot. If so, it's time to get back to organizing your thought process (hope you've kept the notebook, because it does get handy a lot of times). If you're that kind of person, do sketches, maps, timelines, or even write poems about your story, as it gets you in the mood to fully love what you have developed. But don't think the job is done. You only have the basic outline, that is something easy to do. The part where the basic plot becomes the good plot, is at the next stage.

, Writing techniques which vary from clever plot twists, to known artifices like the Chekov's gun (when an object appearing to be insignificant later resolves the conflict) or the not so appreciated Deux Ex Machina (which is a resolution that appears to come out of the blue: ""We were falling to our death, when a blue goat saved us and blasted the evil genius's balloon with its laser beam eyes""). With a combination of these and lots of metaphors, similes, and personifications you'll get the best out of your plot.

,, Now it's time to revise what you wrote. Make sure there are no anachronisms, incoherences with your own rules and laws, and that your characters stay consistent (they may evolve in terms of personality, but have to stay consistent with themselves, as keeping the same hair color, or the same height). If you find a main problem, and find that it ruins your entire plot, don't be afraid to change everything. One error can be difference between a good plot, and a plot outline.

Think of the main idea!,
Add details!,
Consider the Length!,
Use correct Language/Grammar!,
Research!,
Have a good vocabulary or use a thesaurus!,
Be sure to have an effective Opening and Closing Sentence!,
Dialogue!,
Use Transition Words!",How to Write a Good Paragraph," If your paragraph is going to be about Billy wanting chocolate, you shouldn't be talking about flying pigs.;
, Maybe Billy trips over his couch before reaching the chocolate bar! Instead of writing ""Billy trips over a couch and falls before reaching the chocolate bar,"" make the sentence more detailed. For example, ""Billy trips over a blue, leather couch before reaching his crunchy chocolate bar."" Not only does adding details make your paragraph longer, it will also give the reader(s) a better understanding of your idea.

, Paragraph length depends on the writer. Try not to go over twelve sentences, but exceed at least five. For example, would you prefer ""Billy trips over a blue, leather couch before reaching his crunchy chocolate bar, and then gets up finally holding on to the delicious chocolate and then eating it,"" or, ""Billy trips over a blue, leather couch before reaching his crunchy chocolate bar, and then gets up finally holding on to the delicious chocolate and then eating it. Billy can hear the crunch of the almonds in his head. After eating the whole thing, he wished he had bought some more."" As you can see, only one - three more sentences can make the paragraph much more detailed and enjoyable.

, Even if you do have a long, detailed paragraph, make sure to use capitalized letters for proper nouns and also at the beginning of a sentence. ""billy was planning on going back to the store with his friend molly to get more chocolate bars."" Do you see how annoying that was? ""Billy was planning on going back to the store with his friend Molly to get more chocolate bars."" This is definitely more attractive. Also, remember to use apostrophes. For example, ""Billy already had twelve chocolate bars, so he DOESN'T want any more."" The sentence should really say, ""Billy already had twelve chocolate bars, so he DOESN'T want any more."" Also, if it's a first person narrative, you should say ____ and I to being the sentence, or when being used as any subject of a sentence. ""Me and Molly...."" This beginning of that sentence is incorrect. ""Molly and I...."" is the correct way.

, If you decided to write a realistic historical fiction about George Washington's life, make sure all of the facts are pure. Writing something with fake facts may get you a bad grade. An unrealistic sentence would be - ""George Washington's best friend is Selena Gomez."" Doing just the simplest research, one can see that John Beamer was George Washington's best friends and also one of his best campaign supporters.""

, For example, ""vivid"". In a sentence, you want to use unique words, but don't overuse them. ""Billy's house was full of vivid colors: a bright blue couch, a glowing yellow lamp, and also a red carpet that contrasted with the wooden floor."" —That sentence had a variety of different words, but, ""Billy's vivid house was full of vivid colors: A vivid blue couch, a bright yellow lamp, and a vivid red rug that contrasted against the wooden floor."" becomes repetitive and redundant. Try using a thesaurus.

, For openings, try indicating when, where, and with who the paragraph involves. For example, ""It was a cold Saturday night in New York which explains why Billy had his friends over."" See how that told a lot of information in one sentence? The ending is a little more basic, and depending on the story type there are many different ways to end it. Biographies can end with possibly the person's funeral or death. A fantasy can typically end in anyway you want, so be creative!

, The title explains most of it. Make sure you put ""Potentially meaningless dialogue here."" - It's like any other sentence: it needs a capital letter, and must end with something like a period at the end. Make sure you put quotation marks around it. Also, whenever someone speaks, you should normally put a lead-in or lead-out such as ""he exclaimed"" or ""she shouted.""

, These are usually optional and describe the order of events. For example, ** FIRST, they went to the park. **THEN they got a snack. **AFTERWARDS they went to the movies. **LASTLY, they went over Brianna's house for a sleepover. Transition words usually include, FIRST, LAST, NEXT, THEN, A(N) HOUR; MINUTE; SECONDS LATER, or even, ON THE WAY FROM/TO ______.

Listen to how words sound.",How to Write a Funny Personal Ad," Many so-called rules for personal ads or profiles tend to suggest that the writer avoid many of the things that can actually make the ad funny. So, when reading the rules, do so with a grain of salt and only include items that make sense for you and the type of ad you want to write.;
, One of the best ways to figure out what you want to put in your ad is to read other ads. Read good ones and bad ones. Choose to include ideas from the good ads, and remember to avoid the pitfalls from the bad ads.Use example ads as a way to determine what is said so often it doesn’t allow you to stand out from the crowd. Even if the statement is a good one, you want to avoid using it if you find it in 50% of the articles you read.

, The photo you include in your personal ad may actually be harder to create than the ad itself! Unfortunately, however, many people judge a book by the cover, so they’re most likely going to judge your ad by the photo. Therefore, you want something that is flattering and makes you look awesome. And, you want to avoid photos that include other people.If you’ve written an awesomely funny ad, you may want to choose a photo that helps embellish that story, rather than a straight-forward photo of yourself.

, All personal ads or profiles need a title or headline of some kind. Some online dating sites may have a limit to the length of this headline, so keep that in mind when writing it. But regardless of the limitations associated with it, make it memorable. You want the headline to draw a potential partner in and make them want to read the rest of your ad. You also want something that accurately describes the best parts of you.One such way to make an awesome headline is to use song lyrics or a movie quote that seems to perfectly describe you.

, Many dating websites provide all sorts of templates you can use to create your personal ad or profile - avoid these. They might be good to look at and take note of, but don’t actually use one to write out your ad. You want to make your ad unique. Using a template takes away the uniqueness.Some good words you might find in a template, or in other personal ads, are: sophisticated, generous, reliable, affectionate, caring, educated.
Some words you’ll probably want to avoid, even though you’ll probably find them in some other ads, are: well hung, great in bed, animal, erotic, and anything else sexual., When stating things about yourself that are important (e.g. education, previous relationships, children, major turn offs, etc.), be honest. Try not to embellish or exaggerate these items, but feel free to state them in funny ways. When writing about things that aren’t critical (e.g. favourite foods, things you like to do, places you want to visit, etc.), it’s okay to embellish a little bit! Use humour to make the boring stuff sound a little more exciting.One of the things you may want to be honest about is your age. Age can be a big deal when it comes to reading and picking someone from a personal ad. If you lie about this, you might find your personal ad doesn’t accomplish what you’d like it to accomplish.
Another thing you’ll want to be honest about is what you’re looking for in a potential partner. If you just want a ‘friend with benefits,’ make sure that’s obvious. If you’re looking for a long-term relationship, make that clear.

, Bragging isn’t the same as humour. Bragging includes talking about how much money you make, or what luxury cars are in your 10 car garage, etc. Bragging never makes you look good, whether you try to add humour to it or not., There is such a thing as going a little too far with your uniqueness. You want potential partners to read your ad and be attracted to what you write. You want to avoid scaring potential partners away by making yourself out to be someone really odd!This also means to avoid turning your humour into sarcasm or cynicism. Potential partners will be able to tell the difference and it may make your ad seem very confusing., Words with ‘k’ sounds include cabin, cactus, cage, calf, camel, camper, canary, canoe, cape, cards, carrot, carton, chameleon, and cocoon.Words with hard ‘g’ sounds include guacamole, galaxy, garden, gecko, gibbon, gold, gorilla, and guitar.Words with these sounds actually sound funnier to most people. Oddly, the reason these words are found to be funny is because they're related to Yiddish humour, which is appreciated more by Americans.Try using words with these sounds throughout your personal ad, without making the whole ad seem like one giant alliteration.


Example: “I love canoes, being at the cabin, and running around in my cape.""
Example: “My mother tells me I make the greatest guacamole in the galaxy, with cilantro from my garden.""

, In order to write statements in your personal ad that sounds funny, it helps to create a pattern and then misdirect the reader. The pattern (the first two items) creates a setup that the reader will assume is serious, and then the punch line (the third item) is used to throw off the reader.Example: “I enjoy reading, writing, and taunting gorillas at the zoo.""
Example: “My idea of a perfect date is to share a great bottle of wine, dining on a patio under the stars, and trying really hard not to fart because I ate too many beans.""
Can work in longer lists if you get the rhythm right: “My favourite foods are gorgonzola cheese, butternut squash ravioli, french onion soup, and Kraft dinner.""

, Crazy comparisons are metaphors that make you laugh.Metaphors are normally used to help describe something in terms the reader or listener will understand. Similes are technically different from metaphors because they use the words ‘like’ or ‘as’ to compare two things. Similes make comparisons that are explicit (e.g. “her eyes are as blue as the ocean”) whereas metaphors are more subtle and make comparisons that are implicit (e.g. “he’s a chicken”).In the case of humorous writing, you can use either metaphors or similes in your personal ad to make a joke.


Example: “I love my job, my boss is as funny as Donald Trump.""
Example: “My hair is as golden as the diamond ring you’ll be buying me within a month.""

, Cliches are fun! Cliches are expressions or statements that have become stereotypical and common because they’re used so often.An example of a cliche is “in the nick of time.” But instead of using cliches in the standard way in your personal ad, twist them to be funny. Because it’s a cliche, potential partners will assume they’re going to read a certain statement, but will then be hit with the punch line.Don’t just use cliches you’ve heard a million times. Use any statement or term that readers will recognize. Things like movie titles, famous lines from literature or song lyrics are great options.
Example: “I’m ready to fall head over stilettos for you.""
Example: “My friends and I hang out a lot at Pete’s Bar, we call ourselves the Fellowship of the Pint.""

, Some of the funniest things out there are the real life stories we’d really rather forget. Don’t be afraid to use those in your personal ad to make potential partners laugh at your expense.Choose your best, most embarrassing story and embellish it. Add a point or two to your story that may (or may not) have happened!


Example: “When I was 3 years old I love dressing up the dog in my underwear.""
Example: “On a grade 5 field trip I got lost at the Air and Space Museum. I crawled inside the Apollo capsule and had a nap.""

, When using a word (or words) to describe something in your personal ad, be as specific as possible. Specific sounds funnier. This includes being specific when referring to the number of something. Don’t say ‘a lot’, make up a number like ‘fifty-two’.Example: “I have a Dodge Ram 4x4 pick-up truck painted red with white racing stripes.""
Example: “I’ve been to Disneyland four thousand, six hundred, and thirty-three times.""

, Whether it’s a word or a statement in your personal ad, put the funniest thing last. If necessary, re-read the sentence several times, placing the funniest word or statement in different spots. Keep trying until the sentence sounds great.Example: “It’s impossible to have only one chip, or cat.""
Example: “I like to take the scenic route when driving, it helps me relax and avoid satellites.""

, A double entendre is a word or a statement that can be interpreted in more than one way.Ironically, a lot of pick-up lines are double entendres (e.g. “How about you and I go to that dark room over there, and see what develops!”). And you can find a zillion examples of double entendres on the internet from places like newspapers and signs, where it was done by accident. In your personal ad, however, you’re doing it on purpose.


Example: “Marriage is a fine institution, but I’m not ready for an institution.”Example: “I’m always disgusted by the state of my drawers.""

, When writing your personal ad, plan out when and where you’ll use your jokes and new found humour.Use it strategically throughout the ad in a way that comes across as natural, but not overwhelming. You want to be sure you don’t cross a line from funny to stupid by putting too many silly things together. Re-read and revise your ad until the humour sounds like you didn’t do it on purpose!

, Read your personal ad out loud and make sure the words you’ve used actually do sound funny. Have they expressed the sort of humour you were intending? If you don’t like the way something sounds out loud, break out the thesaurus and try the sentence using a variety of other words instead.There are many free online thesauruses you can use.

Decide on a topic.,
Focus your topic into a thesis statement.,
Begin researching for your paper.,
Outline your paper.,
Create the first draft of your paper.,
Write a revised draft of your accounting paper.",How to Write a Forensic Accounting Paper," The first step in writing a forensic accounting paper is deciding on a broad topic. A topic may be assigned to you by your instructor, but a more open-ended paper will require you to pick a topic yourself. Possible areas to focus on within forensic accounting include bankruptcy and insolvency, economic damages calculations, computer forensics techniques, securities fraud, the role of government, insurance claims, and personal injury claims.;
, The central thrust of any academic paper is contained within the thesis statement. To construct a thesis, choose a specific facet of your desired topic and, if possible, defend a particular position. For example, if your broad topic is ""the role of government,"" your specific issue could be ""the need for policy intervention in preventing securities fraud."" By building a thesis from this, you will be dealing with a specific area as well as defending a position - in this case, calling for new government policies.

, The amount of research conducted will depend on the paper's length. You should begin your research early in the process, as you may want to adjust your thesis as you learn more. University libraries and their databases of industry journal articles are an excellent source for material. Popular magazines such as New Accountant can also be used for research. If you need to interview professionals, consider working through your professors or through professional organizations such as the Forensic Accountants Society of North America (FASNA).

, An outline is an essential tool for structuring your paper before writing it. Place your thesis at the top of the outline, and order your supporting points and evidence below it. Forensic accounting is a practical discipline, so case studies are important as evidence. If you are claiming that increased policy intervention would stem securities fraud, you need to build convincing case studies of past events - such as the Enron and WorldCom frauds - that support your position.

, When writing the first draft, focus primarily on the strength of your argument, rather than the elegance of your writing. Make sure that your case studies demonstrate an adequate understanding of the issue, and that your thesis arises naturally from the evidence you present. During your first draft, work tables and figures into your paper. While lengthy tables containing numbers can drag down a paper in another discipline, in an accounting paper they are absolutely essential. Accounting is a field in which you must be able to back up your claims with hard numbers.

, The second (and possibly final) draft of your paper is when you focus on making the writing engaging. Forensic accounting is often joked to be the ""sexy"" side of an oft-acknowledged boring profession. Make sure your paper reflects this through an engaging style. The occasional piece of anecdotal evidence may be appropriate to lighten the tone of your paper, depending on the gravity of the topic and the assignment.

Outline what you want your paper to say before writing your hook.,
Highlight your thesis.,
Use your main ideas and thesis to write your hook.,
Keep your audience in mind.,
Transition smoothly from your hook to your introduction.",How to Write a Great Hook1," Think about what you’re really trying to say in your paper. What is the main goal of your paper? What are you trying to prove? Brainstorm ideas for how you want your paper to go if you haven’t already. The outline of your paper, or your paper itself if you have already written it, will help you determine what kind of hook you should use.


Write the second part of your introduction—the information that will go after the hook—so you know what it will say. Put in details for each paragraph, including your conclusion.;
, The thesis is the specific thing that you are conveying to your reader; all other aspects of your paper will work to prove your thesis. What’s the main idea of your paper? Maybe you’re looking at how cat behavior affects other cats. Or maybe you’re writing on a scientific topic, such as how certain bacteria react in alcohol. Whatever your topic is, you will have to have a thesis.

, Make sure the hook leads into your introduction and your paper. That is, make sure your hook is relevant to your thesis, and to your paper as a whole. In particular, keep the tone of your paper in mind; a serious paper should not begin with a joke. You’ll confuse your readers by leading with something that doesn’t relate to your paper.


For example, if you start with a joke about married penguins but your paper is about the Civil War, the joke is not likely relevant and will just confuse or annoy the reader.

, You also want to make sure your hook is tailored to your audience, as well as your paper. Think about who will be reading your paper. What would draw them into the paper and make them interested in your topic?


If your audience is a professor, maybe the hook could be an interesting fact.
If your audience is your classmates, maybe the hook could be funny joke that relates to your paper.

, You don’t want to just place a hook at the beginning without any connection to your paper. The hook should smoothly transition into the rest of your introduction. For instance, if you were writing about the American Civil War, and specifically the actions of President Lincoln, you may consider making your hook be an interesting fact about something that relates to the topic.


For example: “Many people do not know this fact about Lincoln, as many people do not know what Lincoln’s personal beliefs were about the war he helped win.” The anecdote provides a way into a discussion of Lincoln’s beliefs.

"
"
Use an interesting fact or anecdote for an essay or paper.,
Tell a joke to begin a humorous essay or speech.,
Stick with a more serious hook for newspaper and journal articles.,
Write a creative, intriguing hook for a novel.",How to Write a Great Hook2," In essays or papers, the meaning may need to be clear from the get-go, even if you’re telling an anecdote. For instance, if you are writing about the Civil War, or more specifically, how Lincoln’s personal beliefs affected the Civil War, you could begin with an anecdote about Lincoln.


You could write something like “In 1849, Abraham Lincoln received a patent for a device to keep ships from running onto shore in shallow water.”
This anecdote does two things: it shows Lincoln’s ingenuity, and it provides a fact that not many people know about Lincoln. It also draws interest from the reader.

, In a humorous essay or speech, you can be a little looser with your hook. You can crack a joke, as long as it’s relevant to the writing.


For instance, for something a little silly, if you are talking about relationships and letting people into your life, you could start with a knock-knock joke.

, In newspaper and journalistic writing, a great hook is one that piques the readers’ interests but that leaves them wanting more (so that they read the rest of your story).


You see this technique used in headlines fairly often, such as “Horrific Tragedy Leaves Four Dead”.
This headline piques the reader’s interest, as they are most likely to wonder what the “horrific tragedy” was, and who the people were.

, A novel is going to have a different type of hook than an essay. Novels will have more creative lines, and their meaning may not be apparent in the first reading. Your hook should raise questions in the readers’ minds, drawing the reader into what’s coming up next.


Some famous first lines from novels that are great hooks include: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…” (Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities), “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” (Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina), and “They shoot the white girl first.” (Toni Morrison, Paradise).
These lines draw the reader in by creating anticipation about what is going to happen next. How can it be both the best and worst of times? Is this a story about a happy family or an unhappy one? How are happy families all alike? Why did they shoot the “white girl” first? Who shot her?

Think about your target audience.You should have a specific audience in mind when you begin your how-to guide.,
Familiarize yourself with the process you’re writing about.,
Do research about the process.,
Gather materials needed to create your guide.",How to Write a How to Guide1," The audience will determine the level of detail you need to provide as the breadth of information you should cover.A how-to guide for making a mango mojito directed at bartenders would differ greatly from the same how-to guide written for people without bartending experience who wish to make a mango mojito at home. The lay-person’s guide would likely be more detailed without using any beverage service “slang.”;
, Before you write, you should be able to do the process yourself several times. Even if it is something you have done repeatedly, try doing it again, thinking mindfully about each step that you are taking as you go through the process.


If you pour yourself a mango mojito at the end of every day, you likely don’t have to think about the proper ratios, and you may take parts of the process for granted (like getting out a glass and filling it with ice).

, Your own experience can be a great basis for a how-to article, but it never hurts to supplement your experience with research.Try searching for the topic online and see how other people do what you are doing. You may want to integrate others’ approaches into your guide by suggesting alternate approaches. Be sure to credit any sources that you draw from directly.


If you have a signature mango mojito recipe, your how-to article can only be improved by searching other recipes for the same drink. You may find a shortcut, an alternate ingredient, or an aesthetically pleasing garnish that you never considered.

, Before you start writing, collect material and information that you wish to include in your guide.This may mean taking photographs that document the process at each step or creating flowcharts or graphs that complement your written material.


For your mango mojito guide, you might want to photograph the ingredients before you begin, then take action shots of each part of the mojito creation process. You may even want to recruit another person to take the pictures for you.

Lay out your statement of cash flows.",How to Write a Financial Statement," The balance sheet is called so because it shows the company's balance between assets and liabilities. The key underlying basis of the balance sheet is the basic accounting equation, which is Total Assets=Liabilities+Shareholder’s Equity{\displaystyle {\text{Total Assets}}={\text{Liabilities}}+{\text{Shareholder’s Equity}}}. Rearranging the equation, you can see that equity is equal to assets minus liabilities. The balance sheet reflects this relationship. All assets and liabilities are listed and added up on the balance sheet, then liabilities are subtracted from assets to arrive at a figure for shareholder's equity.Balance sheets may be constructed using accounting software. Or, you can simply create a spreadsheet or written list with two columns that can be used to total your assets and liabilities by category.;
, Your assets are anything that you own, including the cash you have on hand. Assets usually divided into ""current assets"" and ""fixed assets.""Your current assets include the cash you have on hand and what could be liquidated quickly, usually within a year. In this category, you would have things like your accounts receivable (what people owe your company), any securities becoming due with a year such as bonds or savings accounts, and your inventory. It can also include pre-payments or deposits you've made ahead of time, such as insurance for the next year. 

 Fixed assets are tangible and known as property, plant, and equipment. These are assets with a useful life in excess of one year.

There are also intangible assets that may be held on a balance sheet. These include patents, brand recognition, and copyrights, along with other non-physical assets.All of these assets need actual dollar figures in your balance sheet, these can be calculated exactly or estimated based on (and in compliance with) industry convention.


, To write the balance sheet, you need to lay this information out in detail. That is, you need to label each asset along with the dollar amount, divided into current and fixed assets. Add all of your assets up into a total., Your liabilities are what the company owes or has paid to other companies or people, including employees. In other words, it's the company's debt. These assets are also divided into ""current"" and ""long-term"" categories.Current liabilities include things like what you owe on lines of credit and credit cards, as well as anything owed to other companies for goods and supplies. It also includes the income and wages you've paid out to employees and taxes owed, along with unpaid rent and utilities.Long-term liabilities include long-term loans payable, bonds payable, and other liabilities that will be paid out over a time period longer than one year., Just like your assets, you need to account for each liability (in major categories, such as loans, mortgages, and so on). Also, divide your liabilities on your balance sheet into current and long-term. List liabilities by category and include the value of each category next to the its name. Add up all your liabilities to get your total., To figure out the shareholder's equity (also called shareholder's equity), you subtract what is owed from what assets you have. A positive amount of equity indicates that the company has financed its operations with its own money or that of investors, rather than relying as strongly on debt.

 Have a line for your total assets. Below it, have a line for your total liabilities. Show what the shareholder's equity is when you subtract the second from the first.


, On your sheet, have a section where you show what the shareholder's equity is. This section will include items that represent the shareholder's interests in the company. For example, common stock, preferred stock, capital in excess of par, and retained earnings are all common shareholder's equity categories.

When you've listed these categories out, sum them up to arrive at total shareholder's equity.Compare your total to the difference between assets and liabilities from your earlier calculations. If the figures don't match, either you or the accountant that keeps the company's books has made a mistake somewhere along the way. 

Many balance sheets are organized such that the assets are totaled on the left and liabilities and shareholder's equity are totaled on the right. This provides a more literal representation of the basic accounting equation., As a general rule, the first figure listed in the a company's balance sheet is net sales for the period in question. The income statement may just say ""sales"" or ""revenue,"" but the figure used is net sales. Net sales represents the gross sales (total sales in the period) minus any returns, discounts, or allowance for lost or damaged goods. This is the company's ""top line"" and is the truest representation of sales over the period.Unlike the balance sheet, the income statement covers financial activity throughout the period in question, whether that is a month, a quarter, or a year.

The income statement is organized as a reduction of net sales by various expenses faced by the company to arrive at net income (also called net profit or the bottom line)., Your first calculation on the income statement will be that for gross profit. Gross profit represents the company's profit after considering the cost of goods sold (or services provided/sales). Cost of goods sold includes the cost of all materials and labor that went directly towards producing the products that were sold over the period. Total this amount and subtract it from net sales to arrive at gross profit., On the balance sheet, expenses are separated into two major categories: operating and non-operating expenses. Operating expenses follow the same philosophy as cost of goods sold. That is, they are those expenses related directly to the operations of the company. This includes the cost of selling and advertising products, administrative costs, and wages for employees involved in these departments. It also includes general expenses, such as utilities, rent, and manager salaries.Remember that materials and manufacturing labor costs were already covered in the cost of goods sold and do not need to be counted here.

Separate these expenses into three major categories: selling, general and administrative expenses. When you've written out the amount of each expense, total them to find total operating expenses.

Subtract total operating expenses from gross profit to arrive at operating income., The other category of expenses on the income statement, non-operating expenses, are those expenses that are not directly related to operations. These include interest, amortization, depreciation, and tax expenses. There is also room in this section to record an ""extraordinary gain or loss,"" which might arise from a massive amount of inventory theft, for example., As you go, lay out each piece of your income statement. Net sales will be at the top. Each piece will follow in sequential order.Put the net sales on one line. Underneath that, put the cost of sales. Below that, subtract the cost of sales from the net sales to get the gross profit. Skip a line before moving on to operating costs.

 Put the operating costs in general categories underneath the gross profit. Generally, selling, general, and administrative costs are lumped into one, but not always. Underneath that, write the operating income that you derived from subtracting the operating costs from the gross profit.Next, have a line each for the interest and the taxes. You can subtract them separately or together. Separately gives you more precise data. 

 The final line should be the net income., The cash flow is an essential number to the company because it establishes the actual cash you have on hand. It's different from your income because your income includes non-cash expenses and assets that do not affect your actual cash balance.However, in order to create a statement of cash flows, you will first need a completed income statement and completed balance sheets from this period and the previous period. 

 The statement of cash flows is split into three pieces: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities., With operations, you're looking at how much operations brings in through cash. This step is different from what you did in your other statements because those statements include non-cash items. Here, you are focusing solely on cash. In other words, you must add some things back into the net income because they weren't really cash expenses, and therefore, won't affect the money you have to work with right now. Start with non-cash items, things like amortization and depreciation.Amortization is when the company spreads out the cost of something over time for accounting purposes. However, it is not really a cost taking away from cash flow right now. Therefore, you add that expense back in.The same with depreciation. It's a number taken away from the total amount of an asset, as it loses value over time. However, it's not technically a cash flow problem, so that expense is added back in.This method is the indirect method of figuring out cash flow. The direct method involves adding up cash flows from scratch rather than starting with net income., Now you need to look at other items that bring in or take out cash through operations. For instance, gains or losses on sales of fixed assets are included in this category, as this activity brings in (or draws out) cash.If you have sold fixed assets within the period, such as property, you need to look at whether it was a gain or loss, then add or subtract it from the operating costs.

 You also need to look at changes in accounts receivable. Since accounts receivable is what other people owe the company, if it goes down, that means the company has gained cash, and that needs to be added in.

 On the other hand, if the company has bought inventory, that signals a decrease in cash, and needs to be subtracted from the cash flow.

 Other items that can affect the cash flow include taxes payable, insurance you've already paid, and salaries payable., Like with operations, you need to examine how investing has affected your overall cash flow. This category is focused on long-term investments, such as equipment and buildings. This category mainly focuses on where cash has gone in the current year when it has been invested.This step can include money you've put into new equipment or other capital, such as buildings, which will be subtracted from cash flow.It can also be equipment you've sold, which would be added into the cash flow.

 This step also includes any money invested in the stock market, what you've bought and sold, and how that affects your overall cash., The third category is financing. This section is focused on the money that is used to finance your business, such as loans.It also has to do with stock options and shareholders, and how that affects cash flow.Loans are added to your overall cash. However, your loan payments for the year are taken out of the overall cash.Dividends you pay out to shareholders obviously reduces your cash, while if you issue bonds or common stock, the issue is recorded as an influx of cash., Start with the net income at the top, and move down through the three categories. It's best to keep the three categories separate, as then people reading the statement of cash flows can see where expenses are going in and out. Subtract and add cash as needed in each category, to reach your net increase or deficiency in cash for the year.Add in last year's cash. If you have any cash leftover from last year or you started out with a deficit, add that or subtract that to this year's cash. 

 That will give you the total amount of cash you have on hand, also called your total cash resources."

Research literary archetypes.,
Flesh out your archetypes with unique details.,
Get to know your characters.,
Develop your character arc.Flannery O’Connor said that the problem with many beginning writers is that “They want to write about problems, not people,” and that “a story always involves in a dramatic way, the mystery of personality.” She believed that readers connect more with the characters in a story than with the events that unfold, and that the real movement in a story is the revealing of a character’s true nature through the unfolding of plot.,
Map out the central conflicts of your story.,
Decide your character or characters’ main goal or motivation.,
Establish the costs and benefits for your characters.You reader will get more involved with your story if they have a clear sense that your character is suffering in some way.,
Outline your plot points.,
Don’t feel pressured into a happy ending.,
Fill out your first draft.,
Conduct research to make the world of your story more believable.,
Revise your dialogue.,
Cut down your modifiers.,
Revise for restraint.,
Revise for pacing.,
Don’t be afraid to cut.,
Do multiple rounds of revision.",How to Write a Dramatic Story," Some stories have idiosyncratic characters that draw the reader’s attention by their originality — but when you're trying to write a dramatic story, you might benefit from working within the tradition of literary archetypes or stock characters. An archetype is a sort of template for a character that is recognizable, but onto which you can layer the details that make your character unique.If readers don't have to learn a new type of character, they can immerse themselves immediately into your world, because they know how to read this ""type"" of literature. Archetypes allow the emotional tension to rise more quickly to the surface.


Think of your favorite characters, and what universal character types they might stand in for. Why do these characters speak to you?
The psychologist Carl Jung delineated personality archetypes on which he wrote extensively.Literature is often interpreted through this approach, so it will be helpful to be familiar with Jungian archetypes.
For example, the “Mother” archetype is positively characterized by sympathy, instinctual wisdom, and nurturing, but can be negatively characterized by secrecy and inescapability.
The “Warrior” is a hero marked by courage and strength — someone who engages in head to head conflict and overcomes obstacles through strength of will.Byronic heroes, named after the English Romantic poet Lord Byron, tend to be darkly handsome and intelligent, but cynical and self-destructive.They are often loners, misunderstood and mistreated by society, like Pride and Prejudice’s Mr. Darcy.;
, The trick to working with archetypes is to start with a universal template then make it your own. If you simply deliver a pure archetype, your characters will seem too familiar to your readers, and they won’t care as much. When trying to write a dramatic story, it's important that your character have a uniquely moving nature in his/her own right.


Was your character always like this? If not, what made him or her this way?
In what contexts does your character act unexpectedly? For example, Jane Eyre's Edward Rochester was a harsh man who was for some reason still beloved by his staff. Despite his bad reputation, he also looked after a young French orphan for reasons unexplained until the author was ready to reveal more about the character.
Blending characteristics from different archetypes can result in unexpected twists that ratchet up the reader's emotional investment in a dramatic story. For example, if your hero or heroine is normally a “Warrior” who usually overcomes obstacles on their own, the reader will be especially moved when he or she needs to be rescued by a character who is usually a damsel in distress.

, For readers to get emotionally invested in your story, they have to engage in the “willing suspension of disbelief,” which is to say that you must convince them to feel for your made-up characters just as they would for real people in the world.Before you can convince your reader that your characters are real, you must get to know them so well that they become real to you.


Think about who your main characters are before you even sit down to write the story.
Flesh out their backstories. In fiction, readers meet the characters at a point in their lives of the author’s choosing, but there’s a whole life that has been led before the story began. Even if you don’t include those details in your story, think about them.
Regardless of what point of view you write the actual story from, do writing exercises where you write from the first person point of view of all your main characters. Try to get into their mindsets.
Imagine what the darkest days of your main characters' lives were, and have them speak from that moment.

,


Flannery O’Connor’s “Good Country People” is a short story in which both main characters change greatly — Hulga Hopewell because she herself changes, and the Bible salesman because the reader's perception of him changes.The reader doesn't even like Hulga at first because she is too proud and arrogant, and she treats people with condescension. However, the story ends with a moment of revelation in which she comes to the crushing realization of her vulnerability and silliness. Even though we didn't like her at first, the reader is moved to empathy.
The Bible salesman does not actually evolve at all. Though the reader likes him at first because he is polite and kind, his later actions make him repulsive. In this case, his true nature doesn't change, but is masked and then revealed, causing a change in the reader's perception.
The dramatic intensity of this story is due in large part to the complete reversal of the reader's attachments to characters: you go from disliking to feeling bad for Hulga, and you go from liking to despising the Bible salesman.
A character arc that takes the reader by surprise will work well in a dramatic story.

, Conflict is important in any story, even a comedy. Especially in a dramatic story, however, you must pay special attention to it. Nobody wants to read a drama where nothing’s at stake, because the emotional intensity would quickly flat-line. There are three dimensions of conflict: external-world conflict, external-personal conflict, and internal conflict.A comedy might make use of as few as one of these dimensions, but a dramatic story must make use of all three.


External-world conflict is a problem external to the main character(s) — something beyond their control. It can be as grand in scale as a war, or as small and domestic as a character’s parents getting divorced.
External-personal conflict is a conflict between your characters. Examples might be two characters fighting over a common romantic interest, or two politicians going head-to-head in a political campaign.
Internal conflict is a character’s struggle to overcome their greatest personal weakness. For example, a character might have to overcome their fear of commitment to find happiness in a relationship, or overcome their arrogance to succeed in their career.
Because the success of your dramatic story relies so heavily on the reader's engagement with your conflicts, it's important that you map out your conflicts during the brainstorming process, before you begin drafting.

, You may be tempted to describe your story in terms of “what it’s about,” but it will be more effective if you describe it to yourself in terms of “what your character wants.” This will keep you in your reader's mindset: in a drama, the reader wants your main character to find success and happiness. By concentrating on your character's goal or motivation, you will focus on ideas and details that will make your reader more invested in your story.


Your story might have a very clear and explicit goal, such as “to leave behind an impoverished past by getting into an Ivy League college,” or your character’s motivation might be less defined — to cope after the death of a spouse, for example.
Flesh out what’s at stake for the character if they fail to achieve that goal.
Are the results disastrous and epic in scale for the public, or merely monotonous and quietly depressing for the individual character?
Remember that in a big splashy adventure story, epic disaster might be sufficient for emotional stakes.
However, in a drama, the story needs intimate, personal emotional stakes. The general public in the world of your story are not nearly as important as the one or two characters you're asking your reader to care for.
Focus on the individual story, goals, and repercussions, not the larger story beyond your main character(s).

, What will your character have to sacrifice to achieve their goal? And what will they gain by achieving it? By having clear costs and benefits, you can more easily get your reader to understand what’s at stake in your story.


The costs might be emotional (unhappiness), physical (your main character is a police officer who gets shot the day before retirement), or circumstantial (your character loses their job because they reported their boss for improper conduct).
Don't let your character's suffering become boring for the reader. For example, if a character is simply sad because their mother died for an entire story, the reader might turn against them and say ""well, do something to try to work through your grief.""
However, if the reader sees the character trying and failing to move on from their mother's death — doing their best, sacrificing, and still suffering in new ways that only freshen and sharpen their grief — then they will suffer along with your character instead of growing distant from them.
For example, your character might feel frustrated that they don't connect with the therapist they started seeing; that the estranged father they reconnected with in the wake of their mother's death is a brash jerk, or even just quietly disappointing; that their attempt to go out on a date resulted in embarrassing failure; and so on.
Each of those attempts to cope brings a new dimension to the character's emotional journey. The ultimate benefit of a happy ending will be magnified, and a sad ending rendered more devastating, by this accumulation of costs.

, You know your character arc, and you know your main character’s ultimate goal; now you have to plot out how the events in your story get them from point A to point B. Think of your story in terms of three acts: your setup and backstory; your conflict or confrontation; and your resolution.In Act 1, you explain who the characters are and reveal their goals. Provide the dramatic premise that will propel your plot,and the “inciting incident” that kicks your plot into gear.In Act 2, throw obstacles in your main character’s way to prevent them from reaching their goal easily. It might seem at first as though your character will simply easily achieve their goal, before something takes their feet out from under them. After struggling against these obstacles, your character should reach a low point, where they cannot see a way to achieve their goal.
In Act 3, your character reaches a turning point marked by the story’s climax. The conflicts you mapped out earlier reach their highest level of tension, bringing the reader to an emotional high point. After a final confrontation/climax, the storyline should resolve itself.

, Stories don’t have to resolve happily — they just have to resolve. The most important thing is that there be a sense of equilibrium. Unless you’re planning to write a sequel, the reader shouldn’t feel as though there is more to be told in this story. It’s perfectly fine to have a character motivated by a desire for happiness fail to find it with a romantic partner, but end up resigned to (even satisfied with) a quiet life alone, working on their hobbies.


In Flannery O’Connor’s short story “The Life You Save Might Be Your Own,” the main female character is abandoned by her new husband, who only married her so he could steal her car. The story doesn’t end on a happy note, but we’ve learned everything we need to know about the husband to understand him as a human being. Although the ending is sad, we still feel satisfied in having read a complete, fleshed out depiction of a man’s nature.

, Use all the outlines you’ve created about your character arcs and motivations, your costs and benefits, your plot points and acts, etc. to write your first draft. If, in the process of writing, you think the story would benefit from moving away from the ideas you outlined, feel free to take the story wherever you need it to go. All of your brainstorming work is a guideline, not a hard-and-true formula.


Don’t worry about grammar and inventive language at this point. Your first draft is just about getting the bones of your story down: who are the characters, and what happens?

, If your story is about a doctor, learn the terminology a doctor would use in order to make the dialogue realistic. If your story is about a waitress, learn about the types of frustrations servers experience, like bad tippers, sore feet, etc. Work these details throughout your story to make the invented world come alive.


It's the details of life that readers connect to most readily. It's difficult to imagine grand disasters — the death of a child if you've never experienced that, for example — but we can imagine the quiet indignities of life.
For example, a character might not cry at a funeral, but dissolve into tears the next day because a customer blamed slow service on her as a waitress instead of realizing it was the kitchen holding up the order.

, Dialogue is very difficult because it often comes across as stilted and unnatural. Find a partner and read all the dialogue in your story aloud, like you were performing the story as a play. Does it sound like normal human beings, or does it sound self-conscious and forced?


If the dialogue feels forced, put what you’ve written away and try to imagine you are the character. Imagine what they need to communicate in that moment, then say it aloud in your own words, using your natural speech pattern.
While your exposition should be grammatically correct, your dialogue will actually sound strange if it’s grammatically correct. Native speakers almost never speak “correctly” unless they’re delivering a speech or in an important situation like a job interview. Use elements such as contractions, sentence fragments, and interruptions to make your dialogue sound more realistic.
Pay special attention to conversations at key dramatic moments, as they tend to get overwritten. When characters are voicing important thoughts, their language sometimes grows too grand and eloquent. Normal people don't change the way they speak when having important conversations — if anything, they sometimes become less coherent.

, The great Russian short story writer Anton Chekhov wrote often of the need for concision and compactness in good writing: “when you read proof cross out as many adjectives and adverbs as you can. You have so many modifiers that the reader has trouble understanding and gets worn out …The brain can't grasp all that at once, and art must be grasped at once, instantaneously.”Use strong verbs and nouns to pack a greater punch. Note the improvement from “she sat around lazily” to “she lazed.”
Sometimes, you will need to keep adjectives and adverbs to make your writing sound natural, so don’t go overboard with cutting them out. If you find that you're relying on the adjective or adverb to do the work for you --- for example, using ""She said, happily"" as a dialogue tag, instead of demonstrating the character's emotion through what she says and how she acts --- definitely eliminate those.

, Sometimes, we get so carried away with the drama of what we’re writing that we blow it out of proportion. A little restraint goes a long way. Mark Twain once said to “Substitute ""damn"" every time you're inclined to write ""very""; your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.”It’s a good lesson to keep in mind so your reader doesn't roll their eyes at how hard your story is trying to manipulate the emotional tension. Let the story work subtly on the reader instead of trying to boss them around into feeling what you want them to feel.


Maintain a balance between the acts of your plot. The emotional tension of your language shouldn’t be turned all the way up throughout your entire story; it should be highest during the climax.

, Does your climax play out and resolve itself too quickly or easily? If so, add to the climactic scene so that the resolution feels more hard-earned and satisfying. If your first act, where you’re setting up your characters and context, seems to drag on for too long, cut it down to size! As Elmore Leonard said, “Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.”, The best writers know that they have to be cold to their work. It’s hard to throw away even just a word or a line, much less an entire scene, but you have to be willing to sacrifice that work to better serve the overall story. As Truman Capote said, “I’m all for the scissors. I believe more in the scissors than I do in the pencil.”, Good stories take time, so don’t think that you’re going to get it all done in one sitting. The trick to good revising is learning to distance yourself from your work. When you first write something, you might immediately be in love with it — and that’s fine! You should be proud of what you’ve accomplished. But after a few days have passed, you’ll be able to see the flaws a little more clearly.


Give yourself a few days between rounds of revision so that you can see the story objectively.
Save all your drafts, so you can undo changes you’ve made if you decide they don’t work.

Establish the sequence.,
Create clear, active headings.,
Use explanatory text and bullet points when necessary.,
Write in an active, clear style.,
Use graphics to support your text.,
Edit graphics or screenshots to highlight key information.",How to Write a How to Guide2," The most important part of a how-to guide is the main sequence of events.The order of the steps is very important since the nature of the guide is a step-by-step approach. If there is more than one possible order for some of the steps, you should choose one. You could note that some of the steps are interchangeable, but it’s best to commit to a particular order.


Your sequence for making a mango mojito could be gathering the ingredients, muddling the mint and mango, pouring the liquor and club soda into a mixer, mixing the ingredients, placing ice in a glass, placing the muddled mint and mango on top of the ice, pouring the liquids over the ice and fruit, then garnishing the drink, and serving the drink.

The sequence is important; obviously, you can’t serve the drink before you make it. An example of an optional item placement in the sequence is when to place the ice in the glass: it could be done before you start mixing the drink.



, Even if a single step contains detailed information, it should begin with a clear, concise heading. The heading should be directing someone towards an action.Some people may skim your guide, or rely primarily on the headings to guide them, reading the subtext only if they are confused about how to implement a step.


For example, a heading for a step in your mojito making may be “Muddle the mint and mango.” Someone who knows how to muddle may read the step heading and do the step without reading the instructions that accompany the step. The heading is clear and precise.

, Beneath your clear headings, you should provide adequate (but not overwhelming) additional information.If you find that your information for completing a step exceeds 4 or 5 bullet points or sentences, you might want to break the step into two steps. You can always use “part one” and “part two” if a single heading is necessary for both steps.


Consider using bullet points to break up information. This is often more accessible than a paragraph of block text.The text beneath the heading “Muddle the mint and mango” may be:

Use a mortar and pestle to crush the mint leaves and mango chunks.
If you do not have a mortar and pestle, you can use a small bowl and the back of a rigid spoon.



, Particularly if you are writing for laypeople (not experts in the field in which you are writing), you should write clearly and use short, active sentences. Aim for a 7th or 8th grade reading level., A how-to guide almost always benefits from graphics.The level of graphics that you can use may be limited by the publication medium (if you are creating a print publication, for example, you may be limited to black and white line graphics). Graphics should be high-quality and should show exactly what is happening in each step.


Be sure that you have permission to use and/or publish any graphics that you did not create yourself.
If you are writing a how-to guide for a technical process on a computer, you may want to take screenshots to demonstrate what you are saying.
For making a mojito, photographs of the drink evolving with each step would be helpful to most readers.

, Use a graphic editing program to draw arrows to or circles around portions of your graphic in order to direct the audience’s attention to what you want to show them.


For example, if you have a provided a photograph of all of the ingredients of your mojito with the step “Select a quality rum,” you may want to add an arrow on top of the graphic that indicates the bottle of rum in your photo.

"
"
Proofread your writing.,
Test the guide for accuracy.,
Publish the guide.",How to Write a How to Guide3," As with any piece of writing, be sure to check carefully for spelling and grammar mistakes.You should also be sure that your writing is clear and simple. It can be helpful to have someone else proofread for you, or to read your own steps in reverse. Reading in reverse can make your writing seem new and prevent you from “seeing” what you meant to say instead of what you have actually said., Before you distribute your how-to guide, follow it yourself. Pretend you are doing something for the first time and follow your own step-by-step instructions. You may find that you have left out an obvious step or that you have written a step out of order. If possible, have someone else follow the guide and give you feedback about how easy it is to follow.


Make yourself that mango mojito; you deserve it! Be sure you are making it from the steps in the guide, though, and not your memory of how you’ve made it in the past.

, Once you have perfected your guide, publish it in a venue that you deem appropriate.This may mean putting it on your personal blog, submitting it to a website that curates guest posts, or submitting it to a print publication. Whatever the venue, be sure that your writing meets any specified guidelines for length, image quality, or other considerations.

Establish how you are committed to diversity.,
Discuss what types of diversity you are committed to embracing.,
Talk about specifics.",How to Write a Diversity Statement1," That is, talk about how you are committed to hiring a diverse group of people, or how you treat every customer with respect no matter what background they come from.


This is an important piece of your diversity statement, as it allows you to crystallize your organization's commitment to diversity.;
, Diversity encompasses many different spheres of life, so it is important to define the types of diversity that you are specifically dedicated to supporting.


For instance, you can talk about how you believe people of both genders should be treated equally, how every person should be treated the same no matter their ethnic background or what religion they practice.
You can also address age, gender identity, sexuality, and classism.

, Discuss the various ways in which you will follow through on your commitment to diversity as set up in your statement.


How exactly do you implement what you promise in your diversity statement?
Do you set specific goals for hiring?
Do you fire anyone who violates the policy?
Backing up what you say will give your diversity statement bite.

Make sure to choose a meaningful person, place, or thing.,
Introduce the person, place, or thing you are describing.,
Engage your reader's sense of sight.,
Describe smells and tastes if you can.,
Describe how the moment or item feels.,
Describe how your subject sounds.,
Make unique observations.,
Include some figurative language.,
Wrap it up.",How to Write a Descriptive Paragraph," Before you begin your paragraph, you have to be sure to pick something that is worth describing. If you want to describe a character, make sure the person is interesting in some way. If you want to describe an object, make sure it has some deeper meaning beyond itself so you have enough to write about. If you pick a place, make sure you can describe it in a unique way that can capture a reader's attention.


For example, in the opening pages of The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield describes a baseball mitt. The mitt itself is not that remarkable, but he describes it in a way that fills it with meaning because it used to belong to his deceased brother. Though not every object you describe needs an elaborate backstory, if it has some meaning behind it, this can help the description carry weight.
If you want to pick a place, don't just pick any old spot at a beach, but one that is meaningful to you -- or, if you're writing fiction, to one of your characters -- in some way. This can add a layer of depth to the place in question.

, If you want to get the reader's attention, then you should let him or her know what you're describing as soon as possible instead of leaving them guessing. Here is an example of some opening lines in a descriptive paragraph:



Natasha's basement was our sanctuary. I return to it in my best dreams and wake up feeling like I could die happy.

These opening sentences introduce the subject that is being described, the basement of the narrator's friend. They make it clear that this place is very important to the narrator.



, You can start with what the reader can see and appeal to his or her sense of sight to help introduce the object. Since sight is the most helpful sense, any good descriptive paragraph must first discuss what the writer wants the reader to visualize. Using strong adjectives to illustrate your scene, moment, experience or item to the reader will help provide a visual picture in your reader's mind. Keep in mind that, while adjectives can help convey a sense of the subject, overusing them can lead to boring, overwrought writing. Here's an example of the opening of a descriptive paragraph:



Even today I could paint a perfect picture of it, right up to the last piece of neglected pizza crust festering under the ping-pong table.

Immediately, the reader is given a visual description of some things in the basement: old pizza crust and a ping-pong table. The reader is given a sense of a messy, chaotic place.



, Think about how you can describe the topic, scene, or moment to the reader in terms of how it smells and tastes. The best descriptive paragraphs make the reader feel as if he or she were actually experiencing the thing he or she was reading about, not just reading about it. Include a sentence or two about how your topic smells and use a few poignant adjectives to relay the smell of it to the reader. ""It tastes good"" is not going to provide a specific experience for your reader. However, ""It tastes like Grandma's apple pie when it's fresh and still bubbling around the edges - crunchy, flavorful and sweet"" helps describe the distinct flavor of your item. Of course, not everything you describe will have a relevant taste or smell; if it does, though, it can help to include it. Here's the next part of our paragraph:


The spilled root beer and duck sauce shining over the nappy brown carpet indicated nights of giggles and prank calls, times when we were far too occupied to consider the absurd possibility of cleaning up. Popcorn got crushed into the carpet and was never quite cleaned up. You could smell this mixture of sweetness and butter even when you stood on the front porch.

, As you continue writing your paragraph, write a sentence or two about how the experience feels. What does it remind you of as you imagine yourself running your hand along its surface, or the tingling feeling you feel run down your back? How are you reacting to the moment? Again, use descriptive adjectives to describe how the moment feels. Avoid using general statements like ""it feels nice"", which isn't descriptive at all. Opt for specific, definitive examples that relay the feeling of something to the reader. If you're describing how the object or item feels for a certain character, this can also give readers a sense of what it was like. Continuing on:



Nothing ever got erased, either. It was like memory. With enough time and will power, you could find almost anything down there. Katie had once recovered her third grade Tamagotchi from the storage closet. Another time, Nora had unearthed a disposable camera with undeveloped pictures I had taken during our fourth grade trip to Ellis Island.

Note that, in the above sentences, the narrator is showing that the basement that is being described was never cleaned up, while also using these details to show that the basement is important to her because it serves as a time capsule of her childhood. This is both conveying the feeling of being in the basement and also uses figurative language to add a deeper meaning to the place.



, What can you hear? Is there a deafening silence? If there is a buzzing sound, avoid simply saying ""All of a sudden I heard a loud buzzing sound"", rather ""I jerked as all of the sudden I heard an undefinable buzzing sound, so loud I put my hands over my face and ears. I assumed it was the fire alarm..."" and the reader would be able to relate with the ""fire alarm"" description, as most people have experienced the startling noise of a fire alarm. Here is how the sounds are described in our paragraph:



The television in the basement was always on, but no one ever seemed to watch it. We were too busy laughing over our latest stupid game of Rummikub, prank calling our crushes, or listening for the doorbell that told us the pizza was here.

Here, the narrator uses the sounds in the basement to help give a sense of what it was like to actually be there, and to indirectly tell the reader what was commonly done there.



, When you're describing something, give your readers an image, feeling, smell, or sight that they wouldn't normally expect. If you're describing a lawyer, for example, don't just tell the readers things that they would expect to hear about him, like that he wears a suit and works too much; tell them about his secret love for his pet iguanas. Make sure to keep your descriptions sounding fresh and surprising. Continuing on with our paragraph:



The silver Christmas garland around the banisters was pretty much a permanent fixture; the same birthday steamers celebrated three shoe-sizes of birthdays, eventually lost their color, and seemed to peel off the walls on their own accord.

This sentence makes it sound as if the basement has a life and will of its own.



, Using other effective writing techniques to top off your paragraph will make it all that more appealing and evocative. If you include all these elements in your paragraph, your reader will be able to fully experience and appreciate your writing. You can describe a person, place, or thing while using both literal language and speaking on the level of metaphor or simile to fully give a person a sense of the thing that is being described. Here is some figurative language:



As it was, with a net-less ping-pong table and a set of bare mattresses facing the TV, the basement looked more like the Fiona Apple ""Criminal"" video than a place to raise your children.

This sentence uses simile to compare the basement to a notorious music video, adding an extra layer of meaning.



, Though you don't need to have a neat concluding sentence for this creative paragraph (unless it is part of an assignment for school), you'll need to end the paragraph in some way to remind readers of what you had described and to leave a lasting idea of the person, place, or thing in their minds. Here's how this paragraph ends:



And that was exactly why three extra toothbrushes made their way to the downstairs bathroom. All of us could have lived and died there.

The second to last line, while it doesn't say that the other girls used to spend all of their time there explicitly, uses the images of the extra toothbrushes to show that this basement was once a sanctuary for the young girls, which reminds the reader of the first sentence. These sentences show that the basement was incredibly important to the girls who ""grew up"" there without explicitly saying so.

Include a citation for the article.,
Include the article with your summary.",How to Write a Current Events Summary," Choose a source that offers well-written and well-researched news. Avoid blogs and other personal websites, since these types of writings are more rooted in opinion than factual news. Determine the credibility of the source by examining the author, the news source, who owns the news source, and so on.Some possible news sources might include your local newspaper or larger newspapers such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and others.
Check with your teacher for suggestions. He may have specific news sources to use.;
, Since the assignment is to write about a current event, select an article that is fresh. The article should only be one to two days old when you write the summary. It should definitely be less than one week old by the time you turn it in.

, You may have an assigned topic, such as healthcare, government, technology, international news, or sports. These are still very broad topics, so you should be able to find plenty of news on the topic.


Most major newspapers have sections on their websites dedicated to certain topics. For example, the Washington Post has a section dedicated to “Tech.”
Search online for an article on one of these topics. For example, try searching “healthcare news” to find new information.

, You should choose an article that gives you enough information to work with. It should help you understand the topic at hand, and it should give you enough material to write about in your summary.


An article that is one to two paragraphs long is probably not going to be lengthy enough.

, Take some time to read through the entire article. Make sure you understand what the article says. Your objective with this assignment is to write a summary of the news story, so you need to fully understand the article.


Look up any words you don’t know.
Take notes on the article or highlight passages that you think are important.

, After you’ve read the article, try to recount the article out loud. You can either tell someone else or just tell yourself. This will help you figure out the main idea of the article.


The headline typically indicates the article’s main idea, but the article will likely include more information that is relevant to your summary.
Choose five main points from the article that you think are important.

, Once you’ve been able to retell the article’s story, read through the article again. Did you catch an important point that you missed before?

, These correspond to the details of the article that you’ve read. They help you make connections between the main idea and the various elements involved that make up the story.Give specific details for each one. For example:


Who: This is the person or group involved in the story. For a story on a recent arson case, you might say, “The people involved are four teenage boys who were charged with arson, a police investigation team, and the community that lost its historic baseball stadium.”
What: This is the event or the action discussed in the story. In an arson case, it might be: “The oldest wooden baseball stadium in the country burned to the ground.”
When: This is the date and time when the event took place: “The stadium burned down at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, June 29.”
Where: This is where the event took place: “The baseball stadium was in the middle of the city, surrounded by residences.”
Why: This is the cause or reason for the event: “The summer has been unusually dry and hot. The stadium had been sitting empty for five years and was not patrolled by security.”
How: This point explains the ways in which the events took place and the connections between them: “The teenagers walked into the stadium and began playing with lighters and loose debris. Once the fire was set, they ran off.”

, Why is this story important? Why are we talking about it? After your list of the five Ws and H, write down your thoughts on the impact or importance of the news story.


Think about the story’s connection to your community, the nation, or the world, for example.

, When you start writing your summary, you want to be absolutely sure you are not plagiarizing in any way. Set aside the news article and instead, work with your list of the five Ws and H. , The first paragraph of the current events summary is a summary of the events discussed in the article. Write an outline of the article, focusing on the five Ws and H. You may choose to rearrange the five Ws and H so that your summary makes sense.


When you recounted the article to someone else, you highlighted the most important parts of the article. These things will go in your outline. Now your job is to put them in an order that makes sense.

, The topic sentence for this paragraph is the main idea of the article. This sentence gives your reader an overview of what your summary will be about.

, The next few sentences are where you include your five Ws and H. Construct a logical way of telling the reader what happened. This may or may not be in the same order as the news article.


Depending on your assignment, this might be three or four sentences, or it might be seven to nine sentences. Check your assignment for your length requirement.

, The last sentence of your paragraph should reiterate the main idea of the news article. Choose wording that is different from your topic sentence., The reflection paragraphis your opportunity to make connections between this article and the community at large. Think about why this story is important. Think about the connection to your community, or your state, or the country. You might also think about the connection to your class. What themes are you discussing in class that relate to this article? Even though the reflection is short (usually just a paragraph), you should still aim to make an argument, at least to some degree. Determine the main point that you want to make and think about how you will support that main point.

, The first sentence of your reflection should be an introduction to what you’ll be discussing in your reflection.


Some teachers don’t allow the use of “I” (first person) in these reflections. Check with your teacher to determine if you can write in first person or not.

, Expand on your main point by giving specific examples from your news article.Build your paragraph in a logical way.


Don’t just string together random thoughts about why the news story is important.

, Finish off your reflection with a sentence that summarizes what you’ve discussed in your reflection. Or, you might make a final key point about the ultimate impact of the news story.

, Make sure your reader is going to focus on the content of your paper, rather than superficial elements like spelling and grammar. Correct all spelling and grammatical errors in your paper.


If you are handwriting your summary, you may need to write it out again as a clean copy after you’ve corrected any errors. For this reason, it may be preferable to type out the summary. Some teachers may require a typed paper.

, Check your assignment for any requirements about how to format your paper. For example, you may need to use 12-point Times New Roman font with one-inch margins.


If you have a grading rubric for the assignment, review this before turning in the assignment. Make sure you have met all the requirements to ensure a good grade.

, If your assignment requires it, include on your paper where the article came from. For example, you might write an MLA citation for an article like this:




Lee, Morgan. “California Regulators Approve Higher Electricity Rates for Most Residents.” The Los Angeles Times. The Los Angeles Times, 3 July 2015. Web. 4 July 2015.



, If your teacher asks for it, staple or paperclip the original news article to your summary. If you got your article from a news website, print out the entire article. Make sure that all pages are included, since some articles go on to a second page (or longer)."

List them together or separately.",How to Write a Compensation History," If you've already have a resume set up, just match your compensation page to the same style. You can even just save your resume as a new document (Compensation history), then start working from that document.To save your resume as a new document, click ""Save As"" under the file menu.
When the save document screen comes up, give the document a new name, so it will be a separate document from the original.;
, You need the same header at the top that your resume has. That means you include your name and your contact information in the same format as your resume. Also, add a title in the same format, such as ""Compensation History."", Now, take out the majority of your resume information. The exception is your work history. You need to leave that to work from, so you won't need to recreate it for your compensation history. There's no sense in doing work you've already done. Just like your resume, your most recent job should be first.Don't forget to take out the job description. You really just need the basics for your compensation page, as you've already included that information on your resume.
If you prefer, you can include an accomplishment or two, so that the interviewer knows why you've received that compensation.

, You have two choices for including compensation. You can either include both your starting and final compensation at a company, or you can include a range. The range can give you more wiggle room when it comes to negotiating, but some companies may demand an exact number. You should be able to tell from the request which your interviewer prefers, but if you can't, it's fine to ask which they prefer.With a range, it's fine to add in a little wiggle room. For instance, if your compensation was $40,000, you could say your compensation range was ""$37,000 – $43,000.""
Your best option for a range is to include the max and minimum of what you were paid, rounded to the nearest $1,000, as employers can check up on your past salaries.

, For each job, add in a line for compensation. You can label it ""Compensation"" to clear up any confusion. Place your compensation next to the label, then move on to the next job to add in the compensation.Don't forget to add a label. Make it clear whether the compensation was per year or per hour., Your cover letter should always be the first page, followed by your resume. If you're including a compensation history, it can come after your resume as the third page you include., That is, you can add a note about why you are willing to take a lower salary or why you think you deserve a higher one at the bottom of your compensation page. That way, your employer can better understand what salary you're looking for and why.For instance, you could say you took less in the past because you didn't have the experience. Now that you have the experience, you expect to be paid more. You could write, ""The salary I am currently asking for is proportionate to my experience."" Or, ""My compensation is at the low end of the industry standard for this position, which is one reason I am seeking employment at this time.""
On the other hand, you may be willing to take a cut because the economy is bad. You could write, ""I have been paid higher in the past, but I am willing to take a salary that is below what I was previously paid due to the downturn in the economy.""

, Another option is to avoid writing one all together. While some employers may request one, most will still look at you for the job if you skip it; however, you should address it in some way, such as saying you would love to discuss a salary range once you established that you are both interested in each other., Your salary is simply what you're paid, whether you are a salaried employee or paid by the hour. Your compensation, on the other hand, is what you're paid in total, including other benefits such as health insurance, as that is part of your benefit package.Don't forget that tips are a part of your salary, and they should be included in compensation.Don't forget to include any paid time off, or PTO. The trend now is for employers to lump all of your time off for the year together, and let you decide how and when to use it. This will include all vacation, personal and sick days, and is a negotiating point when it comes to making and accepting job offers.

, If your employer contributes to your health insurance, you need to figure out what part your employer paid. Take the amount your employer paid for the year, and add it to your original salary. Your health insurance, salary, and PTO make up the main part of your compensation package, though you may have additional items.Don't forget to include any dental or vision insurance your employer pays for in this part of your compensation.

, Another benefit some employees offer is retirement matching. That is, for every amount you take out of your check to go to your retirement, the employer puts in a certain amount. Some employers match dollar-for-dollar, while others only match a certain percentage.Check to see how much your employer contributed per year on your behalf. It's fine to do an average per year if you and your employer contributed different amounts each year.
Add the final number into your compensation number.

, Employers also compensate employees with bonuses and stock. These perks can be easier to forget, since they aren't as regular as your salary. If your employer provides these benefits, figure out what you received per year. Add that into your compensation for that company., Another part of compensation is what perks you get from your company. For example, if you get discounts at certain places, those perks add up. Maybe your employer pays part of a gym membership or provides meals for free. Add up what you can from these perks, then add it to make your grand total for your compensation package., You can add up all the figures and list your compensation as one number. However, listing them separately is far more helpful to a prospective employer. Employers can often offer different combinations of benefits and perks to suit a person's individual needs, and seeing the details of your compensation from previous positions will be helpful.For instance, you could put your compensation as a dollar amount, and below that you could include the major perks you received, such as retirement matching, paid travel expenses, and free meals while at work.

Choose a specific title for your tutorial.,
Explain the craft.,
Break the craft procedure into simple steps.,
Edit your craft tutorial.",How to Write a Craft Tutorial," Your title should let readers know exactly what the tutorial is about, so you should therefore avoid using titles that are abstract, referential or metaphorical. For example, a tutorial for making ant-fabric baby bloomers should be called, ""How to Make Ant-Fabric Baby Bloomers,"" rather than, ""Ants on My Pants."";
, Introduce the craft by including a clear picture of the finished product, so crafters know exactly what they will be making, and write a tutorial introduction with the following information:


Name of the craft. Part of writing craft tutorials is coming up with descriptive, creative and relevant craft names. Use specifics about the craft that makes it stand out. For example, instead of calling the craft a jewelry box, call it a rhinestone treasure box.
Purpose of the craft. Describe what it could be used for, who might use it and for what occasions.
Level of difficulty. It's a good idea to include a general age range for people who would most likely be able to successfully complete the craft project, plus an estimation of the effort it takes for completion (easy, medium or hard).
Forewarning: If, for example, your craft requires special considerations, like ventilation, high heat or power tools, mention those before outlining the craft instructions.
List the things needed to finish the project. Your list should include tools and supplies, and should be comprehensive enough for crafters to use at the store for shopping. Provide exact amounts and measurements. Additionally, provide resources for hard to find supplies, if applicable.







, When you write a tutorial, follow these guidelines for creating procedure steps:


Each step should involve only 1 action, such as, ""Cut all the pattern pieces.""
Begin each step with an action verb (i.e. measure, draw, glue, etc.).
Number the steps of your craft tutorial so they are clearly differentiated.
Use bold and/or italicized font to accent important information.
Include tips, warnings and pointers along the way, as necessary. When you write a tutorial, it helps to tell readers what mistakes you made that they can avoid, as well as useful shortcuts you learned through experience.
Provide a picture for each step.

, Be sure to run the spelling and grammar check, as well as to read your tutorial out loud several times through in order to identify and correct any mistakes. You may also want to have someone else read it and provide feedback so that you know your tutorial makes sense logically and chronologically, and that your instructions are easy for readers to understand.

Establish how you are committed to diversity.,
Use a story to illustrate your experiences with diversity.,
Clarify the specific types of diversity that you are committed to.,
Discuss how you are going to embrace diversity.",How to Write a Diversity Statement2," In a personal statement, this section will be a little bit different, and will focus more on your personal views on diversity.


Instead of talking about customers or employees in general, talk about how you have encouraged diversity in the past or worked easily with a diverse group of people.
Use your experiences to back up what you’re saying.

, Nothing drives a point home like a personal anecdote. Use a story from your past to illustrate how committed you are to diversity.


For instance, maybe you started a gay-straight alliance when you were in high school because you saw gay friends being bullied.

, Take some time to talk about what types of diversity you are committed to, just as in the organizational statement.


Do you oppose ageism, sexism, classism, and homophobia?
Spell out in your diversity statement in positive statements, such as: “I believe that all people should be treated equally no matter what sex they are…”

, Show how you would use your experiences to embrace diversity in the future at the college or company.


Essentially, you want to convince your employer that you are committed to embracing all people.
If you are applying for a teaching position, you can discuss how you would go about teaching diversity in the classroom.
What types of lesson plans would you use to implement your positions?

Identify your audience.,
Follow the guidelines if you have been given them.,
Create a list of your academic and professional achievements.,
Create a list of your characteristics and interests.,
Review your list to select the content you will use in your bio.,
Determine if the brief description must be written in first or third person.,
Exclude all irrelevant facts and information.,
Write your bio and keep it short.,
Proofread and edit your brief description.,
Ask someone who knows you to read it.",How to Write a Brief Description of Yourself," Chances are, you aren’t just writing a description of yourself just because you feel like it. In order to write to the best of your ability, you will have to keep in mind the person (or people) you are writing for. Your readers may be your professor, colleagues, an academic committee or members of your local community., When writing a description of yourself for a class or for an application, you will be provided with guidelines outlining what you information you should have in your description.


If you are applying for a scholarship, the deciding committee may have outlined the types of information they want to receive from you.
In other situations, such as a personal description for a work environment, you may have to consult with your manager or colleagues to guide the contents of your description.

, Write down your academic accomplishments. You may have overcome extensive academic obstacles, excelled in a particular subject or graduated with honors from a reputable school. Review your professional achievements. Consider the highlights of your professional experience and make a list of sales awards, promotions, employee recognition awards and other noteworthy accomplishments.



Examples of accomplishments: I am the first person in my family to attend college, I was on the Dean’s List all four years of college, I triple majored with two minors, etc.

Examples of achievements: Sold the highest number of back scratchers of an employee in the history of Back Scratchers Inc., Was employee of the month 10 months in a row, Started out as a dishwasher and am now the executive chef at La Lune.

, Reflect on your personal characteristics. It helps to think of common adjectives people have used to describe you in the past. Pick words that you think will portray you in the best light for the specific institution you are writing your description for. As with your characteristics, you will want to list interests that pertain to what you are applying for. You may be known in your community for volunteering or planning community events. Sports and the arts are other areas of possible interests.



Examples of characteristics:: If you are applying to a volunteer organization such as AmeriCorps, you may consider using words such as compassionate, dedicated, and organized. These are all traits that a volunteer organization would look for in a potential volunteer--someone who can be compassionate with the people the organization helps, is dedicated to the cause, and can stay organized in the face of a lot of paperwork.

Examples of interests:: If you are applying for a position such as a member on a team of scientists that will travel to the Arctic together, you would want to list interests that show you are an adventurous team player. Things like, soccer player, rock climber, hiker, etc. would work well.

, Look at all of your lists and choose the combination of accomplishments, achievements, characteristics, and interests that will best create the most complete picture of who you are while still catering to the institution you are writing this bio for.



Example The following combination of examples paints the picture of someone who is a dedicated team player that has faced adversity to get where she is, and is now the best at what she does: 1. I play doubles tennis every week. 2. I have volunteered at the same animal shelter since I was nine. 3. I was the first woman in my family to go to college. 3. I have been the employee of the month at my law firm for four months straight.

, When submitting an application to a school or scholarship committee, your description will be in the first person. When writing a brief bio to be read as your introduction prior to a presentation you are giving, write it in the third person.Example of a sentence written in first person: I have been named employee of the month 11 times since joining the Best Buy team.

Example of a sentence written in third person: Jane Doe has been named employee of the month 11 times since she joined the Best Buy team.

, The key word of this assignment is ‘brief.’ While you may have an opportunity to write a longer bio at some point in your future, you will want to keep this description of yourself to the point. That means that you will not want to list any information that your reader doesn’t need to know.


Whereas inclusion of information about extracurricular activities may be of interest to a school admissions committee, it should be excluded from a professional description.

, Follow the guidelines provided by the requestor of the description. If you were not given guidelines, err on the side of brevity. The saying ‘less is more’ applies here--paint as complete a picture of yourself in as few words as possible. Generally, a personal description should be limited to a length of between 100 and 200 words.Write your bio in a conversational tone that is to the point but not stuck up. You want to promote yourself without sounding like a pompous jerk. So, instead of writing “My father owns 12 antique race cars, which I enjoy working on after a morning at the yacht club” say something like “I enjoy spending time with my dad, helping him fix up old cars and learning about what makes a machine run the most smoothly.”

, Set it aside for a few hours or days, and read it again to correct all typos and edit any awkward sentences. Setting it aside will help to clear your mind--when you look at it again, you will be able to read it more objectively (as if it was about someone else, rather than yourself.)


Read it aloud. Often, reading allow helps you to discover where your writing might sound awkward or stiff.
Double check the spelling of all proper nouns (this includes businesses, schools, organizations, programs, people you’ve worked with, etc.) In particular, make sure that you are correctly spelling the name of the organization you are writing the bio for.

, Request feedback on the tone and accuracy of your description to ensure that you are not being too humble or overstated. Ask them, is your bio clear? Does it represent you well? If they didn’t know you, would they have a better understanding of you after reading your bio? Is there anything you should add or take out of the bio?

Clarify with the author or professor what you are being asked to critique.,
Introduce the critique with a short description of the author and text.,
Explain the significance of the work.,
Begin with positive critiques, if you are writing the critique based on a draft.,
Include a short summary of the work next.,
Do an analysis of the larger elements of fiction, such as plot, setting, protagonist, antagonist and point of view.,
Add both positive and negative points under each section.,
Suggest possible changes to drafts; however, do not write them out in detail.,
Explain the overall success of the work in the conclusion.",How to Write a Critique," Make sure there are no other annotations. For best results, buy or ask for a copy of the work that you can mark on directly.;
, For example, decide to underline the thesis statement, circle imagery and make notes on characters and plot in the margins.


If it is helpful to you, a professor or writer, create a legend of your annotations on the first page of the work.

, An initial reading is essential to mark down first impressions and plot developments. Annotation helps you to refer to this initial reading after you begin to write your critique.

, Reading for critiques should be focused reading, so don't do too much at once.

, In addition to annotation, if you are critiquing a draft of a story or essay, questions can help elucidate if the author has additional plot work or if they are simply creating tension.

, During the second reading, expand your annotation for grammar, spelling and character or plot development errors.

, If imagery, character or an argument is well made, highlight it or note it in the columns.

, If you are being asked to do a critique of non-fiction work, it is usually with an attention to scholarship and detail.

, Detail the work, author and subject area. You may want to include initial dates of publication and any changes that were later made to the work that should be taken into account.

, Suggest what you think the thesis statement the author conveys. Add what evidence is used and what the purpose of the article is.

, In 3 or more body paragraphs you should refer to the following subjects:


Explain what the author's credentials are. Establish whether you think the author is reliable in the treatment of the evidence. For example, perhaps the author makes a leap that is outside of his expertise or establishes himself as a foremost expert with this work.
Evaluate the evidence given. Do not be afraid to do this over several paragraphs, if the author uses different types of evidence or studies.
Write about the author's argument. Answer whether it follows a logical path. Decide whether the author was successful.
Outline any counter arguments that the article or book inspired. Detail any possible newer research, changes or holes in the evidence.

, The critique should be based on research and reading; however, it should ultimately say whether you agreed with the author and why.


Try to avoid overly-emotional reasoning and stick to facts about the writing and argument.

, If you are asked to do a general analysis, you can include what you think are the most important problems and assets of the text.

, For academic critiques, the introduction should outline what you are being asked to critique.

, This can be done in the introduction or near the end, if you desire.

, Critiques based on works in progress should begin and end with positive assessments.


The positive assessments should begin with a general description of what is positive in the text. Then, you can include praise of imagery, characters and other details.

, For a published work, this will give your basis for review. For a non-published work, this will tell the author how you interpreted the work.

,


You do not need to do an analysis of all of these elements, unless you are asked to by the author or assignment. Focus on things that stuck out as you read and reread the work.

, Try not to refer to things that need work as weaknesses.

, It is up to the author to revise.

, If you are doing an academic critique, add how you interpreted the work and found it convincing and complete. If you are doing a draft writing critique, feel free to leave a few opinions or topics for thought and discussion.

Consider presenting your critique to the author in person. Written critiques do not have the nuance of verbal critiques.

Read examples of children’s poetry.,
Find inspiration.,
View a situation from the perspective of a child.,
Try the rhyming form.,
Make a shape poem.,
Experiment with different forms.,
Include sensory detail.,
Use alliteration and repetition.,
Add a twist or surprise at the end of the poem.,
Ask children for feedback on the poem.,
Revise the poem for clarity and brevity.,
Consider distributing or publishing the poem.",How to Write a Children's Poem," Look for inspiration for your poem by reading the work of others, particularly poetry that has proven to be popular among children. There are several well known poems popular with children, including:“Who Has Seen the Wind?” by Christina Rossetti.“The Dentist and the Crocodile” by Roald Dahl.“Daddy Fell Into the Pond” by Alfred Noyes.
“About the Teeth of Sharks” by John Ciardi.;
, Children often respond well to humor, especially imagery that conjures up a funny scene or situation. You may be able to generate content for your children’s poem by using an image you find funny or amusing. You could then expand on this image in your poem.For example, maybe you ended up in the path of an angry pigeon on the way to work today. You may then use your amusing encounter with the pigeon as the source of inspiration for your poem. Children may enjoy a humorous retelling of how you managed to escape a persistent pigeon on a busy city street.
You can also tap into your own childhood memories and interests as inspiration. Consider what made you laugh when you were young, and what made you curious or intrigued. Doing this can help you get into the mindset of a child and remember what topics made you giggle when you were young.For example, maybe you enjoyed playing with plastic snake toys as a child. You may then remember when your brother tried to stuff a plastic snake up his nose and your attempts to help him remove it. This could then serve as the inspiration for a funny poem about plastic snakes in your nose.

, You can also take inspiration by trying to see a particular situation or scene from the point of view of your audience. Viewing a moment from the perspective of a child can help you to notice details or aspects that may be appealing to them. It can also allow you to describe the scene with creativity and imagination.For example, you may consider how a child might view going to the dentist for the first time. The dentist may appear to a child as a puffy swan in a white coat and the dentist chair might seem like a time machine. You may then be inspired to write a poem about a trip to the dentist that leads to an afternoon of time travel.

, Many children’s poems are written in the rhyming form, where the poem follows a certain rhyming scheme or pattern. Often, you do not need to rhyme every line of the poem, as this can sound contrived, even to children. Instead, you may rhyme only a few lines or words in the poem so there is just enough rhyme for it to sound fun and interesting to your young audience.For example, in Christina Rossetti’s poem “Who Has Seen the Wind?”, Rossetti only rhymes a few words in the poem, with “you” rhyming with “through” and “I” with “by”.This gives the poem just enough rhyme to have a sing song quality, without feeling overdone or too contrived.

, Shape poems are great forms for children, as they create an interesting visual for children to look at on the page. Shape poems are often short and concise, as you are limited by the space available within the shape. This makes them good options for poetry written with children in mind.


You may decide to do a type of shape poem that has a short number of lines, like a cinquain. This is a five line poem that appears in the shape of a diamond. It is often easy to write and fun to read., Many children’s poems are written with brevity in mind, as most children have a short attention span and like to be engaged right away. The haiku form, with its short form, is ideal for children’s poetry. Haikus follow a 5-7-5 pattern, with one line that is five syllables long, one line that is seven syllables long, and one line that is five syllables long.You can also try the limerick form The limerick is a type of children’s verse that is known for being funny, ridiculous, and silly. These qualities make it an ideal option for a children’s poem.Limericks are five lines long and have a set rhyme scheme. The first two lines rhyme with each other, the third and fourth lines rhyme with each other and the fifth line repeats the first line or rhymes with the first line. This rhyme scheme gives limericks a bouncy quality when spoken out loud.
Some of the more well known limericks are the Mother Goose nursery rhymes. Often, limericks are meant to be silly and nonsensical, making them appealing to children.

, Good children’s poems will engage with all five senses, from smell to sound to taste to touch to sight. Make sure your poem includes details that play with the senses, as children often respond to sensory descriptions.For example, if you were writing a poem about the dentist’s chair as a time traveling machine, you may describe the smells of the dentist’s office and the taste of the plastic dental clamps in your mouth. You may also consider how it feels to sit in the dentist’s chair and the sounds the chair might make as it flies through time.

, You should also try to include literary devices like alliteration and repetition in your children’s poem. These two literary devices will add playfulness and creativity to your poem, making it more appealing to your young audience.Alliteration occurs when words with the same consonant sound, and often words that begin with the same letter, appear in sequence. For example, in Roald Dahl's’ “The Dentist and the Crocodile”, there is alliteration in the line: “He quivered, quaked, and shook.”Repetition occurs when the same word is repeated in succession or in the same line. For example, in Christina Rossetti’s poem “Who Has Seen the Wind?”, the title phrase “Who has seen the wind?” is repeated twice in each stanza of the poem.The repeated phrase acts as a kind of refrain for the poem, almost like a song.

, Humor combined with a twist or a surprise can be a great way to engage children and make them laugh. A twist or a surprise adds a layer of silliness to the poem, a quality most children will appreciate. You may include a twist ending or a surprise moment at the end of the poem.For example, in Roald Dahl’s “The Dentist and the Crocodile”, the twist ending occurs when the owner of the crocodile appears at the dentist. She reassures the dentist, who is by now frightened of the crocodile, “'Don't be a twit,' the lady said, and flashed a gorgeous smile./'He's harmless. He's my little pet, my lovely crocodile.'""This twist ending is sure to make children laugh with the silliness of having a pet crocodile, at the dentist no less.

, Once you have completed your children’s poem, you should go straight to your target audience for feedback. Read the poem out loud to your own children or to your classroom of children. Listen to their reactions, noting when they laugh or giggle. Pay attention to how they react to the form of the poem and your word choice.If the poem falls a little flat, you may need to revise it so it is more appealing to children. This may mean including more sensory detail or shortening the poem so it is quick, fast, and funny. You may also consider adding in a twist ending to surprise your young audience and make them giggle.

, You should revise the children’s poem so the language is simple and clear. You should also make sure the poem is short and to the point, as children have a limited attention span and like to be engaged right away.


You may also use the feedback from your child audience to revise the poem. Take their constructive criticism seriously, as you want to make sure the poem is appealing to your target audience.

, If you think your poem is strong, you may decide to distribute the poem to your children or to young students in your classroom. You may also decide to send out the poem for publication to magazines and journals that publish poems for children.


If you do decide to send the poem out for publication, make sure you read a few sample poems in the magazine or journal to get a sense of what they are looking for. Publications are more likely to accept your work if it fits with the style and tone of other poems they have published.

Write an outline of your dissertation if you have not already done so.,
Gather the information you will need for a science abstract.,
Include the correct information for a humanities abstract.,
Know what to include in a social science abstract.,
Prepare your information for a business abstract.,
Start by writing the full citation for the paper.,
Begin with a condensed version of your thesis.,
Write in the sentences from your outline.,
Read through your abstract and add transitions to make it easy to follow.,
Make sure to include information that is specific to your discipline.,
Edit your abstract to make it short and concise.,
Double check that your abstract includes the most important information contained in your paper.,
Keep the reader in mind.",How to Write a Dissertation Abstract," If you don’t already have an outline of your dissertation, you should create one. Making an outline will help to make writing your actual abstract much more efficient. To create an outline:


Start with your main thesis at the top.
Next, read each section of your paper. As you read, write a one-sentence summary of each major chapter or section. Keep them in order on your paper. Regardless of your discipline, take time to point out the key theorists in the discipline you’ll be exploring in your paper.
Include a summary of your conclusions, as well.
If you’re writing an abstract for a scientific dissertation, it’s not necessary to include all of your literature review; however, you might include a sentence on how your paper fits into the larger academic discussion.;
, Depending on your field of study, your abstract will contain certain specific pieces of information. For a science abstract, make sure to:


Discuss how your research fits into the larger academic discussion.
Talk about your methodology.
Include your conclusions.
Take time to discuss how it could lead to further research.

, For a humanities abstract, you will need to include information about the major works you are discussing. Remember to:


Include any major works you’re analyzing. In other words, provide a short discussion of the source material, whether it’s the diaries of a famous historical figure for a history dissertation, a work of literature, a piece of music, or a great work of art.
Discuss the major theories you’re applying to make your argument.
Cover your main argument.
Talk about your conclusions.

, A social science abstract will most likely focus on the research you did and any studies you conducted. Try to:


Include any methodology you used to conduct research.
Provide an overview of any studies you conducted, including participants and the purpose of the study.
Discuss major theories that you are using for analyzing your work, as well as how your research fits into the larger discussion. Remember to keep it brief.
Don’t forget to discuss your conclusions, as well as how your research could lead to further research.

, For a business abstract, you will most likely have to provide specifics about other companies that you use as a model. Remember to:


Include major theories you are using to analyze your research.
Talk about your research methods, especially if you are collecting data.
Provide specifics if you are looking at a particular company or analyzing a particular model.
Discuss your overall conclusions.

, This full citation should be placed above your abstract. The citation should include:


Your name.
The name of the article you have written.
Publication information, if there is any.

, You can begin with your overall thesis, as long as it is only a sentence in length. If it is more than a sentence long, try to condense it down.Remember, you’re just trying to give your reader an overview of your dissertation, not every detail.

, Collect the sentences you wrote about each section of your paper and shape them into a paragraph. Make sure to keep them in order so that your reader does not get confused by a section being out of place.


You should also include the sentence about your conclusion.

, While copy and pasting sentences together is a fast way to create an abstract, you should add transitions to make those stand-alone sentences make sense as a whole paragraph.


Remember, you are not just summarizing your individual thoughts in your abstract, you are recreating the argument you make in your paper in a shortened form.

, As mentioned above, each discipline has its own information that will need to be included in your abstract. See Part 1 for more information.


For instance, if you’re an archaeologist, you need to reference your primary materials.
If you’re a librarian, you should talk about the methods you’ve used to collect your research.
If you’re a psychologist, talk about the way you conducted your study.

, Cut your abstract down where it is necessary. An abstract should be about 100 to 200 words or so,as your reader is just trying to get an overall sense of your argument. If your abstract is much longer, spend some time cutting out unnecessary information and making your sentences as concise as possible.Only include information that is in the paper; do not bring new ideas into the abstract.

, Your abstract should include the main purpose of your paper, the problem you’re exploring, how you implemented your research, the conclusions you drew, and the implications it holds for other research. These items will change by discipline, of course.


The way you implement your research in science includes methodology (how you carried out your experiment), but in a humanities paper, you’ll likely be talking about the theories you applied in your research (such as applying Foucault’s theories to a book like Wuthering Heights).

, Remember that your readers want to know the key points and ideas of the work, which is true across all disciplines. Include enough information that they will be able to tell how well it fits into their own research but not so much information that they become overwhelmed.

Decide who you're going to write the book with.,
Choose someone you can be frank with.,
Pick someone whose personality complements yours.,
Choose a genre.,
Create your main character(s).,
Decide what the plot will be.,
Create the secondary characters.",How to Write a Book With Another Person1," It should be someone you get along well with, someone who likes to write, and someone who has a similar writing style to yours. Pick somebody that is open to new ideas and isn't bossy. You need a person you can trust and who you'll want to share your ideas with. Find someone you can discuss ideas with easily and who values your opinion. This is crucial if you want to start a co-authoring project together.
Of course, some writing projects (like academic ventures or school projects) often don’t enable you to choose your writing partner. If you are not allowed to choose your partner, try to make the process as enjoyable as possible by being amicable and willing to compromise.;
, One of the most important parts of writing with someone is being able to speak openly about what you like, what you don’t like, what you think should be changed, and what you think should be kept in the writing. You need to choose someone who won’t get their feelings hurt every time you make a recommendation about something they wrote.In the same respect, you need to pick someone that you can take criticism from. You both need to be able to tell each other honestly what you think about the writing, regardless of who wrote it.

, There’s a lot to be said for working with someone who is similar to you. In many ways, this kind of partnership works well. However, you also want to find someone who excels at things you aren’t so good at so that you can cover more ground with your skillsets combined.If you have a hard time getting things done on time, try to find a writing partner who is really good at pushing forward to meet deadlines.
If you are really good at line-by-line editing, you might want to work with someone who is better at thinking about the bigger picture.

, Once you both agree to write something together, decide what the genre will be. There are literally endless possibilities. Pick something that you both are interested in, and a genre that could make the most successful book.Some possible genre options include romance, science fiction, crime/drama, fantasy, memoir, or self-help.
If you are writing in an academic (or otherwise professional) capacity, choosing a genre may not apply to you. You will, however, need to agree upon the topic to be discussed and a game plan for tackling the project. Your argument will need to be cohesive, so it is important that you agree on the outcome and the process from the start.

, Think about what kind of people you want to write about. What are their physical characteristics? What are some of their personality traits? Provide each main character with a back story that accounts for the kind of person you want them to be.Spend some time fleshing out the details so that your main characters are well developed. You don’t want flat characters that leave your readers unsatisfied or unconvinced.

, Think about the story you want to tell. What kinds of things do you want your characters to experience? What are the main events in the story? What obstacles will your characters need to overcome?Think about what you want the eventual outcome of the story to be and consider what events might occur on the journey to get to that point.

, These are characters that aren't as important, but every good story needs them. They help the story along in more minor ways, but still play an essential role in moving the plot forward.Think about how your main characters will react in certain plot situations. This may help you come up with some essential secondary characters for your story.
For example, if one of your main characters has to go on a journey, some secondary characters could be people your main character meets along the way – the bellhop at a hotel, a fellow passenger on an airplane, etc.

Assign responsibilities.,
Decide how you'll write the book.,
Create deadlines.,
Make a schedule.,
Hold each other accountable.",How to Write a Book With Another Person2," In order to complete a writing project together, you’ll need to be clear from the get-go about who is responsible for what pieces. You don’t want to accidentally be working on the same parts as your partner, or be the only one working at all. Make your expectations clear so that each partner can move forward with a good understanding of what needs to be done.For example, perhaps you’ll begin working on the outline for the first chapter while your partner starts working on some of the dialogue that will appear in a particular scene in that chapter.
The work should be divided fairly evenly when possible.

, Different people work different ways. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to complete a writing project in today’s technological world. Whatever method you choose, make sure it is a way that you can both contribute to changes being made.Consider typing chapters up on the computer that you email to each other for review.
You could also create a Google document that you each simultaneously edit.
Or you may want to do it the old-fashioned way in a notebook that you pass back and forth between the two of you.

, When you begin undertaking a large writing project, it’s easy to get lost in the enormity of the thing – especially in the beginning stages. Try breaking the writing up into manageable parts with clear deadlines for each part.Focus on one smaller piece at a time instead of get freaked out by the entire project as a whole.

, Create a writing schedule, and then stick to it. If you're serious about writing this thing together, try to write at a set time at least once a week. Talk to your co-author about when you plan to be writing and what your writing schedule will be.Be honest with each other about your productivity and keep each other in the loop if something comes up.
Try to have (at least) weekly meetings, even if it is just by email or by phone, to keep each other updated on your progress.

, When you set deadlines, try to meet them by adhering to your planned writing schedule. If one person begins falling behind, offer encouragement and support to help get them back on track. Ask your writing partner to do the same for you.


It is often easier to stick to schedules when the pressure of letting down another person is factored into the situation.

"
"
Create a single voice.,
Mediate differences.,
Have a written contract drawn up.",How to Write a Book With Another Person3," One of the biggest challenges in creating a single text between two or more writers is merging the work into a consistent, shared voice. This can be complicated due to varying writing styles among the writing partners. The best way to do this is to actually work on the writing together. However, when this isn’t possible, you’ll need to merge your separate work into one document and smooth out the differences together as a team.Watch out for things like varying tone, word choice, and sentence structure.

, When two people work closely together on a single project, it’s inevitable that differences will arise. You need to figure out a way to navigate these instances together in a way that doesn’t upset either party and ends in a result both people can agree on.When a dispute arises, try to honestly communicate with your writing partner in a respectful manner. Since you both have the same end goal (completing the project), this is often an effective method.
If you just can’t seem to agree on something, try getting a neutral third party to listen to both sides and help you determine a course of action that is acceptable to both of you.

, If you are co-writing a book with another person, it’s possible that costs will be incurred and that profits could potentially be made. You both need to have a clear understanding about how these costs and profits will be divided among you so that these expectations are clear from the beginning.Additionally, since you are co-creating something with another person, you’ll need to establish in what ways both partners are permitted to use the work in the future. Can you publish or quote from the piece in separate forums? These are things you need to agree on ahead of time and establish in a written contract. This will protect you both in the end.

Conduct interviews and gather information.,
Write the behavior management plan.,
Update the behavior management plan following a review or change in intervention.",How to Write a Behavior Management Plan,"


Interview the teacher who reported the child's behavior problem. Ask the teacher why the behavior is a problem, what his or her thoughts are about the child's behavior, and why he or she thinks the problem is occurring.
Talk to the student's former teachers to acquire information about the child's background and behavioral history. Interview the student's parents to learn more about the family dynamic and how it affects the student's behavior in school.
Interview the student to determine why he or she has chosen the problematic behavior. Ask the student how he or she feels about the problematic behavior. Find out how the student thinks the behavior impacts others.
During your interviews, ask about the student's strengths. This information will help you to develop the behavior management interventions that will be a part of the student's plan.
Review the student's school records to collect information on previous problematic behaviors and interventions, medical and mental health issues, family problems, and grades in current and previous classes.;
,


Heading: At the top of your report, write the student's name, school, grade level, age, and the date the report was written.
Strengths: List the student's strengths. For example, the student desires to participate in class discussions or has a positive response to receiving praise from the teacher. The listed strengths should be related to the student's classroom behavior.
Student's Background Information: In this section, report on medical and mental health diagnoses, previous behavior problems, family issues, current medication, and learning difficulties (poor reading, writing or social skills).
Previous Behavior Interventions: Note all interventions the student's teachers and/or family members have tried in the past to resolve the problematic behavior. State if the intervention was effective or not.
Problematic Behaviors: The student may have more than one problematic behavior. Your behavior management plan should include the following information about each: A statement identifying the problem; the purpose of the behavior; and the behavior that should replace the problematic behavior.
Interventions: Include the strategies that will be used to help the student change the problematic behavior and the acceptable documentation that will show the intervention is working. For example: An intervention may state that the student will change the behavior of not completing homework by turning in 4 homework assignments a week.
Communication with Family: Your behavior management plan should include strategies for communicating with the student's family about his or her progress. This could include sending a note home with the student at the end of every week, scheduling a weekly phone call or reaching out by email.
Crisis Management: Include a plan for managing the student's behavior problem if he or she refuses to follow instructions or loses control. Crisis management strategies may include time-out, detention or suspension, or contacting the police if the student acts out violently and becomes a danger to himself or others.
You should also include a schedule in the plan for reviewing the student's progress.

,


The plan should be revised after each scheduled review (usually at the end of every grading period) or when an intervention has been changed by a teacher or other member of the Individual Education Program team.
Updates will include the student's success in changing the problematic behavior; any major family or educational issues that arise; and any crisis events that the student experienced during the semester.

Know what kind of book you’re writing.,
Identify major themes and the plot.,
Think about setting and time period.,
Search for your title ideas online.,
Look at the titles of your favorite books.,
Start with a working title.,
Identify your major characters.,
Write down ten options.,
Hint at the story within.,
Use nouns and verbs.,
Narrow down word count.,
Allow your title to have multiple meanings.,
Run your title by other people.",How to Write a Book Title," Your title will vary depending on what kind of book you are writing. Nonfiction titles can be creative, but should be more descriptive of what the book is about. Fiction titles can be more mysterious or creative. The title is the first thing your readers will read. The title needs to give readers some idea of what’s inside the book, entice, and be informative.If you have a nonfiction book like a series of essays, or a biography, your title should be more to the point.
Fiction or genre stories like horror, fantasy, science fiction, and mystery, should be creative and entice readers to want to know more, offering intrigue. Use words that are commonly associated with certain genres to start.
A mystery novel could use a title like “The Mysterious Road Forks”. Readers will identify this title with mystery, unanswered questions, and a plot involving a strange road.
Fantasy and science fiction titles can include made up names or places, or words of magic. “The Signal from Vandor” could be a title to a science-fiction book that tells of a strange alien signal from a far away planet named “Vandor”.;
, Every book, fiction or nonfiction has at least one major theme; and even nonfiction stories follow some type of plot. Write down what your themes and plot are in one paragraph. Think about what your characters do throughout your story. What sort of moral dilemmas do these characters deal with?


If your book is about a hero or group of heroes conquering evil, then your theme deals with good vs. evil.
Perhaps you have a fictional story that takes place in the real world. Are your characters dealing with growing older, moving on to another stage in life, hiding a secret, death, or something else?
If you have a nonfiction book, ask yourself why you are writing this book. Are you writing a series of essays about a specific event because you feel compelled to inform others? Maybe you’re exploring some aspect of history that you are inspired by.
Whatever kind of book your titling, write a paragraph that summarizes your themes and plots putting yourself in the reader's’ shoes. Knowing this information, ask yourself what you would want to see in a title for this book. Perhaps you want to know that it is a history of some event. Or you might want to know that you’ll be reading a coming of age tale.
Understanding your plot will also help to craft a title that doesn’t completely give away your plot. You don’t want the readers to know everything about the unfolding story within without having to open the book up.

, Where and when the story inside of your book takes place will help you dictate what kind of language to use in your title. A medieval tale may not use modern words or language. A spy novel set in the modern day may deal with hacking and computers. Your title should aim reflect these aspects. For example, instead of using the word “soldier” in a medieval setting, you may opt for “knight”.


Settings and time periods can also be a great place to start when titling. If your story were about a group of climbers ascending a large mountain, think about the words you could use based on that information alone. Words like “mountain”, “summit” “peak” are all precise nouns that inform and intrigue., Search online for titles that may be floating around in your head. Not only will you find out if a particular title already exists, but you may find further inspiration.


You don’t want to name your book something that already exists, especially if it’s a best selling book. This will make it harder for people to find your work if you publish your book.
Searching for phrases online can also point you in a new direction that you may not have thought of before. You might find that instead of using the word “tale” in your title, the word “adventure” or “fable” sounds better for what you’ve written.

, In addition to searching for titles online, go to your own bookshelf and study the titles of your favorite books. Think about, or even write down, a short answer as to why you picked up a particular book in the first place.


Even if you were referred to a book by a friend or read it in school, you probably saw or heard the title before you knew much else about the book.
Were you drawn to this book because the title intrigued you and you wanted to know the story underneath? Books like “The Great Gatsby” are loved in part because of the fantastic storytelling and quality of writing. But the title does the legwork before you get to uncover that story. “The Great Gatsby” gives you an idea of what the book is about. But if you knew nothing, “Great” sounds wondrous, strong, and compelling. What is “great”? Who is “great”? “Gatsby” is an interesting and precise noun. It sounds like a name, but it could be something else. A title like this is simultaneously informative, and mysterious. It’s only until you’ve read the book, that you can look back and understand the title completely.

, Some writers start with a title before a single word of the story has been written. The title informs the story and inspires how it will unfold. Other writers write the whole story and then go back and add a title based on what has been written. In either case, the title will usually go through some changes during the entire process. Start with a working title that serves as a placeholder if you’re still writing your book. The working title can help to keep your story on track in terms of plot development, character choices, and overall genre.


You might find that your working title ends up staying unchanged. But as the story continues you may also find that your working title no longer applies.
In either case, your working title will help you to craft a final one as you learn more about your book.

, Many titles come from your main characters, or the most important character to your overall story. Certain characters are known as the Title Character, in that the character’s name is in the title. The play “Hamlet” simply uses Hamlet’s name as the title, and the reader knows upfront that this story is about that character. “The Great Gatsby” does the same. John Green's “Looking for Alaska” not only provides a sense of mystery concerning the subject of the book, as Alaska could be a place or the name of a person, but it ultimately tells us that the character, Alaska, is the driving force of much of the story’s action.


You may choose not to use the name of a character in your title, but being to identify who your important characters are, and why each one is important to your story will give you options.
The novel “Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell” is a story that involves many important characters, yet the title shows readers who the leading forces are. It intrigues readers right away by not only the uniqueness of the names, but draws up a curiosity on what the relationship between these two is, and why both are important enough to be given the title.

, It’s always much easier to edit down than it is to have to add. Writing down ten or so book titles will not only force you to come up with several different, and unique options, but it will also give you room to combine a few titles into one perfect one.Try not to edit yourself while writing your test titles. You’re not committing to anything yet, so just free write and have fun coming up with fun, crazy options.
Don’t worry about word count too much here, as you just want to get your ideas out.
Try to incorporate different combinations of place, characters, themes, and action verbs., Look at your list of amazing titles that you have compiled so far. Star the ones you like best and look for ones that provide some context of the story that is within your book.


Read over your work. Are there any parts or phrases that jump out? Take out a phrase that is catchy, or grabs one's attention. If it is concise enough, you could play around with this phrase as the title.
Jane Austen's “Pride and Prejudice” is a great example of a title that tells readers exactly what the theme of the book is about, but it doesn’t give anything away in terms of spoiling the actual plot. This title is also poetic and an alliteration, meaning the beginning of both words start with the same letter and sound.
”Moby Dick” is another example of a great title that provides intrigue without giving the story away. You may not know who or what Moby Dick is before reading, but after, you’ll have a larger understanding of the meaning of this title.

, Specific nouns and actionable verbs which are more specific. Both will make your title sharper and more creative. Look at your favorite titles from your list and pick a few that really stand out to you. Now see where you can get more specific. Toy around with replacing generic nouns like “boy” “girl” “town”, etc. with specific ones. What is the name of the boy, girl, or town? Can you replace a word with a more specific one that provides further details?


Take for example “The Scarlet Letter”. The use of “scarlet” is much more interesting than simply “red”. “The Red Letter” sounds fine, but by getting more specific with what shade of red, you add a finer point of detail that makes your title stand out.

, Sometimes long titles are extremely intriguing and inventive. However, it can be harder to have a good book title if it is longer. “The Hundred-Year-Old Man who Climbed out of the Window and Disappeared” is a long title that works because it manages to be a story in itself without divulging the story of the book very much. On the other end of the spectrum, “Dracula” is one word that tells you everything you need to know.


The length of your title is subjective, but aiming for a shorter book title may be easier to do.
A more traditional, and often successful strategy is to use two or three word titles in an “adjective + noun” or “noun + of + noun” formula. Titles like “Game of Thrones”, “Lord of the Flies”, and “My Sister’s Keeper” use this strategy.
Additionally, think about searchability for your book if you are publishing it, especially online. You not only want your title to be memorable, but you want it to be easy to type into a search on both a computer and mobile device.
Nonfiction and more academic works can get away with having a longer title due to the nature of the book’s contents. “The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money” needs to be longer to adequately describe all of the contents held within.

, Play with contrasts, moods, and vivid language. A great book, and title make readers think about what the title truly means. The title has one meaning before someone has read the book, and another after, when that reader has gained the knowledge and insight from within the pages.Going back to “The Great Gatsby”; once you know the story, the title gains another meaning. Gatsby, to the outside world, is a great and mysterious individual. After reading the book, “great” takes on a new meaning. There’s an irony and contrast in the title. Gatsby isn’t truly a great man. Gatsby has risen to the status of greatness through dishonest means. Gatsby’s life is a sham, and the only thing “great” about the man is the story people tell. A third meaning to the title comes from Gatsby’s most redeemable character motivation, love. While Gatsby has lied, and is pretending to be someone else, the character acts out of love for Daisy. In this way, Gatsby is “great”.Not only does the title “The Great Gatsby” tell you who a main character is, what the book is about, and provide multiple meanings, but it is also succinct. When writing your title, try to incorporate as many of these elements as you can.

, Once you have a title you like, step away from it for a while and ask others for an outside opinion. Another perspective may be just what you need to perfect your title.


Give people a quick synopses of your story and ask for feedback on your title. Ask these people if the title is intriguing. Does it make sense? Is it too short or too long?
After you step away from your title for a while, you can go back to it with fresh eyes. Read over your work again and compare it to your title. You may find you have thought of something else in the meantime.

Decide if you are a planner or pantser.,
Brainstorm your novel.,
Outline your novel.,
Flesh out your characters.,
Form a writing group.,
Choose how you will write your novel.",How to Win NaNoWriMo1," In the NaNoWriMo community, there are two types of writers. The planners are those who plan their novel ahead of time. The pansters are those who wing it as they go along.Think about how prepared you want to be before you start writing your novel.


A planner will probably do outlines, character sketches, and other organizational techniques. This helps the planner avoid writer's block as they have a firm idea of where their novel is going.
A pantser may start out with a vague idea in their head. Pantsers tend to come up with ideas as they write. This helps them keep their writing fresh, and it allows them flexibility as they write during the month.;
, You should start drafting several different ideas for potential novels early in September or October. You can choose whichever idea is the strongest or your favorite. There are many different ways to start brainstorming. These include:



Mindmapping: Write down a main idea (such as “man finds alien”). From this central idea, come up more ideas (such as “alien is friendly” or “alien warns of meteor”). Connect these new bubbles with your central idea. As you come up with more ideas, draw lines between them. The lines should represent how ideas, events, and motivations tie together.Research: If you have a general idea but do not have a central plot, you can start researching relevant details to help you generate ideas. For example, if you know you want to write a Victorian romance novel, you can start off by researching life in the Victorian era or the major events of that century.Listing: Create a list of different ideas that pop into your head. These could be character ideas, scene details, settings, interesting pieces of dialogue, or major events. Keep listing until you are out of ideas. You may find that by writing down ideas, more ideas come to you., An outline will help you stay on track during your month of writing. By knowing what happens next in your novel, you may be able to prevent writer’s block. This also takes much of the work out of novel writing, so you can focus on hitting your word count. Some ways to outline include:



Skeleton Model: This is a traditional outline. List ten major events in the novel. This should include the introduction, the rising conflict, the climax, the resolution, and the conclusion. Label each with a roman numeral. Below each section, in bullet points, list the major events or the most important details of each section.Notecards: Write down your major events, plot points, or details on notecards. Lay these out on a table, and arrange them in the order that you want. If something seems out of place, you can move it around. Remember to stack the notecards in their proper order so you can pull them out next time.

Chapter outline: Write down all of your chapters and their headings. Write a brief summary of what happens in each chapter., Strong characters make a convincing novel, and the more fully realized your characters are before you start writing, the easier the writing process will be. To start building your characters, answer the following questions for each:


What is this character’s role in the story? Why are they important?
What are your character’s aspirations? What are their fears? Do they have insecurities? Are they worried about something in their life?
What are your character’s motivations? Why do they act the way that they do?
How does your character deal with obstacles in their life?
What are this character’s strengths? What are their weaknesses?
What does this character believe in? Do they believe in good and evil? Are they morally ambiguous? Do they follow a certain religion or philosophy?

, You will write more efficiently and effectively if you have others to write with. See if any of your friends are willing to participate in NaNoWriMo with you. You can gather for weekly writing circles for advice and support. If you do not have friends who want to participate, look on the internet to find a writing forum or to see if there is a local writing group in your area. The NaNoWriMo website also offers support through its forums.


During November, you might want to join a write-in, which is a local event where NaNoWriMo writers gather to write their novels together. If you cannot find a nearby event, you can always join a virtual write-in hosted on the NaNoWriMo website.To find events like Write-Ins, you should choose a region for your account on the NaNoWriMo website. To do this, click on “Find a Region” on the Regions tab. Your region may pop up automatically, or you may choose it from a list. There are regions all around the world that will help connect you with other writers and NaNoWriMo specific events., While most writers these days write on the computer, many participants in NaNoWriMo write their stories by hand or on a typewriter. You can still win if you write your story with pen and paper, but you should stick to one method to keep yourself organized. Decide if you want to type or write your story. Either way, you will not be writing your story on the NaNoWriMo website.If you want to handwrite your story, be aware that there is a word count validator.

Find your character's overarching motivation.,
Fill in any other details that pop into your head.,
Distill your character's personality into one or two sentences.",How to Write a Character Sketch1," There is no right way to begin a character sketch because characters can pop into your head in any number of ways. You might see their physical appearance first, you could think of a profession or character type you want to use, or you could decide to base a character off of someone you know. When designing characters, set aside some time to let your imagination run, finding your initial image of the character and taking off from there.


You aren't bound to any of these initial sketches -- you could very easily throw them all out. Like all brainstorming exercises, the point is to start searching for ideas you love.;
, It is far easier to think in visual, concrete terms than put together abstract concepts like ""friendly,"" or ""intelligent."" Most writers, and all readers, generally need some sort of image of the character that they can relate to. If you're artistically inclined, you could even draw out the basics of your character first. Even if the description is sparse (""young, white male"") in the final book, movie, or play, a proper character sketch requires:


Age
Gender
Height and weight
General ethnic background (ie. ""tall, blonde Scandanavian-type"")
Defining physical characteristics (hair, beauty, glasses, typical clothing, etc.)

, Complex characters display a wide range of emotions, but almost all people and characters can be simplified to 1-2 base feelings. Overall, how does your character view life: optimistic, greedy, humorous, angry, oblivious, thoughtful, timid, creative, analytical? You want a simple guidepost when writing out the character -- a jumping off point that allows you to explore the other, more complex emotions when you start writing.


What would their astrological sign be?
How do they deal with hardship?
What makes them happy? Sad? Angry? , Sometimes the name comes easily. Sometimes it is the hardest part of the character to nail down. While names can change throughout the writing process, there are a couple different avenues you can take when naming characters:


Search the internet for baby names websites. Most of these websites categorize the names by ethnic origin as well, such as Japanese, Arabic, French, Russian, Hawaiian, Hindi, etc.
Choose meaningful names. While this has fallen slightly out of fashion for modern literature and film, there is a rich history of sly or meaningful character names. See The Scarlett Letter, or Arrested Development for variously humorous or insightful names.

, Why is this character important to your book or novel? If you're writing a character sketch about someone it generally means they are vital to your story, since minor characters rarely require a character sketch. What is their relationship to the protagonist? How do they get involved in the story? How do you see them contributing to the novel?


Again, this doesn't have to be set in stone necessarily. Many writers use this space to brainstorm possible plots, conflicts, or uses the character might have., Where did they grow up? What were their parents like? You may never use this information again, but you, as the writer, need to know these things to write a believable voice. Simply thinking about their childhood tells you something about their accent, values, philosophy (or lack thereof), etc. If you're struggling to come up with a backstory, start with a simple question. How did the character get to where they are when the story begins?


Think of friends or acquaintances similar to your character. What is their backstory? Read biographies or real-life character sketches for inspiration.

, What does your character want above all else? What guides them or pushes them to act? This can be their principles, their goals, their fears, or their duty. The best characters have agency. That means they take steps to get what they want instead of simply reacting to the world around them. This doesn't mean you can't have lazy or simple characters -- The Dude from The Big Lebowski just wants to relax, after all. Don't mistake a desire to keep things the same from a lack of desire -- all characters desire something that drive them through the story.


What do they fear?
What do they want?
If you asked your character, ""where do you want to be in five years,"" what would they say?, This is going to change depending on your story. What small bits of the character make them unique? How do they differ from other characters, and how are they similar? This information may not make it into the final project, but it helps you develop a fuller, rounder character. Some places you might start include:


What are their favorite books, movies, and music?
What would the do if they won the lottery?
What was their major in college?
If they could have a super power, what would it be?
Who is their hero?

, Consider this the character's thesis. It will be your overall distillation of the character, and everything that your character does should be a reflection of this sentence. If you're unsure how a character would react to a situation, you can always turn back to this compact description to give you guidance. Look at some examples from literature and TV for guidance.



Ron Swanson (Parks and Rec): An old-fashioned libertarian who works for the government, hoping to bring it down from the inside.

Jay Gatsby (The Great Gatsby): A self-made millionaire who earned his fortune in order to win the love of his childhood sweetheart, over whom he obsesses.

Erin Brockovich (Erin Brockovich): A self-assured single mother willing to fight for what's right, even if it's not in her best interests."
"
Realize that your entire character sketch isn't going to make it into your project.,
Illuminate your character through actions whenever possible.,
Ask yourself why the character behaves like they do.,
Write a ""representative incident"" story about your character.,
Discover the character's voice.,
Use the first time you see a character to introduce their overall impact.,
Keep your character sketches short and sweet if you're putting together a treatment.",How to Write a Character Sketch2," At the end of the day, a character sketch is simply a guideline for your writing. If you know the underlying forces that have shaped and sculpted your character you can confidently write them into every situation without telling the reader everything about them.


This is how we naturally comprehend people in real life too -- you may know bits and pieces of their backstory, but ultimately you know them as the sum of their experiences.
The reader doesn't need to know everything about a character to understand them just like we don't need to know everything about our friends to enjoy their company., Your character sketch is a list -- informative, but hardly exciting. Actions are exciting, and they show off a character without resorting to ""this is Nick, he's a writer who enjoys soccer and hanging with his friends."" Instead, show Nick playing soccer, maybe goofing off on the field or sitting and talking when he should be dribbling. Find an interesting, unique way to illuminate your character's inner life instead of just saying it.Think of some masterful character introductions -- Hannibal in Silence of the Lambs, Jung-do in The Orphan Master's Son, Lolita in Lolita, -- to see how actions can speak louder than words.

, This is the best way to move characters successful from your character sheet to your book or movie. You know what the look like, how they talk, and what they do. But to really make a character effective you need to explore why they are like this. The answer to this question will guide you in every scene that character appears in, and helps your adapt your character sketch as you write new plots and storylines.


Character sketches can change. As you write, you might realize you had something wrong, or that you need to adjust your character. If you know the overarching ""why"" of the character it will be much easier to figure out these changes., This sounds complicated, but in reality you've seen it hundreds of times before. A representative incident is just one short story about that that shows the reader who the character is. Frequently, they occur soon after a character is first introduced, and it is usually a flashback. This allows you to touch on their upbringing, as well as show how the deal under pressure.


Usually this event relates to the larger story. For example, a romantic book might explore the character's first love, or an action story might showcase a recent mission or event.
Try to show a story that hints at how the character will react to the events in the story.
If you're struggling, imagine your story as if this person were the main character. What details would they find important?, Looking over your character sketch, ask yourself how the character communicates by writing practice dialogue. Put them in conversation with your protagonist or another character, and focus on making their lines seem unique. What slang do they use? Do they talk with their hands? Great writers have a way of embodying the character so that their speech patterns make the characters' backgrounds come alive.


If you removed all dialogue tags (""he said,"" ""she replied,"" etc.), would you be able to tell which character is which?

, Readers and viewers will always remember a character's first impression. This impression should fit squarely with the character's behavior in the rest of the story. For example, if a character is normally sweet and kind, don't show her screaming at someone because she is having a bad day. If a hidden temper is part of her personality, this could be perfect; but if this is an isolated incident it will just confuse the reader when she is nice the rest of the story.How would a character introduce themselves at a party or meeting?
If you met this character in real life, what would your first impressions of them be?

, Treatments are short overviews of your book, movie, or TV show used to sell the story. They contain an overview of the plot, the tone, and descriptions of the characters. If you're writing a treatment, cut your character sketch down to the essentials. You don't want to share all the quirky facts with producers or publishers, just enough to intrigue them and give a general overview. Include only the essentials, plus 1-2 short details to make a character unique. You should include:


Name
Motivation.
Relation to the plot / main protagonist.
Details relevant to the plot.

Use writing prompts as a starting place.,
Don’t feel like you need to follow the prompt exactly.,
Write whatever comes to mind.,
Remember that your writing doesn't need to be perfect in your first few drafts.,
Organize and develop your writing.,
Revise your writing.,
Try using prompts in a group.,
Try a new prompt if the one you're using isn’t working for you.,
Use only one part of a prompt.,
Create multiple stories from the same prompt.",How to Use Creative Writing Prompts," A writing prompt can take any number of forms. It can be a specific scenario, such as a scene from everyday life or something a little bit fantastical.


For instance, the prompt could be something of this nature: ""You open your closet door to find your clothes aren't there anymore. Instead, you see horse-drawn carriages and people walking in what appears to be London. What happens next?""
It could be an old postcard, where you write about something related to the picture. It could be an intriguing quote (such as ""Half the lies they tell about me aren't true."" by Yogi Berra) or even a snippet of someone else's writing.;
, Though a writing prompt is a good starting place, you don't have to follow the prompt exactly. Once you begin writing, let your ideas take you where you want to go.


That is the whole point of writing prompts — to get you writing, but still allow you to develop your own ideas.

, Right now, you probably just want to generate ideas. Some of what you write at this stage will be awful, and that's okay — it's supposed to be. However, you should also be able to come up with some really great ideas if you just let your mind wander a little.


Don't think too hard about what you should be writing — just write. Try to turn off the really analytical part of your brain that wants to edit as you go.

, Always remember that what you're writing doesn't need to be perfect, especially in a first draft. The spelling doesn't need to be free of typos, and each sentence doesn't need to fit perfectly with the next one.


If you expect your writing to be perfect before you ever put it on the page, you will never write anything. Instead, you'll be plagued by crippling writer's block.
Writing takes revision, and the first draft isn't the time to be thinking about editing.

, Once you've spent time generating ideas and free writing, consider how you can develop the ideas you generated.


Maybe you just want to use a short passage and develop it into a larger story. Maybe you came up with several ideas that will work for a series of poems. Maybe you have a nearly complete story that just needs some revision.
Circle ideas you like. If you really like a paragraph, but it doesn't fit in to what else is going on in your writing, keep it in a word document for later. You might just be able to use it somewhere else.

, Once you feel like you have a story or poem, take the time to revise, revise, revise. Look for typos and misspelled words. Think about how you put sentences together. Read it aloud; does it sound weird or out-of-place in some parts? You'll probably want to rewrite those parts.


Don't forget to have someone else read over your work — they can give you invaluable feedback and catch mistakes that you missed.
The point of the writing prompt is to get you started, but to be a good writer you also need the drive to keep going and the patience to revise once you have a draft story or poem.

, Writing a story or poem with a group of people can help you go places you wouldn't think of on your own. Someone in the group will have a widely different perspective from you. Bouncing ideas off of each other will only help you to grow as a writer. To use writing prompts in a group:


Start a story together, with everyone throwing out ideas and one person writing. Alternatively, you can brainstorm ideas together, then write on your own; have someone read the writing prompt, and someone to write on a chalkboard. Have everyone else throw out ideas for the person writing.
Once you're finished brainstorming, everyone can break off to write their own ideas based on the prompt and brainstorming.
Another method is to have one person start writing from a prompt and then having each person read and contribute to the next section, all done without speaking.

, Not every prompt will be the perfect one for you. Everybody has different tastes, and while one kind of prompt is not better than another in a general sense, one kind of prompt may work better for you.


If you've given it a good amount of time (at least fifteen minutes), trying using a different one. Sometimes a particular prompt just won't be the right fit.

, For example, a quote like this one from Virginia Woolf can be used as a starting place:


""What is the meaning of life? That was all — a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years, the great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead, there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.""
For a prompt like this one, the starting place could be what the ""little daily miracle"" is. The point is to use it as inspiration to begin writing. When using a writing prompt, start writing as soon as something sparks your curiosity, letting it lead you into the writing process.

, You can actually use the same prompt over and over, if you try attacking the prompt in a different way each time.


To do this, try thinking about each of your senses (touch, sound, smell, etc) in turn, or use a narrative voice you wouldn't normally consider. Maybe you've never been to war, but you want to imagine a war scenario from different perspectives using a writing prompt.
Maybe the prompt is something like ""Your country has just entered World War III. How are you involved?"" You could write about being a soldier, but you could also write about being a spouse at home, the president sending people to war, or a person on the other side. In other words, write from a different perspective each time. You may even be able to develop the pieces into a series, as they will likely share common characteristics.

Done.",How to Write a Book in a Year," This will help you have all the things in your book in one place.;
, Then take another sheet of paper and outline your book. Each chapter should take up about three lines of the paper. Number your lines and outline each chapter. Make sure you leave room after you finish each chapter outline just in case you want to add more later.

, Put all of these papers in the ""outlines"" section of your binder.

, If you have your own daily schedule, put that in this section. Take another sheet of paper and map out all the free time you have (for example: 1:30-2:00 Lunch, 4:45-5:00 Bus ride home,etc.).

, These goals should be small, for example; 4:45-5:00 bus ride home-write 7 lines. Keeping the goals small will help you stay motivated and instead of saying to yourself; ""Oh, I have to write an entire chapter during lunch today."" you could be saying ""I only have to finish a page."" Also, if you are in school and you are to taking a class that you don't really need, or want to take you can write during that class (I am by no means condoning that, however). Put these papers in the ""Schedule"" section of your binder.

, Remember, every author started out where you are right now: a beginner.

, Make the map before you start writing the book. Make two copies of it. Keep one copy in your binder, and the other copy with your book. In the copy that you keep with your book, trace the route that your characters take as you write. This will be a good thing to place before your story in the final published product that is your book.

, If your audience is children then don't use big words. If your audience is for adults, use more descriptive words. Find some members of the audience for which this book is being written and have them read your manuscript before you send it out for review by publishing companies.

, Aim to draw in readers with that first word.

, Remember, you can skip a day as long as you don't skip the next day. If you wait too long in between writing sessions, you will lose the flow of your story.

, If you write religiously and finish about a page a day, you should have a 300 page handwritten book by the end of the year. What you want to do next is type it. You have a good 300 pages to type. This may seem monotonous and boring but it will give you a chance to look over your work. If you see something you don't like you can change it, even a name! If you don't like something, you can change it to something better. Of course 300 pages handwritten is not a big book. It's going to end up being about 200 pages typed. So there are two things you can do:


You can format the book on your computer (for example: make the font size bigger and the lines further apart). But the publisher would probably format it a different way.
You can write a longer book. That's the reason for getting a 500-page notebook. Five hundred pages of handwritten work should equal about 350 pages typed. Even if it ends up being a little less, it's not too bad. Thee hundred pages is a nice sized book (depending on the thickness of the pages and the dimensions of the book). (Of course, you can go for longer than a year and write a bigger book.)

, If you ever get writer's block, stop writing. Don't write for the rest of that day, give your mind a rest. Don't write when you have writer's block because this can cause your story sound dull, cheesy, and drawn out because you don't have any good ideas; you are just writing to fill up the page.

, Nobody's work is perfect. The people who are going to criticize your work are not out to get you. The critics are prospective readers. If there is something in your book that they do not like, strive to fix it if the criticism is constructive. If you get no criticism, don't feel left out or cheated. It means you did a great job!


Be careful of asking people who never speak honestly for fear of upsetting you to review the work. They won't tell you what you need to know.

, Most publishers don't like new authors. They would prefer guaranteed bestsellers, than a newbie. Find the publisher of your favorite book (in the same genre) and ask them first.

, Send the first two or three chapters. If they ask for more you know you did a good job capturing them at the beginning. It might also help to hire a literary agent.

, Sit back and read the reviews. Then get started on your next novel

The title shouldn’t be longer than 12 words. This section should be double-spaced like the rest of the paper.;
, The abstract should be on a new page with the centered word “Abstract,” and it should have the page header.


An abstract is a summary of your paper, including the key ideas and conclusions. It should be about 200 words, give or take 50 words.
You can list keywords after the abstract if you wish in a new paragraph that begins with “Keywords:”

, In the main body, the headings should be formatted in 5 levels.


Level 1 headings should be for the main title. They should be centered, bolded, and in title-case capitalization, meaning you capitalize the first and last word and other important words, like this:
Coffee Mugs and Other Knickknacks

, They should be bolded, in title-case capitalization, but aligned to the left:


Coffee Mug Collections

, For level 3 headings, use bold type, aligned to the left with an indention, and sentence-case capitalization.


Sentence-case capitalization is where you only capitalize the first word. Use a period at the end, and begin the text immediately afterwards:

Coffee mugs with sayings. Many coffee mugs include sayings on the side…

, With level 4 headings, use bolded type, an indention that's aligned to the left, and a period at the end.


You also begin the text immediately, use sentence-case capitalization and italicize the text:

Types of Coffee Mug Sayings. Coffee mug sayings fall into several categories…

, For level 5 headings, use an indention that's aligned to the left, and use sentence-case capitalization and italicized text. Put a period at the end and include the text afterwards:



Funny Coffee Mug Sayings. Some of the best sayings are hilarious ones…

, The last part of your paper is the reference page. On the reference page, use hanging indention, which is where the first line is all the way to the left on each reference, but the subsequent lines are indented. Alphabetize the page by the author’s last name.

Understand how to cite journal articles.",How to Use APA Formatting for Academic Papers2," To create a basic book citation, follow this format: “Bard, S. (1999). Coffee and caffeine. Salt Lake City, UT: Buzzed Books.”


In this citation, “Bard” is the author’s last name, and “S” is the first initial. “1999” is the date of publication. “Coffee and caffeine” is the title, using sentence-case capitalization, meaning only the first word is capitalized.
Finally, “Salt Lake City, UT” is the place of publication, and “Buzzed Books” is the publisher.

, To use this for an in-text citation, add a parenthesis at the end of the sentence you want to cite with the author’s late name, the publication date, and the page number you found the information on:


“A standard cup of coffee has an average of 100 milligrams of caffeine (Bard, 1999, p. 24).”

, For an essay in a book, follow this format: “Grace, G. (2002). Green tea. In Grey, H. (Ed.), Caffeine in beverages (55-89). Salt Lake City, UT: Buzzed Books.”


In this instance, “Grace, G.” is the author of the essay, while “Grey, H.” is the editor of the anthology. “Green tea” is the title of the essay (no italics), and “Caffeine in beverages” is the title of the book. “55-89” is the page numbers of the essay in the book.
Make an in-text citation with the author of the essay. For example “Green tea has less caffeine than coffee (Grace, 2002, p. 57).

, For a journal article, follow this format: “Smith, G. (2005). Green tea’s benefits. All about Tea, 23(4), 44-76. Retrieved from http://www.greenteadatabase.com.”


In this case, “All about Tea” is the name of the journal, and 23(4) is the volume and issue number, while “44-76” is the page range.
To make an in-text citation, use the same format: “Green tea is a calming beverage (Smith, 2005, p. 47).”

You may not use all of the ideas you jot down, but the more ideas you generate, the more material you'll have to draw on later.

You needn't worry about fleshing out the ideas you jot down while brainstorming. A simple word or phrase to remind you of what the idea is later on is enough.;
, Reading the work of other adventure authors is a great way to stimulate your imagination. Think about the kinds of settings, characters, and situations which you find compelling, and would like to include in your own story.

You needn't limit yourself to books and short stories for inspiration: movies, comic books, video games, music and other types of storytelling media can also be great sources for inspiration.

, Exposing yourself to new information can be a great source of inspiration. Take a look at your list of ideas, and choose a few related topics to delve into. Aspiring authors of fantasy adventures might consider researching ancient and medieval mythology, religion, culture and warfare.
If you're thinking of writing a futuristic sci-fi adventure, do some reading on modern scientific discoveries, or look at the work of futurists (thinkers who speculate about the future of technology, science and culture) for inspiration.

, Discussing your story with a friend can provide a unique, new perspective on your ideas. Explaining these ideas will also force you to put them into words, which will help you clarify and expand them.

, Adventure stories are often set in unusual, dangerous, or exciting locations. Some are set in a real historical period, such as the European Middle Ages, or the 19th Century American West. Others are set in entirely fictional settings, like many science fiction and fantasy stories. Based on your brainstorming and research, you should already have a good idea where and when the story will be set.

, Many basic elements define the setting in which your story takes place. Ask yourself: What is it like to live in this setting at the time the story is taking place? Is the setting realistic and historical, or are there supernatural or magical elements to the world? What forms of government are in charge in the setting? What is the culture like? What is the climate and geography like? You should think about whether your story will take place in a single location, or in several. Many adventure stories begin in a peaceful or idyllic location, and then follow the story's hero as they travel elsewhere in search of a solution to the story's central conflict. , Most adventure stories have a main character, called the hero, who must try to solve the story's central problem. Often the hero has no choice but to go off on his adventure, but is driven by the importance of the problem they need to solve. , Ask yourself: What is the hero's personality like? Does the hero have a family, or close friends in his community? What is the hero's job? Does the hero have any special skills, abilities or knowledge that will help them in their adventure? What are the hero's flaws and weaknesses? Are they brave, or cowardly? Compassionate, or unfeeling? Wise, or naive? The more detail you put into your hero, the more compelling they will be in the story.

, An adventure story revolves around a problem that needs to be solved. This central conflict is what drives the hero of the story to go off on their adventure. Usually the central problem of an adventure story will require the hero to leave their home behind, and overcome challenging or dangerous obstacles. The problem you imagine should be something the hero of your story cares about, and might be able to solve; otherwise they would have no reason to set out on a dangerous adventure to solve it! .Many adventure stories focus on a powerful or important object, such as a magical artifact, or valuable piece of technology that the hero of the story must acquire. Perhaps the hero needs to recover the object to help their community. Perhaps they want to acquire the object because it has been stolen from them, or because acquiring it will make them rich or powerful.
Other stories focus on an undesirable force or entity which threatens the hero, their family or community, or even the entire world or universe! Perhaps a plague or an evil overlord is threatening to overrun the hero's home. Perhaps a rival of the hero has kidnapped the hero's loved one. Perhaps the hero has been cursed and needs to go on an adventure to lift the curse.

, Now that you have a rough map of the most important aspects of your adventure story, you should decide how the story will begin. In many adventure stories, the story begins with the hero being pulled, often unwillingly, from their ordinary life, and being forced to take on a dangerous adventure.Ask yourself: How does the hero learn about the central problem of the story? How will the hero prepare for their adventure? What is their plan for solving the story's central problem? What will they bring with them? Will they go alone, or will they bring friends or companions to help them?
Heroes in adventure stories are often reluctant or poorly prepared for their adventure. You should decide how the decision to pursue their adventure affects them. Are they frightened? Determined? Excited? Does their family or community approve? Must they quit their job to go on the adventure?

, Few things go as planned for the heroes in most adventure stories, and unexpected complications or problems are often what make an adventure story so exciting!You should decide what sort of challenges your hero will face on their adventure, how they overcome (or fail to overcome) these challenges, and who they will meet along the way.


In many adventure stories, an adversary or rival is working against the hero. Think about who these adversaries are, what their motivation for antagonizing the hero is, and how the hero will deal with their attempts to foil their plans.
If you want your hero to meet allies in their adventure, think about why these allies are motivated to help the hero on their dangerous mission, and what skills or knowledge they have which will help the hero. Are they really out to help the hero, or will they betray the hero's trust?

, After the hero navigates through the complications and challenges standing between them and their goal, they will either solve, or fail to solve, the problem which led them on their adventure. This should be the climax of the story, and a moment of great challenge for the hero. You should decide how, and whether, the hero is able to accomplish their goal, and what this outcome means for the hero and the other characters in the story.


Think about what the outcome of the story means for the future of the hero, and their world. How do the hero and their companions feel now that the adventure is over? Has the problem been solved for good? If not, will the hero of your story need to go on further adventures to solve it?

Keep a running list of story ideas.,
Write for websites you frequent and enjoy reading.,
Pitch articles to your local paper.,
Start a professional blog.,
Add each article to your portfolio of clips.",How to Start Writing Articles1," Part of being an effective journalist or writer is being curious about other people's stories and finding a way to create a story from every day occurrences. Start a list of possible story ideas to pitch to a local publication or an online publication you are familiar with. Generate story ideas by using certain tactics, such as:Using a writing prompt, such as ""That One Time I..."" or a ""Day in the Life"" of someone you find interesting. You may also consider using every day events at school as jumping off points for possible ideas for an article.
Brainstorming different angles on a current topic or subject. For example, police brutality against African American men. Write the current topic or subject in the center of a piece of a paper. Then, write down other related words or terms around the central idea. Continue adding words or terms until you feel you have written down enough. Read over the terms and circle or highlight any terms that seem useful or that could lead to a possible angle or slant on the topic.;
, Maybe you always look at a certain publication every morning or tend to go to the same websites for pop culture or national news. Consider if your writing might work in the online publications you frequent or if these sites could serve as places you may want to see your work in one day.Check the sites for open submissions, or calls for submissions. Some websites, especially online magazines, have themed issues with open calls for work around a certain theme or idea.
One of the big pet peeves for editors is receiving submissions from writers who have never read the publication before and are submitting blind. Avoid this by taking the time to read several articles on the site, and get a feel for the voice and tone of the articles.

, For print publications, the best place to start is local publications in your area, town, or city. Most areas have free weekly publications that showcase the local happenings. Look through several issues to get a sense of the type of work is being published.Check out each section of the publication, such as Arts & Lifestyle, Music, or Local News, to see what type of writing you might want to pitch to the publication. If you’re interested in music reviews, look at the byline (which states who the article is written by) to find the music editor of the publication.
Contact the editor with a brief email expressing your interests in writing music reviews for the publication. Avoid contacting the editor-in-chief of the publication directly. Always go for the editor of the section you would like to write for.

, One of the best ways to get into a daily writing habit and brush up on your article writing skills is to start a professional blog. Choose a topic you are interested in writing about or feel you have a certain level of expertise in. Focus on posting quality 500 word posts on the topic once a day or several times a week.Use your blog as a way to share your opinions on a topic or to delve into deeper research and investigation on the topic. You may then be able to use posts from your blog to pitch story ideas to publications.

, Most publications will ask you for two to three clips, which are choice articles you have completed recently and published, when you solicit them for an article. Your clips should be within the last two years and showcase your writing voice.Many writers have online portfolios. They will then link to their portfolio in their pitch letter or in their initial email to an editor. There are many tools you can use to create an online portfolio with basic computer skills. Platforms like WordPress and Pressfolio are popular and easy to use. You can create a basic site to collect your clips so you look professional to editors and other writers."
"
Reach out to other writers and journalists.,
Get involved in your local writing scene.,
Solicit feedback from editors.",How to Start Writing Articles2," If you read an article you enjoyed and admire in terms of style or voice, look at the byline to see who wrote the article. The journalist will likely have an email address or other contact information. Send the reporter a brief and professional email outlining your desire to write articles for a publication and ask for any suggestions on your work.If you are looking to get published in the paper the reporter works for, you may ask if they would be willing to pass on a pitch from you to the editor or if they can connect you to a contact that will help you get published.
Avoid sending a casual or informal email to a writer or journalist. Always be professional in tone and don't take up too much of the reporter's time by writing a long-winded email or letter.

, Most areas have a writing scene or arts scene that involve writers and reporters. Look for open mic nights in your city, join forums or groups online that organize readings or writer get togethers, and seek out other reporters at local writing events. Introduce yourself to people at these events to get a sense of the writing scene and make yourself known.

, It can be difficult to deal with feedback from readers and editors, especially if you are just starting your writing career. But feedback will help you become a better writer and give you a thick skin when it comes to criticism. A good editor will provide constructive feedback on your article, with notes on any issues or problems they might see in your work, and how to correct them.Don't afraid to ask for feedback if you get a rejection on a pitch letter or a first draft of an article, and use the editor's notes to improve your writing. This will serve you well as you move forward in your career, as each article you write will become better and better with each small adjustment or improvement to your writing style.

Research possible programs and schools.,
Talk to the admissions office.,
Apply early for programs.",How to Start Writing Articles3," Journalism programs, especially at the graduate level, are very distinct and different from each other. Some programs are more foundational, with a focus on giving you journalism schooling from the ground up. Other programs offer a specific concentration, like data journalism or business reporting.Look at the curriculum of each class and program, as well the course descriptions and the length of the program. Some programs will state they are catering to beginning journalists, mid-career professional, or full time working journalists.
Focus on programs that offer opportunities for professional growth and resume buildings. For example, internships, speaker series, and apprenticeships can all help to build your portfolio and connections in the industry.
You should also consider the physical location of the program. You should be comfortable in the area you will be studying, living, and working in. Think about if you can afford the cost of living in a certain city or town while going to school.

, Before you apply for schools, get familiar with the admission requirements. Call or email the admissions office of the program(s) you are interested in and make sure you fulfill all the educational requirements.


The admissions office can also give you more details on what is required for your application, such as a portfolio, letters of reference, and the necessary transcripts.

, Start your applications early so you can get a second opinion on them before you submit them. Ask a professor, mentor, or peer to read over your application and offer their critiques."

Ask yourself questions.

, For each character, or at least each major character, make a mind web, showing characteristics about each character. Do not do this for minor characters, or you'll end up spending more time planning than writing.

Establish a workspace.,
Shut out the world.,
Take a break from your phone.,
Eliminate the Internet.,
Remain seated and writing.,
Resume writing immediately after a distraction.",How to Stay Focused on Writing1," With either a laptop or a pen and notebook, it seems like you should be able to just plop down anywhere and write. However, to write consistently and effectively, you will probably want to set up a defined writing space that is specifically suited to your task. Find a place that minimizes distractions and tells you that it’s “writing time” when you see it.


Many people benefit from sitting and writing at a desk that is comfortable but not cozy; that is, a place that won’t cause you discomfort but also won’t easily let you drift into a nap. Set up a desk that has what you need where you need it, so you don’t have to get up while writing.Some people, however, do their best writing at the coffee shop or at a shaded picnic table in the park. This works best for people who can readily block out ambient noise and visual distractions. There is no single ideal writing spot for all of us; there is an ideal writing spot for you. You just need to find it.;
, Especially if you are easily distracted while working, simply putting a closed door between your workspace and the outside world can make a major difference. Not only does it block visual distractions and muffle distracting noises, it physically and psychologically isolates you within your writing space.If closing a door isn’t possible or practical, using noise-canceling headphones to block out ambient noise may be a good option for you.

, Thanks to modern smartphones, a world of limitless distractions accompanies us wherever we go. The focus required for effective writing is not helped by the constant pings and rings, and the unending lure of making a quick check of emails, updates, and so on. While it may pain you to do so, try to not only silence your phone, but to turn it off completely while you are writing.You may even need to remove the phone from your sight while you work. Put it in a drawer that is nearby but that you’d have to get up from writing to reach. Don’t worry, it will still be there when you are finished.If you have to keep your phone on, at least shut down as many apps and silence as many notifications as you can. And keep the phone out of easy reach so you aren’t as tempted to make a quick check every couple minutes.

, Along with disconnecting or hiding your phone, you should also consider shutting off internet access on your computer (especially if you’re using it to write). Yes, this will make it more difficult to look up a word definition or quickly research a topic, but it will also eliminate a world wide web of possible distractions.If you have something to check or look up while writing, jot down a note for later. Keep your focus strictly on writing and worry about corrections and fine details at another time., Plan ahead so that when it’s time to sit down and write, you can do exactly (and only) that. If you keep having to get up to grab this or do that, you’ll lose your concentration and writing momentum. If you can get yourself into the writing “zone,” you want to stay there as long as you can.That said, you’re not a machine and you can’t work non-stop. Eat a quick snack if you’re hungry, use the restroom as needed, and get up and stretch every hour or if you feel like you’re getting stiff. It’s hard to concentrate if you're uncomfortable.
Try to plan out and coordinate these breaks so they don’t cause too many distractions.

, Despite your best efforts to reduce them, you will face distractions such as a knock on the door or a crying toddler. When you have to stop to deal with a distraction, it’s easy to say to yourself “Oh, that’s enough writing for today.” Fight this urge, and get back to writing as soon as possible after dealing with the distraction.Even if it’s 8:30, and you can only write until 9:00 before you have to get ready for work, sit back down and write. Stick to your schedule as best you can.

Don’t be too disappointed if you don’t win.",How to Win a Short Story Competition," When trying to find a contest, pick one that is suitable for your writing style.


Most contests are connected to magazines, so it's a good idea to read past issues to figure out which one will fit your writing style best.
Alternatively, read the stories of past winners, as this will also give you an idea of what the judges want.;
, Most contests have regular judges that judge the contest every year. Many are writers themselves. Research what they write and if possible, the writers they admire. Similarly, check out the guest judges. Find out what they like and how they write.

, Don’t worry if the story you plan to submit isn’t exactly the same as previous winners’ stories. The judges will want something that is somewhat similar in style or mood, but you should also be innovative. They don’t want the same story over and over each year.

, All contests will have submission guidelines. These will give you ideas about what styles the contest accepts, as well as the word count you should be under and formatting guidelines.

, Whatever you are writing, you will need to do research on your topic. To do this, read, read, and read some more.


Read writers you admire and ones you don’t enjoy as much. Choose writers across many genres.
Read collections of short stories and novels. Read information articles and literary magazines. All of it will make you a better writer.

, Take the time to sketch out what your narrative will be. It doesn’t need to be completely filled in; it just needs to give you an idea of where your story is going. What’s going to happen in the story? Why should your reader care about it?

, Spend some time free writing about what makes your characters unique. You should aim to make your characters as diverse as possible - you can do this by asking yourself a number of questions, like:


What does this character look like? What do they like to do in their free time? What are their secret wishes? What motivates them? What is their impact on the story going to be?
You won’t use every detail you write out, but the details will help you create a more well-rounded character in your story. If the character becomes real to you, he or she will also become real to the reader.

, Is the story going to be told in third person or first? Does the reader know more than the character? You’ll need to make decisions about point of view before you begin, though you can always go back later and change it if you need to do so.

, You have to catch your audience's attention in the first paragraph, sometimes in the first sentence. Never underestimate the importance of a great hook.


Remember, in a large contest, judges are reading hundreds and thousands of entries; even small contests can have over a hundred entries.
Therefore, if you don’t catch the judge's attention in the first paragraph, it’s possible he or she will throw it out at that point. The judges want to be able to get through all the entries in the shortest amount of time, so they will not spend very long on each individual story.

, If the story wants to go somewhere you didn’t really plan, let it go that way. Sometimes happenstance makes for the best stories.

, This piece of advice is almost cliché now, but it is still important. In other words, don’t just tell the reader someone is having an emotion, such as “Kate was sad.” Give the reader details to show Kate is sad, for example:


“Kate reached up to rub the back of her neck. She ducked her head for a moment, and then wiped away a tear before it could roll down her face.”
This type of detail makes the story richer, and it gives the reader a part to play in interpreting.

, Use just enough words to get the point across. Most judges would rather read a shorter story that is done well than a longer story that is rambling.

, Don’t just use dialogue as filler. Instead, make sure it moves the story along.

, A story needs conflict of some type to be interesting. Whether it’s inner conflict or something going on in a character’s life, the conflict is the heart of the story.

, In a story, you build tension over the course of the narrative, which reaches its final height just before the end of the story. In other words, your story must come to a head at some point.

, Look for typos and grammatical errors. Read the story out loud to yourself, listening for awkward sentences and sections. Revise as needed.


Cut any superfluous content. If a certain line (or even paragraph) doesn’t move the story along in some way, it doesn’t need to be there. Be ruthless in your editing.
Check to make sure your story still fits into the guidelines. Format it to the contest’s specifications.

, A great way to do that is to join a group of writers and editors for workshopping. Workshopping is just where everyone brings a piece of writing, and each person reads everyone else’s, offering critiques and suggestions.


Look for a workshopping group in your area; you can try asking at your local library. You can also find groups online.
Be sure that if you are posting your story online that it is in a private group, otherwise you may run into copyright issues if you want to publish it elsewhere.

, Duotrope will help you find journals that run contests. Though they charge a small fee per month, they have a large database of journals.


Submittable is used by a large number of journals. If there is an option to submit using this website, do it.
This makes it much easier to keep up with where you submitted your short story. Plus, it tells you when your story is in-progress and when it’s been rejected or accepted.

, Entering your work somewhere is a big step. You can always try other contests or literary magazines. Also, don’t be afraid to look at the story again and see if it needs to be revised, especially if the judges offer any specific critique.

Set your ideal schedule.,
Choose a time or task focus.,
Find a “writing buddy.” Sometimes, your writing focus can improve when you add a bit of competitive fire and/or some peer pressure to the mix.,
Hold yourself accountable.,
Share and celebrate your accomplishments.",How to Stay Focused on Writing2," Plan your writing time for your most productive part of the day. If you’re a morning person, set aside an hour or two before work or class. If you’re a night owl, schedule your writing time for after everyone else in the house has gone to bed. If you plan your writing time for when you’re distracted or tired, you’ll struggle even more to focus and get any good work done.Also, if you’re juggling multiple writing projects — if you’re a freelancer, for instance, or if you have multiple research papers due — schedule a time for each project separately. If you have two hours in the morning, schedule Project A for 7-8 am, and Project B from 8-9 am. Give each project a dedicated time of focus.

, For most people, setting a time-based schedule for writing is the best way to ensure ongoing productivity. If you’re writing from 2-5 pm each day, for instance, you will become conditioned to perceiving this as “writing time” and your productivity and focus will likely increase.However, some people simply cannot write as effectively when they feel like they’re being controlled by a ticking clock. If you’re writing a novel and “write one good page per day” works better for you than “write from 1-3 pm each day,” that’s okay. Just make sure you hold yourself to that schedule just as rigidly. It will probably also help to write at roughly the same time each day., If you know someone else writing a dissertation or three-act play, buddy up with them and coordinate your writing schedules. Give each other regular updates and hold one another accountable for sticking to the schedule. You can even use small punishments/penalties and rewards if that helps.Your writing partner doesn’t have to be physically present; you could start your shared “writing time” with a text (then turn your phone off!) and end it with another. And, if it’s not possible to write at the same time, you can still keep track of each other’s daily writing results — and hold each other accountable if you come up short.

, It’s a bit easier to be held accountable if you owe your “writing buddy” five dollars each time you don’t get in your two hours or finish that daily page. However, you can set up a series of rewards and punishments for yourself to help keep your writing on track.For example, you can set aside Friday nights for going to a movie or hanging out with friends. However, take away one hour of your “fun time” for each hour of scheduled writing you skipped out on during the week.
Or, if there’s a certain pair of shoes or video game that you really want, put a dollar in your “wish list piggy bank” each time you complete a scheduled writing session. In time, you’ll have earned your reward.

, Writing is tough. It can be fun at times, but it’s also just plain hard work. When you achieve a significant writing goal, like finishing a chapter or completing a new set of poems, don’t be shy about celebrating it. You have accomplished something that many others couldn’t do — or wouldn’t have the persistence to do.Especially if you’re writing something lengthy like a novel or dissertation, define clear milestones along the way. Use them to record your larger progress and to serve as markers worthy of celebrating when achieved. Keep others informed of your progress and achievements, and have a little party or a night out to reward yourself.
Sharing milestones (and when you ought to achieve them) with others also helps keep you on schedule and accountable.

Prepare before you write.,
Try music for focus and inspiration.,
Support your body and brain.,
Make time to think, feel, and experience.",How to Stay Focused on Writing3," If you're writing a book of any sort, whether nonfiction or a novel, you're probably going to want an outline or some sort of idea of the story line. If you're writing a report, gather your information before you write. Spending some time in preparation before you begin will save you time in the long run, and allow you to focus strictly on writing.


That said, and especially if you are writing creatively, you want to make sure you can write freely and without particular concern for form, structure, grammar, spelling, etc. Do research beforehand to provide you with the content and context you need, and edit afterward to clean up and clarify what you’ve written. Allow your “writing time” to focus exclusively on precisely that., If you work better with music, pick something that goes with the mood of what you're writing. Not only will this help you stay on task, it may also improve the quality of your writing.


Use headphones (with noise-canceling if possible) to block out distractions and allow the music to support your focus. If you find the music to be a distraction, try changing genres or go without it. Use white noise sounds with the noise-canceling headphones instead.Typically, classical or instrumental music is considered to be the best accompaniment for a writing session; however, we all respond differently to music. So, if you happen to write most effectively with heavy metal blaring, go for it!

, Eating healthy, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep won’t automatically turn you into a prolific writer, but will certainly help with your concentration and stamina. Properly fuel and rest your brain so that it can be inspired and translate this inspiration to the page.


Create and follow a clear schedule, but make sure that it is a reasonable one. Don’t try to write for more than 3-4 hours at a time, or the returns will likely diminish rapidly. Schedule little breaks every hour or so to get up, get a drink, clear you head, stretch your back, etc. Then get right back to writing. Don’t let a mini break turn into an extended one., Inspiration is a very personal thing. You can’t manufacture it or force it, but you can nurture it. Before starting a writing session, try to do something that sparks your creative juices, or that puts you in a reflective or introspective mood. Go to the park. Walk in the woods. Sit at the cafe and watch the world go by. Meditate. Paint a picture. Find your inspiration.


Doing a relaxing, inspirational activity before writing may also help to reduce the negative thoughts and feelings that can pop into your head when you’re struggling to write — things like “I can’t do this,” “This poem is terrible,” “I’m no writer,” and so on. Try to eliminate them before you begin writing, and power through them if they emerge while writing. You can and will overcome them by continuing to write.If you really can't concentrate, no matter what you do to focus, relax, and encourage yourself, take the day off. Even if you have to adjust your schedule to make up for it, you’re probably better off taking a break and getting yourself into a better frame of mind for writing.

Take notes on the original text.,
Outline the main idea of the original text.,
Include several supporting examples from the text.,
Include the author, title and publication date.,
Use a reporting verb.,
Describe the main idea in the original text.,
Answer who, what, where, and why.,
Have one to three sentences of supporting evidence.,
Use your own words to summarize the original text.,
Keep the summary short and to the point.",How to Start a Summary Paragraph," Start by reading and reviewing the original text. Mark up the original text, noting any keywords and important phrases or points. Highlight or underline any sentences that feel important to you. Note the topic sentence in the original text as well as the main idea or theme in the text. The topic sentence will contain the main topic or idea in the text.If you are working with a long original text, create a brief outline for each paragraph in the margin of the text. Include any keywords, phrases, or points in the summary. You can then use these notes in your summary paragraph.;
, Create a one to two sentence outline of the main idea or ideas of the original text. Keep the outline short and to the point. Ask yourself, “What is the author trying to say in this text? What is the main idea or theme in the text?”For example, if you were using The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald as the original text, you may list several themes or ideas such as “friendship,” “social status,” “wealth,” and “unrequited love.”

, Once you have the main idea down, identify one to three examples from the original text that support the main idea. These could be quotes from the text or scenes in the text. You could also choose a pivotal moment or passage in the text as a supporting example.List these supporting examples and briefly summarize them by noting what happens in each example. You can then refer to these examples in your summary paragraph.

, The first line of the summary paragraph should state the author, the title, and the publication date of the original text. You should also note what type of text it is, such as a novel, a short story, or an article. This will present the reader with the most basic information about the original text right away.For example, you may begin with, “In the novel The Great Gatsby (1925), F. Scott Fitzgerald…”.
If you are writing a summary of an article, you may begin with, “According to her article, “What is intersexuality?” Nancy Kerr (2001)...”

, The first line of the summary paragraph should include a strong reporting verb, such as “argue,” “claim,” “contend,” “maintain,” or “insist.” You can also use verbs like “explain,” “discuss,” “illustrate,” “present,” and “state.” This will make the introduction of the summary paragraph clear and concise.For example, you may write, “In the novel The Great Gatsby (1925), F. Scott Fitzgerald presents...”
For an article, you may write, “According to her article, “What is intersexuality?” Nancy Kerr (2001) claims...”

, Finish the opening line by including the main theme or idea in the text. You can then include supporting points in the rest of the summary that relate back to this main theme or idea.For example, you may write, “In the novel The Great Gatsby (1925), F. Scott Fitzgerald presents the tragic figure of mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby through the eyes of his neighbor, Nick Carraway.”
For an article, you may write, “According to her article, “What is intersexuality?” Nancy Kerr (2001) claims that discussions of sexuality in academic circles ignores the growing public interest in intersexuality.”

, Consider who is being addressed or discussed in the original text. Think about what is being addressed or discussed. Mention where the text is set, if relevant. Finally, determine why the author is discussing or addressing the subject matter in the original text.For example, if you are writing about The Great Gatsby, you should address the two main characters in the novel (Jay Gatsby and his neighbor/the narrator Nick Carraway). You should also focus on what occurs, briefly, in the novel, where the novel takes place, and why Fitzgerald explores the lives of these two characters.

, Aim to have one to three supporting points at the most, as you do not want to make the summary paragraph too long. Use events from the text as well as quotes or points in the text to support your opening line.For example, if you are discussing an article, you may use the author’s key arguments in the article as supporting points. If you are discussing a novel or short story, you may use the key events in the story as supporting points.

, Do not copy or paraphrase the original text. Use your own words in the summary. Avoid using the same language or word choice as the original text, unless you are quoting it directly.Keep in mind a summary paragraph should simply state the essential information in the original text. You do not need to present an opinion or argument about the text in the summary paragraph. This can be done in a separate paragraph or section in your paper.

, A summary paragraph should be no longer than six to eight sentences. Once you finish a draft of the summary paragraph, read it over and revise it so it is short and to the point. Remove any sentences or phrases that seem redundant or repetitive.You may also show the summary paragraph to a writing instructor or a friend to get feedback on it. Ask the person to make sure the summary paragraph includes the essential information about the text in a concise, clear way.

Understand the purpose of a writing sample.,
Read the writing sample instructions carefully.,
Choose the stronger writing sample.,
Don’t include informal writing samples.,
Go for short, polished samples.,
Check for grammatical and spelling errors.,
Follow any formatting guidelines specified in the application.,
Remove any confidential information in the sample.,
Create a table of contents.",How to Provide a Writing Sample," Your employer or university application reviewer is looking for a writing sample that shows how you organize and express your ideas. Your writing sample should demonstrate to your audience that you can create polished, written material that fits the expectations of the position you are applying for.Think of the writing sample as test, or another key element of your application. The employer or university application reviewer will be looking at your writing sample as a way to gauge how you well you might suit the position or the program.;
, The employer may note they are looking for a one page writing sample that shows your ability to communicate a marketing idea effectively. Don’t submit a three page writing sample about the energy crisis, as this will waste the employer’s time and show the employer you don’t know how to follow instructions. The same logic applies to a university application writing sample: only submit samples that respond to the instructions provided by the university. Often, the reviewer will note how well you followed the writing sample instructions and if you provided a sample that matches the criteria specified by the employer or the university.Some employers may not specify what they are looking for in a writing sample. If this is the case, consider the position or program you are applying for and how you can demonstrate your skills through a particular piece of writing.

, When deciding which writing sample to use, it would be ideal if the sample is relevant to the position or program you are applying for and is also your strongest piece of writing. However, this is not always the case. If you are wavering between two samples, one of which is stronger in terms of writing but weaker in terms of relevance, submit the paper that has stronger writing. Your writing sample show demonstrate your writing at its best, and relevancy will come second to a well written sample.If you have time, you can also revise the more relevant paper so it is better written and submit it instead. This would show the reviewer you took the time to find an applicable writing sample that also shows off your strong writing skills.
You could also create a writing sample for a particular job application or university application. This might be necessary if you have limited work experience and are applying for an entry-level job. For example, if you are applying for a job in sales, you might create a mock proposal for a sale of the company’s product to a client, or create a profile for a client. Or if you applying for a research position, you may submit a school assignment that demonstrates your excellent research and writing skills. School assignments are good writing samples for first time applications, especially if you worked hard on them and if they seem relevant to the position or program you are applying for., Though your writing sample should demonstrate your writing style and voice, don’t use samples that use informal language and a casual tone. Your writing sample should appear professional and polished. Avoid submitting blog posts or Facebook posts are writing samples, unless the blog is a professional blog and addresses issues that relate to your application.Always submit recent or current writing over old writing. If you’ve been out of school for several years, your old science term paper may not be the best demonstration of your writing. It will tell the employer or reviewer that you haven’t written in a long period of time and may not showcase your strongest writing.

, The employer or reviewer will likely note how many pages or excerpts they want in the application. If there is no specified number, avoid submitting a ten page essay or a fifty page report, as most reviewers have limited time and will likely not be willing to read more than a few pages of your writing sample. The standard page count is around two to five pages for university writing samples. Some employers may only ask for a one to two page writing sample.If you have a long paper that you would like to submit, choose excerpts from the paper that showcase your best writing. One option is the choose a section from the introduction, the body paragraphs, and the conclusion, totalling no more than five pages, so your reader has a sense of the paper as whole., Give your writing sample a close read for any errors, as you want your sample to appear well written and as perfect as possible. This is relevant even if you are applying for a job that does not necessarily require in depth writing every day, as you will likely be emailing clients and your employer will not want error riddled emails being sent out under the company letterhead.One trick is to read your writing sample backwards to look for any misspelled words or grammatical mistakes. You can also ask a peer, friend, or colleague to read over your writing sample for any obvious spelling and grammar errors you may have missed.

, Many applications will include a formatting guide or a short paragraph describing how they would like to receive the sample. This could be: double spaced, with page numbers on the bottom right corner and your name clearly stated on the front of the sample.


If the formatting is not specified, it’s always best to make the sample double spaced so it is easy to read and to include page numbers and your name.
If you are submitting an excerpt, you should include a note that informs the reader is is an excerpt from X page to X page, and provide the topic of the paper on the top of the sample.

, If you are using a writing sample from a document you created for a previous position, be sure to mask any real names, descriptions, or numbers so you don’t reveal private information. Avoid exposing your previous employer by taking the time to hide or remove any confidential information in your writing sample, as they are likely not essential to the sample.Another option is to create a fake company name and adjust the location and type of business noted in the sample so you don’t reveal any private details.

, This is especially important if you are submitting a writing sample for a university application, as it shows you took the time to organize and format your application. Include your writing sample in the Table of Contents so it is easy for the reviewer to access.

Cite your sources.",How to Type a Research Paper," Sometimes when you are assigned a research paper you are given a specific topic to write about. However, if you are given a broader topic area, it’s your job to narrow down your own specific topic. Choose a topic that you are interested in and will enjoy researching. It’s much harder to type up a research paper if you can’t find a topic you’ll enjoy learning more about.
If you are given a more specific topic, you can and should still brainstorm a specific angle for that topic to research.
For example, if you are given the assignment of writing a research paper on World War II, you can find an aspect of WWII that appeals to you. Perhaps you’re interested in researching Pearl Harbor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, or the contributions of a specific branch of the military.;
, Once you have your angle for the paper, do some research. Go online and research your topic. Go to your school’s library, or the public library and check out books on your chosen subject.


Encyclopedias both in print and online are also good sources.
When finding information, make sure to stay on your topic as best as you can. If you’re typing up a research paper on WWII, you’ll find a lot of information, and not all of it will be relevant or helpful to you. Be selective about the information you gather. If you’re gathering information online, make sure that you are getting this information from a reliable source. Government sites with a .gov and sites with a .org are usually reliable. However, even the information on these sites should be cross-checked with other information.
Write down your sources so that you can easily go back and find information.
Look for information that is found in multiple sources. If you are doing a research paper on Dwight D. Eisenhower’s contributions to WWII, look for information that you see in multiple sources like books, and different websites.
Do not rely on Wikipedia to be a reputable source. Many teachers will not allow you to cite Wikipedia as a source. Since Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, there is a chance that information is incorrect. However, you can use Wikipedia to gather basic information in the early stages. Check to see if this information is reliable by going to the source site that the info you found on a Wikipedia page came from. You can then use that source to check your information.

, Interview someone who is related to the topic. Avoid interviews with family members, unless your family member is an expert on your topic.


If you’re researching WWII, it may be unlikely that you have a family member who fought in WWII, but you may have a grandparent who was alive during the war. You can still ask this person for anecdotal information. It may not be useful as a concrete fact in your paper, but may help you find an angle, or give you an idea on what type of information to research.
Contact your professor and ask if there are other teachers at your school who may be experts on your topic who you can talk to.
Contact institutions who may be able to help you as well. If you’re researching WWII, contact your history museum and see if you can talk to someone there. If you’re writing a paper on the effects of smoking or something that might be health related, contact a doctor’s office in your area. Explain your purpose for getting in contact and ask if you could speak with a doctor to get information.

, Before typing your research paper, you need to come up with a good thesis statement. Your thesis statement is your point of view on your topic. It will express one main idea that covers your topic.


Your thesis statement should be an objective statement which can be argued by a reasonable person.
To help you come up with a thesis, turn your topic or assignment into a question which your thesis can answer. For example, if you’re writing about Dwight D. Eisenhower, formulate a question to narrow your topic. Maybe you decide that your research paper will be about Eisenhower’s contributions to America’s success in Europe. Therefore, you might ask the question “How did Dwight D. Eisenhower’s military tactics and plan to invade Normandy affect the outcome of World War II?”
Your thesis statement will then be a statement which broadly answers that question. You will then use this thesis statement to help you build your paper’s outline and focus on relevant information and sources.

, Writing an outline will not only help the actual writing of your paper but will help you to stay on topic. An outline makes a difference in how your paper is structured and interpreted by the reader.


Unless otherwise instructed, following the standard MLA format is a great way to structure your outline. MLA (Modern Language Association) is a commonly used format for structuring your papers in your word processor. It dictates your margins, spacing, font type, etc.
At the top center is the title of your paper.
Below, on a left indent, is your introduction. This is roughly a three to five sentence paragraph which gives basic information on what your topic is and what’s included in this paper. The end of your introductory paragraph typically contains your thesis.
Each paragraph is denoted by a Roman numeral in your outline. On your first line, start with a complete sentence that expresses the main idea which supports your thesis.
Your next line is denoted by a capital letter, starting with “A” for each section. Here you write a phrase that represents what you offer as proof from your research to support this main idea.
On the next lines below your capital letters are supporting points denoted by numbers, starting at “1”. Next to your number you will write a phrase that contains a specific example of support, detail, or statistic to back up your previous statement.
Here’s an example of a potential beginning to an outline if you’re writing about Eisenhower’s contribution to America’s success in Europe during WWII:

I. “Dwight D. Eisenhower’s superior tactical abilities aided in the successful invasion of Normandy, France on D-Day, ultimately shifting the tide of the war in the Allies’ favor.”
A. Here you might have a sentence that discusses the outcome of D-Day.
1. Support your statement about the outcome of D-Day by providing statistics and details that prove this invasion was a success.


Continue your outline in this format for your other paragraphs. In many cases, you will have three body paragraphs that support your thesis if writing in MLA.

, If you are required to write your paper in the APA (American Psychological Association) format, you will include sections in your outline for your Title page, Abstract page, Methods, and Discussion.


The Abstract page includes a concise summary of the key points of your research. Include your research topic, research questions, people who participated, methods, results, data, and the conclusions you found.
Your Method section will discuss how you came to your overall conclusion and gathered your findings. Your Discussion section is where you express your opinions and views, explain your findings and offer evidence.
If you’re writing an APA formatted paper, you will have these different sections instead of body paragraphs. The body of your paper begins with the Discussion section. This part of your paper is identified by typing “Discussion” as a level 1 heading, meaning it is centered and bolded. , With your outline typed up, go through all your notes and information and organize so that each bit of research information corresponds to a specific part of your outline.


Organizing your notes in this chronological order will make typing the paper much faster. You’ll be able to quickly find the correct resource to use or cite.
Likewise, get rid of any notes or information that no longer serve your outline. You can keep these notes if you wish to use the information later. But separate these less important and relevant notes so you don’t waste time sifting through when trying to find relevant information.

, After you’ve organized your notes and sources to match your outline, go over and check to make sure everything is reputable and that you have enough resources to support your thesis.


Check the accuracy of your research and verify that all of the information is factual and up-to-date. Especially if your research paper is on a current topic.
You may find through fact checking that you come across a new or central idea that helps you better discover the central topic of your paper.
Reading over all of your notes once again before you begin typing up your paper will also help you to learn the information better, allowing you to concisely communicate your point of view.
Read over your thesis one more time, making sure that it still applies to your research and answers the question of the assignment. You may find that you have to tweak it a bit.

, With everything in place and more knowledge on the central idea of your research paper, look over the structure of your outline.


You may find that you would be better off rearranging some of the body paragraphs.
Perhaps you found a better or new supporting source or statistic to back up an argument. Edit your outline to include this new source.
You may also find that you have irrelevant information in your outline which now distracts from your main idea. If this is the case, take it out.

, You will most likely be required to type your research paper in either MLA (Modern Language Association) or APA (American Psychological Association) formats. MLA is used for most types of papers written in school. The APA format is common when writing a paper related to the social sciences. Both styles are intended for presenting your information and sources in a specific way.


For MLA papers, your document settings require 1-inch margins on all sides, double-spaced, and 12-point font size.

You will include a page header on the top right, or flush right, of each page. This header includes your last name and the page number.


On a left indent, or flush left, you will include a title block which includes on individual lines, your full name, your teacher’s name, the name of the class, and the date the paper is due.

Following this information is the title of your paper which is centered.


APA styled papers include a 1-inch margin on all sides, double-spacing, and 12-point font.

You will include a page header, also known as a “running head” on top of every page. The running head includes page numbers flush right, and the title of your paper in ALL CAPS flush left.



, If you are writing in the APA format, you’ll need an Abstract page which is a concise summary of your research and findings. At the top of your page center your cursor and write “Abstract”. On the next line you will write your summary which includes all the relevant information to your paper. This is like a preview to your research paper and includes sources, persons interviewed, stats, and your findings. Do not indent your first line and keep your Abstract between 150 and 250 words.

, Your introductory paragraph starts on the next line below your title and the first line is indented. Don’t add extra spaces between your title and first paragraph for both MLA and APA.
You indent the first line by pressing the tab key. This equals about 5 spaces.
Your introductory paragraph is like an overview of your paper. This is where you set the scene and give your paper some context. Describe what the question of your paper is, and how you plan to solve the problem or reach the answer. At the end of your introductory paragraph, include your thesis. This is the answer to the question posed.
You’ve now told the reader the general purpose of your paper, how you plan to address the subject, and what your point of view is.
Write your introduction as if you’re speaking to a smart person who has knowledge on the subject. Don’t go into too much detail trying to explain every thought you have.
Keep it short. Aim for 3-5 sentences where you cover the broad topic, ask the question or define the problem, and end by stating your thesis or hypothesis.

, Begin the first body paragraph on the next line after your introduction. Indent the first line with the tab key again. In a lot of standard research papers that you will write in school, you will have three body paragraphs as three supporting arguments.


Flesh out your outline. Your outline is the skeleton of your paper and already has your arguments, sources, and examples laid out. For your body paragraphs, go through this outline and flesh out these points into narrative arguments, and examples that your reader can follow.
Go back to the notes you have organized and use these to find quotes, data, statistics, and any other information which you can include to expand your writing.
Expand your information to back up the arguments and points you expressed in your outline. It’s also a good idea to get each paragraph peer edited several times, and once by your teacher before your final draft. Your peers and teacher will provide another pair of eyes which can help you fill in any gaps or show you where you may be going off topic; as well as checking for spelling and grammar.
When citing sources or using quotes in your paper, you must immediately include the proper citation for reference. If citing a text with an author, you can either include the author’s name or a reference number which corresponds to a source in your Works Cited or References page. Include the name or number in parentheses after your sentence, but before the period. If you are quoting an author, introduce the quote with a phrase that provides the author’s last name and the date of the publication. Put the date in parentheses. Then begin your quote. After the quote, reference the source by page number if you found the quote in a book.

According to Jones (1998), ""Students often had difficulty using APA style, especially when it was their first time"" (p. 199). , Your conclusion paragraph like all the other paragraphs starts on the next line and is indented. Your conclusion is a summary, much like your introductory paragraph, which briefly touches on the question or problem with which you based the paper on. Include your methods or arguments for answering the question, or solving the problem, and restate your thesis.


In your conclusion, make sure you restate your topic and explain its importance.
Restate your thesis. You don’t want to simply write out your thesis. Instead, it should be a re-wording so that it compliments the information you have provided throughout the body of your paper.
Then summarize your main points. Quickly explain the points that served as your larger arguments from each paragraph and tie this information back into your thesis. Explain how these points supported your thesis.
Like your introduction, your conclusion doesn’t always have to be as long as your body paragraphs. However, it can be longer than your introduction. You might go into more depth on expressing how your main points contributed to your thesis.

, After you finish your first draft, take a break. After some time away, go back and read over your paper checking for any content errors, facts, sources, and quality. Then revise your paper into your final draft.


Your research paper won’t be complete after one draft. You will usually have some errors and may have not fully answered your thesis or provided enough relevant information. Some research papers even take three or four drafts before being complete.
Go through a checklist and make sure that you have included not only the right information but done so in a way that your reader can follow. Ask yourself:

Is my thesis clear and concise? Does it answer the question posed?
Did I follow my outline? Am I missing anything from it?
Have I proved my thesis throughout my paper clearly and with strong supporting arguments.
Have I given enough documented support to my arguments.


Once you can check off each item in this list, go through and check your paper for spelling and grammar. Make sure that your paper follows your formatting as well.

, You will have different formats for citing your sources depending on whether you’re writing in MLA or APA. References which are cited in your paper must have a Works Cited page in MLA, and a References page in APA.
The way you reference a citation or source will also differ based on where the source material was found. Book sources include the authors, title, city of publication, publisher, and year of publication. Journals and magazines need the journal title, article title, authors, volume and issue number, date of publication, and page numbers you used from the article. Websites require the author’s name (if given), title, group who manages or owns the site, last update date, the date you accessed the site, and URL.
Sources should be ordered alphabetically. Do not include the word “and” or an “&”. Capitalize all major words.
Your sources page should follow the same 1-inch margins and double-spacing. Do not add an extra space between each new source.

Target the cause.",How to Start Writing1," Almost anything could be discouraging you from writing whether it is mental, emotional or physical. When you begin to write, jot down the thoughts that come to your mind even if they aren't related to what you need to write about. This exercise is known as free or random association will give you a clue towards what the problem is. Here are some common reasons to why people have trouble writing and some suggestions on how to overcome the hurdle.


Not in the Mood: Take interest in what you write. Are you putting off your writing project because the topic seems boring? If you are allowed to write on other topics, then switch to a topic that interests you more. Otherwise, try to find some source of inspiration to overcome your boredom. For example, you could try to relate to the topic personally by thinking about how you, your friend or a family member have been affected by it.
Feeling Disconnected: Don't feel isolated. Build a connection between yourself, the topic you are writing about and the reader. Perhaps you can imagine somebody you care about or wish to impress reading the article while you are writing it. This will make your experience as a writer feel more interactive.
Lack of Preparation: Come up with ideas. Brainstorm to develop ideas to use in your writing. Jot down the main ideas that you want to express so you can refer to your notes whenever you get stuck. You should also plan out the structure of your project so you know how you will build interest for the reader during the introduction, present and interlink each idea in the body, and finally summarize and conclude the project based on what was discussed.
Anxiety: Be less self-conscious. Don't worry about failing as a writer. Most great writers have found success by loving what they do instead of worrying about how others will respond. You may have deadlines to meet and restrictive guidelines to follow, but you must think of writing as something enjoyable rather than torturous. There is no need to try to be a perfectionist. Think of writing as a process that is creative and easy to do instead of just worrying about the end result.
Exhaustion: Relax. Take proper and regular breaks that do not involve writing. For example, don't chat on the Internet or write emails to friends during your break. Instead, go for a walk outside or maybe freshen up with a shower or cup of tea. Your mind needs rest just like any other part of your body.
Distractions: Focus on the task at hand. Find a quiet place to develop your writing skills without distractions. Turn off your cell phone if you are getting a lot of unnecessary calls.
Feeling uncomfortable or too comfortable: Work with proper posture. Position yourself in a firm yet relaxed posture while working on your writing project. For example, you should not be sitting on a stool with no backrest, but at the same time you should not be lying on a bed either, because then you will start to feel lazy.
Personal Problems: Deal with problems outside work. This is 1 of the most difficult causes of writer's block to overcome because personal problems such as domestic violence or rejection from a loved one are difficult to control or ignore. Try to think about positive changes that will make your life better. Many writers have become successful by using writing as a way to escape from personal problems and give themselves hope during difficult times.;

Develop interest.,
Organize your project.,
Stick to the main points.",How to Start Writing2," Start writing the introduction in a way that appeals to the reader. Present your introductory characters or hypotheses clearly. Build curiosity and make the reader think.

, Divide different aspects of the story or topic into separate paragraphs. If you are writing a story or play, you will want to divide it into a sequence of scenes. If you are writing an essay, you should discuss different viewpoints in organized paragraphs.

, Don't go off into tangents that may confuse or bore the reader. This will help you bring your project to a focused conclusion later on.

Open the file.,
Check for word usage.,
Check for serial comma or oxford comma.,
Check for usage of quotation marks for emphasis or for quoted texts.,
Check for use of ""i.e."",
Check for author affiliation and background.,
Set the file in US or UK spelling.,
Start editing.",How to Standardize a Manuscript in US or British Spelling," Once the file is open, check the status bar (located at the bottom of the page) for the language the file is set. But there are times that the file is set in US language where in fact the word consistency is in British spelling.;
, 


British spelling uses ""-ise,"" ""-isa-,"" and ""-isi-"" for some words although usage of ""-ize,"" ""-iza-,' and ""-izi-"" is acceptable if the author has been consistent in the entire manuscript. US convention strictly uses ""-ize,"" ""-iza-,' and ""-izi-.""

For example,characterise, characterization, and characterizing rather than characterize, characterization, and characterizing.


Usage of ""-or"" for US  versus ""-our"" for British spelling.

For example, colour, endeavour, and rigour instead of color, endeavor, and rigor.


When the past tense, gerund, etc is formed, the final single consonant is spelled double regardless of stress, for example,modelled, channelled, and labelled. While in US spelling, the final consonant is doubled only if the stress is in the final consonant, for example, preferred, occurring, etc.""-t"" or ""-ed"" endings for the past tense of the verb. In British, use both forms of spelling, that is, spelled or spelt, while in US, ""-ed"" is the preferred form, for example, spelled.Use of ""-ce"" versus ""-se"" for some nouns. British spelling uses ""-ce"" for nouns like defence, licence, and practice but ""-se"" for the verb forms of these nouns, that is, defense, license, and practise. US uses both forms for the same spelling, for example, practice (noun or verb) and license (noun or verb).The suffix ""-wards"" is common in British, while ""-ward"" is more common in US spelling (e.g., toward vs. towards).Use of ""-re"" for UK, for example, centre and metre, while meter and center for US.Use of ""-ph-"" for UK, that is, sulphur, while sulfur in US.Usage of ""ae"" for UK, that is, haematology, while US uses ""e,"" that is, hematology.UK convention generally uses ""oe"" like in manoeuvre and oedema, but US uses ""e"" like edema and maneuver. UK also uses ""-ogue,"" while US uses ""-og"" (analogue, analog).
There are other word spellings distinct only in British spelling, like artifact, grey, leucocyte, among others. Make sure to check the dictionary for the right spelling.After checking the word usage count it one by one.

,


US spelling uses serial comma. A serial comma is a comma placed at the last item of a series, although usage of serial comma or oxford comma in British is now acceptable as long as the author has been consistent. For example, in the series apples, oranges, and lemons.

,


UK uses single quotes for emphasizing texts or to separate the quoted text, although the usage of double quotes is acceptable if the author is consistent. Take not also the period and comma are placed right after the closing quotation mark.
US spelling uses double quotes as standard. Periods and commas are placed before the closing quotation mark instead.

, and ""e.g."" 


British spelling does not place or set off ""i.e."" and ""e.g."" in the sentence. The comma only comes before it, for example: I want to buy fruits, i.e. apples, oranges and lemons (note no comma is placed after ""i.e."" The same applies for ""e.g."" in UK), while in US, for example, I want to buy fruits, i.e., apples, oranges, and lemons.
But always set off that is and for example with pairing commas when used in the sentence.

,


There are times that you can decide clearly whether the author is using US or British spelling. Try to check the author's affiliation if he was born in the UK or USA or born in the UK but raised in USA.

,


Once you have determined that the author is not using serial commas, consistent in using double quotes, and the number of words has been spelled in British spelling, set the file in UK convention. Click the language portion of the status bar, and set it to the correct spelling convention.

,


If the file is now set in US/UK, edit the words according to its convention. Use serial commas for US, retain if consistent in UK. Change single to double quotes if US, but retain double quotes in UK if consistent.
Use a standard dictionary for your spelling. Merriam-Webster Dictionary is preferable for US, while Oxford Dictionary in UK.

Check the size of your envelope.,
Weigh your letter.,
Decide if you want to send the letter by First Class, Priority, or Standard Mail.",How to Put a Stamp on an Envelope1," This should be marked on the packet of envelopes, or on the envelope itself. Size 14 envelopes measure 5"" x 11.5"" and are considered the standard size. They will be rectangular in shape and will often be sold in packages at your local post office.


You can also mail a letter in an envelope that is smaller than a size 14, such as a size 10 envelope (4.125"" x 9.5""), with a regular stamp.
If possible, fold your letter so it fits in a standard rectangular envelope, as this may cut down on the price of postage.
Envelopes larger than size 14 are considered large envelopes, or flats, and will be more expensive to mail.
Card sized envelopes, made for small greeting cards or wedding invitations, will also likely have additional postage fees. This is because pieces of mail that have an odd shape or are square shaped and made of rigid card can jam mail processing machines and need to be processed separately.;
, You can do this at the post office or on a small office scale. The weight and size of your letter (plus the envelope) will affect the price of postage, or how much you will pay for a stamp. Often, the heavier the letter is, the higher the price of postage will be.


Letters in a standard envelope that weigh less than 13 ounces can be sent via First Class Mail at one flat rate.
Letters in a standard envelope that weigh more than 13 ounces will be upgraded to Priority Class Mail, and the price for postage will be more than the flat rate., There are three basic levels of mail, according to the US Post Office.


First Class Mail is often what is used to send letter-size pieces that are rigid and square. To send a letter First-Class, it must weigh no more than 13 ounces. The price for sending First Class Mail is the same, regardless of the distance the letter is traveling. The arrival time for First Class Mail is two to three days for destinations within the U.S. Sending mail First Class is ideal for a single letter as all you need is a standard stamp and access to a post box.Priority Mail is ideal if you want your letter to get to the addressee by the following business day. To send a letter by Priority Mail, it must weigh no more than 70 pounds. At the post office, you can add on extra services to your Priority Mail item, such as USPS Tracking and Registered Mail, especially if your letter contains legal or sensitive information that must reach its destination. The price of Priority Mail postage is based on the distance the mail must travel; the further the distance, the more you will pay for postage. This is broken down by nine “zones”. For example, “Zone 1” is local, or the area close to you, and “Zone 9” is the furthest distance away from your location.
Standard Mail is used for larger quantities of mail, at least 200 pieces or 50 pounds of mail at one time. Envelopes must weight less than 16 ounces. Large envelopes, also called flats, cost more than letters. People use Standard Mail to send flyers, advertising documents, newsletters, catalogs, and bulletins. You can only send domestic mail by Standard Mail and you cannot send one single envelope through Standard Mail.

Set up a regular workspace.,
Organize your supplies.,
Make yourself comfortable.,
Snack regularly.,
Listen to music--or don’t!,
Reduce distractions.,
Make a writing schedule.,
Find a work routine.,
Take plenty of breaks.,
Plan your next writing session.,
Keep your goals in sight.,
Outline your work.,
Read something exciting!",How to Set the Mood to Write," Writing in the same space every session will help you stay on task and will train your mind to get into “writing mode” every time you sit down. Choose a quiet space that allows you to keep all your writing material on hand. You can set aside a whole office, a desk in a corner, or even your kitchen table., Keeping everything in a regular place and in easy reach will let you focus on writing instead of searching for lost pens and files! Depending on your writing style, you may need a laptop, printer, pen and paper, reference books, or other materials close by and well-organized. Line up books neatly, put writing utensils in a container, and keep loose papers organized into folders., Making yourself comfortable will help your mind concentrate on writing and will vary from person to person. Wear the clothes you like to write in, adjust your chair, and make sure the thermostat is at your perfect temperature!, If you are hungry or thirsty, you won’t be able to concentrate, so make sure that you keep your favorite snacks and drinks on hand. Keeping them within arm’s reach of your work area will prevent you from interrupting your writing time to visit the kitchen--those refrigerator trips can add up!, Some people need total silence to write, but others feel inspired by their favorite songs. If you need silence, keep your music apps or stereo turned off! If you love to listen to music while you write, make sure your favorite writing music is ready to go before you start writing so you don’t have to stop writing to find it later. Try listening to classical music too--many people who don’t like to listen to it find that it’s helpful while writing., It’s okay to take a break from writing, but don’t try to write while watching a movie, texting your friends, or working on other projects! You need to be able to concentrate to really get your mind in the mood to write. Put your phone in another room or turn it off, close social media pages on your computer, and turn off movies and television shows until your next break., If you can set aside a regular time to write, it will be easier to get yourself in the mood. If you write full-time, you can give yourself a regular workweek, with a start time and an end time every workday. But don’t worry if you work or go to school full-time--you can still make a writing schedule! Even if you can only set aside a few hours a week, having a set time will help you mentally prepare to write. It will also make it much harder for you to put off writing time!, Every writer has a work routine, and finding yours will make it easier for you to get started with your writing! Some writers like to check social media and get a second cup of coffee before they start to write, while others like to wake before dawn and begin writing immediately before taking a break. Think about what you like to do best before you write, and add it to your routine. Once you make it a habit, writing will become a habit too!, It might be tempting to sit down and write for ten hours, but that can actually make it more difficult to write! Take plenty of breaks to keep your mind fresh and in the mood for writing. Be sure to set a time limit on your breaks--you don’t want to spend the rest of the day on a “break” from writing!, At the end of every writing session, read over what you’ve done and plan your next step. It can be something small like “add a sentence about the latest business report” or something major like “kill off your main character.” Write your goal for the next session on a sticky note or on the last line of your file so it’s the first thing you see when you sit down to write next time!, Think about what you want to do as a writer--do you want to write a great novel, or an A+ research paper, or even the best sales brochure your company’s ever seen? If you have the end goal in mind before you sit down to work, it will be easier to get started achieving that goal., Spend some time writing an outline of your entire plan--for a novel, you could break it down into chapters, for example. If you are working through an especially boring part of your writing, knowing that there’s more exciting material ahead will help you get in the mood., Every writer has read something that got them excited about writing. If you’re finding it difficult to get into the mood to write, read something that makes you want to write--your favorite novel, a new story everyone’s talking about, or even something on the same topic as your own work. Being inspired by writing is a great way to get in the mood to write."

Refocus on a smaller goal, if you need.,
Set priorities.,

Break your goals down into steps.,
Create a schedule.,
Stay focused.,
Set time aside for your obligations.,
Be persistent.,
Communicate with others.,
Remove distractions.",How to Put Words Into Action," While you may have a broad idea of what you want to put into action, you need to take the time to formally list your goals. By listing your goals, you’ll provide yourself with the opportunity to think about them and to articulate them. When you list your goals:


Write them in concise language. For example, if you want to help disadvantaged people, write on your list “I will help homeless people this year.”
Include specifics in your list. For instance, commit that you’ll spend 10 hours a week helping homeless people. In addition, try to express where – like a homeless shelter.;
, After creating your list, you need to determine if you have what it takes to achieve your goals. Without the proper resources, you'll fail to turn your words into action.


Do you have the time to achieve your goal? For instance, consider if you have the time to get all As in school while maintaining a commitment to extracurricular activities like tennis and swimming.
Do you have the money needed to achieve your goal? For example, consider if you or your organization have the money it takes to offer subsidized spaying and neutering for all dogs in your town.
Do you have the help you need to achieve your goal? For instance, if you want to clean up trash along a local highway over the course of a weekend, can you actually do this yourself, or do you need the help of others?, After thinking about the time and resources you have available, you may need to narrow the scope of your goal. After refocusing, you'll likely discover that your goal is much more attainable than before.


Narrow the geographical scope of your goals. For instance, if you want to end homeless dog and cat euthanization in your community, think about your town instead of the entire county.
Focus on impact rather than ideal. While it might seem great to eliminate poverty in your community, helping a handful of struggling people might be an enormous success for both you and them.
Remember, refocusing your goal does not mean you are lowering your expectations or reneging on your stated commitment., After setting realistic goals, you should prioritize them so that you know which are most important for you. Without setting priorities, you may be overwhelmed by the scope of your goals.


Use a numeric scale to rank your overall list of goals. For example, if you have 10 goals, apply 1 to your top priority and 10 to your lowest priority.
Think about which goals need to be achieved to aid in the completion of other goals. For example, if you want to promote social justice in your community, you may rank your goal of promoting awareness as top. This could help you recruit others in your broader effort., Once you know your goals and priorities, you can begin the work of setting a timeline for putting your words into action. Without a timeline, you won’t have any idea of the progress you’re making.


Set up important milestones. For instance, if you plan to get an A in your College Algebra class, make sure you are doing well on quizzes and tests.
Set a definitive date to achieve your plan. For example, if you plan to clean up trash along a local river, give yourself an end date., At the center of your plan should be a step-by-step breakdown of how you are going to put your words into action. By breaking your plan down into small steps, you not only make your plan easier to achieve, but you’ll be able to grasp it in easy-to-understand terms.


Try to articulate, visualize, or map out your overall goal. If you’ve promised to be a better older sibling, break this down to definable steps you can take to do so. For instance, think about helping your little sibling with homework, with sports, and by giving them general advice.
If your goal is to be nicer to friends and family, re-conceptualize your goal as being nicer to individual people. This way, each interaction will be an important step toward completing your overall goal., After breaking your plan down into steps, you need to create a schedule so you can reserve time to carry it out. Without a schedule, your plan will just be a plan rather than a blueprint for action.


Get a day planner and reserve different days and time slots for non-goal related obligations.
Divide the remainder of your time up for goal-related obligations. Make sure to map out your schedule for as much time as you think you'll need to meet your goal. For example, if you have a month-long timeline for success, map out your entire month.
Pencil in your major milestones. For example if your plan has you cleaning up a local stream over the course of a month, plan to clean up 25% of it every week.
Reserve blocks every day or every week to meet your milestones., Throughout the process of implanting your plan, you need to stay focused on your overall goals. Without staying focused, you’ll likely lose motivation and may lose sight of your larger objective. In the end, you’ll fail to put your words into action.


Print off your list of goals and post them in places you can see them.
Spend time every day or every week reflecting on why you wanted to put your words into action., Make sure you hold to your plan, schedule, and use whatever time you need to put your words into action. Without guarding the time you've set aside to achieve your goal, you won't ever achieve it.


Don't deviate from your schedule. For example, if you’ve carved out an hour every afternoon to volunteer at the local animal shelter, don’t take on other responsibilities that might eat into that time.
Tell others you're committed to your goal and you can't blow off your obligation. For example, if your friends ask you to join them for a movie when you're supposed to be studying for a test, say ""I'd love to go but I'm committed to acing the next physics test."", Perhaps the most important part of putting words into action is that you need to persevere and put forth effort even when you meet challenges. This is important, as you’ll likely encounter many unexpected challenges.


Be positive and tell yourself that you can achieve your overall goal – especially considering the preparation you’ve put into creating a plan.
Don't let a setback or failure slow you down. In the end, earning a D on one math quiz won't necessarily stop you from getting into your top pick of colleges.
Redouble your efforts when you experience a setback. For example, study extra hard for the next quiz or test if you don't perform as well as you wanted to., When it comes to putting your words into action, you’ll have to communicate with people who support you as you implement your plan. Without properly communicating with people, you won’t be able to organize your effort, draw on additional resources, or gain feedback about your progress.


Hold periodic meetings with friends and allies about your goals, your plan, and your progress. Use the opportunity to reflect on whether you are successfully implementing your plan.
Use others not involved in your project as a sounding board for ideas. For example, explain to them what you’re trying to achieve, how you’re going about achieving it, and see what they think about your success so far., Don't let day-to-day distractions stop you from achieving your goal. By limiting distractions, you'll be able to dedicate more energy into carrying out your plan.


Don't mix fun and your goal-related obligations unless it helps you achieve it. For example, if some friends offer to kayak down a local river to help you clean it up, don't take them up on it unless you know they'll actually help.
Turn off electronics that may distract you. In the end, the TV or your cell phone might slow you down or distract you from your higher purpose."

Provide a writing sample only if specifically asked for one.,
Make the sample relevant to the position you're applying for.,
Be sure the sample is your own work.,
Make the sample a reasonable length.,
Proofread the sample carefully.,
Format your writing sample for easy reading.,
Identify your writing samples in your cover letter or email.",How to Prepare a Writing Sample," Even if the position you're applying for requires a great deal of writing, you may not be asked to provide a sample right away. Providing a sample too early in the interview process may torpedo your chances of getting the job if it isn't a good sample.;
, The type of writing sample you submit should relate in some way to the position you're seeking: For a technical writer position, sample topics from a help file or procedure manual would be appropriate. For a marketing position, advertising sample copy would be appropriate. For a public relations position, a press release would be appropriate.


If unsure about what kind of sample to send, research the position further to get a better understanding of the kind of work you'd be expected to produce, both by reviewing the company website and asking people in the company with similar positions about what they do.
In some cases, you may want to send more than one writing sample, notably if the position calls for the ability to write various types of pieces and you want to showcase your abilities in all the areas listed.
If you have several prospective samples to choose from, choose the most recent sample unless an older sample better showcases your capabilities with respect to the position.
If you haven't written in that area before, you can either send something you've previously written that's close to the area called for or write an original piece that falls within that area. In some cases, you may be asked to write an original piece ""on spec"" to demonstrate your skill in a particular area, such as a writer position for a particular publication.
Unless the position calls for it, avoid sending writing samples that contain political or religious opinions or caustic humor. In no case should you send a sample that puts down any individual or groups of people.

, This means four things:


Your writing sample should be your own work, not the work of someone else. If it involves the work of someone else, that source should be properly credited according to the style used by your prospective employer, such as APA (American Psychological Association) or MLA (Modern Language Association).
Although you may be asked to work with someone else on a writing project once hired, you should be the sole writer of any writing sample you submit, as you will be evaluated on how well you write.
You should have the rights to what you submit. Some companies may consider writing you've done for them as their property, if you wrote it as their employee, and you will need their permission to use it as a sample when applying for a position with someone else. Other companies may restrict you only to not using a given piece of writing if doing so violates any confidentiality agreements or until it is published or the product is associated with, such as a help file for a software application, is released.
Your writing sample should not be heavily edited by someone else. If you've worked on something that was heavily rewritten by others before publication, such as a white paper that went through multiple revisions, use the most recent draft that was largely your own work.

, In some cases, the type of writing will dictate the length of the sample: blogs and press releases typically run from 300 to 500 words, while legal memoranda should run 5 to 10 pages. If in doubt about the appropriate length, ask.


You can take an excerpt from a larger piece of writing, but if you do, include a note that explains this and summarizes the parts that were omitted and why you omitted them.

, Just as you want your resume and cover letter to be perfect, your writing sample should be free of spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. Look it over carefully yourself and have a knowledgeable friend look at it if necessary.

, Use adequate margins and spacing between paragraphs. Text should appear in a clean, readable font, with your name in a professional-looking header on the first page and on each subsequent page.


If sending a printed sample, print on clean, high-grade paper.

, Tell the recipient what each sample is and who it was originally written for.

Detail system requirements.,
Explain how to install the product.,
Include extra notes about updating versus installing.,
Report what is new with the product.,
Note the changes in the release.,
Reveal outstanding issues with the product.,
Incorporate as many troubleshooting tips as necessary.,
Add contact information at the bottom of the release note.",How to Prepare Release Notes,"


Start with the very basic information the customer or client must know in order to use the product. Even if the release note is reporting an update, the product might require additional hardware or other software to be installed prior to the new product's use.
Give a full account of operating system requirements and memory usage.;
,


Provide minute detail on the actual installation of the product. Release notes should be able to standalone as a technical document and helpful tool for users. If the installation steps are extensive, the release notes should refer to a specific document customers can refer to for the installation procedure.

,


Create a section that explains how to update the product without performing a full installation. Many software program enhancements simply need a downloaded update to fix bugs instead of a new install.

,


Supply an overview of new features and enhancements the product possesses. Include a concrete, explicit reason for the release. This might mean admitting prior defects, but it must be disclosed to keep customers' trust. This section of the release notes provides the most important information in the document. It is what users look to when deciding if the update is crucial to them. If the release is a small fix on an application an individual customer never utilized, he or she might not need to update.

,


Go into detail about the bugs and problems that have been fixed. Explain what exactly was wrong and the steps that were taken to restore the product. Corrections should be summarized at the least and explained in full detail at the most. Full detail includes the issue number, the symptoms, its cause and the correction employed.

,


Disclose even minor problems that have been found with the new release. These problems should not be grave enough to warrant a totally new release; but they should be explained to the user in the notes regardless.

,


Include 2 columns: One should have basic troubleshooting tips and the other should have more advanced tips. You will not be able to include every possible stumbling block and its solution, but you should include the most obvious obstacles.

,


Point the readers in the right direction in terms of customer service queries, technical queries, etc. Include the company's website in this portion of the release notes.

Choose your writing materials.There's no right or wrong way to write.,
Create an organizational system.,
Have a regular writing spot.,
Look for an inspirational writing location.Inspiration strikes every writer differently.,
Make your writing space comfortable.,
Decorate your writing space.The more you can personalize your writing space, the more time you'll want to spend there.,
Figure out when you work best.,
Consider your other obligations.,
Create a writing schedule.A daily writing routine will make you more likely to stick to your goals and finish your book.You should know when you’re going to write every day, and plan the rest of your schedule around it.Depending on how flexible your day to day life is, create either a strict or flexible writing schedule.,
Make a promise that you won't get drawn away from the routine.,
Set deadlines for yourself.Setting deadlines is a delicate balance.,
Get an accountability partner.An accountability partner is another writer who's also working on a book.,
Determine the book’s genre.When deciding what type of book you want to write, first consider what types of books you like to read.,
Figure out the book's purpose.Once you've chosen your book's genre, you need to figure out what you want to provide the reader.,
Conduct your research.If you are writing to provide information, it may seem obvious that you need to spend a lot of time researching.,
Outline your book.As you research, your vision for the book may start coming together.",How to Prepare for Writing a Book," Some people find that writing on a computer distances them from their work, so they prefer to work by hand. Other people prefer computers because they can edit more easily, and can use the internet to research their projects. Don't feel pressure to choose one over the other. All that matters is that you choose a writing method that will allow you to be productive and efficient.;
, Whether you're working with a computer or with pencil and paper, you need a system to organize your thoughts. It's best to come up with an organizational strategy before your notes get too jumbled, or else you may not be able to figure out what you meant to say. If using a computer, create one folder for the whole book, then create individual folders to hold different types of information. If using pen and paper, set aside a drawer that is just for your book materials. Put individual notebooks or file folders dedicated to different types of information in the drawer.


Nonfiction books obviously call for a great deal of research. Make sure you can find all your information quickly and easily with your organizational system.
For novels, you might have a file or folder on each character's development information. For example, if one of your characters is an EMT, you will want to research EMTs to make the character more realistic.
Consider using software that helps writers organize their research and chapters.

, For most people, regularity is a key to sticking to a writing schedule. J.K. Rowling famously wrote large portions of the Harry Potter books in one local spot — Nicholson's Café and Roald Dahl had a hut outside of his house where he wrote his greatest novels.The sites and sounds of public spaces may be distracting, in which case you may prefer to work at home.
Home isn't free of distractions, though. If your bed or TV keep you away from writing, maybe you need to get out of the house to write.
The important thing is to have a comfortable, routine writing location that you can look forward to settling into every day.

, What do you need to get your creative juices flowing? If you need the stillness of nature, you may want to set up shop at a picnic bench in your local park. If people-watching gives you ideas for your characters, you might gravitate toward coffee shops. If you're writing at home, choose your favorite room in the house.


Don't work anywhere that has stressful or negative connotations. For example, writing in the kitchen might just remind you of all your other household obligations.

, If your chair is squeaking or if it hurts your back, you won't be able to concentrate on your work. Make things easy for yourself by making your environment as comfortable as possible. Keep in mind that the environment will be easier to control at home.


Make sure the temperature is comfortable. Wear warm or cool clothing to adjust for uncomfortable temperatures if you don't control the thermostat.
Choose a comfortable chair. Use cushions to protect your bottom during long periods of sitting, or to make your back feel better.
Set up your research materials so you can access them easily. You don't want to have to search for information when you're in the middle of writing. At home, keep your bookcase or research files nearby. In public, bring the books you'll need with you.

, When you're writing, you should be surrounded by things that inspire you to keep working. What motivates you? If there's a particular book that always makes you want to write, keep it nearby for when you have writer's block. Consider placing framed pictures of your family in your working space, or quotes from your favorite authors. Surround yourself with your favorite colors, or maybe your favorite album playing quietly in the background. The writing space should be a place you look forward to retreating into every day.

, Some people work best first thing in the morning, when the house is quiet and the mind is clear.But if you're not an early riser, you may find yourself falling asleep at your desk instead of working. Be honest with yourself about when and how you write best.

, Before setting up your writing schedule, you need to be able to anticipate the things that will drag you away from writing. Do your work hours change from week to week? Do you have small children who might take up a lot of your time?Older children whose activities might have you on the run? You'll need to decide whether you will work best with a strict schedule or a flexible one.


If you have a predictable schedule, develop a strict writing routine.
If your schedule varies from day to day, know that you'll have to find writing time where you can.

, The most important thing is that you have at least one hour of distraction-free writing time every single day. If you can find more time, that's even better! It doesn't have to come all at once: you might write for an hour before work in the morning, then for another hour in the evening once the rest of the house has gone to bed., Once you sit down to write, you shouldn't allow anything else to drag you away. Don't answer the phone or check emails, ask your spouse to watch the kids — do whatever you need to do to stay focused. You may need to discuss your writing needs with those you live with. Ask them to be understanding of your routine and to give you some space when you're working.

, You want to push and challenge yourself so you're not getting lazy, but you also want to be reasonable. Don't set yourself up to fail. Assess your schedule and be honest about how much time you can set aside to write. Some examples of writing deadlines might include:


Daily word counts: you have to write 2,000 words a day
Notebook counts: you have to fill out one spiral-bound notebook each month
Chapter deadlines
Research deadlines

, You will hold each other accountable to your writing routines and goals. It's easy to slack off when you're writing in isolation. A good accountability partner will make you confront any laziness or distraction and help you get back on track.


Meet with your accountability partner regularly. Depending on your schedule, this might be every day or every week. What's important is that you stay in regular touch.
Share your schedule and goals/deadlines with your partner. They need to be able to tell if you're behind schedule!
During these meetings, you can either work side by side on your own projects or look at each other's work. A second set of eyes can be a useful tool when writing a book!

, When you go to the bookstore or library, which section do you spend the most time in? Do you spend your weekends relaxing with a romance novel, or do you prefer to learn about historical figures through biographies? Do you enjoy the satisfaction of the long novel, or do you find the immediacy of the short story more gratifying?


Writers perform best when they are familiar with the genre in which they are writing.
This usually aligns with the genre they enjoy reading best. Choosing the genre you know most about will likely result in the most enjoyable writing experience, too!

, Think about why you've enjoyed your favorite books in this genre. This will help you figure out what the purpose of your own book should be. For example, a biography George Washington might help you understand and connect to the culture of your country. Mystery novels consume you with tension, curiosity, and surprise. Fantasy novels let you escape this world and expand your imagination.


Spend some time writing about what effect you hope to achieve in your reader.
By laying out your goals before beginning the project, you have a reminder you can come back to later, when you feel lost or directionless in the writing process.

, Don’t assume, though, that romance novels or dramatic short stories don’t require any research. If your novel is set in the past, you must be able to provide a realistic physical and social setting. If one of your characters is a police officer, you must be able to realistically portray her in that profession. To present the reader with a believable story, you must always conduct research.


Look in textbooks to find basic language that will make a character’s professional life believable. You don’t want to use terms incorrectly!
Research historical eras online and in books.
Consider interviewing people who may have expertise in areas you want to write about.

, As soon as you feel like you know which direction to take it in, begin putting together your outline for the book.


Each chapter of the book should have its own section on the outline.
Within each outline section, use bullet points to flesh out important details that need to be included in the chapter.
The outline can grow and adjust as your book begins to take shape. Add or delete information as necessary, but use the outline to make sure you’re staying focused on your writing goals.
When you’ve researched and outlined you’re book, you’re ready to begin the writing process!

Provide a historical review.,
Offer an anecdote.,
Write a surprising statement.,
Let a famous person speak.,
Avoid overly broad language.,
Do not use dictionary definitions.",How to Start an Introductory Paragraph1," The introductory paragraph is often the best place to lay out how people generally think about a topic. For instance, if your research topic is about how tattoos are central to Maori culture, you might open your intro paragraph with some background information about Maori society, references to the larger body of scholarship on Maori tattoos, or quotes from the first historical accounts about them.This historical statement should help readers who are not well-versed in the topic of your essay to better understand the relevant points of the topic that you’ll later debunk, refine, or expand upon.;
, An anecdote is a brief story that relates either literally or symbolically to the topic you’re writing about. For instance, if you’re writing about how extremists have been infiltrating a political party, you might start the paragraph with a summation of the Iliad, focusing especially on the Trojan horse ploy.Alternately, you could provide a more literal anecdote. For instance, if your topic is the ecological crisis, you might provide a brief story about how quickly a certain species is going extinct.

, A surprising statement is one that shocks or amazes readers. For instance, it could be a statistic like “Seven people under the age of 20 are shot every day.” You could also provide an unusual fact. For instance, you might write about how sand shark embryos eat their gestating counterparts while still in the womb., You can almost always find someone who commands authority and respect who has spoken on the issue you want to address. Run an internet search for quotes regarding a particular topic or search for quotes from someone you respect. Politicians, captains of industry, and religious leaders can often provide relevant quotes., When starting an introductory paragraph, focus sharply on the topic you’re writing about. Do not use “cosmic statements.” These include “There are two sides to every issue,” “Since time immemorial,” and “For many years…” Instead, cite a specific historical range (when relevant) or specific cultural conditions, and keep your writing centered on the subject or issue under examination., Starting an intro paragraph with a dictionary definition is uninspired and trite. It will rarely interest readers or provide them with new information.If you feel obligated to delineate more clearly what you’re writing about, that’s fine, but do it without referring to dictionary definitions.

Find out how much time you will have, how many questions there will be, and what you will need to bring to the test.
Find out how many points will be dedicated to mechanics, like grammar and spelling, as opposed to the content of your answers.;
, Read them all, making sure you understand all the material. Recall if there was anything that your teacher emphasized. Jot down any concepts you don't fully understand or vocabulary words you haven't yet memorized. Make sure you know all the vocabulary, as well as the trivial details (like names, dates, and events).

, Essay tests demand a thorough knowledge of concepts, not just simple facts. Don't just memorize aimlessly. Instead, categorize and arrange concepts from the class into thematic patterns.Look through your material and organize concepts into categories.
Look for important ideas and organize your notes into groups.
Brainstorm ways that these groups correspond to each other.

, Review any recent writing you've done for school, and see if you've made any common mistakes. Check your grammar, and review the spelling of any relevant words. Correct mechanics can earn you points, while poor grammar may hurt you., Making healthy choices on the night before the test and that morning can significantly improve your grade.


Get a good night's sleep.Eat a nutritious breakfast.Do something that helps you relax, such as playing a game or taking a bath.

, Having all the required and optional supplies will enable you to pass the exam. These may include items like pencils, blue books, a specific reading, or even a dictionary. Some instructors may allow you to bring your notes. You may also want to pack some water and a snack.

, When you receive your prompt, note how long you have to write, and what time you will be required to stop.


Decide how much time you will spend planning your writing, writing the actual essay, and proofreading.
Consider using a 5-45-10 ratio (for an hour-long essay exam): 5 minutes to plan, 45 minutes to write, and 10 minutes to revise. You can adjust this ratio to fit your own time constraints. , Key words in the prompt will communicate exactly how you should go about answering each part. Circle these words and be sure you understand what each is asking. Here are some examples:


Define: Provide the subject’s meaning (or definition). Often you will be asked to provide one than perspective on the subject's meaning.
Explain why/how: describe the reasons why, or the steps leading up to how a particular thing occurred.
Compare or contrast: Show how two or more things are similar or dissimilar.
Prove: Give reasons or examples to demonstrate how or why something is the truth.
Analyze: Look closely at the components of something to figure out what it might mean, or why it is important., Your thesis is the center of your essay. It is the main idea that everything in your essay will work to support. Think about what the prompt is asking. Then craft a clear, declarative statement that provides your basic answer. This thesis statement will broadly explain the central point of your essay, which the rest of your essay will prove., Write your thesis in a bubble at the center of a sheet of paper. Write down what you think may be the main ideas of your essay in smaller bubbles. If an idea is very important, make that bubble larger. This concept map will help you visualize which ideas will make good strong points, and which others may be combined or omitted. , Using your concept map as a guide, select three main points that support your thesis. Under each main point, list specific evidence that supports it. Organize your main points into a logical order. Make sure all of your main points work to support your thesis. This outline is just for you so format is not really important.

, Begin with a sentence or two that introduces the topic and its significance. Next, state your thesis. If time allows, provide a sentence that previews your main ideas., Start each paragraph with a strong topic sentence, connecting the last paragraph to this one by use of a transition. Then, support your thesis with specific evidence, such as key vocabulary or facts. Finally, conclude the paragraph with a sentence connecting it back to the thesis., Review your body paragraphs. Restate your thesis using different wording or phrasing. Conclude the paper with an explanation as to why your topic was important. Endeavor to do more than simply summarize your paper., Proofreading your essay can make an immense difference in your grade. This step will enable you to clean up sloppy grammar, as well as to make sure that your essay reads clearly, and makes sense.Read your entire essay to check for clarity. Go back to the prompt and make sure that you have answered the question or questions.
Proofread for grammar and spelling. Be sure to check spelling of words you learned in class!
Check that every body paragraph has a topic sentence, specific evidence, and a connection to the thesis.
If time allows (and if the essay is handwritten), rewrite the essay to reflect any changes you made. Use your best penmanship.

, Double-check that your name appears on your essay. Often students are so preoccupied with the test itself that they forget this crucial element. You worked hard! Be sure to give yourself credit.

If you are under 13, you can still take part, but instead of signing up under the Script Frenzy program, you sign up under the Young Writers Program (www.ywp.scriptfrenzy.org). This is a version of script frenzy designed especially for younger people
If you took part in Nanowrimo, then your user name is automatically registered on Script Frenzy. All you need to do is to go straight to the log in screen, log in with your Nano details and then accept the terms and conditions.;
, Click on 'My Script Frenzy' once you are logged on to access your profile. Use the buttons on the left hand side to edit various aspects of your profile such as a picture, interests, where you live. Share as much or as little as you want.

, If you haven't done something like this before, then reading through the Writer's Resources articles will give you a good starting point for creating a script.

, What will you be writing? A TV show, a graphic novel, a musical - there are many areas to chose from. Also, Script Frenzy allows you to work together with another person on your script. There are both advantages and disadvantages to this so you need to think about it (Even if two people are writing, you still only need to write 100 pages)

, How much you do is up to you. Some people plan each scene in detail, some only a brief idea of beginning, middle and end. You probably need some general idea as to where your script needs to go otherwise it will get confusing. Remember that you can only actually begin to write once April has started.

, These run before and after April as well as during and it is a great way to talk to fellow writers as well as to get inspiration and motivation.

Motivation is a key part of Script Frenzy. You need to make yourself write the pages even when the words don't seem to make sense. Remember - this is a first draft so quantity not quality.

, If you have made 100 pages then save it as a PDF, go to 'edit my profile' and upload the file. If it says you have won, you will receive a certificate which you can print out and proudly display.

, Edit out the rough bits (trust me, there will be some rough bits - it is only a first draft after all!) and then do what you wish! Film it with friends, send it off or just keep it to yourself. It's up to you.

Draw inspiration from the gifts all around you.,
Take words from the street.,
Use index cards.,
Listen to children.,

Study the comics pages.",How to Organize Your Ideas Into a Single Panel Cartoon," Does the blank page scare you? If so, try free writing. It's exactly what it says - writing freely. To do it, sit for a specified time, seven to ten minutes and write by hand. Write whatever comes to mind. If you draw a blank, look around you and write what you see or describe what you are wearing. The goal is to write furiously and fast, so punctuation, spelling and neatness aren't important. Fill a minimum of two pages with a steady stream of writing. This isn't for show, so don't edit or refine. If you dry up, write ""Dear Friend"" and keep going, or bemoan your writer's block. Patience, discipline and writing will be rewarded. It will get easier to fill two pages. Save the pages, set them aside and look at them much later. Highlight good parts.;
, This is a form of free association used by many who want to explore a single word. Draw a circle in the middle of a piece of paper, circle it and write the word in the circle. Look at the word and other related words will come. Make another circle and write the related words in the circle. Keep going back to the central word and when you run dry, keep going. Go back later and, by distancing yourself, you will be able to add more words. Scan the page, make connections, and write ideas at the bottom of the page.

, Obtain six pictures, snapshots, or magazine photos of people or animals. Study body language, facial expressions, and the settings. Put cartoon balloons over their heads and write their thoughts or speech in the balloons. You can purchase blank bubbles in stores that sell scrapbooking supplies or make your own. Keep the results in your notebook.

, Use any picture or go online to sites offering pictures to caption, print one out and make up and write a caption for it. Even if the captions are way off-base, or wrong, keep them, and do another beneath it. Practice and this gets easier.

, If you like orderly columns, this is an ideal thing to try. Pick a word you want to explore, such as ""dog"", ""shoes,"" ""cars,"" ""vacation,"" etc. Write the primary word at the top and make columns titled, Person, Place, Thing, Words and Phrases, and begin to fill them in. You will be able to associate things that you might not have thought of by having all the words organized in such a manner. When you run dry, try to keep going or take a break and go back later, more and more words will come.

, Look for things seen in daily life that are incongruous or surprising. For example, a highway worker, drinking coffee, leaning against a sign that says, ""Your Tax Dollars at Work."" When you see something, organize it so that the punchline comes last, for greatest impact. The more you discover, the more you will begin to discover.

, We are inundated with words: signs, advertisements, slogans, directions, store and street names, cautions, bumper stickers, notices of sales, specials, even bits of paper on the ground or blown up against a wall or fence. Take note of these cosmic messages, write them down in your notebook, whether they immediately make sense or not. Jot them down or you will surely forget the exact wording.


Online, you can find sites offering bizarre signs. How about: EXIT 5/10 MILE ahead?

, You may have outlined on index cards in school, one idea to a card. You can shuffle them and lay them out randomly, or divide them into categories: themes, characters, captions, etc. This visual approach is good because the layouts can be left out to view at various time, in various moods, and they might even catch your eye as you pass by, so take note.

, Kids are blunt and haven't yet developed a filter for their thoughts. Pay attention to their stark observations, and material might emerge for a cartoon. Study kid's books for brevity, directness and how to hone words and pictures for maximum impact. They will help you aim high.

, Write out old sayings, enough to fill a page, but change the endings. Start a train down the track, but derail it for laughs. ""A stitch in time saves going shopping for new clothes,"" ""Cleanliness is overrated,"" ""Who would watch a pot when the microwave is faster."" Get the words and phrases to substitute from ones you've collected and put in a jar for this purpose.

, Analyze cartoons as if you were using them as a textbook for cartooning. What makes them funny, or not? Do you need background information to ""get"" the joke? How is the message conveyed; drawing, facial expressions, body language or a combination? What first captures your attention and why? How is your eye lead through the piece, side to side, up and down or in a circle? Study the art work. How is the piece composed? What type of line is used; fine, even, brush quality, sketchy, etc.? How is shading used? Look at the foreground, middle and background, is perspective used? Perhaps there is no attempt at depth and the image is flat. How is speech conveyed, balloons, captions through signs on the walls, etc.? Cut out and put favorites in your notebook as work to inspire you.

Write the start of your introductory paragraph last.,
Write with confidence.,
Read the start of your intro paragraph out loud.",How to Start an Introductory Paragraph2," Sometimes it is best to say what you want to say or lay out the results of your research in a series of body paragraphs, then analyze what you’ve written or discovered before crafting your introductory and concluding paragraphs. This will give you more time to consider the connections between your own writing and other material on the topic, or connections between the many elements within your article or essay., To write with confidence, avoid qualifying language. For instance, do not start your intro paragraph with “I think…” or “I believe” or “In my opinion…” Instead, state the facts as they are. This way, you can convince readers that you are an authoritative voice and your writing is worth reading., After crafting your intro paragraph, read the whole thing out loud to yourself. This will help you sense whether the start of the introductory paragraph meshes well with the middle and end of the intro paragraph. As you read, listen for logical inconsistencies, unclear passages, missing details, and spelling or grammar errors. Correct them where needed.When reviewing the start of your intro paragraph, be sure that it leads smoothly into your thesis in a meaningful way.
Edit the intro paragraph for filler. Only keep passages that demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the topic.

Identify what’s important.,
Provide an analysis.,
Strip away minor details.,
Set the scene.",How to Start an Introductory Paragraph3," When starting introductory paragraphs for the news, it is important to provide the five W’s (who, what, when, where, why) and the H (how) as soon as possible. Since these are the most important details in a news story, their presence close to the opening of the story will help readers get a better sense of whether they want to continue reading or move on to another article., By starting your intro paragraph with a bit of analysis, you can explore in greater depth the ramifications of a well-known story or a story that has been covered elsewhere. In this case, instead of providing the five W’s, you focus more on the “how” of a given topic in recent news. For instance, instead of describing or reporting on the actual details of a public policy and how it moved through the legislative process, you can use the start of your introductory paragraph to explain how the policy will change society or the lives of those affected.Starting with an analytical lede will often also include information regarding who benefits and why, but the primary focus will be on explaining how a news item or event work, rather than merely describing it.

, The standard way to start an intro paragraph in news articles is to provide all the important info up front. Sometimes, though, this means stripping the story down to its barest and broadest components. For instance, instead of starting the intro paragraph with a sentence jam-packed with the who, what, where, why, and other details, you should provide a bare-bones sentence that helps readers understand the broader issue without getting bogged down in details.For instance, instead of writing, “President Jones declared in a joint session of Congress today that he will work with his counterparts abroad to reorganize international fiscal policy and lending practices, making it easier to distribute international aid,” you could write, “A new law aims to fast-track international aid to developing nations.” The details about how the process worked and why the president chose to adopt this measure could come later.
This approach is called starting with a blind lede.

, Instead of explaining the issue or news event from the typical detached, omniscient perspective, take the reader right into the action. For instance, you might start the intro paragraph to a story about a war by writing, “Craters scarred the landscape. The smell of gunpowder hung in the air. In the distance, the husk of a burned-out automobile belched black smoke.”After describing the aftermath of the battle, you could zoom out to describe the duration of the conflict, reasons behind it, and long-term impact of the fighting.

Prioritize.,
Tidy up.,
Schedule your writing times.,
Organize your writing itself.",How to Organize All Your Writing Projects," If you are avoiding writing because you feel there is so much to be done, prioritizing can give you a sense of control and a motivation to get started. An example way to prioritize is as follows:


Put writing projects that you are being paid for at the top of the list. This makes common sense!
Put writing projects with a deadline at the top of the list, and naturally, prioritize them according to due dates.
Place writing projects that will result in motivating you to complete something quickly next. These might be writing poems, a short story, an article for wikiHow, a children's story, etc. This is for the projects that you want to do, not the ones that you feel you must do or that you'd eventually like to get around to doing.
Place the projects you'd like to get around to doing at the bottom of the prioritization. It is possible that such grand ideas of what you could write are hampering what you are in a position to write. By no means discard them, but give them less prioritization until they are less amorphous and become much clearer in your mind.;
, It is vital to have space to write. Even if your creativity runs to messiness as inspiration, it is important to have some space around you to be able to access source materials, to lay out your plans, to reach your computer or writing pad, and to feel comfortable. A pile of ""inspirational materials"" over-towering your computer space will put you off rather than inspire you, so put all these things in easily accessible places. An hour or two spent reorganizing desk mess will pay huge dividends. Ideas include:


Use magazine holders for separate projects.
Use in-trays for material yet to be read and out-trays for material needing to be placed in files, folders, or magazine holders.
Use mini bookshelves as a way of separating source materials for different writing projects; this can help as both a source of inspiration and also lessens frustration when looking for that ""exact quote"".
Use small cut-down boxes (that is, boxes with the flaps cut off) as places to hold the materials for different writing projects; these are free from grocery stores, for example, and can make excellent small holders for papers and books. Look for ones that dispense items such as candies, as they will often already have a front portion punched out to make it easier to see your materials.
Color code. Use of colors for different writing projects can be a visually inspiring and easily accessible way to arrange and find your writing projects. You can also consider grouping each writing project with the relevant source materials that you are using to feed into the writing.

, Set definite times to write particular projects or documents. Set time limits and aim to meet them each time before switching to the next project or other activities in your life. While this may feel limiting to begin with, it is actually a very useful way to tame wandering creativity and focus it into real outcomes. There are many great writers who revealed that they would write during set blocks of time and then have the rest of their day free for other activities. Find out which part of the day and which periods of time work best for you, and set those aside.


In a work environment, your writing project deliverables can often be determined by the input from others; be sure to include the need for other's ideas, checks, and redirection in your timeline.

, There are many ways to plan out writing, to provide motivational structures that help you stay focused when writing. It is important to find the one that fits your style though, so don't just go with the first one that you read about. Try a few out and see which works best for you.

Decide what the god is about.,
Decide the sex of your god.,
Name your god.,
Give your god powers and personality.,
Give your god an appearance(Optional).",How to Make Your Own Made‐Up Mythical God," Athena is the goddess of wisdom, Zeus has power over the sky, along those lines. You can make it for anything you want. It can be the god of trees, mavericks, or even something as simple as fruit. Dionysus is the god of wine!;
, Depending on what the god is of, one gender is usually more appropriate than another. However, this has varied in different old religions, and don't just make the god/goddess's gender be based on a modern version of what is feminine or masculine. Artemis, for example, was the goddess of hunting and dogs.

, One way to do it is to combine names of already existing gods in mythology. But don't choose a god everyone knows about like Hades, Horus, Venus, etc. You can also just say something random that sounds cool. There are also other methods to name your god.

, And don't be afraid to borrow traits from existing gods. Let's say, for example, we have Aperkses, and he is the god of storms.You can give him the power to shoot lightning bolts like Zeus. If we have a god named Sucuel, the god of darkness, and you like Hades' depression, you can give him that trait if you like. Just make sure you aren't ripping off any gods.

, The appearance should match the god's personality though. If you have a god of fire, you can give him spiky orange hair, (even flaming!) and give him eyes with attitude! But let's say you have a goddess of beauty. Make her exotic and pretty! If you have a goddess of air make her look calm and intelligent, maybe with wings!

Say “thank you.” If you are tempted to respond impulsively with a remark that could come back to harm you, it may be in your best interest to reply simply as if the person was entirely sincerely.,
Smile and carry on.,
Ask the person to explain what he or she means.,
Request that they stop.",How to Deal with Insincere Compliments1," Tell the person “thank you” even if you’re sure the compliment wasn’t altogether genuine.


Thank the person for the positive portion of the compliment and ignoring the rest. For example, your sister says “Geez, you’ve lost a lot of weight! You look good! At one point you were so much bigger than me!” You might reply with “Thanks, I’m glad my hard work is starting to show.”It is likely very hard to not respond to hurtful comments mixed into the ""compliment"". This sort of approach is best for situations in which responding in a more frank and forthright manner is not advisable. For example, a superior at work or your sibling at a family gathering.;
, In other words, ignore the masked insult and continue what you were doing. There’s no need to allow the person to get under your skin. Ignoring them with a polite smile will send the message that you won’t engage in the exchange, it does not have the desired effect on you (upsetting you, humiliating you, manipulating you). Plus on the off chance the compliment was actually sincere, you won’t have waged war on an innocent person., If you have an acquaintance who regularly offers insincere compliments, you might choose to confront them by having them really explain what is meant by the statement. This will force the individual to confront his or her words, and have to justify them. This will often make a person uncomfortable with his or her actions and re-think interactions.

Be specific in your example. For example, ""Thank you for noticing I cleaned the kitchen, but what do you mean by saying, 'it's nice to see a person like you doing that?'"" Rather than, ""Thank you for noticing I cleaned the kitchen, but the rest of that statement is garbage."" Being specific in the insincere compliment makes it harder to just blow off as a mistaken word or phrase.
Particularly manipulative individuals, or those good at coming up with excuses on the spot may be able to navigate this tactic. Even still, it is worth trying, as it will indicate you are aware of the behavior and question it.
Keep in mind that the person may not even be aware that they are giving negative compliments if this is their normal way of interacting, so you may be doing them a favor by pointing this out to them.






You might say, “Ben, I notice that you make a lot of remarks about my work. At first glance, they appear positive, but I noticed you keep commenting about my punctuality. I'm really unclear on why you keep talking about it because you know I take the bus and have little control over when it arrives. Can you explain?”Occasionally an individual does not really understand he or she is giving insincere compliments. This can happen if a parent modelled this behavior, he or she was not allowed to voice feelings directly, or some mental illnesses. It is still not OK, but it can be a learned behavior.
The person might respond with a sincere apology, which you can choose to accept. Or not.
People may become defensive and make up excuses or the like. This is a sign that he or she knows it is wrong but is not ready to own up to it.

, Sometimes just confronting the individual with his or her statements or enough, but requesting that they stop is an even stronger statement. Do so under the pretense of modesty and the person will be none the wiser.


For instance, say something along the lines of “Please stop with the compliments, Tina. I’m just doing my job.” Or, you might deflect the praise to others by saying, “I wasn’t the only one who worked on this project. Praise the rest of the team—not just me.”"
"
Reframe it so it’s about you.,
Be genuine.,
Be specific.,
Sneak it in there.,
Give compliments if you want to.,
Limit trash talking about other people and talking about your own flaws.,
Focus on people’s good qualities.,
Call him out on it if he deflects or rejects praise regularly.,
Recognize self-esteem issues.,
Find out about cultural differences.,
Think about gender differences.",How to Give Compliments to People Who Won't Take Them," He will have a hard time refuting it if you are talking about your own feelings.


”I've never seen eyes that blue before.”
“That piece you played on the piano made me feel so calm and serene.”
“Your smile just made my day!”
“I couldn’t have finished this project without you. You really helped me out and I appreciate it.”;
, People can spot a fake compliment a mile away and faking flattery will make you seem untrustworthy, which can sabotage a relationship.Think about your reasons for giving praise. It should be to make someone else feel good and valued, not for your own personal gain.

, Sometimes the most memorable compliments are the most specific ones, because it shows that you were paying attention.


“I liked how you handled the questions during your presentation today. You really helped the group find a solution that benefits everyone.”“Your shirt is such a pretty color. It perfectly matches the color of your eyes.”

, Be creative in how you give a compliment to make people feel good indirectly.


Ask for the recipe if you like what she cooked, or ask for advice. She will feel valued.Mention that someone else said something nice about her or talk about how much other people care about her.Do charitable work together so she will see herself as someone who helps others. , If giving compliments is part of your character, you don't need to diminish that quality just because you get an unfavorable response from someone. If being complimentary part of who you are, go ahead and give out compliments.


In addition, even if the person struggles to accept your compliment, you may be activating the striatum region of his brain, which motivates him to perform better.Compliments can also improve a person's self-esteem. Again, the person doesn't have to consciously ""accept"" the compliment for it to make an impact., Modeling positive behavior will help others realize how hard we are on each other and ourselves. You can be a good example of how a person can think positively about him- or herself and see his or her own value, so when you give a compliment the other person might believe you.


Eliminate “fat talk” and other negativity toward yourself and other people.Even if you are putting yourself down and not someone else or your friend, it can still have a negative influence.
This is particularly important around children and adolescents, who learn these behaviors from the adults in their lives., Part of helping build someone else’s self-esteem is to shine a light on the great things about her. Acknowledge that the other person may have room to grow in some areas of her life, but that she has other wonderful qualities., People get into the habit of refuting anything good other people say about them, but pointing it out in a kind way will help the person recognize his behavior so he can start to learn how to accept praise gracefully.Let him know that you wouldn’t have said anything if you didn’t believe it, and it hurts your feelings when he rejects or discounts your feelings toward him., Unfortunately, some people really don’t like themselves. This can stem from growing up in an unsupportive environment or other factors and can be very hard to overcome.


A person with low self-esteem may hate compliments because it contradicts her negative view of herself and she can’t believe it.She may worry that the compliment means you have high expectations that she can’t live up to, and that she is destined to disappoint you., Does the person come from a different country or culture than you do? That could have something to do with it.


Some cultures are averse to compliments because they feel it is like coddling and that you are treating them like a child.In some cultures, to accept a compliment is to place yourself above others, which is unacceptable., Have you noticed that many women have a hard time accepting a compliment? They will do anything to convince you that you’re wrong or to minimize their positive aspects.


Women are conditioned to deflect praise because they are taught to be humble, unlike men.Women are also taught not to make someone else feel bad in comparison, so they will deny praise so as not to hurt someone else’s feelings."

Boost your self-esteem.",How to Deal with Insincere Compliments2," As sad as it is to believe, some praisers are merely doing so to set you up for a request or favor in the future. They’ve played into the concept that “flattery will get you everywhere” and may be complimenting you to win approval or even forgiveness for some wrongdoing.If a person continually lays on the praise, be wary of any demands they may ask of you in the future. False flattery is actually a disguised form of emotional manipulation: the person is buttering you up to get their way. Distance yourself from the person, if possible. If not, avoid letting them get their way with you.

, Whether you’re delighted because you were recognized or secretly pissed because the person’s adoration is dishonest, take time to feel what you’re feeling. Don't ignore the way you are feeling, or this may begin to chip away at your self-esteem, especially if you do not do something to create boundaries with the person. Own your emotions, but don’t let them get to your head.An insincere compliment can bring up feelings of shame or self-doubt. Give yourself a time-out if needed to collect yourself. Take a few deep breaths to cool off. Remind yourself of your positive traits, or call up an authentic friend who will help you see the positives.

, If someone thought you’d fall prey to false flattery, they may see you as lacking self-esteem. They assumed that by merely throwing a disingenuous compliment your way, you’d give in to their demands or view them favorably. If you tend to rollover after false praise, you may need to work on your confidence.Boost your self-esteem by making the most of accomplishments and failures. Use accomplishments to help you acknowledge and affirm your abilities. Use failure to help you pinpoint weaknesses for future growth.
Stop comparing yourself to the people around you. This is a surefire way to make your confidence suffer. Know that you have something unique to offer the world that no one else can.Try something new. Developing and honing new skills can help you build self-efficacy and start to believe in your abilities. Go back to school and further your education. Or, ask your boss for some on-the-job training in a new area.
Try reading a confidence boosting audiobook if your self-esteem becomes a constant problem for you and you begin taking things too personally. One good option is The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem by Dr. Nathaniel Branden.

Determine if you were meant to hear the compliment.,
Check the content of the compliment.,
Reflect on your previous relationship with the person.",How to Deal with Insincere Compliments3," It may be wise to take a step back and truly assess the context of an accolade you are suspicious of. Did you overhear the compliment? If you did, it’s a chance the person was actually being genuine.


Think about it. There’s no reason for the person to use sarcasm or false flattery if you weren’t even meant to hear the remark. If you heard others exchanging nice words about you, consider that they were earnest.

, Most compliments that are disingenuous fall into a few categories. They are made in tones of mockery; they are over-the-top; they are inappropriate for the relationship; or they occur too frequently. If the praise you received meets any of these criteria, you may need to pay closer attention to this person., Consider whether the behavior is out of the norm for the person. If so, then they may have an agenda. You can sniff out an underlying agenda after receiving praise by determining what the other person could possibly have to gain. Think about your interactions with this person over the past several days or weeks. Study the person to determine what their motives might be. Has something occurred between you and this person that would warrant groveling, or worse envy?


False flattery is more likely to occur after a fall out when the person is seeking forgiveness, or when you are in a position of status and the person is hoping for a leg up.Similarly, insincere praise may also arise in the midst of competitive workplaces or after you have received recognition the other person was coveting.

Reflect on the person’s influence and impact.",How to Outline a Biography," Start by including key biographical details like the person’s full name and their birth date. You can also provide the person’s place of birth, especially if it will give readers context for the rest of the biography.For example, you may write, “RuPaul Andre Charles, born November 17, 1960 in San Diego, California.”;
, Include the names of the person’s parents, as well as any guardians or adoptive parents. Discuss any key biographical details of the person’s parents.

, Discuss where the person grew up. Mention any key moves to other cities or countries during the person’s childhood.For example, you may write, “RuPaul grew up in San Diego, California and moved to Atlanta, Georgia with his sister when he was 15.”

, Include details on the person’s education, such as where they went to grade school or high school. Mention any details about their schooling that reflect on their career or achievements later in life.For example, you may write, “At 15 years old, RuPaul attended a performing arts school in Atlanta. After he graduated, he focused on his budding stage career, opting not to attend college.”

, Discuss any details from their upbringing that reflect on their later life. Make sure you mention key moments in their family or social circle that seemed to impact their childhood and how they developed as a young person.


For example, you may write about the person’s experience with abuse at the hands of a parent. Or you may mention that the person struggled with a learning disability in middle school that would go undiagnosed until later in their life.

, The next section of the outline should focus on the person’s move from a teenager to a young adult. Mention if the person went to college or entered into higher education. Name the institution as well as the date the person attended school. Note if the person graduated with honors or distinction.For example, you may write, “Martha Graham went to Brown University from 1967-1981, majoring in dance.

, Include details about the person’s jobs and positions at companies or organizations. Note if the person was self-employed or unemployed for a period of time. Mention any professional relationships in the person’s career that seem important.For example, you may write, “Martha Graham worked as a bartender while at Brown to support herself.

, This is the section where you focus on awards, accomplishments, and moments of recognition in the person’s life. You may also want to include any significant failures or setbacks the person experienced.For example, you may write, “Martha Graham was rejected from several major dance companies and was unemployed for several years. In frustration, Graham decided to open her own dance company and studio, using funds from friends and colleagues. It later became the premier dance company in America.”

, If the person is still alive, include details on where they are at now. Mention any current projects or career high points. Note where the person now resides as well as any family they may have.

, If the person is no longer alive, make sure you mention their later life as well as the circumstances of their death. Include any key moments in their later life, such as awards, accomplishments, or setbacks.For example, you may write, “In her later life, Graham fell into a depression and battled alcohol addiction. She died in 1991 at the age of 96 from pneumonia. She was cremated and her ashes were scattered over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Northern New Mexico.”

, You should also include a section in the outline that explores the person’s impact in their field. Mention how they influenced others in their field, and continue to do so.


You can also include your own opinions about the person’s overall life. You may include a short section on the impact the person had, or continues to have, on you.
For example, you may write about how the person influenced a generation of artists or how the person impacted the way we view technology in the 21st century.

Understand where your difficulty is coming from.,
Understand the assignment.,
Find something that interests you within the assignment.,
Break the assignment down into smaller parts.,
Focus only on the step you're working on at the moment.,
Build in rewards and diversions as you work.",How to Make a Tedious Writing Assignment Fun," Many react to a difficult writing assignment by immediately thinking that they can't write and becoming intimidated. The problem may be more specific, such as a limited vocabulary or a poor understanding of the subject assigned. Once you understand what's causing your fears, you can address them by taking the appropriate steps to overcome them.;
, This means two things: The first is to know the subject you're writing about; you can learn this by researching in books, through interviews or on the Internet. The second is to know what specifically you're being asked to write about in relation to the subject. If you're assigned to write about Hamlet, you need to read the play. If you're writing about Hamlet's hesitancy in fulfilling his late father's call to be avenged, you need to focus on Hamlet's meeting his father's ghost, his soliloquy and his catching his uncle praying after seeing ""The Mousetrap.""

, If you're offered a selection of books to write about and one of them is one you've always wanted to read, choose that book. If you're asked to contrast Beowulf to a modern hero and you are fond of comic book superheroes, you can choose one of your favorite superheroes to compare with Beowulf.

, Looking at the whole assignment at once can be intimidating. Breaking it down into smaller parts, such as identifying the sub-topics, deciding what order to arrange them in, researching each sub-topic and then actually writing them helps make the assignment seem easier.

, Once you break the assignment into smaller parts, you need to focus on one step at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the number of steps. You can be aware of the next step or the one following while you concentrate on the step you're working on, however, so that if you get stuck, you can move onto the next step and then return to the previous step later.


You can also choose to switch back and forth between steps as you need to, devoting the hours of the day in which you write best to the actual writing of the assignment and the rest of the day to other parts of it.

, Just as everyone has a unique view on a writing assignment, so also everyone has his or her own way of working on it. If you feel you work better with background music, listen to music as you work, with headphones if you're in a place where the noise would disturb others. When you complete a step or section in your writing assignment, give yourself a small reward to celebrate that achievement, and give yourself a bigger reward when you finish the whole thing. Just be sure to work on it regularly from start to finish so that you don't stress yourself out by trying to write a large amount of text at the last minute.


Also plan on taking breaks from working on your assignment as you need them. Use the breaks to think about your writing assignment in a different way. If you're writing about Hamlet, imagine the duel with Laertes as it would play out as a fight scene on ""Batman"" or imagine the prince lamenting his troubles to a Simon and Garfunkel song. These kind of breaks let you get away from the stressful parts of the assignment while still keeping it in mind.

Consider Your Audience.,
Update your blog regularly.,
Recognize that making money blogging will take time.,
Prepare to spend significant time and effort on your blog.Maintaining a quality blog requires an investment of both time and significant mental energy.",How to Make Money Writing1," Rather than writing a personal blog, create and maintain a blog on a specific topic. Readers are more likely to return regularly to blogs that provide reliable content in a specific subject area.


Reflect upon your interests. Perhaps you are an enthusiastic gardener or a voracious reader of celebrity news. Targeting a blog to your interests will help keep you engaged as a writer, and your passion for the subject will likely translate into enjoyable content for your readers.
Focus upon an area of expertise. Maybe you work in computer programming, or have learned how to provide restricted-diet foods for your family. Use these skills as a foundation for developing a blog that will provide useful instruction for your readers.;
, Careful attention to blog maintenance and to providing fresh content will help you grow and maintain a steady audience.


Create a regular schedule to keep yourself on track. Perhaps you'll plan to post a set number of times per week, or designate different content for different days -- a recipe each Monday and Wednesday, for example, on a culinary blog, with plans to share shopping advice on Tuesdays and an amusing anecdote on Thursdays.
Learn how to schedule postings in advance. Popular blogging sites typically give you the option of drafting posts and then scheduling them for release at a future date and time. Doing so will enable you to keep your blog active even if you're out of town or otherwise occupied.

, While the process of setting up advertising links via ad players such as Google Ad Sense, Amazon Associates, or Pay-Per-Post is fairly straightforward, it may take several months before you start to receive ad revenue. Ads typically pay on a format of ""cost per thousand readers,"" or CPM, so drawing readers to your blog is very important.


Search for related blogs and post comments to draw readers to your site. Always remember to link your URL.Scan the Web for opportunities to participate in ""link ups"" hosted by prominent bloggers. Link ups offer you the chance to submit a blog post that will then be posted alongside other bloggers' posts in a collection of links.
Consider learning ""search engine optimization,"" or SEO. This is a technique for improving the rate at which search engines such as Google list your blog postings in their search results. A quick Web search will yield tools to help you learn how SEO works., Payoff, however, comes both in the form of ad revenue and in the community successful blogs can create.


The number of hours successful bloggers put in per week varies, but remember that in addition to writing content, you'll need to spend time on advertising, networking, bookkeeping, and efforts to maximize your social media and search results. Consider 20 hours per week a reasonable starting point in terms of time commitment, then evaluate your own work pace and habits once you're underway.Plan to spend at least an hour or two drafting and an extra hour editing each post. Always, always proofread before posting to ensure your content is tidy and easily read.

Observe your actions around your love interest.,
Tell your partner about your feelings.,
Give your partner time to reciprocate the feelings.,
Stay committed to the relationship.",How to Realize You Love Someone," The idea of “love at first sight” is not very common; usually, it takes a long time for feelings of love to grow. If you think that you might be experiencing feelings of love for your special someone, think about how long you have known him/her.


Are you in a relationship, or is it just someone you like from a distance?
If you are in a relationship, how long have you been dating?
How long have you known this person in general?;
, Many people report observing certain physical reactions in themselves when they think about their love interest. These signs are connected to certain centers in your brain that are connected with relationships.Dilated pupils
Accelerated heartbeat
Nervous feelings
Sweaty palms
Flushed cheeks

, There are many questions that you can ask yourself when you think about your special someone. Answering these questions will help you to identify whether you truly love this person or if you are simply experiencing feelings of infatuation or lust.


“How well do I know him/her?”
“What would my life be like without him/her?”
“Is my attraction purely physical/sexual, or am I attracted to his/her personality, too?”“When do I think about this person? All of the time? Only when I want him/her?”
“Do I think about my future including him/her? What does that future look like?”
“What do I value in a committed relationship? Does this person fulfill those needs?”
“Do I feel supported and encouraged by him/her?”
“What would I sacrifice in order to make my relationship with him/her work? Would I be willing to sacrifice anything at all?”
“Am I genuinely happy when I'm around this person?”
“How do I feel when he/she is not around? Do I miss him/her? How much?”
“Do I feel jealous or possessive about this person?”, It is sometimes easy to get caught up in feelings of lust or infatuation over a person. Take time to consider whether your feelings for your special someone are romantic and whether you are truly interested in this person.


Are you physically attracted to him/her?
Do you want to be in a committed relationship with this person, or is a friendship all you want?
Are you only interested in physical intimacy, or is that just a bonus to your great relationship?
Do you think about him/her frequently?
Do you get “butterflies in your stomach” when you think about this person?
Is this someone you can imagine introducing to your family and friends as your significant other?

, Pinpointing the qualities about this person that you like will help you to determine if what you are feeling is truly love or simply infatuation or lust. If you have more physical attributes on your list, there is a good chance that you are not actually in love with this person and instead are lusting after him/her.


Personality traits
Physical traits
Positive attributes—are they genuine?
Negative attributes—are they endearing? Annoying?

, When you think about this person, do you think of an “us” or “we” that implies that you think of the two of you as being connected?Can you see a future with this person one year down the road? Five years? Fifteen years?Do you find yourself making decisions based on what is best for both of you?
How important are his/her dreams and ambitions to you?
Are you willing to fully support this person through the obstacles of life?, Flaws are part of a person's personality just as much as the positive qualities. You need to consider whether you completely accept your love interest for who he/she is or whether you find yourself wishing some aspects were different.


Oftentimes, part of realizing that you love someone includes becoming aware that that person's flaws do not bother you. You accept him/her, flaws and all, and you are willing to work together to overcome those flaws.
Simultaneously, you find yourself becoming a better person because of your significant other. He/She is accepting of your flaws, but you find yourself trying to become better for the sake of the relationship., When two people are involved, it is impossible for only one person to always get his/her way.


Do you find yourself making decisions that benefit your partner more than you?
Do you make concessions or sacrifices in order to make both of you happy?
How much are you willing to sacrifice for the relationship?
Do you consider this person to be worthy of your sacrifices?
Are these sacrifices an inconvenience, or are you making them because you genuinely want to do so?

, People often treat their significant others differently from their friends and family. Make observations to yourself about how you behave around this person.


Do you find yourself giving this person special treatment?
What are your emotions like? Happier? More positive? Glum? Sad?
Do you treat your special someone with respect?
Are you giddy?
Do you find yourself touching him/her more, like holding hands or hugging?
Do you want everyone to know that you are in love with him/her?, Once you have reached the decision that you are in love with your special someone, express those feelings to him/her. This gives you the opportunity to make sure that you and your partner are on the same page and to advance your relationship.


“I've recently realized that I'm in love with you, and I want you to know.”
“I love you. There are so many qualities about you that I treasure, and I want you to know how much I care about you.”
“You are very special to me. I've been waiting for the right time to say it: I love you.”
“You mean the world to me. I realized recently that I think about us together, and I make decisions based on both of us. I love you.”

, Sometimes, the significant other is not ready to return those feelings when you express them. You have to decide if the relationship is headed in the direction you want or whether your partner will never feel that way about you.


Even if your partner is not ready to return the “I love you” statement, he/she will likely still be genuinely interested in you. If you truly do love this person, then you owe it to him/her to stick around in the relationship. There may be reasons why he/she is not ready yet, such as negative previous relationships or being new to dating.
On the other hand, if you come to the realization that your significant other just does not feel the same way, then it would be best to end the relationship before experiencing any further heartbreak.

, Once you have expressed your feelings, it should be easy for you to remain committed to the relationship. Make sure that you continue to put forth effort in maintaining the relationship and showing your love.

Tap online resources to find writing opportunities.,
Network online and in person.,
Study your target before making a pitch.,
Make the first move.",How to Make Money Writing2," Web-based publications, print publications that post additional content online, and businesses all need freelance writers to provide quality material for their sites. Search for resource sites that offer free access to listings of online writing opportunities. You may also consider investing in subscriptions to more specialized job-listing sites.


Avoid listings that don't mention pay, or that ask writers to submit new work on speculation in order to be considered -- after all, your time has worth.
Exercise care regarding offers to blog purely for exposure or that involve payment in exchange for Web traffic (for example, $1 per 1,000 page-views). You aren't likely to make much from such jobs.
Take the entire context of a job opportunity into consideration. You may be willing to write for less, for example, if you are just starting out or if a job takes minimal time and effort. The predictability of establishing an ongoing relationship (a weekly guest post, for example) may merit accepting a slightly lower pay rate, or you might value the opportunity to retain the rights to your material after it is posted.

, Read the forums of writer networking groups to gain knowledge and insight. You'll learn where to look for work -- and what opportunities to avoid. Attending industry events can yield valuable opportunities and help you gain exposure.


Start your perusal of online forums with a general site such as the American Society of Journalists and Authors.You can then move on to genre-specific sites for information specific to your writing interests.
Research writer's organizations in your field of interest to see whether and when they host conferences. Groups ranging from the Society of American Travel Writers to the American Medical Writers Association (and many organizations based in other countries or world regions) host regular gatherings.

, If you're interested in writing for a particular site, examine which areas of the site are updated most frequently. Is there a blog? Does it feature regular content from outside contributors? Understanding where opportunities lie will help you target your approach.

, Send a letter of introduction, or, better yet, a query outlining a specific pitch. Emphasize your Web writing experience, if you have it, and include any personal referrals you can muster. If you're short on experience but do maintain a blog or Web site, include a link.

Search online for ""paying greeting card markets."",
Request companies' guidelines before submitting your material.,
Pay attention to voice.,
Aim for ""rack impact.""",How to Make Money Writing3," While card manufacturers of all sizes accept freelance work, consider starting with smaller companies where competition may be less fierce.Consider what types of card-writing interest you. Perhaps you enjoy developing funny quips, for example, or consider yourself gifted at composing meaningful poetry. Understanding your own talents will help you target card companies that produce relevant card collections.

, Ensure that you're targeting your material to the company's needs. One manufacturer may be in particular need of rhymed poetry for sentimental cards, for example, while another might have a word limit for humorous text.


Study retail card displays. Reflect upon what types of material work well. Pay specific attention to the styles of cards each manufacturer provides so you can target your material most effectively.

, The greeting card format is more directly personal than most other forms of writing. Even a blog that you write with a confidential ""me-to-you"" voice actually reaches a host of readers; greeting cards, by contrast, are explicitly sent from one individual to another.


Composing greeting card text provides a great opportunity to practice ""writing tight."" Carefully consider each word to ensure your verse or quip packs maximum impact from minimum length.

, Greeting cards on a rack have an average of 1.5 seconds in which to catch a consumer's eye. Cards with strong ""rack impact"" will stand out to consumers. Ensure your text will attract potential buyers quickly.Remember that the cover of a card is what consumers see when they're scanning a rack or display. A high-impact beginning will ensure that potential buyers pick up the card and open it to view your amusing punchline or heartfelt verse.

Research self-publishing options.,
Pay careful attention to pricing structure.,
Market your book.",How to Make Money Writing4," While Amazon is the best-known avenue for self-publishing books, a variety of companies offer these services. Careful research will help you determine which self-publication service is right for you.


Consult publications and Web sites such as Writer's Digest or the Self-Published Author to gather general information about self-publishing.Genre-specific writer's organizations may also offer resources for authors seeking to self-publish.

, Different self-publishing services offer different pricing structures. If you plan to offer your work on a variety of platforms, study each platform and be prepared to vary your strategy. With some platforms, the percentage of royalties you receive will vary depending upon the price of your book, while others use blanket royalty rates., Self-publishing offers the advantage of bypassing the gatekeepers of traditional publishing houses, but now you'll need to be your own marketing department. Nineteen percent of self-publishers earned no money from their work in 2013, and while poor quality work may account for part of this problem, poor marketing is just as likely to sink your chances of earning money from your work.


Maintain an author Web site with a blog and up-to-date news of your publications. Visit --and comment -- on blogs focused upon topics congenial to your work. Be sure to post a link back to your site.
Compose a press release announcing your publication and send it off to Web sites, blogs, and publications in your field. If your book is a Christian romance novel, for example, consider sending it to Christian women's magazines and to prominent Christian women's bloggers.
Make use of social media to generate buzz about your work. Start author pages on Facebook and Twitter, and post regularly. Seek out fellow authors and consider establishing networks to share and re-post news of your work.
New work may be your best marketing tool. Generating a steady stream of quality publications will help you make a name for yourself in the self-publishing market. Consider complementing full-length work with novellas or shorter volumes published in formats such as Amazon's ""Kindle Singles."""

Find something you genuinely like about the person.,
Compliment someone’s point of pride.,
Say something that isn’t obvious.,
Don’t compliment everyone the same exact way.,
Focus on achievements more than physical traits.,
Compliment generously, but not excessively.,
Express your compliment warmly.,
Smile, but don’t laugh.,
Make eye contact.,
Watch your tone of voice.,
Avoid backhanded compliments.,
Don’t mistake a cat call for a compliment.,
Avoid demeaning comments.",How to Give a Compliment," It’s easy enough to pick the first thing you notice about someone and compliment it. You could say “I like your shirt” or “Nice hair” to just about anyone, but a good compliment goes deeper. Take a moment and think about what you really admire about the person before you say anything. Your compliment will be appreciated if it’s clear you really mean what you say.


On the other hand, never give someone a false compliment. For example, if your friend walks in wearing a new pair of boots you think are tacky, don’t compliment them. Maybe she’ll believe you, maybe she won’t, but if you make a habit of giving compliments you don’t really mean, you won’t come off as sincere, and eventually your words will mean less to people.

, A compliment will feel more special when it’s clear you’ve noticed something that really matters to the person you’re talking to. For example, if your mother-in-law spends a lot of time cultivating her beautiful flower garden, you could compliment her on her excellent eye for color. Complimenting someone on what they’re really good at is a sure way to bring a smile to his or her face every time.

, Another good tactic when it comes to giving genuine compliments is to pick out something that most people wouldn’t notice, something that shows you’re really paying attention to the person. Non-obvious compliments are the kind that people remember and cherish for the rest of their lives.


For example, you could tell your little sister that you noticed how hard she worked in her art class this semester, and you think she’s got a talent for photography.
Or you could tell a guy you’ve got a crush on that you admire the kindness he shows everyone he talks to, even little kids. Maybe he’s used to getting compliments on his muscular physique, so your compliment will really stand out.

, If you tell most people you see “I like your outfit” or something similar, the end result will be that the people you compliment won’t feel very special. Complimenting people on their specific positive attributes goes a lot further. If you find yourself giving the same shallow compliments a lot, pause and think a little longer before speaking next time. Come up with something genuine to say, or don’t say anything at all.

, It’s always nice to get a compliment like “You’re so pretty” or “I like your shoes,” but the best compliments are those that point out someone’s awesome achievements or personal qualities. Complimenting people on something they’ve worked on means more than complimenting the person on something they have nothing to do with, like the color of their eyes.


If you’re looking for a nice compliment to give to the girl you have a crush on, she’ll probably respond better to “I think your English essay was brilliant” than to “Your lips are sexy” or “you have a really nice chin.”

, There’s a limit to how many compliments a person wants to hear. Showering someone with compliments will make each individual compliment seem to mean a little less. If you compliment a little more sparingly, your words will resonate more.


Spread your compliments out among more than one person, too. If you compliment the same person all the time, he or she might feel like you’re getting a little obsessed.
Compliment only when something really strikes you as worth bringing up. Don’t compliment just for the sake of saying something or trying to look like you’re a nice person. It’s not about looking good, but about making someone else feel special.

, Delivery is everything when it comes to complimenting someone. There’s no one perfect way to deliver a compliment. The important thing is to sound like you really mean what you say, so that your compliment isn’t taken the wrong way. Since there’s a certain brand of meanness that involves tossing out fake compliments, you want to make sure the person you’re complimenting knows you’re being serious.


Make sure the person can hear you clearly, so it doesn’t sound like you’re saying something under your breath.
Read the situation and don’t compliment someone if it could be construed as insincere. For example, if your new classmate walks in wearing a skirt with lots of wild colors, and everyone’s looking, you might not want to draw attention to her in front of people who may not like the skirt as much as you.

, It’s always a nice idea to give a compliment with a smile, though you can also deliver it with a serious and sincere expression. However, if you laugh while you’re complimenting someone, he or she might not know whether you’re serious. You might appear to be joking, which can ruin the whole effect. Try not to laugh while you’re complimenting someone unless the quality you appreciate has something to do with the person’s humor.

, It’s an easy way to show that you mean what you say. Making eye contact is a form of nonverbal communication that helps people understand each other better. If you look down or look away, you’ll appear to be less sincere than if you make eye contact while you’re talking.

, Do your best to say it like you mean it, and not in a weird tone that could be taken the wrong way. The best compliments leave no room for misunderstandings. The recipient knows that you mean what you say, and he or she comes away from the conversation feeling good about it. It sounds pretty simple, but it’s common for compliments to carry hidden meanings. For example,


If you sound a little sarcastic, the person might think you’re making fun of him or her.
It’s also possible to come off sounding jealous of the person you’re complimenting. Make sure you don’t seem angry or envious.

, This might be the worst type of “compliment” there is. A backhanded compliment is one that sounds really nice at first, but then the real meaning of the statement hits. It’s a passive-aggressive way to really hurt a person’s feelings. It’s possible to deliver a backhanded compliment without even knowing you’re doing it.


For example, you might say something like, “Wow, I really like your hair today. What’s different?” By saying this, you’re implying that you don’t like the person’s hair very much on other days.
Or you might say, “You’re amazing at baseball, for a girl.” Attaching a qualifier to the end of your compliment turns it into an insult.

, Yelling a “compliment” at someone walking down the street is actually highly insulting. The point of a compliment is to make someone feel good, and yelling about someone’s physical features is likely to do just the opposite.


Even if some people say they like being cat called, not everyone does — not by a long shot. If you really want to make someone feel good, even a stranger, don’t yell something in passing. The same rules apply to giving compliments to a stranger and giving compliments to someone you know: you need to find something sincere to say and deliver your compliment respectfully.

, You probably already know what these are, and you’d probably never say them to someone. Even if you have a huge crush on someone and you want to ask her out — actually, especially if you want to ask someone out — don’t try to compliment someone on a sexual body part. It’s just rude, and in certain settings this type of comment can be construed as sexual harassment. Keep your compliments polite!

You can always ask your boyfriend ahead of time if he has condoms. This can save you some time and space in your suitcase.

, If you like to smell nice, a small bottle of lotion or perfume can be a good addition to your suitcase.

Cut out distractions.",How to Make a Writing Nook," If you live with other people, find a spot where they won’t distract you, such as your bedroom or a large closet. If there’s nowhere you can go and close the door, clear out a corner of a room and put up a room divider. Folding screens or curtains can visually separate a space and make it feel like you have some privacy.Try rearranging furniture to create this separate space. Push a large bookcase out from the wall to create a private space behind it.
If you’re really short on space, try lofting your bed and using the space underneath for your writing nook.;
, If you use a tablet or laptop computer, long writing sessions may lead you to run out of battery. It's better to stay plugged in while you work rather than risk your device dying while you're in the middle of something. And you may decide later that you want to plug in a lamp there too.

, Artificial light increases stress levels, while natural light increases creativity and is better for your eyes.Create your nook as close as possible to a window or glass door. Or add some mirrors to the room to amplify the amount of natural light coming through the window., Consider how much space you'll need for your materials. If you like to look at several pieces of paper or books at once, find a desk with larger surface area. Decide if you prefer to sit or stand while writing. Some people are more productive on their feet, so seek out a standing desk if you don't want to sit.If you like to switch between sitting and standing, there are desks that move up and down to convert between the two positions.

, Desks aren’t always available or even practical depending on the location of your nook. Try using an upside-down milk crate or wooden box to make a small work surface on the floor. If you prefer to stand, try attaching a sturdy shelf to the wall or using the top of a small bookcase.


If you’re more comfortable using a laptop or notebook on your lap, consider investing in a lap desk, or just prop your materials up on a throw pillow.

, If you’ll be sitting, decide if you’ll do better in a regular chair with a structured back or a soft cushion or pillow on the floor. Choosing cushions may open up more options for where to make your nook, like on the floor of a closet. But be aware that spending extended periods of time on a soft cushion could lead to back pain., Avoid overhead lighting, since it can strain your eyes and make you feel more tired.Swap out lightbulbs that give off yellow light for those that create white light.


Look for lightbulbs that are specifically called “daylight” bulbs and can mimic natural light., Blue tones promote creativity, green tones make you calmer, and yellows lift your spirits. Figure out what mood you want to create while writing and decorate accordingly. Avoid decorating your writing nook with red, since it's more of a physical stimulant than a mental one (i.e. it may make you want to get up and move around rather than sit and write).If you can’t paint the entire room a new color, try just painting your desk or work surface. Or buy special wallpaper or decals that don’t damage the wall when removed.
Select throw pillows, blankets, or posters in your preferred colors.

, If you’re writing by hand, keep a cup or small bin with plenty of extra pens or pencils nearby. Be sure a few extra notebooks or stacks of loose paper are within reach as well. If you’re writing on a computer, it’s helpful to keep a pad of sticky notes on your desk as well. That way you can quickly jot down ideas to come back to later (and they add a bit of bright color to your space)., Figure out what really makes you want to write. If other writers inspire you, print out quotes from famous authors and either frame them or just tape them to the wall.Try stacking books nearby to create a literary atmosphere. Or find paintings or photographs that remind you of the topic you’re writing about.

, Leave your phone somewhere else so that you’re not tempted to text or check email while you’re writing. Turn off any electronics, like the TV or radio, unless music makes you more productive.


If you live with other people, ask them to keep their noise levels down while you’re writing. If that’s not an option, use earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones to block out any unwanted noise.

End on a high note.",How to Pull a One Night Stand With Women," One timeless strategy for finding a partner for a one-time fling is to search the nightlife. Visit your favorite bar, nightclub or lounge and post up for a while. Take note of the women around you and see who is alone and looks like they might be seeking company. When you find a girl you’re attracted to, strike up a conversation and offer to buy her a drink.Don’t harass a woman if she doesn’t want to be bothered or proposition her for sex right off the bat.;
, In the 21st century, having a one night stand is often as easy as getting on your phone. Download a dating or hookup app designed to bring interested parties together and begin playing the field digitally. You’ll be able to tell prospective partners a little about yourself and find out a little about them. If you match with someone who catches your eye, you can begin discussing the possibility of taking things to a physical level.People often find it easier to cut to the chase when negotiating a one night stand through technology rather than in person.
Certain apps, like Tinder and Down, were designed purely to match up people looking for sex. These will be your best bet. The women on apps such as Bumble, OkCupid and eHarmony are most likely looking for something long-term.

, Find a social gathering hosted by someone you know and go where the action is. There will always be lots of eligible men and women at mixers, and you might even be able to get a mutual friend to make an introduction for you. Spend a little time flirting with different women and get a sense of which ones might be open to a carefree sexual encounter.Know the limits of decency. If she’s had too much to drink, her judgment may be impaired.Make sure the girl you’re talking to isn’t there with someone else before you try to pick her up.

, Ask a close friend to play matchmaker. They may have other friends in their circle of acquaintances who are in a similar position and wouldn’t mind getting fixed up by someone they trust. Your friend will also be able to put in a good word on your behalf and vouch for the character of the girl you’re meeting, so the two of you won’t have to worry about what kind of person the other is.Ideally, this will be someone you don’t know that your friend isn’t too close with. It’s generally a bad idea to sleep with someone if it may have a negative impact on your friendships.

, Since one night stands are almost exclusively physical in nature, you’ll want to make yourself as alluring as possible. Shower and groom yourself meticulously. Pick out a clean, good looking outfit that accentuates your best features. Spritz on a little fragrance. Above all, project confidence. The more assured you appear, the more desirable you’ll be.Devote a little extra time to cleaning up your intimate areas if you think sex might be on the table., When you find a suitable partner, make an effort to learn her name and find out a bit about her. This will give you just enough insight into who you’re with to make your temporary connection memorable. Put her at ease by treating her like a person with a mind of her own, not just a sexual object. It’s one thing to have a fun fling, but no one wants to feel like they’re being used.Don’t rush things. It only makes you look desperate. No one wants to get together with someone who’s just looking for an easy score.
Pay attention to see if she's returning your interest. Coy eye contact, smiling, raised eyebrows and a willingness to flirt in an overtly sexual manner are all good signs. If she purses or licks her lips, touches her hair or body suggestively or emphasizes her erogenous parts to make sure you notice them, it's almost certainly a sure bet.There’s no time limit for setting up a one night stand. Spend as long as you want getting to know your prospective partner. Make conversation, take her out to dinner, go for drinks. Ideally, you should both be excited by everything that comes before sex, too., As soon as the possibility of physical intimacy gets brought up, be direct with her about your desires. Don’t lie to her, misrepresent your feelings or string her along in order to get what you want. A one night stand should be a consensual experience for both people. You’re both mature, responsible adults and are capable of deciding whether you can live with a one-off hookup.When it comes time to make your move, do it in a way that isn’t forceful. Say something like “I think you’re really attractive and I’d like to make you feel good for a night, if you’re interested.”
If she’s hopeful about seeing you again in the future, she might feel pressured to do something she otherwise wouldn’t do.

, Always come prepared. If you’re a guy, stash a couple condoms in your wallet so you won’t be caught without a contraceptive. If you’re a girl, think about whether you’d feel comfortable bringing a dental dam along. It’s also best to be upfront about any sexually transmittable infections either of you may have to avoid any unpleasant surprises later.It’s always better to have protection ready than to deal with unplanned consequences later on.
Never withhold knowledge of an STD or illness. Your partner’s health matters., Since you've never been together before, you should be open to communicating with one another about your individual desires, hangups and level of comfort. Find out whether a given technique, position or behavior is okay with her before trying or asking for it. Respect her boundaries and be careful about making her feel pressured or judged, and be clear about what is and isn't alright for you in return. As long as you're on the same page, a night of casual intimacy can be a lot of fun for both of you.A one night stand can be a great place to act out your most torrid fantasies without worrying about making things weird, but everyone has their limits. Remember that the two of you are essentially working together to satisfy each other, and, unless it's explicitly agreed upon beforehand, no one person should be in complete control.You should have your partner's consent every step of the way. Whether the pressure comes before or after you're in bed together, it's still wrong.

, Once the deed is done, get comfy and plan to stay a while. There is a certain level of respect that should go along with sex, and unless she indicates otherwise, it would be inconsiderate to sneak out or make excuses for why you have to leave. Relax and take pleasure in each other’s company for the night, then go your separate ways when the sun rises.Leaving immediately after you’re finished sends the message that you don’t even want to be around her, which can easily ruin the experience for her.Remember, you’re with another human being, and they have feelings that can be hurt.

, Resist the pressure to do a lot of cuddling or kissing after sex, and don’t start telling her how much you like her. There may be an expectation to bring emotions into the mix. However, this will only complicate things for both of you. Be nice and act friendly towards her, but don’t make promises you don’t intend to keep. If you’ve been honest about what you’re after, there should be no reason to make your time together seem like anything more than what it is.Never say “I’ll call/text” you if you have no plan to.

, The two of you should be clear on what level of communication is appropriate before you part ways. It may be that you’re both content with the fun you’ve had and don’t feel the need to see or talk to each other again. Or, you might like the idea of becoming casual friends and sending each other a text once in awhile. Restate the fact that you both agreed it should be a one-time thing.Keep things light. You don’t have to send each other a friend request on Facebook or schedule another time to get together just because you kept each other company for a night.
Sometimes feelings can develop unexpectedly. If that’s not what you want, say so. Remind her of your original arrangement. Be firm (but not rude) if you have to.

, Rather than walking off with your clothes in your hand and your head hung in shame, be appreciative of the time you shared. Thank her for showing you a good time and let her know that you enjoyed getting to know her a little. Sex should be a pleasurable interaction with no regrets. There’s no point in having a one night stand if it leaves you feeling disgraced.Reassure her that you’ll be discreet about the details of your encounter.
If you do things the right way, having a one night stand can exhilarate and satisfy both individuals without causing any awkward fallout.

Search online resources to find opportunities.,
Advertise your services.,
Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each ghostwriting opportunity.",How to Make Money Writing5," In addition to freelancing resource sites, consider searching advertising sites such as Craigslist where individuals outside the field of publishing may be seeking writing assistance.


Ensure you understand your client's expectations before taking on a project -- and verify they understand that you are a writer and not a literary agent. You might be able to offer advice to your client, but you won't be formally ""representing"" their publishing needs.
Always sign a written agreement with your client before undertaking a ghostwriting project. At minimum, this contract should itemize the work you'll be doing, how much you'll be paid, when you'll be paid, your deadline, and who will retain copyright (usually this will be your client). It's a good idea to seek legal assistance in composing or evaluating a contract.

, Make you have an author's Web site and/or blog, and specify on your site that you are interested in ghostwriting. Mention your ghostwriting services in your email signature, and let editors, story sources, and colleagues know you're ghostwriting.Experience helps, but promote what you have. Seek ghostwriting opportunities in fields where you bring special skills. A background working in the computing field, for example, may make you an attractive ghostwriter for someone seeking a writer conversant with technological jargon.

, Ghostwriting generally means you will not receive personal credit for your work. You do, however, gain multiple advantages. First, ghostwriters are not responsible for publicizing their work -- simply fulfill the terms of your writing contract and you're done. Second, you will spend less time on research and preparation, as your client is generally responsible for providing background material, or at minimum pointing you in the right direction. In addition, you may enjoy the opportunity work as part of a team in what is often a very solitary profession.A typical ghostwriting contract is paid entirely in advance. If a publication is likely to generate substantial sales, however, you may consider accepting a smaller advance and a cut of the profits.
In cases where your name appears on a title as co-author or editor, you may determine that the prestige of the association merits accepting a lower fee, perhaps in combination with a percentage of the book's royalties."

Keep your distance from the person.,
Establish clear boundaries for yourself when you are around the person.,
Do not accept romantic gestures or gifts from the person.",How to Not Fall in Love With Someone1," One way to avoid letting your feelings get the best of you is to maintain a safe distance from the person as much as possible. This may mean staying away from the person in social situations, such as gatherings with friends or coworkers. Or you may avoid the person when you are sharing the same space, such as at school or at work. Keep your distance from the person so you are not tempted to interact with them, as this can lead to a deepen of your feelings for them.For example, you may try to avoid going to the same meetings or gatherings as the person, especially if you know they are going to be there. You may plan to just miss seeing the person so you do not have to be in close proximity to them.
You may also avoid adding the person on social media so you are not tempted to look at their profile or their activity. This way, you cannot get sucked into looking at the person’s activity on sites like Facebook, Instagram, or Tumblr.;
, If you do end up having to be around the person, you should set up clear boundaries so you do not let your emotions take over. Perhaps you avoid touching, hugging, or sitting close to the person when they are near you. You may stand at a fair distance from them with closed body language so you do not appear friendly or welcoming to the person. This can signal to them that you are not interested in them romantically.For example, you may maintain closed body language around the person by keeping your arms crossed over your chest and by avoiding eye contact with the person when you speak to them.

, The person may end up giving you gifts to show their affection for you or they may make kind gestures towards you. Avoid accepting or encouraging this behavior. Accepting gifts or kind gestures from the person can encourage them to pursue you, which you may not want if you are trying to avoid them.


For example, you may politely say, “No thank you” and decline a gift they try to give you. Or you may say, “No, I can do it myself” or “No, I’ll take care of it” if they try to do something nice for you.

Cry, and cry a lot.,
Think about all the bad things associated with the person you loved.,
Imagine some of the negative consequences of your interaction with this person.",How to Move on from Someone Who Doesn't Like You1," Crying will get out all of your emotions instead of keeping them bottled up inside. This is called ""catharsis."" Research shows that crying is a stress reliever and it actually makes you healthier.Think about it. Let's say you're filling water up in a bathtub and your phone rings. You figure ""it's taking forever to fill up, I'll just go talk to so and so for a moment and come right back."" You talk on the phone for 10 minutes, forgetting all about the water you left running in the bathroom. By the time you're done on the phone and you enter the restroom, water has seeped everywhere and onto the floor. You run to turn it off, but by that time it's too late. That's what it is like if you don't cry. You will eventually explode and overflow with emotions.
The best thing to do is get it all out. Don't be afraid of crying. If you feel more comfortable doing it in private, ask to be excused for a moment to use the restroom or go to your room. Find a good place for crying. Depending on how emotionally attached you were to this person, you'll probably be going to this special place specifically for crying a lot.;
, You might think this person has no flaws and they're perfect, but that's probably not true. The old saying really is true: nobody's perfect. Try to make a list of everything you disliked about them and their flaws. The more you find about the person that you didn't like, the easier it will be to convince your heart that they were the wrong person for you.


Maybe they were rude to your best friend or they had horrible friends. Maybe they constantly put you down, damaging your self-esteem. Maybe they had a problem being honest, saying they'd do things and then never follow through. Whatever it is, write it down and when you start feeling those old feelings creeping back, read the list.
Also, try to think about any negative feelings you had while interacting him/her. Negative feelings are different from bad qualities: they're how s/he made you feel, not what s/he did. Did you feel like your family friendships were compromised because your parents thought that person was wrong for you? Did that make you feel less secure in your judgments? Does that person bring you down a lot? These are only some of the things you can consider.

, Maybe there weren't very many negative consequences that happened as a result of your relationship. But there's a good chance that you can probably think of some if you try:


Did s/he cause an unhealthy fixation on the past?
Did s/he manipulate you to get what they wanted?
Did s/he keep you from realizing your own dreams in favor of theirs?
Did s/he cause you to believe that you should only been spending time with them, and not with other friends or family?
Did s/he cause you to learn bad stress management or conflict resolution skills by constantly fighting or playing games with you?

If the date seems like it was a disaster, don't think about what went wrong.",How to Not Embarrass a Prom Date," It doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl, we live in the 21st century.


Ask them yourself. Confidence is attractive. It also suggests to them that you're genuinely interested in him or her and not just anyone who might be your date, increasing your chances of having them agree to go with you.
Have a Plan B. Just because the one you fancy isn't up for it. it doesn't mean that you can't have a date. Figure out if someone is available by having a quick chat with them about the prom (e.g. Are you looking forward to it?, I'd say it will be a brilliant night, So whose the lucky guy/girl?). If they mention they haven't got a date, say that you don't either and ask if they fancy going along with you (be casual but not dismissive).

The great benefit of this tactic is that you can suss out if they are good company. If you don't enjoy chatting to them for five minutes, do you really want to have them hanging around you all night?


Figure out how you'd deal with no. A smile, feigned devastation or a simple ""Lucky guy"", ""I'm not surprised you're in demand, you're gorgeous"" or a ""I'll see you there, maybe we can dance at some point?"" reduces the awkwardness of the situation- and vastly increases your chances of getting a date with them another time.
If they say no, go to the prom anyway. Life's too short to skip out on something like this.;
, If your date shows signs of displeasure during your date, ask yourself what you could be doing wrong.


Are you talking about yourself a lot? Unless the person asked you a question, you may come across as self-centered and conceited.
Are you teasing? Some people don't understand that teasing is just a way of playfully showing affection. Give the person a compliment instead! Whatever you're doing, show them that you realize what's wrong.

,


If you are the guy and it is your prom or her prom, pick her up at her home at an agreed time. The guys usually give her mother a box of chocolates and get a corsage or bunch of flowers for their date. Be charming towards her family, reassure her father that you'll take care of her and grin and bear any photographs. You should organise a lift for you both to the meeting place for your prom group.
If you are the girl and it is his prom but not yours, you might wish to meet him at the general meeting point for the prom group. Check with him beforehand.

, You can be guaranteed that there will be loads of pictures taken, formal and informal. Whilst a stick in the mud is no fun, neither is someone who pulls faces in every and any formal snap.

Spend a few minutes in front of the mirror figuring out how to arrange your fabulous features in a smile for the picture. A proud mammy will hang the picture on the wall for years, and then let loose and find some fun poses for the crazy pictures you'll take with your friend later in the night.







, In many areas, corsages and buttonhole posies are par for the course. If this is the case, take the time to choose an arrangement that will compliment your outfits.

, Who wants to show up at prom with someone who hasn't taken a shower in five days? Shower. Dress nicely. Do your hair, makeup (if you're a girl), and a little deodorant never hurts anyone.

, If the prom includes some food or even a sit down meal, make sure you know how to handle various knives and forks and how to eat various dishes. Basic things like not talking with your mouth full, eating small bite-sized chunks at a time and not slurping can make or break the date.

, If there is a drink going around, avoid it altogether or only take as much as you can handle. Nobody's dream of the perfect prom includes a date making ridiculous comments, being aggressive or vomiting across their tux or dress.


If you plan on drinking to excess, tell your date beforehand. Depending on the local underage culture, they might not be bothered or split off with sober friends at some point in the evening. Some however may ask you to refrain from making a fool of yourself or may not want to go to the prom with you in such circumstances. Attitudes towards alcohol often have personal roots so respect their privacy and agree on a solution that will ensure that you both have a good night.
If you suspect that you may not in a position at the end of the night to make sure your date gets home safely, arrange a lift for them beforehand with a friend or taxi company.

, You're at the prom, and a slow song comes on. Your date has been waiting all night to dance with you. And do you know how to dance? No! Just be prepared for any kind of dancing, but if you don't care and neither does your date, go crazy.

, Think about what went right, or what could've gone wrong and didn't. Just don't dwell.

Pick the girl you would like to talk to.,
Approach the girl in a non-creepy manner.,
Talk to her.,
Relax and enjoy her company.You have gone through a lot of effort to pick up this lady.,
If at first you don’t succeed, try again.If you get flustered with one girl, evaluate the situation.",How to Pick up Girls Without Them Thinking You're Stupid," This is probably one of, if not the most, important steps in the process. If you have had girls think you are stupid in the past, it may have been because you were picking the wrong girls. Chose a girl who is around or below your intelligence level. If you are a barely passing classing or understanding what is going on in the workplace, pick someone who is in the same boat. If you pick the genius in the class, it is very possible she could think you are stupid.;
, If you are at the club and you eye a fine-looking lady, go up to here and say, “Hello, my name is _____. I noticed you because of ______. What’s your name?” Say this in a confident voice while maintaining eye contact. Do not try to use a pick-up line, grab her, get too close to her, or stare at her assets.If she is rude to you, simply say, “Alright mam, I just wanted to introduce myself. Have a nice night.” Do not act rude towards her. If she is responds positively, you can ask her to dance or if you can buy her a drink.If you in a work school environment, you can walk up to her when she is not busy and say essentially the same thing as above. If you are in a school environment, talk to her at the very end or beginning of class, or in the hall. Do not try to talk to her in the middle of a meeting or class “Hello. My name is ______. I work over in ______. I’ve seen you around and was wondering if you wanted to grab lunch together sometime. ” If you are embarrassed about where you work, then you don’t have to tell her that. If she is rude or seems offended, it may be best to apologize. “Well that’s okay; I hope you have a great day anyway.” Do not act rude towards her. If she responds positively, have a place for lunch already in mind. It makes you seem prepared. If she says she has been to that place recently ask if she would like to go somewhere else.

, You can make a positive remark about her name or one of her features. Do not ramble about an ex-girlfriend, dog, sister you had with that name. Do not comment on any features covered by clothing. Then you can ask her about her day, her interests/hobbies, and other things. If she brings up a subject that you are absolutely clueless about, tell her that. It doesn’t make you look stupid. If you know nothing about a subject and try to lie your way through the conversation, you will look much more incompetent. Talk about things that you have a great interest in or a lot of knowledge about. Since these are things you are already confident in, that will shine through.

, Be kind to her. Don’t try to make fun of her unless you already know her very well. Have a good time. Relax and tell appropriate information about yourself. If she shares something silly, you can as well, but try to keep the same level of appropriateness of the girl you picked up.

, What happened that made you trip up on your words? What did you say that made her think you are not intelligent? What made you tell that embarrassing story about your Uncle John? Prepare for the next time you wish to pick up a girl by having “stock stories” to tell to fill the awkward silence. Make sure that these are appropriate and show off positive elements of yourself.

Go over the agreement with your spouse.,
Decide whether you want to revise or terminate the prenuptial agreement.,
Check your state law.,
Consider hiring an attorney.,
Search for forms or templates.,
Draft the initial recitals.,
Write out the agreed modifications.,
Close the agreement.,
Read over the final agreement.,
Sign the agreement.,
Make copies for your records.",How to Modify a Prenuptial Agreement," Review each provision in your prenuptial agreement to decide which provisions you and your spouse want to modify.A prenuptial or postnuptial agreement is only valid after full disclosure from both you and your spouse regarding your income, assets, debts, and liabilities.
If any of this information has changed since you signed the prenup, share it openly. Don't assume that your spouse knows.;
, If you intend to change a significant portion of the prenuptial agreement, it may make more sense to terminate it and start from scratch.Keep in mind that if you revoke your prenuptial agreement, property division will follow the state laws governing marital property in the event you and your spouse separate or end the marriage.
While a contract between spouses after a marriage that revokes a prenuptial agreement generally is considered valid, a postnuptial agreement that modifies the prenup will be evaluated more closely by judges.
If you decide to modify your prenuptial agreement, any provisions of the prenup not addressed in the written postnuptial agreement will still be in effect to the same extent.

, Although all states allow you to revoke a prenuptial agreement, some do not allow you to modify the agreement after marriage, and a postnuptial agreement will have limited or no effect.Some states don't officially recognize the legal validity of postnuptial agreements. In these states, you can only terminate your prenup but you may not be able to create another agreement.
For example, Ohio has a statute that explicitly prohibits postnuptial agreements.In states that don't recognize postnuptial agreements, spouses may only make agreements that alter their legal relationship regarding property ownership in the context of a legal separation.
Even in states that do recognize postnuptial agreements, judges evaluate these agreements more strictly because under the law spouses have a greater duty to each other after they are married than they did before., Particularly if an attorney drafted the original prenuptial agreement, you probably want an attorney to draft your agreement modifying it.You can't have one attorney who advises both you and your spouse. Separate interests are at stake, so each of you must have your own attorney.
If your spouse has hired an attorney to draft the agreement, you should hire an attorney to review the agreement for you and advise you of your interests in signing it.
If you're concerned about the expense of hiring two attorneys, you may want to consider creating your agreement through mediation, which can be less costly.Working with a mediator allows you and your spouse to create the provisions of the agreement yourself, ensuring that they say what you want and you understand them.

, You may be able to find samples online that you can use as guides to create your postnuptial agreement.Keep in mind that any sample you find online isn't drafted by an attorney, and may not meet the legal requirements for your state.
Even if you're thinking about drafting the agreement yourself, you may want to have an attorney look over it just to make sure it meets your state's requirements for legal validity.

, In many ways the opening statements of your postnuptial agreement will mirror those found in your prenuptial agreement.Generally, your recitals will state who you are, when and where you were married, and the purpose of the agreement.
For example, you might write: ""Whereas, Husband and Wife were married on the 7th of July, 2007, under the laws of the State of California.""
If the purpose of your postnuptial agreement is to modify your prenuptial agreement, you also should state that and make reference to the prenuptial agreement and the date it was signed.

, The next sections of your postnuptial agreement will specifically set forth the changes you want to make to your prenuptial agreement.Organize these sections the same way they were organized in your prenuptial agreement. You also may want to refer to the sections of the prenup specifically.
For example, you might write: ""The separate property section of the prenuptial agreement is modified with respect to the house located at 123 Lovers Lane. Although Wife purchased this property prior to the marriage, Husband and Wife agree that each have joint ownership in this house, and it may not be disposed of without mutual consent.""

, The final portion of your postnuptial agreement, which may be similar to those in your prenuptial agreement, contains language necessary to enforce the agreement and make it legally binding.The closing clauses of the agreement typically contain language known as ""boilerplate"" because it is included in all contracts. Although it may seem like a lot of legalese, it is necessary to make the agreement legally valid.
For example, you generally need clauses that state the agreement is the entire agreement between you and your spouse, and a clause addressing severability. What that clause means is that if a court decides that one part of your agreement is not legally enforceable, it can be removed from the agreement without invalidating any of the other portions of the agreement.
You also need to state which state's laws govern the agreement.

, You should make sure you understand the postnuptial agreement and how it modifies the prenuptial agreement before you sign it.A court may declare the agreement not legally valid if you didn't have enough time to read it before you signed it. However, in most cases, you can't get out of an otherwise valid agreement by claiming you didn't read it.
If there are any terms you don't understand or clauses that don't seem to say what you understood the agreement to be, talk to an attorney.
Remember that you can continue to negotiate regarding the wording of an agreement before you sign it, but it will be too late to change anything after you sign it – unless you want to go through the whole process of creating a new written modification again.

, Your agreement is not legally valid unless signed by both you and your spouse.Some states require postnuptial agreements to be signed before a notary and other witnesses. Check your state's law before you sign your agreement to make sure you're doing it correctly, otherwise your agreement won't be recognized by the courts.
Typically, if you use the same signing process you used for your original prenup, that will be sufficient.
The purpose of witnesses is to confirm that both spouses are of sound mind and neither has been coerced into signing the agreement against his or her will. Make sure you choose a witness who could potentially be available to testify to these facts in a court of law.

, You will need copies for your own records as well as copies to file or record along with the prenuptial agreement.Some states require pre- or post-nuptial agreements to be filed with the court or with the county clerk, particularly if they address the ownership of real property.

Check out your date's manners.,
Notice any mention of sex on the first date.,
Watch out if the ex gets a starring role in your conversations.,
Beware the competitive dater.,
Stand clear of Mr. or Ms. Obnoxious.,
Don't get involved with someone who oozes nothing but negativity.,
Take heed of the nitpicker.,
Balance your preference for a date's sense of humor with the date's sense of appropriateness.,
Beware any form of put-down, condescending attitude or joking comments about yourself.,
Take care if you are informed of how your date likes ""his women"" or ""her guys"".,
Notice the level of drinking.,
Be wary of any signs that indicate this person is already involved or married.",How to Pinpoint Red Flags on Your Date," Does the person you're dating have good manners according to the context within which you're dating? If not, this can be a sign of not caring about other aspects of life either, such as staying polite with you long after the dating euphoria is over. On the other hand, if manners don't really fuss you that much, this might not matter too much.


If your date is rude to other people on the date, this is a red flag. If he or she is capable of this with others, don't feel that it can't be turned on you later.;
, Where this occurs, it's quite probable that he or she has but one interest in mind, which could suggest that any further dating won't be that meaningful to him or her. Note that any attempts to guilt you into having sex are a deal breaker.


Watch for smutty or suggestive comments that make you feel uncomfortable rather than respected. Trust your internal radar on this one.

, If he or she keeps on bringing up the ex, it won't be long before comparisons between you and the ex start happening. Either this person isn't over the ex or there is a lot of anger that's as yet unresolved and you are the rebound person. Since you're not the first person your date is focused on, move on as soon as it's polite to do so. You can't change someone who is fixated and you deserve someone who is focused on you.

, Notice the signs of a person who needs desperately to be better, stronger, wittier or even noisier than you. If your date insists on winning every game, outwitting you at every turn and talking over you whenever you try to say something interesting, you may be facing someone who is incredibly competitive (either that, or they're rather insecure). Unless you enjoy out-competing your romantic interest, consider twice about hitching your star to this ride.


Be aware that a person who is more focused on winning rather than having fun with you can be intense, driven and ignorant of your needs and wants. That's not really match made in heaven. On the other hand, a healthy dose of competitiveness about standard things, such as getting a good promotion or winning a triathlon is fine. Be sure to ask questions and observe the context of the competitiveness before judging.
In some cases, you may have a similar passion that drew you together, such as politics, sports or faith, that the person feels a need to out-compete you to prove that he or she is super way more into that thing than you. Be really wary of this, as it can end up with you being criticized for not being as involved as he or she is, turning what was once a fun shared passion into an unwanted contest in which you keep losing.

, If all your date can manage is to talk non-stop about himself or herself, and won't stop to hear your story or input, then you are facing a very big red flag. This person is liable to stay this way, needing to be the center of attention, unwilling to listen to you and possibly even lacking in empathy or consideration for others. Call for the check.


Watch out for the humblebrag. This is the person who says things like: ""I don't mean to be a show-off but I make a seven figure income for doing what comes naturally."" or ""I don't want to sound full of myself but I am so good at X, I could practically wipe the floor of any competition."" False modesty is always prefaced by someone not meaning to sound a certain way but then ending up sounding that way. If you want to listen to that for a lifetime, stick around. If not, keep this red flag front and center of you when making your decision about that second date.
Bragging about education is boring. Why should it matter on date one where he or she went to school? Even worse if he or she seems overly concerned with your schooling. Ask whether he or she would rather you'd had your date in a high school because that's what it has started to feel like all over again.
Does this person want to know about you? Beware if he or she fails to ask about you during the date.
If it's clear that you are only as valuable as your connections, skills or utility to this person, move on fast.

, For this person, the world is always upside down, things that go wrong are always someone else's fault and everything you care about will have some rotten edge to it that just has to be pointed out to ""enlighten"" you as to what can go wrong or is wrong. It is hard to be on an even keel around this sort of person and it can really bring you down if you're not careful. Take the hint from the conversation being nothing but negative and call end time on the date. You need someone to build you up with positivity, not the other way around.


If something bad has genuinely happened to your date, be sympathetic. But seriously, he or she should not have arranged a date in the middle of a catastrophe––there is a reason for prioritizing the things that matter.
Avoid someone who is in clear need of constant validation. Any mention of not being good enough for you, wondering out loud why anyone would love him or her, or anything of the sort is a prompt for you to list all their terrific points, just to give them a boost. It's awkward, it's painful and it's a poor show on a first date.

, It's great to split costs when you first date, and it's a wise thing to do. However, if you're on a date with someone who insists that you pay a few dollars more for the drinks or food, just because your drink or food was slightly pricier, in place of the simple equation of just splitting the bill in half, realize that this person is liable to always be this way. If you can live with that, then fine. But if you believe that generosity and respect carry the weight of the day, you may wish to steer clear of this type of dater.


This sort of person may be obsessed with small details. This can cause you to feel spied upon, checked on and scrutinized if taken to extremes, so heed this red flag early on!

, While the funny side of this guy or girl might be what attracted you in the first place, making impolite or politically incorrect jokes on a first date is a fail. Such jokes are not funny, they do not reveal a sense of humor and equally, they do not serve as a test you have to pass to prove your sense of humor. This kind of joking is a red flag.


In turn, be wary of any date who expects a laugh when he or she cracks a joke but barely blinks when you offer one of your own. This could indicate an unwillingness to be genuinely warm and involved in the relationship.

, Any talk of this type is a warning sign that this guy or girl isn't averse to picking on you to feel better. It may come across as a joke, a flippant comment or an attempt to make a kindly suggestion for improvement but seriously, who tries to put down a person on a first date? Only someone who can't help but do this as a way of coping, all the time. Steer well clear.


Another red flag is the guy or girl who puts all women and men into some sort of generalized ""bad person"" basket. Not only does the need to generalize give reason for caution but such broad scale moralizing can be a sign of actually disliking the gender being picked on, which may well mean you too.

, The implication is that you'd better conform, or else you don't make the grade. Nothing says ""controlling"" more than this sort of demand, no matter how matter-of-factly or nicely it is expressed.

, If your date is more interested in the next cocktail than in learning about you, that's not a great sign. An even worse sign is that your date ends up incredibly drunk. On a first date, that's major disrespect.

, Such things as answering phones, texting or emailing during the date. Or accidentally calling you another person's name. Or, any other faux pas that reveal there is a Mr. or Mrs. waiting somewhere.

Develop a way to share responsibilities.,
Continue to engage in activities.,
Learn new ways to be together.,
Commit to one another.,
Exercise together.,
Manage stress.,
Accept yourself.",How to Navigate a Relationship with Multiple Sclerosis1," MS may make it so you cannot do the same household or daily activities you used to. If this is the case, your partner may take more and more of the responsibilities until they have taken on too much. If you are able, try to figure out a way to share or balance the responsibilities so your partner feels like an equal and doesn’t feel just like a caregiver.For example, you may be able to take over paying bills online and balancing the finances. You may be able to make menus and take out the ingredients, or load the dishwasher. You may be able to fold clothes or put a load in the washer in the morning.
Set realistic goals and expectations for your partner and yourself. Make sure to discuss these so that you are both on the same page.
Keep in mind that you can always adjust responsibilities as needed. Try to stay flexible. Some days may be better than others, so it is important to anticipate these needs.;
, When you are diagnosed with MS, you may feel like you are not going to be able to do the same activities you did before. You may not be able to do everything you were once able to do. However, you should continue to do activities that you and your partner are interested in, or find modified activities that you can do with your MS.For example, if you and your partner used to go hiking and camping often, you may need to modify what you did. Instead of camping in a tent, you can go in a comfortable camper or RV. You may be able to walk along a short trail or get a scooter to take you along accessible trails.
You may have to give up going to crowded professional sports events. Instead, you can go to sports bars or install a home entertainment center to enjoy to games at home.

, If it is impossible for you to do what you were once able to because of your MS, you and your partner should look for new ways to have fun together. This may include trying new activities or finding new hobbies. Neither of you have just one interest, so expand your horizons and try new things. Being flexible is an important part of dealing with MS and your relationship.You and your partner can get together and come up with new activities you can do together. Remember, the idea is to spend quality time together while enjoying yourselves.
You may have to adjust the way you have sex. Try new things, like new positions, sex toys, or extended foreplay. You may also consider seeing a sex therapist.

, If you and your partner are in a serious, long-term relationship, you should both commit to one another. This means your partner commits to you and your MS. You can have healthy relationships and marriages if one partner has MS. You can nourish each other, enjoy life, have new experiences, and experience intimacy despite your condition.One way of committing to the relationship is to have the mindset that “We” are affected with MS instead of just one of you. The MS will influence both of your lives and futures.
Deciding to stick by each other through everything, not just MS, will help you build a stronger and fulfilling relationship.

, Exercise is a common MS management technique. You and your partner can decide to exercise together. This gives you time to spend together, involves you both in your management, and helps promote healthy lifestyles for both of you.For example, your doctor may have given you a list of approved exercises, such as walking, gardening, dance, yoga, tai chi, swimming, cycling, or something else. Work with your partner to decide what exercise will be enjoyable for both of you.

, MS is stressful for both you and your partner. You can both work together to manage your stress. You can talk to one another about your stress, or work actively together to prepare to face your stress triggers. Daily exercise can also help relieve stress.You may want to do yoga or tai chi together. These activities are great stress reliefs.
Consider deep breathing exercises, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.
Make a list of your stress triggers and use it to help you avoid unnecessary stress whenever possible. This may help to keep your symptoms from getting worse.

, One way you can have healthier relationships is to accept yourself for who you are. You may feel less like a person due to the MS, and it may take you awhile to cope. However, accepting yourself can lead to a healthier view of yourself, which can help you form a better relationship with your partner.For example, accepting yourself helps you reduce stubbornness and helps you be more willing to ask for help. Being able to be honest with yourself helps you be able to be honest with your partner.
By accepting yourself the way you are, you may feel better equipped to move forward in a realistic way. This will also help you to identify your current limitations and find ways to take care of your needs.

List the person’s negative qualities.,
Determine why you and the person are incompatible.,
Focus on the friendly aspects of your relationship.",How to Not Fall in Love With Someone2," Closing yourself off emotionally from the person may be another way you can avoid falling for them. Try to control your emotions so you do not feel overwhelmed or out of control around the person. Make a list of the person’s negative qualities. Read them over and let yourself feel discouraged or disengaged from the person because of these negative qualities. This may help you avoid falling in love with the person.Be honest and think about qualities of the person that may be bothersome or an issue if you were in a relationship with them. For example, you may write down about the person: “too career-focused, quiet and introverted, hard to talk to in a big group.”

, You should also think about why you and the person are not suitable mates. You may make a list of their negative qualities and then write down why these negative qualities mean you and the person are not meant to be together. You may also write down specific instances where you and the person did not seem to mesh or jive well together. Focusing on your incompatibility could help you close yourself off emotionally from the person and see them as nothing more than a friend.


For example, you may write down: “we are incompatible because they are career focused and I would prefer to travel” or “we would not work out because they are intent on settling in one place and I plan to move around often.”

, If you are already on friendly terms with the person, you can try focusing on your friendship with them over any romantic relationship. Perhaps you and the person get along well as friends. Remind yourself that pursuing the person romantically could lead to hurt feelings and ruin your friendship. You may then reason that you are better off maintaining a friendship with the person rather than a romance.For example, you may sit down and write out all the fun times you have had with the person as friends. Then, you may consider if it is worth risking your meaningful, fulfilling relationship with the person to pursue a romance.

"
"
Distract yourself with a hobby or activity.,
Confide in friends and loved ones.,
Consider talking to the person about your feelings.",How to Not Fall in Love With Someone3," You can avoid falling for someone by devoting your time to your own needs and interests rather than to them, or thoughts of them. Distract yourself from your romantic yearnings by pouring your energy into a hobby you love. Or take up an activity that will be all-consuming and leave you little time to focus on your romantic feelings for someone.For example, perhaps you pour your energy into a hobby like painting, writing, playing music, or singing. You could also take up an activity like sports or join a team at school to fill your time.

, Though you may be tempted to keep your romantic feelings to yourself, you may try talking to those closest to you about your emotions. Tell close friends about how you are trying to avoid falling in love with someone. Speak to a close family member about your conflicted feelings. Often, talking to someone who will listen to you about how you are feeling can make you feel less alone and confused.You may also be able to get some perspective on your situation from a friend or family member. They may also offer advice or suggestions on how you can avoid falling in love with the person.
For example, you may say to a friend, “I have feelings for someone but I do not want to fall for them. What do I do?” Or you may say to a family member, “I think I’m falling in love with someone but I don’t think it’s a good idea. Do you have any advice on what I should do?”

, If your romantic feelings for the person are overwhelming and undeniably, you may want to consider telling them how you feel. Though the conversation may be awkward, being honest about your emotions and telling the person can make you feel better. It can also open the door to the possibility that the person may feel the same way about you.If you do decide to talk to the person about your feelings, you should ask them if you talk just the two of you in person and in private. You may then tell them, “I think I am developing romantic feelings for you. I’ve tried to deny these feelings but I think it may be better to be honest with you about how I am feeling.”

Get away from everything that reminds you of him or her until you're over them.,
Go on a mini-vacation.,
Get your mind off of him/her.",How to Move on from Someone Who Doesn't Like You2," This means not going to places that you had experiences with them at, putting away old pictures, and maybe even deleting their contact information from your phone or removing them from Facebook. It might seem rude, but you need to understand that you have to move on in life.


Here's one way to think about it. If you're stopped at a red light and all the sudden it goes green, everyone else is going forward with their lives and you're just stuck. You will eventually get hit by another car or fined for staying in the middle of the road. You can move, but it takes effort to put your foot to the gas. Move on. You do not want to be the person stuck at the red light any longer.
If seeing them on your home page on Facebook or seeing them on your phone will bring back sudden memories or you will be tempted to contact them, you need to delete them.
If you own anything of theirs, now might be a good time to give it back to them if it holds memories or is important to them. If you want to avoid seeing them altogether, you can get a friend to deliver it, or ship it in the mail.
Getting rid of things that remind you of them is not the same as destroying things. It may not be a great idea to send all of their belongings up into smoke by burning it in a funeral pyre. It's recommended that you store things, shelving them away, instead of destroying things. You want to temporarily forget about the memories, not destroy them altogether.

, It can be a stay-cation if you want (late night slumber party, anyone?) or it can be a full-blown vacation, off to an exotic destination. Whatever it is, you deserve it. You're been putting in a lot of work into this, and other, relationships, which means you've earned a break.


Taking a vacation doesn't have to mean traveling far. In fact, you can still have a vacation if you stay in the same city. The trick is convincing your mind to let loose and act like you're in a totally foreign place. So meet some locals, go to a museum you've never gone to, and soak it all in.

, Hanging out with friends, joining a club (i.e. drama clubs, creative writing or book clubs, online clubs, etc.) help a lot. Do anything to get your mind off of him/her. Write song lyrics or stories, do homework, hang out with friends at the mall, watching movies; all of these things work. Make sure that you're not thinking of him or her and there is absolutely no reason for you to encounter them or think about them.


For example, if they work at the mall and your friends want to go there, don't go. Stay home and do something else. The whole point is to move on, and for most people who are in love, the moment they see their loved one again or the moment they start to communicate with them, old feelings begin coming back. So make sure you won't be seeing them at all.
Try to find a hobby you're interested in such as art, music, writing, books, dance, etc. You can also kill two birds with one stone by trying to get something good done while moving on, such as losing weight, studying or doing homework, practicing for a speech or playact, or earning money.

If you're ready, try to find someone new to love.,
When looking for a special someone, remember to learn from the relationship mistakes of the past.,
Get in the mindset that it's good that it happened, but everything has to end sometime.,
Let go now of false hope.",How to Move on from Someone Who Doesn't Like You3," You could meet this person in a bookstore or a coffee shop, online, or in the middle of the street. Never lose hope as to where you will find your one true love. It obviously didn't work out with you and the other person you once love(d), otherwise you wouldn't be here right now. If it didn't work out between you two, it wasn't meant to be.


Everything happens for a reason in the great scheme of things. Know that better things are ahead for you, and be glad that your love story will be in the future and not in the past. Motivate yourself for the future and never give up on finding your true love, because he or she is out there somewhere.

, You're probably going to start looking for someone new, which means exposing yourself to different situations and people. Throughout it all, remember to learn from past relationship mistakes instead of making them all over again. That way, you hopefully only have to move on once and put that behind you. Fingers crossed!


For example, if you were in a manipulative relationship with someone, look for clues in the next possible relationship that it's turning manipulative. Stay away from people who make you feel bad for not getting what they want. Stay away from those can't ever admit having done something wrong.You may be attracted to the pitfalls of the other person, and actively look for those in a new mate. But that's only because that person didn't give you the benefit of a healthy, active, mutually-respecting relationship. Once you're in a healthy, active, mutually-respecting relationship, you'll begin to realize that all the things you thought you needed in a relationship were, in fact, things that kept you from achieving your fullest happiness.

, Be happy of the memories you shared with this person. There were probably good lessons learned. Don't wish it never happened — just wish to move on. Sometimes, moving on can be happy, too. You just have to see the good that this experience has shown you.

, Somewhere in your mind, you're going to think ""I can make them love me. Maybe they didn't mean that, they were just embarrassed. Maybe one day everything will work out."" No. Let go of all of that. In order to move on, you need to know now that there is no hope for you guys. If he or she rejected you, they were probably being serious and holding onto false hope is not going to help you whatsoever. Know that if they wanted you, they would come back to you.


If they haven't already, you have to move on and let go of any false hope between the two of you. You can't make someone love you, and if you're thinking that, you might as well drop those thoughts. Everyone does it-you think it'll make you feel better. But in reality, it's really only making the situation worse because you're once again not moving on.

Be honest about sexual problems.,
Provide emotional support for your partner.,
Say thank you.",How to Navigate a Relationship with Multiple Sclerosis2," MS can put a strain on your relationship. It can lead to changes and a disruption of routines. Though you may not know how to talk about it at first, you should work towards sharing your feelings with each other to avoid miscommunication or repressed negative feelings.Sit down when you are not going to be interrupted.

If you experience this, you should be open and talk to your partner. The sexual problems may be due to an MS-related medical reason, or it might be a psychological problem.Most sexual dysfunction problems related to MS can be reversed with proper treatment. If you are experiencing a psychological problem, like loss of libido, discussing the problem with your partner and working on physical intimacy may help. If it doesn’t, you can see a therapist who may be able to help.
Tell your partner, ""Unfortunately, I am experiencing sexual difficulty due to my MS. I will speak to my doctor about it. Until then, I need you to be understanding of my situation. I want to try alternative ways to find sexual pleasure or physical intimacy during this time.""

, Your partner may not experience the physical symptoms of your MS, but they are still affected by it. Make sure not to make your whole conversation about MS. Talk about what is going on in their life as well. Ask them how they are doing, how work is going, and how they are feeling.

Ask your partner things like, ""How was your day at work?"" or ""Have you worked on any new paintings lately?"" Say to your partner, ""Tell me about your latest project"" or ""What are you working on now?""
You may also say, ""I know my MS takes a lot of our energy. However, I am here for you. You can tell me how you feel or if something is wrong. I'm here to listen to you.""

, You may think your partner knows or doesn’t need to be told, but you should tell them that you are grateful for their help. This doesn’t mean you have to tell them every time they do something or overdo it, but you should periodically remind your partner that you are thankful for them, your relationship, and everything they do.For example, you may want to tell them thank you because they took over activities you used to do, took you to the doctor, or communicated to you honestly. Tell them, ""Thank you for everything you do for me. I appreciate it and couldn't do it without you.""

Learn to self-reflect.,
Consider other’s inner experiences.,
Show curiosity.,
Give empathy and compassion.,
Cut out black and white thinking.,
Hit the pause button.,
Calm down.,
Gain some control.,
Become responsive, not reactive.",How to Mentalize Relationships," Self-reflection is a big part of mentalization. Create some self-awareness by examining your own thoughts and feelings. For example, if you’re mad at someone, don’t think about all the things they’ve done to make you feel mad. Instead, think about what triggered your own feelings. Do you not like being interrupted or spoken over? Did you feel like you weren’t being valued or heard?Start using self-reflection in your day-to-day life. Keeping a journal can be a great way to reflect on your thoughts and feelings throughout each day and gain insight into your inner world.
Self-reflection can also help to keep you focused on your own process rather than on the other person.;
, In the same way that you reflect on your own inner workings, try to think about how others may feel or think. For example, if someone is mad at you for being late, think of what it would be like if someone was late to see you often. Try to put yourself in their shoes, so to speak. What would it be like to have their experience? How might they experience you?Think about how other people see you or what their opinions of you might be based off of your behaviors.
For example, if you get into a fight with someone, think about how they may have felt when you raised your voice or said something hurtful.
This process can help you get to the bottom of your own feelings and resolve situations much better.

, Instead of jumping to conclusions or reacting solely on your emotions, ask questions instead. Expressing curiosity can help ease misunderstandings and make people feel understood. If you’re about to make an accusation, ask a question instead.For example, say, “What makes you feel that way?” or, “I don’t understand you. Can you say that a different way?”
You can also ensure your understanding by saying, “So let me make sure I understand you. You’re saying you want me to be cleaner around the house.”

, Recognize that your emotions are valid and so are the emotions of other people. Even if you disagree with someone, try to understand their perspective and why they think or behave the way they do. Understand and give compassion for yourself and your difficulties but also for the difficulties of others.For example, if your friend breaks up with their partner, understand that they might feel sad, lonely, or upset. Respond in a way that shows you understand that they are experiencing something hurtful.
By focusing on their feelings you won't be caught up in why they couldn't go to the movies with you, or keep a lunch date.

, Avoid saying things like, “You never help me” or, “You always make excuses.” These kinds of extreme statements are rarely true. Reconsider your beliefs and catch yourself in these all-or-nothing thoughts. Think of a more accurate or nuanced approach to the situation.If you catch yourself thinking or saying these statements, stop and re-evaluate. You might choose to say, “It bothers me when you don’t help me” or, “I really dislike it when you make excuses.”
Keep in mind that it takes a lot of courage to state your thoughts and feelings directly to someone.

, If you’re feeling a strong feeling (like anger or frustration), you might have the impulse to do something like yell, scream, throw something, or walk out. If you notice these feelings, try to tolerate the feeling instead of act on it or run from it. It will feel uncomfortable at first, but it’s the first step to preventing a bigger fight or causing harm to a relationship.Pause your thoughts and behavior to keep yourself from doing something destructive.
For example, if you want to yell or walk out, say to yourself, “I need to take a break” or, “Right now I’m feeling frustrated and will not react.”

, It’s difficult to get into a rational, logical state of mind when your emotions are heightened. When you’re feeling intensely emotional, take some time to calm down. This might mean taking a walk, exercising, distracting yourself, or taking some deep breaths. Get to a place where you fee like you can think without working directly from your feelings.Try some deep breathing exercises. Inhale for three seconds, hold for three seconds, then exhale for three seconds. Do this until you feel calm.

, Mentalization involves feeling in control of your own behavior. It means not accepting that your behavior just happens but instead, realizing you have responsibility and ownership of your own choices. Recognize that you can control how you respond, what you say, and how you say it.If you’re about to say something hurtful, recognize that you can choose to say it or not. You don’t have to do or say anything.
At any rate, make sure to pause first and wait before responding.

, Focus on responding to your own thoughts and feelings, then to other people. Reactions occur when something happens and you quickly take action. Instead of instinctively responding, put some thought into how you feel and what you’re thinking, then comment or act.For example, if you’re upset that someone didn’t do the dishes, don’t yell or snap at them. Recognize that you feel frustrated or angry, then respectfully say, “Would you mind doing your dishes?”
Respond to the other person’s needs or words instead of focusing on yourself. For example, say, “I know we both feel frustrated right now. I’ll let you talk so I can listen.”

Spend more time with your friends.,
Keep your cool.,
Wait to respond to him.,
Hang out with other guy friends.,
Do his favorite things with someone else.,
Make a big change in your appearance.,
Remember communication is key.,
Explain to your boyfriend that you feel neglected.,
Stop trying to manipulate each other.,
End your relationship if it's going poorly.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Jealous," The best way to ignite a healthy jealousy in your boyfriend is to show him that you don't need him to have fun. Have a great time with your friends and if he asks you about it later tell him how much you missed hanging out with them and how you desperately need your ""girl time."" You want to give him the impression that you're perfectly happy and having fun without his presence.Call your friends, head out to a club, or do something that you all enjoy together. Have a girls' night out. If you're feeling neglected by your boyfriend, spending time without him is a great way to make him miss you, but it's also a good opportunity to distract you from any hurt you may be feeling by his neglect.
Don't just ""use"" friends to make your boyfriend jealous. No one wants to be friends with someone they feel is just using them to make others jealous. Take time to care for your friends and do actually spend a lot of time with them -- you want them to still be around if your relationship ends.;
, If the reason you want to make your boyfriend jealous is because he's making you jealous by talking or texting with other girls, then the first thing you need to do is stay calm. If he's trying to get a rise out of you, going on a rant and getting angry is exactly what he wants you to do. Instead, be chill and act like you're above it.It's possible that your boyfriend is flirting with other girls and doesn't even realize it, so give him the benefit of the doubt and try talking to him about it if it's really bothering you. Make sure the conversation with him is very gentle and understanding, not accusatory or heated.
If you see him talking to other girls and he just want to get a rise out of you, the best way to respond is to act like nothing strange is happening. Go talk to someone else, or if he's talking to a girl right in front of you, jump into the conversation and be super friendly with her. This will probably throw him off because it shows that you don't care if he talks to other girls. Also, if this is the way your boyfriend regularly acts, you might want to ask yourself why you are dating him in the first place.

, To keep your boyfriend on his toes wondering what you are doing, try giving it some time after he texts or calls you to respond. Don't go overboard (like waiting a few days) but if you missed a call from him, don't call him back until an hour or two has passed.If your boyfriend asks what you were doing, make it sound like you were doing something really fun and exciting. You may be tempted to be short with him, but that's likely just going to frustrate him and make him feel like you are uninterested in talking. Make him feel like he's missed out on doing something really fun.

, Flirting with other guys is tricky, and can cause your boyfriend to feel angry or territorial, but hanging out with guy friends is innocent and effective. Spend time alone with your guy friends, doing things that you really enjoy together and having great conversation. Then if your boyfriend asks about your time go easy on the details -- this will make him wonder about the extent of your relationship. Your boyfriend may not think anything of you hanging out with guy friends, so make it clear that these guy friends are really close to you and know how to make you laugh. If your boyfriend is oblivious, spend extra time with your guy friends until he begins to notice that you're trading time with him for time with your friends.
Another good idea is to invite your guy friends to hang out with you and your boyfriend. If your guy friends get along better with your boyfriend than with you, this may not be very effective. But if you are close to your guy friends then act playful around them in front of your boyfriend. Don't flirt excessively, but give them a tender hug when they show up and compliment them on their style. You can try telling your boyfriend something like ""You should get your hair cut like so-and-so"" or ""I really liked so-and-so's outfit; you should dress like that more often."", Maybe your boyfriend loves the chocolate chip cookies you make or he's really into baseball. Instead of making him his favorite recipe or buying him tickets to his favorite sporting event, bake for someone else and do activities with someone else. This doesn't have to be another guy, but it does help!


If you bake cookies for someone else, send him a text saying ""freshly baked cookies"" with a picture of the cookies, and then if he asks tell him you made them for so-and-so. Then, even if you have any extras, tell him that you don't.
If he's really into sports, purchase tickets and go to a game with someone else and then send him a picture or snapchat of you at the game. Try doing this with someone who would actually enjoy the event you're going to, so it's not obvious that you purposely left your boyfriend out of it.

, One effective way to grab your guy's attention is to look amazing. Change something up about your hair, style, or start exercising so that your body will look really fit. The most important thing is to look and feel confident, because confidence in a woman can be one of the most attractive things to a guy.


Change your hair. Make your hairstyle more modern and sexy, trim it or add hair extensions. Dye your hair a drastic different color, or give it a little highlight. Curl your hair if you usually keep it straight, or straighten it if it's usually curly.
Buy sexy clothing such as shorts, tight dresses, crop tops, skinny jeans and high heels. Some boys find a tracksuit sexy too. Or, do the opposite and wear an outfit that's very classy and sophisticated, showing him that you are totally confident in your body shape and in who you are.
Do your makeup differently. Try going for a smoky eye look by using black eye liner and using different shades of gray eye shadow if your makeup is normally more subdued. Of if you usually wear your makeup heavier during the day, try going for a more natural glow that accentuates your best features.

, If your boyfriend is making you jealous and isn't paying attention to you, talk to him about it. Don't accuse him of anything, but try to have a mature conversation about how it makes you feel in the relationship. Catch him at a time when he seems calm or relaxed -- you don't want to bring up a difficult subject when he's already had a hard day. Relationships are partnerships, and they involve compromise and sometimes sacrificing things for one another. If you feel you give and give and your boyfriend doesn't treat you well, it may be time to consider ending the relationship.

, If you feel your guy is being a little hands-off or distant then tell him that you don't feel cared for very well. Encourage him to be more affectionate and passionate when you're together, instead of trying to bring it out of him with manipulation.


If you think he might be bored in the relationship, get more creative with your activities. Do things that he really enjoys and keep the relationship at a steady pace. It could be good to ask him if he's bored with you in particular or just with how the relationship is going. That will help give you a lot more insight on how to spice up things.

, If you feel the need to act a certain way to make your boyfriend jealous, it's a bad sign. It means you're not communicating openly and your relationship is in bad shape. Even if you're successful in making your boyfriend jealous, you run the risk of your boyfriend ending the relationship instead of becoming more passionate. If you want him to pay attention to you, tell him you need him to be more committed and you can't last in a relationship that's only one-sided.

, If your boyfriend doesn't pay attention to you, it's likely he's lost attraction to you or has become complacent in the relationship. Evaluate the relationship and the type of guy he is to figure out if it's worth working things out or if it would be better to break it off."

There are some obvious places to find these women, but there are some other less-known locations to find them as well. Here's where you can begin your search:


Obviously, go to Russia or Ukraine. There will be plenty of Russian and/or Ukrainian women there.
Other countries that were formerly in the Soviet Union, such as Latvia, Estonia, or Belarus.
Places in America with large immigrant communities, especially the New York and New Jersey area.
Almost any major city has a sizable Russian population if you know where to look. Check out the Russian restaurants and clubs in your area. For example, if you're in New York City, Brighton Beach will be full of beautiful Russian women. Most cities have their own Facebook page for events for the Russian community. Ask to join.
Check out online dating websites. If you really want to meet a Russian or Ukrainian woman, look at the profiles of beautiful women online. Most women have lots of Russian pride and will say so in their profiles. Look out for common Russian or Ukrainian names like Katya, Masha, Irina, Tanya, Olga, or Sasha.;
, If you're at a Russian and Ukrainian friendly location but aren't sure if the girl you have eyes on is a true Russian or Ukrainian, there are some tricks to being able to tell what country the girl hails from. Of course, there is no fool-proof way to spot a Russian woman because they are as diverse as any other women on the planet. Still, there are a few things to increase their chances of being Russian or Ukrainian:


See if they are overdressed. If they are wearing leather pants, high heels, sparkly tops, and chunky earrings to a casual event like a happy hour or even a coffee shop, they may be Russian or Ukrainian, because these women take pride in looking their best under any circumstances.
See if they have high heels. These women just love wearing high heels to show off their great legs.
See if they've taken time to groom their hair and put on a healthy amount of makeup.
One type of Russian or Ukrainian woman is tall, blonde, slender, with blue eyes and beautiful cheekbones.
However, keep in mind that many Russian women in America are Jewish immigrants, and have a different look. They have black hair and brown eyes and are just as beautiful as the more common conception of Russian women.
If she doesn't smile every chance she gets. Russian women are kind, generous, and have a fantastic sense of humor. However, they will be less likely to have an open face and to smile and say ""How are you?"" to any stranger who passes by. You have to earn their trust first.

, In most cases, if you're chatting up a Ukrainian or Russian girl, she will let you know where she's from within the first five minutes. These women are proud of who they are and will find a way to say, ""Hey, I'm Russian,"" no matter what subject you're discussing. However, if your lady doesn't bring it up, here are a few hints that she may be from the Mother Country:


If she asks you what your New Year's plans are even though it's only August.
If she talks about how much she loves her family, especially her grandmother, who may live with her parents.
If she prefers vodka over tequila, whisky, or another hard alcohol. This may be a stereotype, but many Russian and Ukrainian women really do prefer vodka over other types of hard liquor.
If she does not drink. Russian and Ukrainian women may have had alcoholics in their family. Typically a male relative.
If she casually mentions that her dad is the most amazing man in the world.
If she has a background in gymnastics, dance, or mentions that she plays the piano like a pro.
If soccer or hockey is her family's spectator sport of choice.
If talks about something having a ""soul.""
If she rolls at her eyes, complains and/or shakes her head at something Americans do.

, Russian and Ukrainian women like their men to have confidence. Many of them have a healthy self-confidence and don't want to waste their time trying to tell their man how great he is. When you meet the woman, you should already be confident in who you are and what you do. Now, it's matter of letting her know you're a confident person. Here's how:


Use the body language of a confident person. Make eye contact instead of looking at the floor, stand tall instead of slouching, and use your arms to gesture instead of folding them.
Show that you're confident in your appearance. To show a woman you care about how you look, wear well-fitting and clean clothes, and take the time to groom yourself by showering and washing your hair. Russian women may like a little facial scruff, but make sure it looks purposeful, and not like you just forgot to shave.
Be positive about your life. Talk about how much you love your friends, your family, and your job. There's no need to lie if you're not happy with all aspects of your life, but you should focus on talking about the things you love and leave the rest for later. This will make the woman see that you love who you are and she'll be more likely to love you, too.

, Russian women want real men who can take care of themselves and are useful around the house. They want a man who knows what's going on because Russian women know what's going on and don't want to waste their time educating anyone. Here are some ways to show that you're capable:


Have a career that you love. Your profession says a lot about you, and your work should say that you can get things done, be a leader, and manage your time well.
Have useful skills. You should know how to fix your car, fix things around the house.
If you take her out to eat, you should know what to order. If you're out for a drink, you should know the best cocktail on the menu.
You don't have to pay for everything, but make it clear that you are not a freeloader.

, People who say Russians are gruff or have no sense of humor are completely wrong. Russians simply have a different kind of sense of humor that relies more on sarcasm, anecdotes, wordplay, and cheekiness. Here's how to make a Russian girl laugh:


Tell a funny story that makes you the hapless protagonist. Don't take it too far and make yourself look incapable, though.
Make witty observations about the world around you. Mention something about the difference between New Jersey and New York, for example.
Learn the art of quick banter. Be sharp, and learn to handle a quick back-and-forth conversation with your lady. You have to think on your feet.
Learn not to take things literally. Russians love saying the opposite of what they mean (irony), and you should be able to recognize when your lady's tone is not sincere. If you don't catch on, you may look simple.

, Once your Slavic sweetie is wowed by your confidence, capability, and sense of humor, you can open up to her a little bit to show that you have a sensitive side. Choose the right time to reveal your deeper emotions. Here's how to do it:


Mention how much you love the elders in your family. If you tell her how much you love your grandmother (your Babushka), and how you call her every single day, she will be brought to tears.
Talk about your siblings, and how protective you are over them. This will show that you can help her take charge of your household.
If you have a pet cat or dog, talk about how much you love them in a non-embarrassing way. Show her pictures if she's interested.

, Basically, it's complicated. The Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union until 1991. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, all people under its power were considered to be Russian, whether they wanted to be or not. But Ukraine is a separate country with its own customs, language, and culture. The fastest way to annoy a Russian or Ukrainian woman is to not understand this difference. Here's what you need to know:


If you're in Russia, the native women there will consider themselves Russian. If you're in Ukraine, the native women there today will consider themselves Ukrainian for the most part. Unless their heritage is Russian. Due to the recent hostilities between pro-Russian separatists on one side and Ukrainian Army and Special forces on the other side - majority of Ukrainians no longer see Russia as a ""brother nation"".
If you're in America, many Ukrainian immigrants from the capital city of Kiev will actually consider themselves Russian because the country was still considered to be a part of the USSR when they lived there and because they grew up speaking the Russian language. Before 1991, Russian was the language spoken in schools, used in newspapers, and in every day life in Kiev, but now, Ukrainian is used in schools, advertisements, and some television shows, though many city people still speak Russian at home.
Don't tease the women from Ukraine who consider themselves Russian by saying, ""What, are you ashamed of being from Ukraine?"" Again---it's complicated. Just don't even go there.

, Russian and Ukrainian languages with their own alphabet and unique way of speech. These women will be truly impressed if you have learned their native languages in school, on your own, or through a study abroad program. They will also be impressed if you show an interest in learning the language. Here's what to do:


Before you approach her, learn a few key phrases. Don't use them right away because that will just look corny, but using Russian phrases when the time is right will impress her. Here are a few words to say in Russian:

""Kak dela?"" simply means, ""What's up?""
""Krasavitsa"" means ""a beauty."" ""Ti krasavitsa"" means, ""you are a beauty.""
""Dasvedaniya"" means ""goodbye"" and ""paka"" is a more casual way of saying goodbye.
""Prekrasno"" means ""amazing.""
""Ya tebya lyublu"" means ""I love you.""
""Ochen priyatno"" is what you should say after you meet her family. It roughly means ""Nice to meet you.""


Ask your lady to speak Russian to you if she wants to. Don't be annoying about it---many Russian women are sick of everyone asking them to speak their language.
If you are serious about dating a Russian or Ukrainian woman, you should try to learn her native language as much as you can. It will show a respect for her culture and will allow you to really understand her family.

, If you don't already love Russian and Ukrainian food or don't know what it is, it's important to know and love a few key foods so you and your lady can cook together and so you can fit in at her family's dinner table. Here are a few basics:


Russians love dill and sour cream and can find a way to sneak it into most dishes, such as mashed potatoes. They don't go light on the salt, either.
Borsch is a traditional beet-based soup that should be served hot with a healthy dose of sour cream.
Pickled vegetables, such as tomatoes, pickles, and sauerkraut are key staples in a Russian household.
Russians love their meats, from cold cuts, such as salami or ham, to Beef Stroganoff. They also don't say no to salmon.
If you're dating a true Russian or Ukrainian woman, being a vegetarian is a near impossibility.
Russians love salads with a healthy dose of mayo. One of their favorites is called Salad Olivier (originally french), which is a mix of mayo, ham, peas, and other vegetables.
Blini, which is a thin crepe, are excellent with caviar, some honey and sugar, or---you guessed it---sour cream.
Learn to love black bread.

, In order to understand the workings of your new lady's mind, you'll have to have a sense of the quirks and traditions that make her culture unique. Knowing about these in advance will earn you lots of bonus points. Here are a few of them:


Don't hug, hand anything over, or do anything important in a doorway. It's a threshold that is meant only to be crossed.
Before you leave for a journey, you must sit down for a minute to reflect on the trip ahead.
If you accidentally step on her foot, she has to step on yours, or you will get in a fight.
Don't use gestures to show something bad, such as touching your own body to show where your friend was hurt. This is bad luck.
Don't ever wish her a happy birthday before her actually birthday because---believe it or not---it's bad luck.

, Even if you don't know a lot about Russian films, literature, or artists, you should at least show a respect for the achievements of her people instead of seeing them as stereotypes. After all, she may not be the most well-read person in the world, but a few key insights will impress her:


Without being too nerdy, tell her that your favourite writers are Pushkin, Turgenev, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy.
Know that Battleship Potemkin is an amazing film.
Know who Yuri Gagarin, Gorbachev, and Peter the Great are, just to name a few figures.
Don't make dumb jokes about her culture, like asking her if her dad is in the Russian mob or wanting to know if she knows any Ukrainian mail-order brides. This will show that you only see her culture as a stereotype.

, Russian and Ukrainian women are quick to tell when you're being phony, but letting the woman know that there are many things you like about her in a sincere way can take your conversation to the next level. Here's what you do:


Make a few observations about things you like about her personality. If she tells you about a struggle she had, say, ""You must be a very strong person,"" or if she has a great sense of humor, mention it.
Once you're comfortable, move on to compliment her features, such as her nice eyes or her scintillating laugh.
Compliment by teasing. If she tells you she loves to read, say that she's the cutest nerd you've ever met. Don't hurt her feelings, but show that you can joke around.

, Russian and Ukrainian women are used to being fetishized and if you make them think that you only like them because they are exotic, or known to be beautiful, they will quickly be turned off. Here's what you should do:


Show an interest in her life by asking about her passions outside of your culture. Talk about her hobbies, her friends, or her job.
Try not to ask too many questions about Russia or Ukraine right away unless she is open about it.
Don't tell her that your last three girlfriends were Russian, or that she reminds you exactly of some Russian girl you know---this will not make her feel special.

, If you've hit it off with your new lady, it's time to take your meeting to the next level. To ask out a Russian woman, you have to be a true gentleman and show that you're worth dating. Here's how:


Be direct. Russian women are forward and will appreciate if you can ask them out with confidence.
Be a gentleman. Take her coat, buy her a drink, and hold a door for her. Do gentlemanly things to show that you will be a great date.
When the time for the date comes, look your best and bring flowers. And don't be surprised if your girl is a little bit late---maintaining her good looks is hard work!

Don't try to make him jealous for too long if your goal is to date him.",How to Make a Guy Jealous," Jealousy only works if the guy has feelings for you. If he's totally not interested, you'll have a very hard time making him jealous. The good news is, any guy you're dating or that you have dated is almost certainly interested in you, and the same can be said with guys that have been flirting with you. If you're not sure if a guy is into you, you can just try to make him jealous anyway.


Though it's impossible to know if he has feelings for you with 100% certainty without asking, there are many tell-tale signs that he has a crush on you. If he pays extra attention to you in groups, makes a point of ignoring you in groups, or is always caught staring at you, then chances are, he has a crush on you.
Of course, if you play your cards right, you can make a guy notice you more by trying to make him jealous, but this will be harder to do if there isn't some interest in the beginning.;
, If you want to make the guy jealous, then you can't go around in your sweatpants and bed head. You probably don't want to wear a mini skirt and stilettos, either, but you should make an effort to look pretty darn cute when you know he'll see you so he'll take notice. Just make an effort to style your hair, wear flattering clothes, and to look like you spent some time on your appearance.


This means you should look like a version of your best self, not that you should try to look like a celebrity or a supermodel.

, The best thing you can do is have a fantastic time without the guy that you want to make jealous. This can mean laughing with your girlfriends, dancing it up at a party, or just doing something that makes you feel happy and free. Give whatever you're doing all of your attention, and the guy will see that you really are having an amazing time - and not thinking of him at all! What could make him feel more jealous than that?


If he catches you looking around the room for him, or trying to put on an act for him, then he won't be likely to get very jealous. Make sure he really doesn't think he's on your mind at all. That will drive him crazy.

, Do things you like to do. If you're busy and having fun so that you don't always have time for a guy, he'll start to get a little jealous. This technique is especially effective on ex-boyfriends. It shows that you're going on with your life and having a better time without him. Even if this technique fails to inspire jealousy in the guy, you'll be better off. If you don't stay busy, you'll spend all of your time obsessing over the guy and he'll be able to tell.


If you really can't stop thinking about the guy and have nothing to do, make a point of making your schedule more packed.
If he can see you being busy and doing things that matter to you (other than him), then great. He'll be even more interested.

, Nothing drives guys crazy so much as when a girl they're interested in or involved with flirts with other guys. Many men are incredibly competitive by nature, and if other guys appear to like you, even a guy who wouldn't notice you before may take interest. Make sure the guy knows you're flirting by doing it in front of him or in situations where you know it'll get back to him.


If you flirt with too many guys in a short period of time, however, he might catch on, especially if you're not normally that much of a flirt.
But don't make it too obvious, because he might think that you're a type of girl who's easy to get and flirt with. We don't want to make a bad impression, right?
There's a difference between casually flirting and leading a guy on. Don't flirt too much with a guy who you know likes you just to get back at someone else, because you'll be getting the poor guy's hopes up.

, Actually dating other guys takes flirting to a whole new level, and it will do the same with the guy's jealousy. Especially if you have just started dating a guy or if a guy has just dumped you, getting out and seeing other people is a great way to keep your independence and to make the guy you want try harder to get you or, in the case of an ex, really regret losing you. Of course, you shouldn't date people you totally don't like just to get back at your ex, because you'll just be hurting feelings and making everything more complicated than it needs to be.


If you and the guy you're dating happen to be around the guy you're trying to make jealous, act natural. Let him see you having a great time instead of laughing too hysterically or trying too hard to say, ""Look at me! I am having such an amazing time without you!""

, If he and someone else you know are sitting together on the bus, say hi to the friend and not the guy you're trying to make jealous. If he reacts immediately, he likes you. If not, he probably doesn't care. You don't have to be rude or ignore him completely, especially not if he reaches out to you, but you shouldn't go out of your way to talk to him or necessarily let him know that you notice him, either.


If he texts you a lot, don't get back to him right away. Give it at least a day or two to make him see that you have better things to do than to get back to him ASAP (even if you don't!).
If he's passing you in the halls and says hi, you can say hi back, but don't slow down and talk to him; you've got places to go!

, Even if you don't actually go on dates, it's good to have some guy friends that you hang out with. Even if you're in a committed relationship, there's nothing wrong with having male friends, but when you hang out with them your boyfriend will probably be at least a little jealous and nervous.


Just block him out completely, and then he'll get really jealous. Act like you don't care about him. Lay it on, and you'll have a perfect jealousy plan.

, If you're always available for him, you'll lose some of your mystery, and mystery can create jealousy. For example, don't always answer his calls. When you call him back a couple hours later--you definitely should call him back if you're interested--be vague about what you were doing. Say you were out with a friend or you were just busy. Just by not answering the phone, you may make him wonder what you're doing and who you're with.


In the same vein, if he calls you to ask if you want to do something, once in a while it's good to just say that you have other plans, even if you don't really.

, You don't have to post a photoshoot of you and ten hot guys playing a casual game of volleyball at the beach. However, you can use your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other accounts to make the guy see that you're living a great life without him. Whether you post pictures with guys you know, mention an amazing party or museum you went to that weekend, or just show the world how much you love your best friends, you can use social media to make the guy jealous and annoyed that you have a whole life that does not include him.


Don't post too often, though, or he'll think the opposite -- that you have no life. Just posting something two or three times a week should do the trick.

, A lot of guys, believe it or not, can actually tell when you're trying to make them jealous. Sometimes the best thing you can do is give a flirtatious smile to a different guy, and the guy whose attention you want will be all ears. It's the subtle things that can really make the guy who you want to make jealous take notice, so you shouldn't go too far out of your way to make the guy see that you just want him to see how much you don't need him.


If he's in the same room as you, keep doing what you're doing. If you change your entire personality just to make the guy jealous, he'll be able to tell.

, You can't be too obvious when you do this. Don't say, ""I was hanging out with Mark all weekend - Mark is so hot!"" or he'll see that you're just trying to ruffle his feathers. Instead, say something like, ""Have you heard of the Arctic Monkeys? Mark burned me their newest CD and I just can't stop listening to it."" The subtle mention of a guy you know will make someone much more jealous than if you raved on and on about all of the guys you know.


Don't name drop too often, either. Mentioning another guy's name just once or twice throughout the course of a conversation will do the trick.

, Though making a guy jealous will require you to not be the nicest person in the world to him, don't take it too far, either. If you're openly mean, talking way too much about being with other guys, or just generally not acting like a gracious, kind person for the sake of making a guy jealous, then there will come a point where he will be turned off, and when the other people in your life get annoyed by your behavior, too.


You can be a bit mean, especially if you want to get the guy back, but don't lose sight of who you are.

, If you do end up talking to the guy who you want to make jealous, don't give him all of your time. Talk to him for a few minutes and then tell him that you have to go -- whether you're going to class, meeting up with friends, or actually doing absolutely nothing. If he thinks he can talk to you for hours until he has to go, then guess who has the power in the relationship? (It's not you.) Even if you do like him and can't stop drowning in his baby blues, force yourself to break away.


Don't give him 100% of your attention when you talk to him, either. Make him see that you've got other things on your mind.

, If he asks about your weekend, you can give him a flirty smile and just say, ""It was…really amazing."" You can leave him to guess what you mean by this - he'll be likely to think you meant you had an amazing time making out with another guy at the movies instead of celebrating your Aunt Flo's 50th birthday. If you have to get going, you don't have to say, ""Time for my dentist's appointment!"" Instead, say, ""I'm late for this…thing I have to go to."" He may think it's a date, and who are you to say otherwise?


Don't be an open book if you want him to be jealous. Lead him to guess what you could be up to and to create his own scenarios that can make him jealous!

, If you want to make a guy jealous because he broke your heart and you want to get him back, then great. But if you want to make a guy jealous because you actually like him and think this ploy will get his attention, then know your limits. A little bit of flirtation and jealousy-making is fine, at first, but if you take it too far, then the guy may think you're not interested, not a nice person, or the kind of girl who gets with every guy. Once you and the guy begin to make a real connection, you can minimize the jealousy antics.


If you do date the guy, you can still keep him on his toes, but there are better ways of doing so than making him jealous! If you want to start a relationship with the guy, then it has to be built on a foundation of trust, not doubt and suspicion.

Ask him to meet you for lunch on a workday, or bike to brunch together on a sleepy weekend. Make it clear that it's a date: nobody else is invited, even the kids.


Dress up. Plan events that will require you to change out of your ordinary clothes. This could mean going to an elegant dinner, a dance class, or a themed event. It could even mean going swimming.;
, Couples fall out of the habit of regular sexual encounters for a million reasons. The ways that you got together early in a relationship don't necessarily teach you how to maintain your sex life later on. Plan times and ways to have sex. If you always used to have sex at night, but are too tired now, find other times during the day.


Shower together, or fall in bed before dinner.
Please yourself. Be honest about what makes you orgasm, and what hurts or bores you. Ask for what you want: being selfless kills sex.Ask him what he wants in return, and take turns satisfying one another's desires.
Make a date with him, and plan some creative details together (candles, costumes, trying something new.)
Having a plan will get you excited ahead of time.
Stick to it! Plans are useless if you don't follow through.

, The intimacy built by physical contact cannot be underestimated.Whether or not your sex life is flourishing, your bodies should find their ways to one another. Hug him when he comes in the room, when he wants reassurance, or just when it occurs to you. Trade back massages, or offer to massage any part of him that is sore.


Kiss goodbye when one of you leaves the house, and kiss hello upon return.
Groom one another. Offer to brush his hair, or put his lotion or sunblock on. Ask for him to help you with your zipper, and offer to tie his tie.
Make eye contact when you talk. It is a powerful form of sensory connection., Getting out of your ordinary spaces will allow you to break your ordinary habits. Go on a vacation together, without anyone else. Take a weekend trip, or just a night away from home, if you can't be away for long. Plan a vacation that won't be too stressful.


If one of you drives all the time for work, for instance, don't let it involve driving. Take the train or fly, or walk down the street to the local hotel.
Get nostalgic. Take a vacation to a place where you both had a lovely time together. Don't try to do everything exactly the same, but do the things you both liked best. Reminisce, and create new memories.

, Expressing gratitude for your partner can powerfully strengthen your relationship. Think about everything you appreciate about him: his character, his actions, what he does for you. Find a calm moment and tell him exactly how you feel. Write it out first if that helps you organize your thoughts.


Make a practice of thanking him specifically for kind things he does for you.
Expand on the ""thank you."" Explain the lovely qualities he has that cause him to act kindly.Instead of just saying ""thanks for making me dinner. I loved it!"" Say ""Thank you for making me dinner. I see that instead of getting mad at me for being grouchy, you recognized that I was tired and hungry. You are a good cook, but you're also a truly thoughtful person.""
Compliment him as well. The flirt will return to your relationship.

, Take time to pay attention to one another every day. Spend at least an hour a week alone together, focused on one another. This could be a meal, a walk, or just a while sitting on the couch after your children have gone to bed.


Ban certain subjects during quality time. Whatever you normally talk about (work, the kids, health concerns, money concerns) should be banned for at least the first 20 minutes of your quality time. Talk about your less dire shared interests, the news, or anything other than your everyday concerns.

, Sign up for classes and learn a new skill together, such as a language or a kind of cooking or dance. Go places together that you haven't gone before. Try to think of something you'd never do as a date, and then do that. The novelty will make your relationship feel young and new, and you'll get to see new sides of one another.


Play. Couples who have fun and laugh together have better marriages. Get in snowball fights, tease one another gently, throw a ball around, and tell jokes., Sometimes you see things that your partner doesn't see, and sometimes your partner does something inconsiderate or ham handed. Try to limit your criticism to one instance a day. Before you offer criticism, think ""is this worth biting my tongue later?""


When your partner complains, listen. Rather than give advice, offer sympathy. You can give advice if it's asked for, or suggest a new perspective if he is thinking himself into a rut, but you might do the most good just by attentively listening., Initiate the things that you really miss in your relationship. If you feel like you never talk anymore, start a conversation. If you used to always go out, ask him to go out. Initiating will give him the idea to reciprocate.If he doesn't reciprocate, then you can ask. For instance, if you are always taking all the pictures during family vacations and there are never any of you, hand him the camera.
Initiate first, ask second. Explain your frustration third. If you feel yourself getting frustrated, explain this calmly.

, If one or the other of you has done something to damage your mutual trust, talk honestly about it. State your experience of the betrayal without trying to influence your husband's reaction.Write it as a letter. Get your own feelings straight by writing them out.

, If you two are ever going to rebuild trust, the person in the wrong needs to apologize. If you betrayed him, say you're sorry. State what you did wrong, and how you think it affected him. Say why it was wrong, and promise you won't do it again.If he betrayed your trust, ask for that sincere of an apology. If he isn't ready to apologize, then he isn't ready to love you again either.

, When the apology has happened, talk through the situation that was so hurtful. Don't dwell on the painful details, but do make sure you agree on what happened, why, and the reasons it hurt., Write down what you would like to happen to your relationship, and have your husband do the same. You might find that you both want to make some changes. Working to rebuild trust might have the positive side effect of making some parts of your relationship stronger.If you find your goals differ, compromise to accommodate them all. For instance, if your husband wishes you had more together time, while you are longing for more time alone, try scheduling both quality together time and quality time apart.

, Find a therapist who specializes in dealing with couples like yours. If there was infidelity, find a therapist who specializes in marital therapy.If you cannot get your husband to visit a counselor with you, see a counselor on your own.

Ask yourself why you want their love.,
Speak in person.,
See if they’re on the same page.",How to Make Someone Love You Again1," It’s important that you’re self-aware in going into this. Do you want them to love you because you feel lonely, you miss them, you want to reconnect, or you want someone in your life? Do you regret your actions and want to deal with the guilt? Are you feeling disconnected and wanting more closeness?Imagine your ideal circumstance. If you know what you want from them, you might have a good reason to seek their love.
You may find out that you don't have a great reason. Maybe you miss how good it felt to be loved, but don't really want to get back together. In this case, leave them alone.
Be clear why you want this person’s love and help that motivate you to win their affection.;
, If you haven’t spoken in a bit, you may wish to reach out. While it’s okay to establish a connection through a text or message, make sure you speak in person. This way, nothing can get lost in translation and you can be in each other’s presence. If they are hesitant to see you, then wait some time and try again. If they agree to meet you, this is a promising first step.


See what it’s like to be with them and what emotions it brings up for both of you. Does it seem likely that you can win back their love?

, If you want to make someone love you again, make sure they are at least open to returning to a loving relationship with you. If they are distant or angry with you, don’t get your hopes up. You may need to give some space. If they have told you that being loving toward you won’t happen again, don’t try to convince them. Respect their decision and let them know that you are open to being in a loving relationship with them.If they are clear that they do not want to love you, say, “I respect your decision, even if I feel differently. Please know that this is what I want and I’m leaving the door open if you want to reconsider.”

The time and effort involved in fixing any meal demonstrates a certain level of care when that meal is prepared for someone else, though, and that alone can speak volumes about how much you love him.


For something extra special, find out what his favorite meal is and try making that. You should occasionally cook other things, as well, but mastering his favorites will show him that your efforts are for his sake.;
, Every relationship comes with some sort of financial burden. Oftentimes, the man in the relationship takes on the majority of that burden. Even if he is happy to do so, you can still show some consideration for his needs and his situation by offering to chip in every now and then. He may or may not take you up on the offer, but knowing that you would be just as willing to pay for him as he is for you can reassure him that you love being with him for his sake, and not simply because he pampers you.


Know when to back off. Some guys like taking on the role of financial provider, and if that dynamic works for your relationship, you do not need to push him into letting you pay the way. Make the offer, and if he politely declines, then leave things at that.

, Chances are, there is at least one thing your guy enjoys doing that you find little to no enjoyment in. Figure out what that hobby is and tell him that you want to do it together. When the day of the event or activity arrives, attend without complaint. Your willingness to put his needs above your wants demonstrates your love for him.


For example, offer to see his favorite band in concert even if you hate their music, or ask him to take you to see his favorite baseball team play even if you think that sports are boring.

, When the two of you are apart, pick up the phone and call him. This is important even if the two of you live together and are only apart during working hours. A quick phone call just to let him know that he's on your mind will tell him that you're still “with him” even when the two of you are physically miles apart.


Know when enough is enough, of course. A call once during the workday can be sweet, but a call every hour can be a bother.

, A love letter is a great idea if the two of you live apart, but if you live together or otherwise see each other every day, try dropping a quick note into his pants pocket or suitcase when he isn't looking. When he stumbles upon the note later in the day, it'll probably bring a smile to his face.

, If your man has a favorite snack or food he loves, buy it and bring it over, especially if you know he's had a long day or has been under a lot of stress. It is a simple gesture, but one packed with plenty of consideration, and that consideration is what lets your man know that you love him.


If you happen to be a good cook, you could make the treat instead of buying it.
A favorite treat can be something sweet and indulgent, like a quart of his favorite ice cream, or it can be something more practical, like a pizza or a meal from a favorite take-out place.

, The longer two people are together in a relationship, the more likely they are to fall into a routine. A kiss or similar expression of affection can highlight the sincerity of that gesture when delivered at an unexpected time.


Kiss him on the cheek or lips as you walk past him, or give him an affectionate squeeze on the arm under the same circumstances.
Try playing footsie underneath the table at a restaurant or grabbing his hand when you walk down the street.

, Read up on what to do, then surprise your man after a long day by offering to massage his troubles away. The thoughtfulness of the gesture might speak volumes on its own, but since a massage is also a physically intimate act, it tells your man that you appreciate and love his body, as well.

, One of the simplest ways to make a man feel loved is to directly tell him, “I love you.” A direct expression of love and affection may seem hollow when there are no actions to back it, but it is still an important sentiment to convey in words. It is the statement that focuses all your loving actions into one clear, obvious meaning.


Mix things up.Saying ""I love you"" is important, but there are other sentiments you can use to express your love just as meaningfully. Try something like, ""I'm grateful you're in my life,"" ""I am so in love with you,"" or ""You're incredibly important to me.""

, Men hear these sorts of things less often, but as visual creatures, they usually like to know that you have your eyes appreciatively on them as much as they have their eyes on you.


For instance, if he plays a lot of sports and you usually go to cheer him on, tell him something like, “I love watching you as you play basketball” or “I love the way your body looks when you're playing.”
If he is more of the artistic sort and is not physically active, you could compliment his body by telling him something like, “I love watching your hands as you play the piano.”
Even simple compliments like “I love staring into your eyes” or “I could stare at your smile all day” can work wonders.

, Tell him that he turns you on. In strong romantic relationships, emotional love and physical love walk hand-in-hand. You need to express your love on an emotional level, but you also need to express it on a physical level. Telling him how much you love his body and love having it pressed against you is important.


Of course, you can usually convey this sentiment with body language and behavior. As with emotional love, though, saying how you feel in straightforward words can be just as important.

, When the two of you are around other people, sing his praises. Talk about how great he is at his job, how passionate he is about his hobbies, or how great he is at making you feel loved. These are all great things to say to his face, but telling them to another person in front of him lets him know how proud you are to be at his side.

, Express your gratitude often and earnestly. “Thank you” should be part of your daily exchanges. Tell him how much you appreciate a kind gesture when he does something thoughtful. If there is something he has done for you habitually that you do not usually thank him for, go out of your way to tell him that you appreciate that gesture, even if you do not always say as much.

, Every couple fights. When you have an argument, be the first to apologize, even if you were not at fault. You do not need to be the first to apologize every time, but you should be the first to do so sometimes. An apology lets him know that he is more important to you than your own ego, and it also tells him that your relationship is something you want to fight together for.


This does not mean that you should allow him to walk all over you. If you sense that he will never apologize to you without you apologizing first, or worse, see that he does not apologize to you even when you do offer the first “I'm sorry,” there might be an underlying problem in your relationship that you need to analyze and remedy.

, When life gets stressful, simply tell him, “I'm here for you.” He may still hesitate to show you his weak side, but telling him that you love him even when he feels weak can be incredibly reassuring.

, Serious problems in your relationship need to be addressed, but avoid nagging him, embarrassing, or making him feel ashamed for trivial reasons.


A statement meant to shame is critical without being constructive. For instance, “You're so cold; do you even have any feelings at all?” would be a statement meant to shame. On the other hand, “I feel hurt when you walk away without telling me what's wrong,” is a statement that addresses the actual hurtful behavior and opens the problem up for discussion.

, Do not make him feel like he has to beg for your attention. Make it absolutely clear to him that he is one of the most important parts of your life.

, Kiss him hello, goodbye, good morning, and good night. Cuddle against him when the two of you are side-by-side. Linger in his embrace when the two of you hug. Physical affection demonstrates physical love, and this physical dimension of love is just as important to a guy as the emotional dimension when he is involved in a romantic relationship.

, This is important no matter how long the two of you have been together, but it is especially important if the two of you have just begun falling in love with each other. Find out about his likes and dislikes. Ask him about his past or his plans for the future. Getting to know him deeply and thoroughly lets him know that you are really serious about him.


Part of getting to know a guy also means letting him talk about the things that interest him at length, even when they do not interest you. Your conversation should never be completely one-sided in his favor, though. If you want your relationship to be healthy, you need to make sure that both of you are allowed time to talk about things that are important to you as individuals.

, If you've never met them, ask your man to introduce you to the other important people in his life. Once you do meet them, go out of your way to connect with them. Welcoming these people into your own life demonstrates a desire to further connect his life to yours.


At the same time, you need to make sure that you let him spend time with these people away from you, as well, especially where his friends are concerned. Sometimes your guy might actually crave “guy time” with his buddies, so you need to let him have it.

, Sometimes, your man might need to get away from the world for a while. If you lets you, then hide away with him. He may not feel like talking about what's wrong and he might act a little indifferent to you, but simply being there with him when he wants to shut the rest of the world out completely will make you a safe, comforting presence in his mind.

, If your relationship has been going on for quite some time, the two of you may have reached a point at which you are so relaxed around each other that you no longer feel the need to glam yourself up for a date with him. Every so often, though, you should surprise him by slipping on your most flattering dress and putting on a little makeup. Greet him, and when he offers you a compliment or appreciative stare, let him know that you put the extra effort in just for him.

, If your relationship is already physically intimate in nature, make sure that you meet his desires and needs as often as he meets yours. This does not mean that you need to let him “have his way with you” regardless of how you feel. It does, however, mean that you need to spend time satisfying him even when you do not find the experience equally remarkable.


Note that this step should only be considered if your relationship has reached a physically intimate stage at a natural pace that both of you are comfortable with. Do not feel pressured into becoming physically intimate with a guy if you are not yet ready for that step.

, Eye contact is important for creating a connection with somebody else. Most importantly, you must learn how to make proper eye contact. There is no “right way” to make eye contact overall. Instead, tune in to the person’s eye contact. Do they make frequent eye contact, meet your eyes then look away, or maintain a steady gaze? Mimic their style so that they feel connected to you.For example, if the person likes to make constant eye contact, they may think your fleeting eye contact is dismissive, while someone who prefers less eye contact might find your steady gaze intimidating.

, It’s hard to get someone’s love if you’re only texting or emailing. Spend time together away from talking about what went wrong or is going wrong. Do activities you know you enjoy.

Compliment on the person’s creative work.
Compliment on the person’s good looks.
Compliment on the person’s wonderful character.

Man: ""I wish I get a girl like you who could bake a pie as good as this!""
Woman: ""I wish I am lucky enough to get a guy who can fix a computer as efficiently as you!""
General: ""Every time we spend time together, I feel so happy. I wish I could be happy like this forever.""

Be an active listener when your grandparent is telling you stories about your family history or about her memories. Ask questions and make comments that prove that you are listening.
Respond appropriately to her requests or commands. If she asks you to do a task, then you should do it.

, Your grandparent grew up in a different time period, where societal norms and values were different. Be aware of what habits might irritate your grandparent.

Understand that eye contact varies depending on culture.",How to Maintain Eye Contact1," Eye contact will come a lot more easily if you feel at ease. Try not to get yourself too stressed out. Stay focused on what you are trying to convey in words. As you get into a conversational rhythm with the person you are talking to you will become more comfortable and more able to make eye contact.;

Replacing eye contact with non-verbal cues is a great way to assure the other person you are paying attention.

Be willing to leave your shell.",How to Maintain a Relationship with an Extrovert," It’s important for any couple to have open and honest communication, but this is especially true if you have different personalities. Make an effort to understand your partner’s needs and respect them, even if they are different than yours. This can help you understand your partner better and not take things personally.Be honest about how much time you want to spend together, when you want to be close, and when you’d like to be alone, Tell your partner that these preferences help you function better and can help you be a better partner when your needs are met.
Say, “How often do you want people at the house, and how often would you like to spend time with friends each week? Your needs may differ from mine, and it feels important to talk about it.”;
, If you keep finding that an extroverted partner wants to go out while you want to stay in, have a discussion about social limits in the relationship. What is a workable amount of days to go out each week or month?Talk about your social limits within the relationship ahead of time to avoid fights or disappointments. For example, if going to dinner with friends every week sounds overwhelming, then you might agree to join friends twice each month and your partner can join them weekly.
If both partners are extroverts, you may want to have social time separately (like you spending time with your friends and your partner spending time with his or hers) so that you don’t spend all of your time together.

, Extroverts tend to prefer and increase energy by engaging with external things, while introverts tend to prefer and gain energy by engaging with the internal world. Keep this in mind as you move forward in your relationship and do activities together. An extrovert may love having dinner parties, yet, if you’re an introvert, you may feel drained. Make compromises that appeal to both of your needs, such as limiting dinner parties to once a month, or staying for half of the party.Compromise on social engagements and time spent together. An extrovert may want to spend lots of time together, but if you’re an introvert you may want some quiet time or alone time. Find a way to balance both of your needs.

, Extroverts may tend to approach conflict through confrontation and problem-solving while introverts tend to shy away from conflicts. In turn, introverts may feel harassed or nagged while the extrovert may feel like he or she is being stonewalled.If you are an introvert, be willing to engage in conflict with your partner, and realize that your partner likely wants to find a resolution, not argue.


If your partner is quick to discuss issues and it irritates you, ask your partner to thoughtfully consider the issue before immediately bringing it up. Some things are better left unsaid or can be worked out on their own.
Likewise, if you’re both extroverted, don’t bring every little thing to the surface. Count to ten or ask yourself some questions before going to your partner, such as, “Will this help improve our relationship?”

, In addition to understanding your conflict styles, be honest about what conflicts are like for you. If you’re an introvert, let your partner know what sets you off or shuts you down. You can encourage your extroverted partner to give you a nudge to open up or respond back.If you’re introverted, say, “I tend to shut down when you are upset. I know that doesn’t help us solve our problems, so please gently invite me to engage the situation, even if I seem mad and upset.”
If you are both extroverted, you may want to approach conflicts when you are each calm and settled. Don’t let anger flare up and don’t jump into discussions that could be better if you slowed down.

, If both partners are unwilling to compromise and continue to butt heads, this may be a relationship issue. For example, an introvert may retreat as a way to avoid problems in the relationship while the extrovert may spend more time with friends to avoid problems. If you’ve tried to find compromises but your partner won’t budge, consider the longevity of your relationship and how the changes you want will affect it.Talk to your partner about your efforts and how you feel about not finding compromises. Say, “It’s important that we find some degree of resolution about our differences, and I want us to treat each other with respect.”

, If the problems continue to come up despite your best efforts, it may be time to see a therapist.A therapist can help you work through problems and see things more clearly from your partner’s perspective. You may learn new ways to approach or interact with your partner or try new things to understand your partner’s needs better.


Seeing a therapist doesn’t mean your relationship is doomed or that you should be ashamed that you are struggling. It’s brave to ask for help and take steps to improve your relationship.

, Extroverts may have a difficult slowing down their talking, as talking can be a way to process emotions and thoughts. Extroverts also tend to interrupt others or dominate conversations. Take turns talking and listening and try to find a balance. Let your partner talk and express himself or herself without interrupting or derailing the conversation. Then, talk turns back and forth dividing the attention., While an extrovert may want to go to lively places, an introvert may feel overwhelmed with too much stimulation. Find a compromise by going out to a quiet place. That way, the extrovert can enjoy going out while the introvert can enjoy spending time with the person without feeling overwhelmed.Choose a low-key activity such as going for a walk or a hike. Choose quiet places for dinner and go camping somewhere remote.

, If you are an introvert, then having people show up for dinner on short notice might be really stressful for you. You might feel like you need time to prepare yourself and store up energy for the visitors. However, an extrovert is more likely to feel comfortable with people dropping by any time.

To avoid any uncomfortable situations, let your partner know that you need advance notice before people come over. For example, you might request at least a few hours of advance notice before people come over.

, Levels of preferred stimulation vary from extroverts to introverts. An extrovert may enjoy big cities full of things to do, flashing lights, lots of people, and lots of noises. To an introvert, this may be absolute torture and he or she may prefer a quiet, comfortable room to read in instead. If you and your partner clash in your level of stimulation, find some humor instead of frustration.Instead of telling each other to change, recognize that differences exist and approach them lightheartedly.


If one person’s morning routine is rushed and chaotic while the other’s is slow and methodical, don’t say, “Hurry up!” or, “Slow down!” Instead, recognize that you approach the same thing differently and laugh together.

, If you’re an introvert, you may shy away from attention and social situations. Allow yourself to be challenged and open up to your extroverted partner little by little. Be curious to things you’ve never noticed before and open-minded in the way your partner stretches you.If your partner challenges you to explore new things, say yes. Be open to the opportunity to learn something new or have a new experience.

Practice using the television.,
Give each person attention.,
Don’t let people's expressions faze you.,
Keep your eye contact head on.",How to Maintain Eye Contact2," Find a talk show that features multiple people in a still frame. As each person talks, focus your eyes on their eyes. This is a great way to practice maintaining eye contact in a group., If you are speaking you have to make sure that you switch your eye contact between all the people you are talking to. If you only maintain eye contact with one person then the others will feel like they are not a part of the conversation.


Try looking at one person per sentence and then switching when you start your next sentence., If you are talking to an audience and you make eye contact with someone who is frowning or shaking their head at what you are saying, don’t be thrown. Maintain eye contact with this person for three or four seconds just like you would with everyone else. Maybe even throw in a smile just so they know you are taking their nonverbal criticism good-naturedly. Then move onto the next person unflustered.If making eye contact with so many people makes you nervous, try looking at the tops of their heads. From a short distance, they can't tell the difference.
People will naturally have different opinions on what you are saying but maintaining eye contact is important regardless of what they think. This establishes a subconscious connectionthat is vital in social situations.

, Don’t look at people out of the corner of your eye as you talk to the group. Move your whole head to face theirs when you make eye contact.Making eye contact out of the corner of your eye is not much better than making no eye contact at all.

Maintain a balance in the conversation.,
Be self aware.,
Don't feel put off by the end of the conversation.,
Allow yourself to disagree.",How to Maintain Eye Contact3," You shouldn't be speaking too much and you shouldn't be forcing the other person to hold the entire conversation either. Try to maintain a balance by responding to what the other person is saying rather than waiting for your turn to speak.


Giving positive feedback during the conversation is very helpful. For example, if the person tells you something say ""oh, interesting. Can you tell me more?"", Self awareness is key to effective communication. You have to understand that while your ten year old cat may be a very important part of your life, other people don't necessarily want to hear about it constantly. Understand what is of interest to others and react according to the way that they respond.You don't only have to use stories from your own life as you make conversation. Don't be afraid to talk about anecdotes that you read or heard from someone else. This will show that you are willing to pay attention to and talk about topics other than yourself., All conversations end at some point, so don't feel discouraged if you stop talking with someone. If you have had a good conversation with someone you don't need to force it to continue along. Gracefully end the conversation.


For example, say something like ""it was good talking to you, we should hang out again sometime"", or ""hope to chat again soon"".This will end the conversation on a positive and comfortable note.

, One myth about communication or good social skills is that you are not allowed to disagree with the person you're talking with. This is entirely untrue.. You shouldn't disagree in an impolite or aggressive way, but being willing to express your own opinion will make the conversation more interesting. It will also last longer.


Talking about sports is a good example of polite disagreement. Someone might say, I think this player is the best player in the league right now. If you don't agree you can say something like, ""I'm not so sure, have you seen this other player play? He is having a really good year this year. I think he may have passed your player by."" This is a polite way of disagreeing that will spark debate without offending the person."

Stock your kitchen with healthy foods.",How to Maintain Healthy Eating Habits After a Breakup1," The stress of a breakup can affect your food preferences. You may crave more fat and sugar, even if your diet doesn’t normally include much of them.Making smart food choices throughout the day—at home, restaurants, or cafeterias— can help you maintain your healthy diet after a breakup.Focus on heart friendly fats like avocado, nuts, and oils. They can fill up your belly and kill cravings for junk food. Add these to foods you cook at home or select dishes with them at restaurants. Taking a lap around a cafeteria before making your choice(s) can also help you make smart choices.Make yourself a big salad if you can’t find anything healthy. Choose sources of protein such chicken, tuna, or tofu with lots of colorful vegetables. Selecting crunchy vegetables can also help beat any stress or anxiety you’re feeling.;

It can also fill your belly with liquid so that you don’t crave junk foods. Green, black, and oolong teas come with the added benefit of theanine, a chemical that can calm your mind. Keep a pot of tea by your side after a breakup to soothe yourself and keep your belly full.Recognize that green, black, and oolong teas contain caffeine. Drinking too many cups of these kinds of tea may make you jittery. Consider mixing these types of teas with fruit or herbal infusion teas including yerba mate., One of the best ways to maintain your diet after a breakup is keeping your kitchen stocked with healthy choices. Keeping nutrient-rich foods on hand can reinforce your healthy eating habits. It can also keep you from reaching for a bag of chips or cookies instead of something like fresh fruit.Have a variety of frozen fruits and vegetables, which are as healthy as fresh food, ready to use at any time. You can incorporate them into dishes such as a smoothie, stir fry, and soup.Stock non-perishable foods including pastas, beans, oatmeal, nuts, and rice to cook quick and easy meals.Keep a small selection of perishable dairy and meat products to use in meals. Select low fat choices including yogurt, cheese, and fish.
Maintain a selection of healthy oils and spices to jazz up your meals a bit. This may also brighten how you’re feeling."

Learn to laugh at yourself.,
Act confident.,
Own it.,
Blow it off.",How to Stop Your Friends from Making Fun of You1," It can be really hard to do this when you're feeling embarrassed and self-conscious, but it is a very important step. Kids can be very cruel at times, and are often much more thoughtless in their dealings with each other than adults generally are. If you become visibly upset, it brings out the mean streak in some people – and they will tease you even worse.


It's especially important to learn to laugh it off if you've made an obvious, public mistake, like spilling a drink, tripping over something, or dropping something you are carrying.
Notice how popular kids handle this situation. Typically, they'll make a joke out of it right away (“What is wrong with me today? I'm tripping all over everything!”) They'll probably still get teased by their friends for being a ditz – this happens in the “cool” cliques, too. Then, after a minute, they'll roll their eyes and tell their friends to knock it off...and they'll all start talking about something else.
Let yourself off the hook. Everyone does something embarrassing once in awhile. Try to put it out of your head, and genuinely move on – this will cue the people around you that it's not a thing, any longer.
This will feel unnatural at first, so you just have to force yourself to do it. It gets easier with a little practice!;
, You don't necessarily need to feel confident all the time, but do your best to look that way; if you appear more confident, you are less likely to be made fun of. People find confidence intimidating. If they can't predict what you're going to say, they aren't going to risk teasing you – they know they'll look like an idiot if you have a clever comeback.


Try to slow down your speech. When you're nervous, you tend to speak faster...slow it down, and you will come across as more confident.Watch your body language. It may sound clichéd, but try to stand straight with your shoulders back and your chin up. Not only will this make you look more confident, you'll actually feel more confident as well.Strike up a conversation with your elderly next-door neighbor, or one of your mom's friends, or your friend's little brother. Talk to people who you know won't tease you, and when your friends aren't around to make you nervous. The more practice you have, the easier it will be to talk to people in more stressful situations.
Keep in mind that people probably aren't paying as much attention to you as you think. All the kids around you – including the most popular – are completely self-obsessed. They're too busy worrying that they will say something dumb around someone they like, or that their friends will notice they're having a bad hair day, to be paying a lot of attention to you. So don't automatically worry that everyone is looking at you when you enter a room. In most cases, they aren't.

, Sometimes you can turn teasing into an advantage, if it's something that really doesn't bother you very much, or if you suspect you're being teased because someone is jealous of you. A great example of this is when guys tease their guy friends for dressing up, especially if they think he's trying to impress a girl. Instead of getting upset, he can simply own it by saying something like, “Yep, it's a new hat, all right...and I look good in it, too!”

, There is a trick to this approach, but if you can master it, it is extremely effective in a lot of different types of uncomfortable social situations. When you're being teased, Instead, play it cool and look mildly annoyed but not angry. Inside, try thinking something like, “Okay, kids. Fun's enough, grow up already.”


Don't ignore their banter completely, or it will look like you are upset and taking things too seriously.
Don't agree with them and put yourself down, or it will encourage them to be more mean.

Write a weekly meal plan.,
Enjoy healthy foods at restaurants.,
Let yourself cheat occasionally.,
Drink alcohol in moderation—or not at all.",How to Maintain Healthy Eating Habits After a Breakup2," Having a meal plan can keep your healthy habits on track. It can also help you avoid unhealthy behaviors. As you deal with the emotional and physical impact of your breakup, compose a meal plan each week to ensure that you continue your healthy eating habits.Prepare as many of your own meals as possible to avoid triggers such as rich pastas or booze. Review your meal plan to ensure each meal has a variety of vitamins and nutrients.
Start your day with a healthy breakfast. Pack your lunch or pick out a dish from an online menu before you go to a restaurant.Include restaurant meals, exercise, rest and other activities such as seeing friends on your plan. These can help you feel better in addition to maintaining your healthy eating habits.Be aware of places you may be more likely to indulge and stress-related food cravings. Avoid putting these in your meal plan to keep you on track.

, Visiting with friends can often soothe the blow of a breakup. Many people get together with friends for meals at restaurants. You also may simply not feel like cooking. If you are going to a restaurant, it can derail your otherwise healthy habits. Consciously staying away from certain foods at restaurants can help maintain your good eating habits.Steer clear of unhealthy offerings such as breadbaskets, buffets, dishes in heavy sauces, and fried foods.Choose healthy options such as salads, steamed vegetables, lean steaks, and fish. Select fruit for dessert or share a piece of fruit pie or cake with a friend.

, Some days you may just feel like giving in to your food cravings. No person is perfect and sometimes it’s ok to indulge yourself. Allowing yourself an occasional cheat day won’t set you off track and may help you maintain your healthy diet in the longer term.Incorporate a cheat day or two into your weekly meal plan. You may want your cheat day to be when you’re spending time with friends or don’t have any plans and can stay at home and eat to your heart’s content.
Eat whatever you want on your cheat day without guilt or worry. This may help you feel better about your breakup or drown out bad feelings you’re having.

, Alcohol can alter feelings and perception. You may reach to booze to drown out the feelings you have after a breakup. However, alcohol is a depressant and may actually make you feel worse. In addition, it can derail your healthy eating habits because it lowers your inhibitions and ability to metabolize food properly.Have no more than one drink per day if you are a woman and two if you are a man.Stick to low calorie drinks such as wine spritzer or light beer. Steer clear of calorie bombs such as mixed cocktails.

Get regular exercise.,
Draw on your support system.,
Seek professional help.",How to Maintain Healthy Eating Habits After a Breakup3," Breakups can cause you to feel sad and maybe even depressed. This often fuels behaviors that cause you to overindulge on food. Regular exercise can help you feel better by boosting feel-good chemicals in your brain. It may also keep you on track with your healthy eating habits and ward off weight gain.Exercise most days of the week for at least 30 minutes. Do activities you enjoy. This may include walking, running, swimming, or kayaking.Invite friends to go along with you, which can also boost your mood. Recognize that exercise or other types of activity may introduce you to new people who can help you forget your ex.

, Many people feel lonely after a breakup. You may feel like staying at home and binging on television and foods. Instead, spend time with loved ones. They can help you deal with your feelings but may also distract you from overindulging on food and derailing your diet.Recognize that spending time with loved ones has similar effects as exercise—it boosts your feel good hormones.
Do things with your loved ones that you enjoy. This might include trying new activities, going to the movies, or just grabbing coffee. Talk to your loved ones about your feelings if it helps.

, You may find that your feelings of sadness don’t go away with exercise or spending time with loved ones. These feelings may make the desire to overindulge in foods that aren’t a part of your usually healthy diet bigger. In these cases, seek treatment with a mental health professional. A doctor can help you work through your feelings, which may ultimately keep your healthy eating habits on track."

Search for the good in this person.,
Look for the root cause of this person's behavior.,
Meet anger with kindness.,
Set a positive example for others.,
Listen to this person.,
Recognize the signs of mental/personality disorders.,
Recognize the signs of trauma and abuse.",How to Love the Unlovable1," When dealing with someone that you consider to be unlovable, your first step should be to take a step back and try to reflect on the person as whole. Ask yourself: Is this person really unlovable? Does she actively resist efforts to love her, or is she just a little awkward and standoffish? Does this person really have no positive traits, or have I just not taken the time to look for any?"" Try to think of ways — even small ways — in which this person has proven that they're not all bad. These can be minor acts of kindness they've performed, talents they've demonstrated, or even simply nice things they've said.


Trying to love someone is much easier if you don't start by viewing them as ""unlovable"" to begin with. This is why it's such a good idea to look for some minor positive aspect of the person you're trying to love. By identifying this person's positive qualities, you're disassociating her from the ""unlovable"" label in your mind.;
, It's much easier to love someone who reacts to your efforts to reach out with anger or frustration if you have some sort of idea why this person acts this way. Some people push others away because they've been hurt in the past and are afraid of opening themselves up to the same kind of pain, while others may simply not know how to interact warmly because they were never taught. Finally, it's also worth noting that some people may act unlovable due to a genuine personality disorder or mental illness or as the result of abuse. In any of these cases, understanding why someone who acts so difficult does this can make it much easier to love them.


One way to learn why an unlovable person acts the way she does is to simply get to know her. In this case, you may want to read the section below on reaching out to unlovable people. However, if this person is so difficult to be around that making a connection with her is virtually impossible, you may want to try gently broaching the subject with people who know her, like her friends (assuming there are any), family, peers, roommates, and so on.

, If the unlovable person you're dealing with has a tendency to lash out at you whenever you try to connect with him, resist the urge to retaliate. Anyone who's earned the label of being ""unlovable"" is probably more than used to bearing the brunt of other people's snide remarks, insults, and verbal abuse, so this will get you nowhere. Instead, make an effort to be kind to this person. React to his hostility with a smile, a kind remark, or even an offer to help with whatever's bothering him. Since this is probably an uncommon experience for him, it may surprise him, opening him up to further conversation. At the very least, it will prove to him that not everyone will meet his anger with their own.


For instance, let's say that you're walking down the hall at school when you notice a student with a reputation as an angry, awkward social outcast approaching you. You say, ""Hi!"" and he glowers at you angrily. Here, if you can, you'll want to react positively without missing a beat. Smiling and saying ""Have a good day!"", for instance, may seem a little cheesy for an ordinary social interaction, but to this person, it may be the only kind thing anyone's said to him all day.

, As hinted at above, people who are thought of as ""unlovable"" often are the subject of jokes, derision, and outright verbal abuse. This sort of negative attention can discourage them from having positive social interactions with others, leading to a vicious cycle where the negative actions of otherwise decent, normal people reinforce the behavior of the ""unlovable"" person. In these sorts of cases, changing the actions of the people around the unlovable person, rather than concentrating solely on the unlovable person, can do serious good. Try to encourage them to follow your example of treating the unlovable person with kindness even when she's being difficult.


For instance, let's say you're sitting in a classroom waiting for your professor to arrive with the social outcast from the example above and a few popular kids. If you get the chance, you may want to set the precedent of treating the outcast with kindness by trying to strike up friendly conversation with him before the popular kids even have a chance to ridicule him. Even if he reacts negatively, you'll have the chance to set the example of meeting this sort of anger with your own kindness.

, Some social outcasts and ""unlovable"" people act the way they do because they feel like they can't make genuine connections with other people and, on the rare occasions when they do, they're not listened to. While it can be difficult to pinpoint the ""signal"" of what an unlovable person actually is trying to express in the ""noise"" of the hostility they may bring to their interactions with you, making it clear that you're trying to do so can be enough to make an impression.


For instance, let's say that, at lunch, you sit next to the social outcast from the example situations above because you notice that he's in the corner by himself. At first, he gives you the silent treatment, but eventually he sneers, ""Geez, can't you tell I want to be left alone?"" You might try responding calmly with something like, ""Hey, I'm sorry, I actually couldn't tell — I was just trying to trying to get to know new people. I'll leave if you want, though."" This person probably won't immediately apologize and ask you to stay, but, at the very least, he may realize that you've actually taken what he's just said into account, rather than ignoring him or dismissing his words.

, Unfortunately, some people with a reputation for being ""unlovable"" act the way they do because of a genuine biological problem that makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for them to behave the way most people do. In these cases, the ""unlovable"" person's bad behavior may not be a matter of choice, so reacting negatively may not merely be ill-advised, but cruel. If you think that someone with an ""unlovable"" reputation is exhibiting any of the following disorders and is not receiving help, contact an appropriate authority like a counselor, social worker, or priest. You may also seek to speak with their trusted contact before disclosing any information about them:


Clinical Depression: Sometimes causes irritability, sadness, lack of motivation, self-loathing, and reckless behavior.Antisocial Personality Disorder: Can cause a lack of concern for others' feelings, irritability and aggression, poor impulse control, a lack of guilt or remorse, and callous, selfish behavior.Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Can cause an inflated sense of self-worth, an excessive sense of entitlement, envy of others, a strong desire to be admired, a lack of empathy, and excessive anger in response to insults or slights.Avoidant Personality Disorder: Can cause an extreme fear of being embarrassed or rejected, an excessively meek and restrained personality, constant anxiety, a fear of risk-taking, and awkwardness in social situations.

, Perhaps most tragic of all ""unlovable"" individuals are those who became the way they are because of some sort of external trauma or abuse. Extremely traumatic experiences, especially during childhood, can have marked impacts on the way a person, thinks, behaves, and perceives the person around her. While it can be difficult for an inexperienced person to pinpoint the signs of past abuse, seeing any of the signs below are cause for immediate concern and intervention, so contact a qualified professional (like a teacher, counselor, social worker, etc.) immediately.


Physical abuse: Unexplained or mysterious injuries or illnesses. Injuries often justified as ""accidents"". May dress in clothing designed to hide marks of injury (long sleeves, sunglasses, etc.) and/or miss work, school, or social outings.Emotional abuse: Low self-esteem, anxiety, and social withdrawal. If in the context of a relationship, this person may be overly anxious to please their partner, may avoid going out without their partner, may have restricted access to their family, friends, and/or possessions, and may have to frequently ""check in"" with their partner."

Learn to tease back.,
Throw it back at them, in a light-hearted way.,
Take notes.,
Use the “Yes, and...” method.",How to Stop Your Friends from Making Fun of You2," An important life skill is the ability to joke back with others without being too mean. A certain amount of making fun is a part of life. If you can joke a bit, and give as good as you get, others won't pick on you so much.Some people tease their friends, and their boyfriends or girlfriends, out of affection – they really do think they are being funny. They will admire you if you can tease them back without getting upset.

, If a friend has suddenly started teasing you about a boy, for example, you could say, “Why are you suddenly so interested in my love life, anyway?” Or, if they have been poking fun of your new look, you can say something like, “When did my hair cut become the most fascinating thing this group has to talk about?”, Pay attention when you are around someone who is good at deflecting criticism, and can toss back witty remarks when they are being teased. Notice how they deal with it, what kind of things they say, and the reaction they get. When you're being teased, you can think to yourself, “What would this person say in this situation?”

, Your friends might be teasing you because they sense that you are changing, and they are afraid you will outgrow them. They are mocking you because it is easier than evolving along with you – change can be scary. If you can match their joke by taking it even further, it shows them that you are still the same person inside and there is no need to feel threatened.Your friend teases you for wearing a new leather jacket, saying, “What's up, Fonzie?” You say, “Yeah, and...I'm not stopping there. Tomorrow I'm jumping my motorcycle over a shark tank.”
You're wearing a new scarf. Your friend says, “Dude! Is that your girlfriend's scarf?” You say, “Sure is! And...I'm wearing her undies, too.”

Tell them it bothers you.,
Ask them if something is bothering them.,
Figure out why they're doing it.,
Be willing to let it go.",How to Stop Your Friends from Making Fun of You3," A little bit of teasing is normal among friends, but if it is happening so often that it bothers you, it's probably gotten out of hand. Your friends may not even know how much it bothers you. Be sure to confront each friend alone, away from the group. If you try to shut it down while it's happening, it may just make the teasing worse.


Be clear about your expectations. Was there a particular incident that bothered you? What could he or she have done differently, that would have been okay with you?
Remember teasing is part of some people's personalities – your friend might not be able to avoid teasing you ever again. Don't try to force them to make a promise you know they won't be able to keep. You'll both end up resenting each other.
Try to be specific. If there is a specific subject you'd like to make off-limits, ask if she will avoid teasing you about it. Or, if there is a certain friend who always seems to egg your friend on, ask your friend if she has ever noticed this happening – ask her to look out for it, in the future.
Avoid blaming your friend, as this will just make them defensive. Avoid saying things like, “Why are you always so mean to me?” Instead, try something like, “It really bothers me when people tease me about my weight – would you please back me up when everyone starts doing that?”
Let them know that as long as they are trying to work on things, you'll let them off the hook. Say something like, “We've been friends for ages, right? This is the only thing that bugs me...if you can just try to pay attention in the future, we're good.”
If you know you sometimes overreact to teasing, or you're having difficulty laughing things off when you know you should – tell your friend you are working on it. Say, “I know I can be really sensitive sometimes, and I'm trying to work on it. Can you maybe go easy on me, until I develop a thicker skin?”But don't let them off the hook, if they are being a jerk. Sometimes people cover their bullying by telling their victim, “Hey, lighten up!” or “Get a sense of humor!” Don't blame yourself, if this is what's happening.

, Some people tease because they have a problem with you and they aren't brave enough to confront you about it. They will try to slip it into the conversation, pretending it's a joke. If you suspect this is the situation, take your friend aside one-on-one and just ask them if there is something they want to talk about. Tell them their teasing has come across as kind of mean spirited, lately, and you'd like to know the reason why.Use this approach with friends who suddenly start teasing you, or if their normal light teasing has become cruel.
It might be that there is a miscommunication between you two, and once you clear it up, the teasing will stop completely.

, Sometimes friends tease you because they feel threatened by you, if they think you are becoming more popular than they are. They are just trying to get attention from the group, even if it's negative attention. They think if they make you feel small, they will look better.If you are suddenly getting teased more than usual, and you can't figure out why, it might be because people are beginning to see you as more attractive or more confident than you used to be – in this is the case, cheer up, it could be a good thing!
Think about whether something has happened in your friend's life to make them feel insecure. They may be lashing out to deflect attention away from themselves. It might not be you at all.

, Avoid making too big a deal out of it, and don't demand an apology. A good friend will apologize without being asked, once they realize you are truly upset. But if you try to force them to feel bad when they don't think it's a big deal, they will only resent you for it. If you want to remain friends, tell them that as long as they tone down the teasing, things will be okay between you.


If they continue to tease you after agreeing to change, you may need to think about ending the relationship. Having toxic people in your life causes a lot of unnecessary stress.

Go on the offensive.,
Take control of the situation.,
Avoid making fun of anyone, ever.,
Report them.",How to Stop Your Friends from Making Fun of You4," As the saying goes, “The best defense is a good offense.” If you think you can pull it off, one way to avoid being teased is to stop it before it starts. If you always get teased by a certain person in 4th period, for example, try addressing them right when you sit down. In a casual, joking tone, say something like, “Oh, right – it's 2:00. It must be time to talk about my hair again.” The trick is to make your tormenter look like they are being boring and predictable.


If you can get the other person's friends to laugh with you, you can deflect their teasing onto the bully instead. People who pick on others a lot usually run in groups where they all tease each other, too.
The last thing a bully wants is to be embarrassed in front of his friends.

, If you feel confident you can handle a more aggressive tactic, you can try to take back control of the conversation. You may be able to calm them down if you can figure out their underlying motive for harassing you. Also, if you can figure out why they are bullying you, you may be able to find another way to work things out that doesn't involve fighting.Every time the bully asks a question, reply by asking her to explain herself. (“Why do you believe that?” or “What makes you think I did that?”)
Be careful not to lose your temper or come across as sarcastic, as this will only make them angrier.

, You immediately lose the moral high ground if you are caught teasing other people, even if you are teasing the friends who are the worst at teasing you. If you start to tease them, they will just think it's part of the game. Some kids actually enjoy teasing and don't mind giving it or getting it – these are usually tough girls with four older brothers. The minute you start making fun of other people, you become fair game. Defend yourself, but don't be cruel.

, If the situation gets too bad, and you can't find a way to get it under control, you may need to talk to a parent or teacher. They may be able to find a way to deal with the situation without anyone knowing it was you who said something.You have to be careful with this approach, because if the bully finds out you reported them, they will treat you even worse.
Your safety and your mental well-being are more important than your reputation. If you think a bully might become violent, you owe it to yourself – and to the other kids who are being abused – to say something.

Consider if you are overreacting.,
Release your emotions in a healthy way.,
Don’t ruminate.,
Practice self-care.,
Lean on other friends for support.",How to Tell a Close Friend You Feel Betrayed or Neglected1," It can be hard to swallow, but sometimes we feel betrayal or neglect due to overthinking or oversensitivity. Carefully weigh the context of what’s happening in your friendship before deciding what to do.


Reflect on the evidence. Is there some other way to describe your friend’s behavior? Are they overwhelmed with work? Have they been sick?
Consider your own state of mind. Are you going through a difficult time, and could that be clouding your judgement or perception when it comes to your friend's behavior?
Get a second opinion. Would someone else react the way you are?;
, Betrayal and neglect can lead to painful emotions, so it’s a smart idea to effectively express them. Holding in your pain can cause a blow up in your friendship later. Take some time before confronting your friend to let the dust settle and get your emotions out.Avoid unhealthy coping with food, sex, drugs or alcohol. Instead write in your journal, get some exercise, or listen to soothing music.
Wait until you feel more calm and re-centered before approaching your friend.

, When someone hurts you it may be second-nature to go over the event again and again in your mind. This is called rumination — an ineffective way of solving problems. Rumination only digs into the wound rather than giving it the opportunity to heal.Resist the urge to dwell on the betrayal or neglect. Use your energy to brainstorm solutions. How important was this betrayal? What do you want to do about it? Is it fairly minor and you want to let it go, or do you want to tell your friend how you feel?

, Self-compassion is a vital tool to leading a healthy and wholesome life. Self-care practices offer you the ability to nourish your mind, body, and soul when you’re stressed or hurting. Find a few self-care practices to help you through this upsetting time.Eat a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and sleep seven to nine hours each night to support your body.
Ease your mind by doing relaxation techniques such as mindful meditation or massage therapy.
Nourish your soul with activities like repeating positive affirmations, walking through nature, or praying.

, Although you may not want to share details of one friend’s betrayal with others, you can use this time to get support from existing friends. Social support is instrumental in helping you manage stress and improve your mood.Ask a few friends to get together for a sleepover or game night. Go see a new movie. Or, simply call up a close friend to talk.

Start by inviting this person to group events.,
Eventually build up to more intimate events.,
Don't be discouraged by negative reactions.",How to Love the Unlovable2," If you're trying to get an ""unlovable"" person to come out of his or her shell, hanging out one-on-one may be awkward and stressful for both of you. Instead, try inviting this person to an event where lots of people will be in attendance. At the event, do your best to make this person feel welcome, but try not to make her feel singled-out, as this can be terribly awkward and may discourage her from attending in the future.


For example, let's say you throw a party and invite the socially awkward outcast character from the examples above as a sign of goodwill. When he actually shows up, you're pleasantly surprised. However, you shouldn't make a huge production of welcoming him to the party or he'll get the idea that he's the center of attention, which, in his experience, has been a bad thing. Instead, welcome him exactly as you'd welcome any other acquaintance to the party. During the party, you might try starting a pleasant conversation with him, introducing him to your friends, and bringing him into group conversations if you sense he's being left out. He'll probably appreciate your help.

, Over time, as this ""unlovable"" person becomes more comfortable at group events, you may or may not find that he naturally opens up and becomes more pleasant to be around. If he does, you may cautiously try inviting him to events with fewer people where he'll be able to have more meaningful interactions with others. You shouldn't ever feel like you have to do this — in fact, acting like someone's a close friend when you actually don't care for him is disingenuous and unkind. However, if you are starting to get along with this formerly ""unlovable"" person, you shouldn't be discouraged from trying this out, either.


For instance, in our continuing example, if this person has reacted well to being invited to a few parties, you may want to invite him to hang out with a smaller, closer circle of friends when you go bowling or head to the bar. If he seems to continue to act well, you can probably safely proceed to as you would with any other friend.

, The steps above assume that you get good reactions after you invite a formerly ""unlovable"" person to hang out with you. It's also a possibility that you won't get a good reaction. The ""unlovable"" person may revert to her former behavior or start lashing out at people at the social event, making things awkward for others. In cases like these, you can cut your losses and refrain from inviting this person to any further social events, or, if their behavior becomes too distracting, you may want to kindly insist that they leave.


It's not necessarily cruel to stop inviting a difficult person to social events after she has already sabotaged a few — it's simply learning from experience. In cases like these, it's probably more stressful for everyone involved (including the ""unlovable"" person) for her to continue to attend.

Look for scriptural guidance.,
Show love to the unlovable in emulation of God.,
Recognize that unlovable people need love most of all.,
See your efforts to love this person as acts of faith.,
Realize that God loves this person.,
Remember the Golden Rule.",How to Love the Unlovable3," Some people feel a need to reach out to those that others have deemed ""unlovable"" for religious reasons — for instance, because their religion calls on them to extend a loving hand to others even when it's difficult or out of a sense that this sort of selfless behavior is desirable. All major world religions more or less encourage their followers to act with love and kindness towards others, so if you're looking for inspiration in moments when it's difficult to love another person, turn to your religion's scriptures. Below is just a tiny selection of religious quotes on the subjects of love and empathy from a wide selection of world religions (many, many, more exist).


Christianity: If anyone says, ""I love God,"" and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.Islam: ""None of you has faith until he loves for his brother or his neighbor what he loves for himself.""Judaism: ""What is hateful to yourself, do not do to your fellow man. That is the whole Torah; the rest is just commentary. Go and study it."" Hinduism: ""When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union.""Buddhism: ""Compassion is a mind that savors only mercy and love for all sentient beings.""Sikhism: ""Even Kings and emperors with heaps of wealth and vast dominion cannot compare with an ant filled with the love of God.""Note: because ""loving the unlovable"" is a phrase that's often used in a Christian context,the rest of this section will reference certain Christian concepts and terminologies. However, it's important to understand that virtually all major religions advocate love of others, especially ""unlovable"" people, who need love most of all.

, God, the creator of the universe, is the source of all love. When we love, we emulate God. In fact, when we make an effort to love others even when they act in ways we consider to be unlovable, we're imitating one of the greatest traits of God of all, which is that he loves all people unconditionally. If you're having a hard time justifying your continued kindness to someone who seems not to deserve or appreciate it, try to think of your behavior less as an action you're performing for another individual and more as a way to practice God's love.

, As noted above, God loves all people unconditionally. However, people who have strayed from God's path, shunning his love, need love the most of all. Only through love (never through force or coercion) can these people be brought back to God's light, so, by showing them love, you are opening this spiritual door for them.


In Christianity, returning to the love of God after doing wrong is generally considered to be one of the greatest personal victories of all (for a textbook example, see the parable of the prodigal son). By showing your love to another, you're making this victory more possible for this person.

, One way to motivate yourself to extend your love to a person who's making it difficult to do so is to think of this act as a sign or testament to the power of your faith. If you normally would have a hard time loving someone because of your behavior, view this as a challenge to your faith — trying your best to love this person is a way to prove your devotion.

, Some people's actions are so hurtful that it's very, very difficult to love them, especially if they've hurt you personally. Even if you can't bring yourself to truly love someone, don't forget that God loves this person just as much as he loves you. For this reason, the unlovable person is, at the very least, worthy of your kindness and forgiveness, even if you can't sincerely bring yourself to love him.


For an inspiring story of forgiveness, see the story of Robert Rule, who famously forgave serial killer Gary Ridgway for the murder of his daughter, Linda Rule, because it was, in his words, ""what God to do."", Treat other people the way you'd like to be treated — virtually every culture and religion on the planet has some variation on this rule (several are listed in the selection of quotes above). No matter what someone does or says to you, the Golden Rule dictates that you should treat them the way you'd like them to treat you. If someone's practically unlovable, keeping the golden rule in mind can help you justify your continued efforts to extend your best kindness and love even in the face of this person's hostility.

Spend time bonding.,
Accept your people for who they are.,
Overlook minor offenses.,
Appreciate others for what they do.",How to Love People1," One of the most important ways to love people is to spend time with them. The time you spend together will help you to understand each other more and be more comfortable around each other. This will create a trusting bond that reinforces your love., The people in your life may have values and habits that are similar to your own. Whether this is the case or not, you have to accept them for who they really are. Avoid criticizing or trying to change them. Instead, agree to disagree on some things, but continue to love them.For example, if someone you love does not follow the same religion as you, you should accept that and love them anyway. You will no sooner change their mind than they will change yours.

, The more time you spend with anyone, the more chances they will have to upset you. If someone does something that bothers you, take some time to decide if it is worth a confrontation. If you decide that it’s a minor blunder, just let it pass. If the incident really bothers you, you should talk it over with the other person.For example, if a friend spilled coffee on your shirt, there is no need get angry or lecture them. Just change your shirt and let it go.
In contrast, if a friend made up a story about you having an affair because they dislike your partner, you probably should have a conversation with them.

, If you have people in your life who love you, help you, and support you, try to express to them how grateful you are for their presence in your life. By doing so, they may return the appreciation, building a mutually beneficial relationship of trust and respect.

You do not need to outright tell people ""I appreciate you."" You can also demonstrate it through your actions. Help them when they are in need. Lend them an ear when they are upset. If they live far away, periodically check in with an email or phone call.

Accept the fact that they are your beloved partner's family.,
Suppress your ego:  Most relations spoil due to this ever damaging ego factor.,
Make an effort to get to know them.,
Approach kids.,
Respect the elders.,
Volunteer for jobs.,
Be yourself.,
Never compare.,
Stay in touch.,
Support your spouse.",How to Maintain a Good Relationship with Your In Laws," It means that your partner grew up in the family and loves the family more than anything. Keep that in mind and they become much easier to bear and everything will flow freely.


Consider them as family and not opponents: Many people end up spoiling their relationships with in-laws because they frame them as opponents, who always impose demands on them. The biggest culprit behind this kind of assumption is the information that we are getting access to. Try to see any given conflict from their perspective, too; treat them like family and give them the benefit of the doubt, as you enter into a disagreement. If you view things from their angle, you may understand where they're coming from.;
, Stay humble and try to avoid any sort of conflict. The rule is simple and you just need to fill in  empty spaces with love and abstain ego from getting in at any point of time.


Avoid comparing your family to your in-laws. Each family dynamic is different, and your expectations of each other will always be different from those in your family of origin. Accept this, rather than fighting it, and your relationship will benefit.

, After formal introductions, put some effort to know them. Make a special effort with the older people at home, then the siblings of your partner, their partners and their kids, if there are any. We tend to dislike or ignore people only when we don't really know who they are.


Ask your partner to help you draw out a family tree and memorize it if you find it hard to remember all the names and various relationships in the family.

Smile. A smile is a starter to many great things, including good relationships. Whenever you bump into your in-laws remember to give them a genuine smile.
Start a conversation. Take steps to start the conversation since you are the newcomer. They might expect you to make the move first. Be ready to accept any kind of replies or response. Don't be surprised if you get snappy replies. Remember you are there for the best man or woman of your life.

, Kids are always easy to be tackled compared to the adults. Try to play with or tell stories to the kids. Buy them chocolates or candies and let the elders realize that you are a friendly and jovial person.


Respect the beliefs and practises of the families. If they don't allow sweets, avoid them like the plague. If they are deeply religious, praise their beliefs and join in as much as you possibly can, particularly in front of the children.

, Show respect when you talk, eat or even when you are just sitting idle in front of them. Playing with smartphones should be banned completely. Show attention to the conversation or the food you are eating. Attentiveness would reflect your well being to them.


Don't feel afraid of asking about the family history. Show an interest in your partner's heritage and background. If they romanticize the past, grin and bear it.

, Volunteer to help in the kitchen or with the laundry, or find opportunities to buy stuff or to fix a broken item at home. This would bring a special kind of affection towards the family besides showing your hidden talents.

, Just be yourself and you don't have to act to get a place their hearts. Show that you are sincere in every single thing you do and you really mean what you say in every conversation. Originality always attracts. No harm to share with them your drawbacks or weaknesses. Show your talents and abilities rather than tell.

, People are different. Your parents and the in-laws will never be the same. When you compare them, things will get worse. So accept them as they are and show love and affection to them.


Never brag about your maiden family. You may tell things about your parents or birth family but never ever brag or talk big about what you had in your home. This might irritate your in-laws or cause negative remarks.

, If you are not staying under the same roof with your in-laws, find time to text or call them once in a while. They would be definitely touched and it would help a lot in the bonding of your new relationship. Make them feel that you acknowledge them.


Remember birthdays and anniversaries. Use an organizer to keep track of them.
If you have children, keep them updated on the newest milestones reached and make every effort to meet up as often as you can if they're interested.

, This is their family, and always will be. If you put them in the middle of fights a lot, you'll only breed more tension. Just try not to sweat the small stuff, and support your spouse's position in relation to his next of kin.


Praise your partner. Whilst families are well aware of your husband or wife's faults and failings, they don't want you to remind them. Speak highly of your partner and mention their great qualities. Demonstrate the admiration, respect, love and fondness you have for your partner. S/he is a darling son, daughter, nephew, niece, uncle, aunt, grandson or granddaughter too.

Set a date to talk.,
Practice what you will say.,
Share your perspective using “I” statements.,
Ask for an explanation or amends.,
Listen to their responses with an open heart.",How to Tell a Close Friend You Feel Betrayed or Neglected2," After you have taken the time to address emotional pain associated with betrayal or neglect, plan to have a conversation with your friend. Don’t drop such a loaded topic on them suddenly; let them know you need to talk ahead of time.


You might inform your friend, “Hey, when you have some time this week, I’d really like us to sit down and talk.”, It can be tricky to express how you feel about a friend’s negative behaviors. To ensure you get your point across while still being tactful and respectful, rehearse your side of the conversation.It might be a good idea to rehearse in front of a mirror or with another close friend or family member.
While you’re practicing, you might also briefly consider what you want from the discussion. Do you want an apology? For your friend to correct their behavior? To end the friendship?

, Because you’re hurt, it’s easy to come across as harsh when explaining your feelings; however, the conversation will work more smoothly if you can convey your message without making your friend defensive.


Make use of “I” statements to prevent defensiveness. These statements start with something along the lines of “I feel…” so you can take ownership of your thoughts and emotions.It may sound like “I feel betrayed. I told you a secret in confidence only to find out you shared it with Melissa, too.”

, Progress the conversation by moving into the resolution phase. Since you’ve already thought about the outcome you want to achieve with this confrontation, share it with your friend.You might say, “Can you explain why you did this?” or, “I expect an apology for you breaking my confidence.”

, Although you were hurt, how you handle this conversation can save or worsen your friendship. Practice active listening — that is, listening to understand rather than listening to respond. Don't cut your friend off with interjections or disputes. Try to really listen and see the situation from their point of view.


You can demonstrate listening by summarizing what they said. You might say, ""From what I'm hearing it sounds like you let my secret slip out. You didn't really mean to share it. Is that right?"""
"
Decide if you are both willing to put in effort.,
Review each other’s personal boundaries.,
Focus on rebuilding trust slowly.,
Spend quality time together.",How to Tell a Close Friend You Feel Betrayed or Neglected3," Friendship is a two-way street, and your relationship can only improve if all parties are invested. Verify that both you and your friend actually want to continue the friendship.


You might take some time after the initial conversation to contemplate how it went and whether they explained or apologized. Weigh the pros and cons of your relationship. Is it mostly good? Or do you often feel betrayed or neglected by this friend?
You may even ask your friend, “Your behavior makes me think you aren’t as committed to our relationship as I am. Do you want to fix things?”If it becomes clear that one of you is not committed to the friendship, then you will need to make some changes. You may need to spend less time together, or no longer share certain things with that friend.

, If you determine you both want to improve your friendship, it’s time to go back to the drawing board and figure out how to make reparations. Your friend’s behavior likely violated your personal boundaries, which is why you felt betrayed or neglected. The two of you need to go over your boundaries again to be sure they are clear.


Sit down with your friend with a few sheets of paper. You both should write out how you want to be treated in the friendship and how you don’t want to be treated. Then, share this information with one another.
Ask questions to make sure you understand each other’s boundaries. You should also verbalize mutual agreement that you will respect and uphold these boundaries. Also, discuss consequences if boundaries are violated again., It takes time for a relationship to heal after a boundary violation; however, it is possible to rebuild trust in your friend with simple actions to restore credibility.


Confide in your friend with minor disclosures to verify that they won’t spread your secrets anymore.
Make small commitments to hang out so that your friend doesn’t constantly break promises.
If your friend shows effort, you might gradually increase your trust in them over time., One of the best parts of a friendship is spending time together doing things you enjoy. Feelings of betrayal or neglect may arise when a friend starts spending more time with others than they spend with you. Overcome this by making a standing date with each other to hang out one-on-one.For example, you might watch a certain TV show together on the same evening each week.
Notice if your friend follows through with the changes you discussed. If they don't, then you may need to take a step back from the friendship.

Make a pros and cons list.,
Look for reasons to compliment him.,
Focus on positive feelings.,
Make happy memories.",How to Love Someone The Way He Is1," Taking time to think about all of a person’s positive qualities can help you to remember what you love about them. At the same time, noting what frustrates you about a person can help to put things into perspective. Make a list of all of the things you love about this person and all of the things that annoy you about him.

Review the list and pay special attention to the pros, such as his kind nature, his sense of humor, or the interests you share with him.
Remind yourself that the things that annoy you may be things that can change in time, such as being a smoker, having a hard time remembering important dates, or seeming unmotivated.;
, People are extremely complicated beings that can be seen from many different angles. Whatever you choose to look for in a person, you are likely to find. Avoid looking for negative traits, and instead look for good traits within him. Reinforce those traits in his behavior (and in your own mind) by complimenting him often.For example, you could compliment his intelligence.

, Again, where you put your own focus is crucial to determining how you feel about someone. In any person, there are things that will make you feel good and things that will make you feel bad. If you want to love him, pay attention to the things that make you feel good when you are with him.For example, you should focus on how he notices your feelings instead of how he doesn’t keep his bedroom clean.

, Any kind of loving relationship needs reinforcement. You can strengthen your love for him by creating happy memories. Do things that both of you enjoy doing and spend time reflecting on it. If you have a lot of separate interests, take turns doing something the other would like.For example, if you both enjoy movies, you could take turns choosing a movie at the theater or for a home movie night.

Get comfortable with affection.,
Express your love.,
Make yourself available.,
Do things for others.,
Be spontaneous.,
Comfort each other.",How to Love People2," When you love people, it is important to give and receive affection. Try to be comfortable with hugging or embracing friends and family members, giving them gifts, and offering them praise. Also, be willing to accept the same things in return.Do not expect an immediate reciprocation of your affection. For example, just because you give someone a compliment does not mean that you will get one from them in the next five minutes.

, Aside from just giving and receiving affection, you can also be forward about your feelings. You should tell people in your life that you love them and care for them. You also need to allow them to express their feelings to you openly and without judgement or ridicule.For example, a family member might come out and say that they love you. Instead of laughing at them or ignoring the statement, make it a point to say something back such as, “I love you too.”
There is no need to overdo it on constant compliments or expressions of love.

, Many people make the mistake of being fair weather friends. In other words, they are there when the someone’s life is going well, but busy when that same person needs help. You should make it a point to be available to the people you love when they need help or support. This will show that you love them, and it will help you form a stronger bond and love them more.For example, if someone close to you recently lost a family member, cook them a meal and take it to them. Make sure that you go when you have time to talk and be present with them.

, When someone is in need, just being available isn’t always enough. Sometimes, it would help them tremendously if you do small chores or run errands for them in a time of need. Help them complete tasks that they need done, or buy them a something that they have been wanting.For example, you could go grocery shopping for a friend that has just come home from the hospital.
Another example would be to buy someone a meal after a hard week.
If you're unsure where to start, you might volunteer at a worthy organization, charity, or community effort. Volunteering will allow you express your love to others, even strangers, and allow you to build connections to other volunteers with the same beliefs and passions. This will increase your overall capacity to love and care for others.

, You can continue to build the love you have for someone by keeping the relationship interesting. Do things spontaneously with people you love to build excitement and mystery. Make a point of offering and receiving romantic gestures from time to time in romantic relationships, and the passion in the relationship will stay strong.., Everyone goes through good times and bad. Life’s emotional rollercoaster can make or break the love that you have for other people. If you want to continue loving the people in your life, be there to comfort them and help them through hard times, and allow them to do the same for you."
"
Keep your promises.,
Tell the truth.,
Stay true to yourself.",How to Love People3," One of the first steps to loving someone is to value the commitments you make to them. While commitments may differ in every situation, promising to do something for someone else will signal that you do have love for this person. Once you make the promise, do everything in your power to keep true to it.For example, if you promise someone that you will do something for them, you should follow through no matter what. If you don’t want to do something for your friend, tell them no instead of setting yourself up to break a promise.

, Remaining honest with people in your life will allow them to see you for who you really are. Knowing that they love the real you and not a fake version of you will make a big difference. This will help you open up and love yourself and everyone else even more., Do not fabricate feelings for or against someone else. Allow yourself to feel what you feel, and act accordingly. If you allow yourself to do the things you love and surround yourself with people that you love, you will be happier and able to love more fully."
"
Forgive yourself first.,
Avoid scorekeeping.,
Express true pain.,
Let the pain go.",How to Love People4," It can be difficult to forgive others when you are still struggling to come to terms with things that you did, said, or that happened to you. Release yourself of any guilt, shame, or pain that you associate with past relationships so that you can build new relationships of trust, love, and respect., Lovers often do small things that bother one another. If you want to love your partner, let those things go. Holding a grudge or keeping count of any time your partner hurts you will only diminish your relationship.For example, if your partner makes a joke about your shoes, it is okay to mention that it bothered you, but it does not give you a free pass to say something bothersome to them.

, If you have been deeply hurt, you will need to allow yourself to feel and express that pain before you can move past it. Meditate on your feelings around the situation, or talk through it with a close friend. Once you come to terms with your feelings, you can start doing things to let them out. Some common ways that people deal with pain are:Exercise regularly.
Find a creative outlet.
Spend time with friends and family.
Seek counseling.

, Whether the person apologizes or not, forgiving them is necessary for you to move on. Have a talk with them or write a letter to declare that you have forgiven the pain that you were caused. If you had any fault in the situation, this is a good time to apologize as well.If you do not know how to find the person or feel that it is inappropriate to contact them, you can write a letter, but do not send it.

All relationships are based on the following concepts:


Desire:This is when a person observes (visual) a person's actions and or appearance creating an image of interest.,
In relationships, there are different depths of desire, attraction, and love.,
A married man who is involved with another woman, sexually, emotionally, or in any way not in accordance with their marriage vows, is in fact 'not married' (emotionally).,
There is also a real possibility that we all (both men and women) can love more than one person in a deep way at the same time.,
Be prepared for ""THE CHALLENGE"".,
Above all, be discrete.,
Define the terms of the affair from the outset.,
Keep feelings of jealousy in check.,
Don't be a home wrecker.",How to Love a Married Man,"
Attraction:This takes place when a person feels (emotion) a connection with a person beyond the image.
Love: This is a combination of levels of both desire and attraction which creates a certain level or depth of love.;
, This is why some relationships have a deeper bond and longevity. Marriage is considered the ultimate depth of love, and ""proof positive"" that your mate is irrevocably, and unconditionally admirable of you and will be with you until the end of all time. While this is a valid interpretation of marriage, the worth is only as valuable as the individuals embarking upon this type of commitment. If the level or depth of the aforementioned elements are superficial, this type of commitment will not have an everlasting bond.

,


Marriage is a sacred decree, (emotional), in which two individuals declare, in accordance with Gods law, their commitment and love for each other.
A wedding (physical) is a ceremony in which two individuals declare before family and friends their commitment and love for each other.
Once the man violates the decree(emotional), he is merely a participant in a wedding ceremony (physical).

, Perhaps he/she is such a person and you are as well. This can be reinforced if all parties are open and honest with this type of situation.

, Truthfully, single men can cause more drama, detriment, and unnecessary pain in your life, if their intentions are not admirable. Which oftentimes, they are not. They can mislead you for months, even years, and leave you bewildered and confused as to why they won't commit, want just a ""booty call"", or ""friends with benefits"", you know him; ""THE PLAYER-PLAYER"". With a married man you know he has attempted to be in a committed, monogamous relationship, and is probably a good father, provider, and a great lover, all of which we as woman consider great traits and secretly desire in a man.

, It should go without saying that having an affair with a married man is something you'll generally want to avoid. To be perfectly clear, having an affair with a married man is an easy way to ruin multiple lives, including your own. However, if it's too late to prevent, you can still do your best to ensure the affair does as little damage as possible to your life, your paramour's life, and his family members'. The best way to do this is to take measures to ensure that no one ever', ever discovers your affair in the first place. Below are just a few examples of ways to keep your secret love affair a secret:


Only contact your lover via secure channels of communication (secret cell phones are a good bet) and only when you're positive he's alone.
Never flaunt your relationship. Don't tell anyone - even your friends. Don't even make veiled hints or references to the relationship.
Don't spend time with your lover in public. You have no way of knowing when or where you'll run into someone who knows him.

, To avoid unnecessary heartbreak (which is a possibility regardless of how well you conceal your affair), you'll want to make sure that you and your lover are absolutely clear on the boundaries of your relationship as soon as possible. For instance, you may want to consider setting some of the following limits:


Neither lover will ever ask the other to compromise their relationship with their ""real"" partner in any way.
Neither lover will ever try to move the relationship in a ""more serious"" direction.
Both lovers will have the right to end the affair at any time.

, When it comes to affairs, envy is a recipe for disaster. If you're a married man's secret lover, you absolutely must be OK with him spending the majority of his time with his wife and family. If you can't come to terms with the fact that you're the ""other woman"", an affair is probably an even worse idea for you than it would normally be. Never, ever, ever let your jealousy get the better of you. It can lead you to make decisions that can end in catastrophe for you, your lover, and/or his family.


If you're about to make a drastic decision out of anger or jealousy, try waiting one day before you act. Never act without giving yourself a chance to cool down and consider all the consequences of your actions.

, When it comes to affairs with married men, this is the oldest piece of advice in the book. Having an affair with a married man is a very bad thing to do, but destroying his family is even worse. Mistresses should stay very, very far away from their lover's home, his family, and especially his children. Don't ever allow yourself to come into contact with your lover's family or try to position yourself between your lover and his family.


This advice is as much in your own self-interest as it is in your lover's, as, if you attempt to interfere with his family, you're essentially forcing him to choose between you and his wife, which may end badly for you (to say nothing of the damage his family might experience).

"
Avoid nagging him.,
Withhold judgement for his actions.,
Remind yourself that you love him.,
Avoid unrealistic expectations.,
Be willing to compromise.",How to Love Someone The Way He Is2," The opposite of complimenting a person is nagging them. When you find small details about a person and use them to vent your own frustrations or insecurities, it undermines the relationship. If you need to talk to him about something he is (or isn’t) doing, you should have a clear, calm conversation about it. Tell him what you expect him to do, and let him do it.For example, instead of nagging him for not doing the dishes, you could just say something like “I could really use some help with the dishes when you have time.”

, Even if you love someone, you should realize that you will not always agree with everything they do. If something he does bothers you, you can talk to him about it, but avoid turning it into a general label on his personality. By withholding judgment, you see him as a whole person and not just the sum of his mistakes.For example, if he forgets to do the dishes (even though you reminded him), keep in mind that he has a lot going on, too. While it is fair to expect help, you should not judge him as lazy or inconsiderate when he doesn’t get everything done.

, Telling him you love him is important. Telling yourself that you love him is just as important. It is easy to get frustrated with someone and analyze all of their faults. Instead, you should remind yourself constantly that you love him and that your frustration with him doesn’t define him.For example, if he forgot your birthday, you are probably going to be pretty frustrated. Instead of focusing on how badly that hurt, remind yourself that you love him the way he is and that you can still celebrate your birthday with him even if you had to remind him.

, The man you love is not perfect. That is because nobody is perfect. Though it might be easy for you to imagine a fairytale romance, be aware that such relationships rarely (if ever) happen in real life. In fact, a happy relationship takes work from both sides and requires realistic expectations.


The idea of a “Mr. Right” just waiting around the corner for you will likely destroy your relationship over time.

, Relationships are all about compromise and flexibility. Though you shouldn’t settle for being with someone that you don’t love, you should realize that you will have to give up some of the things on your checklist if you want to love someone. The man you love isn’t likely to be able to satisfy your every fantasy or whim, but he can love you and satisfy some of those things. The rest, you will have to accept as qualities that he does not possess.


For example, the man you love might not be able to dance and sing you love songs with perfect pitch. In this case, you might have to settle for him willing dance with you and belt out some karaoke (even if it’s bad karaoke).

"
"
Come to terms with jealousy.,
Reflect on insecure feelings.,
Work on correcting your insecurities.",How to Love Someone The Way He Is3," There are two types of jealousy that can affect your love for him. You can be jealous of his life, or you can be jealous of his attention. Either one will lead to disagreements and hard feelings. If you are feeling jealous, analyze why and move on.An example of being jealous of his life is wishing that you had as many friends as he does.
An example of being jealous of his attention is wishing that he would stop hanging out with his friends and spend his time with you.

, Jealousy is not the only feeling that can get in the way of loving him. You might also feel things like sadness, resentment, or neglect. If you have any negative or insecure feelings, you should not repress them or act on them. Instead, analyze what makes you feel that way. Once you know what is bothering you, you can work on accepting that part of his personality.For example, if it bothers you that is never on time, once you realize this you can start accepting it as a part of his personality rather than viewing it as a lack of caring for you.
Avoid taking things too personally. Keep in mind that some of his actions may be harmless and not reflect any deeper meanings other than what you assign to them.

, This might take a lot of time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and constantly analyze why you feel insecure. It might help to keep a diary of your feelings so that you can monitor them. If you are having a lot of difficulty with your feelings, you can consult a mental health professional.Do not leave the diary somewhere that he can read it. Explain that it is private if he seems uncertain. You may prefer to keep a diary in a file on your computer.
Another way to work through your insecurities is to be open and honest about them. Do not blame them on the man you love, but use “I” statements like “I sometimes feel that our relationship might fade over time.”
You might even consider sharing some of your insecurities with him if you are comfortable doing so. This can help to strengthen your relationship. Hiding things may only lead to trouble in the future.

Have silky hair he wants to touch.",How to Look Hot for Your Boyfriend," Men like a little makeup. They think it's hot if you use makeup to bring out the natural beauty of your eyes or to highlight the lushness of your lips. But that's the key: It has to look natural. You don't want to look too much like a tomgirl who never wears makeup, but you also shouldn't cake it on.


Use shimmer powder or lotion with shimmer in it so that your body glistens. Put it on your cleavage and shoulders. Try using subtle fake lashes. He will be unlikely to realize what you've done differently, but beautiful eyes with lush lashes are definitely going to attract him.
Men aren’t fans of bright eye makeup colors like green or bright blues. A better choice if you’re going out is a smoky eye. Use grays, silvers, golds, browns, and blacks to create the smoky eye look. Apply the powder under your eye, and above the eyelid. But if you do, choose a neutral lip. Don't overuse eye liner or lip liner. Maybe try the Angelina Jolie look - black liquid liner subtly applied to the upper lid, and peachy or brown colored eye shadow, with a little black mascara.;
, Take care of your hygiene. If you don't show that you respect yourself, why will he respect you?


Get a bikini wax. Try something different ""down there"" to surprise him. Regular bikini waxes might be a little painful, but they will make you more confident.
Get your nails done professionally. Chipped nails aren't hot.
Shave your legs and your underarms. Obvious things - but crucial.
Get your eyebrows professionally shaped. Just go to any nail or beauty salon, and they will probably be able to wax them fairly cheaply. You will be surprised how grooming your brows can immediately improve your look.

, What you wear - on your nails, your clothing - will trigger different sensations in him depending on the colors you choose.


Think red. It will make him think you're hot. Studies have shown that men rate women higher in attractiveness when they’re wearing red, and that they’re more likely to want to date them. It’s a good idea to wear no more than two colors at once. If you wear black, add a flash of color with a bright necklace or shoes. Just a single piece of jewelry can make you look hotter.
Black is also a color that is associated with sex appeal. If you wear it, a man is also more likely to consider you sophisticated and elegant.
Other colors such as blue and brown are less likely to be associated with being ""hot."" They convey dependability and stability.

, Many men have this test. Does a woman look good when she wakes up in the morning or is she a scary sight when she doesn't have the makeup caked on?


Try the no makeup look (maybe even during the day) to show him you can. If he thinks you look beautiful this way too, he will be very impressed. The key to pulling off the no makeup look is a healthy diet and great skincare (clean your face every night, and use a high quality facial cream. Don't forget sunscreen during the day). Don't go to sleep with makeup on. A fresh face will look better in the early morning light than smudged mascara and lipstick will. You also don't want to leave makeup smudges all over the pillow.
Wake up before he does and sneak into the bathroom. Brush your teeth, comb your hair quickly, and put a little blush or powder on (don't make it obvious, though).

, You don't have to be trussed up in a corset or garter belt, but don't sleep next to him in ratty pajamas or shapeless jogging pants.


Wearing only his T-shirt to bed is something he will almost always consider hot.
Wear something with spaghetti straps or silk. You can never go wrong with these. Every now and then surprise him with sexy, but classy, lingerie.
Choose a light cotton T-shirt or tank top and pair it with a pair of pajama shorts. He'll most likely think that this is sexy. , It's a bad idea to head for the tanning bed because you'll pay the price later with wrinkles and aging skin. But these days you can use self tanners that look more natural.


Get a little glow by finding a local tanning salon that offers natural looking spray-tans. Choose the lowest level so your skin just barely looks sun-kissed. These days, the products are so sophisticated they usually look natural, at least for the most part.
Use bronzing powder on the apples of your cheeks to give your skin an instant color burst. A little color makes you look healthy.

, Some people ignore their feet, which can be a mistake. You can ruin a beautiful outfit if you're wearing old, scuffed, matronly shoes.


Although you shouldn't wear them all the time, high heels for a night out will almost always make a man think ""that's hot.""
Get a pedicure. Red glossy well-done toenails will make even flip flops look pretty hot.
Make the skin soft. Use heel cream to soften even the roughest spots of the feet.

, If you put the focus on your lips, it will make him want to kiss you or think about kissing you. And he’s likely to find it hot.


Studies show that men prefer subtle lip gloss over bright red or other more obvious colors.
Choose gloss over matte lipstick.You definitely want to strive for adding the moisture to your lips. Use Burt’s Bees Lip Shimmer or Carmex Moisture plus Clear Gloss. You could pop in a little red into your outfits every once in a while. Especially with black.

, Men like it when a woman pays attention to grooming (so shave your underarms and pluck your eyebrows). But they don't necessarily like it if your feet are always crammed into high heels, and you don't know how to let your hair down.


If you can master glamour at times and also the laid-back casual look, he will think that's hot. So be game for almost anything. Be willing to go to a sporting event, try fishing, hang out with the guys, go for a walk down the beach.
You can look hot if you put your hair in a pony tail and wear sweatpants to lounge around the house sometimes - but not if you look like that when you go out to the grocery store or to dinner.

, If you master the art of verbal flirtation, he will think you're hot. Being hot is an art form. It's not all about how you physically look.


Whisper, especially in his ear. It's hot. Compliment him on his looks. Tell him he looks hot. If he feels more confident, he will get a boost of energy and may return the favor. , Cleopatra was no great beauty. But her ability to attract men was legendary. That’s because she understood how to appeal to a man’s common interests and spoke multiple languages. Men are intrigued by women who have interests outside of them and can add something to the conversation. So deepen your knowledge in several areas that are of interest to you.
Find a cause. Angelina Jolie became more attractive to men when she started doing philanthropic work. She matched beauty with passion for something outside herself, and men find that attractive.

, Make a man laugh, and he will think you’re more attractive. You don’t want to be too serious or hard to please all of the time.


Part of having a sense of humor is being able to laugh at yourself. If someone criticizes you, turn it into a joke, and shake it off.
If you don’t really have confidence, fake it. People will react to you differently because they will think you have confidence, which will then lead to a boost in your actual confidence.

, Keep the focus on your eyes, and use them to seduce your man. If you make a connection through the eyes, he’s more likely to think you’re hot.


Be able to look a man directly in his eyes for a few seconds without blinking. Then, look away shyly, so the look isn’t too intimidating.
Think of a specific emotion that you want to convey to him when you are looking into his eyes. This will help create an emotional link.
Eye contact is so important that some studies have found men will look at a woman’s face – and eyes – first even when looking at pictures of naked women. To highlight your eyes and make them seductive, make sure your brows are well-groomed but not too thin or sparse. Darker eyebrows are sexier.

, Understand the difference between “hot” and trashy. It can be a fine line, but there aren’t many men who want a woman who looks slutty or cheap on their arms.


Looking too trashy – showing too much skin – actually makes a woman look insecure to men. And that’s a big turn-off. Instead of the sky high stilettos, how about trying three-inch heels instead? Don’t show a lot of cleavage. Just a hint of cleavage is a lot sexier to men. Leave an air of mystery to make him want more. Either show a little leg or a little cleavage (and we mean just a little) – not both. That’s a good rule of thumb to use. If you are showing a little cleavage, wear slacks or a longer skirt. If you’re showing a flash of leg, don’t show any cleavage at all.
Do wear lace though – strategically. Lacy sleeves on a shirt, for example, is feminine and attractive. If you want to show a little skin, how about showing off the shoulders? There’s something about the collarbone that’s attractive to men, especially if your skin is glowing.

, It’s not just about putting lip gloss on your lips. It’s about showing a joy for life, and there’s nothing like a beautiful smile to draw a man.


Get your teeth bleached at the dentist or buy bleaching kits at the drug store. There’s nothing attractive about a mouth full of yellow or stained teeth.
Don’t force your smile – make it a natural one.

, Tell him you got a new brassiere in a color that's different, and ask him to guess it. Suggest you've got something planned for him later that evening that he will enjoy. Be seductive and tease him but in a coy, mysterious way. Never be crude.


Light touches will tease a man in a good way. Put your hand on his knee briefly. Whisper in his ear. Grab his hand. Master the art of the double entendre. Be coy and mysterious.

, You should strive to be healthy. Develop a workout routine, even if it's walking for 30 minutes several times a week. And eat a healthy diet that's heavy in natural foods, such as fruits and vegetables. But don't fall into the trap that men want a skeleton.


Many men actually say they prefer a few curves on a woman, even a rounded stomach. The key is to project confidence. Be comfortable in who you are and don't be the kind of woman who goes out to dinner with a man and won't touch her plate. This isn't very hot to men.
Not looking perfect actually can increase a man's confidence because he won't feel pressure to look perfect too.

, When he goes in for a kiss, surprise him with lip gloss that has flavor to it. That way you will taste twice as good.


Even some chapsticks have flavor to them. Katy Perry's cherry chapstick comes to mind.
Some lotions have flavored scents too.
Make sure your breath smells good. Carry small breath fresheners in your purse, and make sure to brush and go to the dentist for regular teeth cleanings.

, You can enhance his experiences of being with you if you share sensual food with him.


Share chocolates with him or berries. Chocolate releases the chemical serotonin in the brain, which creates feelings of pleasure.
Bake him homemade cookies and share them after a sexy date with a bottle of wine.

, You want something light. Think vanilla. Or a faint musky smell. You don't want to smell like your grandmother. Perfume should be lightly applied, but you want a signature scent.


At the same time, he will get used to your scene over time, so now and then mix it up and surprise him with something new.
Lather on lightly scented lotion in something like lilac or, again, vanilla, which has been tied to increased desire.
Spray perfume in the air and walk backwards through it. This way, when he hugs you, you’ll smell good to him because his head will be near your back. Above all, don’t put on too much perfume. Men hate this. No one wants to hang out with a walking department store.

, There’s nothing hotter than when a man’s hand brushes your legs, and they’re silky soft. You want skin a man wants to touch.


To get soft skin, use a hydrating exfoliating body scrub to remove dry skin from your body. These scrubs also have a nice scent. Choose a razor designed for women so you catch all the stubble when you shave. Then, put body lotion or body butter all over your body.

, Although men like a girl who can hang with them, they aren’t likely to classify a tomboy as “hot.” If you play up your femininity, it will make him feel manly and protective.


Wear skirts and dresses more than pants. This will make you look more feminine.
If you wear blue jeans, avoid jeans that are too plain or have holes in them.

, Touch is sensual. Take care of your hair. A flip of shiny, healthy hair is bound to attract any man. It's hot to have bouncy, shiny hair.


Get natural color or subtle highlights. Avoid the “skunk” look or anything too overdone. Avoid tight permanents. Men like hair they can run their fingers through. Get regular hair cuts every 6 weeks to get rid of split ends.
Wearing your hair swept to the side looks romantic and hot, especially if you put a few beachy curls in it with a curling iron or medium-sized rollers. Apply a shine spray to your hair after styling. This will give your hair more gloss.
Use salon shampoo and conditioner. If you don’t put good quality products on your hair, the results will show.
Wear your hair down, and don’t use a lot of hairspray. Men tend not to be fans of overly styled hairdos. They don’t want to feel like their hands will be covered with product if they run their fingers through your hair. Don’t stick too close to obvious hair trends. Find a look that suits your personality and your face shape instead.

It can be as simple as swapping artwork on your wall, moving furniture around or buying new curtains. Consider buying new bedding, too. There’s nothing like new bedsheets or a duvet to comfort you when you’re getting over someone.


Repainting the walls in your personal space is another great way to begin again! Go with warm colors. Warmer hues are more calming than cool colors, and that can go a long way in helping you get over a tough breakup.;
, We can all be guilty of letting friendships slip when we’re in a relationship. So take a minute to think about who you have lost touch with. There’s bound to be someone from your past who you miss and would enjoying spending time with again.

, In order to move on, you have to forgive your own failings as well as your partner’s issues. Romantic relationships are never completely one-sided. Also release yourself from any guilt. Each of us are usually doing the best that we can in any given moment.


If you see areas where you were wrong in the relationship, reflect on why you behaved a certain way and vow to never do it again. That’s the best any of us can do because no one’s perfect. Learning and growing from your mistakes is what life’s about. Know that one day, you will be kissed again!, There’s nothing like a day at the spa to feel better! Most spas have packages for all kinds of budgets. The separate treatments, like facials or massage, can be pricey. But many also have day passes that are fairly reasonable.


A day pass usually includes access to the general amenities such as use of the hot tub, sauna, shower facilities, steam room and the swimming pool, if it has one.

, Are you interested in web design? Would you like to learn how to make sushi? Then take a class in something you’ve always been interested in! Along with acquiring new skills, you’ll also be meeting new people. Not only will this keep your mind off the breakup, but you’ll also discover talents you never knew you had!

, We all can use a little perspective. All it takes is a moment to hear another person’s problems to help us realize how fortunate we are. So why not volunteer at a retirement home, an animal shelter, a charity home or be a Big Sister or Brother. There is always someone else worse off than us, and sometimes we just need to be reminded of it. One of the biggest rewards you get from volunteering is how unbelievably grateful the little critters are or the people you’re helping. , All this does is stir up old feelings, and it could even trick you into thinking there’s still a chance it will work again. Delete his or her number off your phone, get rid of all emails, texts, voice mails, and if you have to, change your phone number. Don't put too much thought into it, though, just do it. You’ll likely be saving yourself from a lot of pain by not going back into a relationship that didn’t work the first time around.

, There’s no reason to rush back into another serious relationship. Enjoy this time in your life! See what it’s like again going on dates or outings without having relationship issues hanging over your head. Life has seasons to it. Sometimes we’re involved with someone; sometimes we’re not.


Rather than lamenting that you’re not in a relationship, think about the positive aspects of being single again. You don’t have to ask another person what he or she wants to do. Now you can just do it! You also have more time to hang out with friends.
Make sure you take time to process what happened and time to heal, as much time as you need, in fact. If you don’t, you could find yourself in the same kind of unhealthy relationship again., After you’ve been hurt, fear of trusting another person again is so common that it even has its own name: pistanthrophobia. Granted, it’s a difficult thing to get over. But, if you want to be in a healthy, happy relationship again, you will need to get past it. You can’t cast the blame on the entire male or female population. It’s just not logical or fair.Keep in mind that by not allowing yourself to be vulnerable again, you could really be hurting yourself in the end. Because when someone does come along who has only your best intentions at heart, you could end up overlooking him or her entirely, and you don’t want to do that.

, We are all works in progress, and you probably learned a lot from your previous relationship. What you may have overlooked in the last one, you probably won’t overlook in the next one. Allow your hard-won lessons to guide you when choosing your next partner. More experience in any area helps us tremendously in making better decisions down the road and the area of love is no exception.

, Think of a night out or a date as just a few hours of time. It’s not going to necessarily be a life-changing event. It could be tempting to say yes to the first person who comes along, even if you’re not really into him or her. But don’t be so anxious. You can trust that the universe is watching over you.

, Let’s face it. When you’re getting to know someone, it can be a little awkward. A great way to combat this is to double-date with other couples you know. Double-dating takes the pressure off of how to keep the conversation flowing between the two of you. Plus, when the person is in the restroom, you can get feedback on what your friends think of him or her!The best criteria to picking couples to double-date with are those who are fun, know how to relax and who you’re comfortable around.

, If you do, no matter what you say, your date is likely to think that you’re not over the relationship. Basically, it’s an unpleasant zone that neither of you owe each other when you’re only in the dating phase. There’s no need to cross that uncomfortable line, otherwise. The time to address past relationships is when you’ve bonded more and established a certain amount of trust., It can be easy to get hung up in trying to find someone with similar traits to him or her. Remember, though, you broke up for a reason and maybe the best thing you can find is someone completely unlike that person! If you try to pigeon-hole someone to look and act like him or her, you could be missing out on a fantastic person! Plus, you want to enjoy yourself on a date, so the more you accept someone for who they are, the more relaxed you’ll both be.

, Does your potential partner bring you up or bring you down? A good communicator knows how to separate the person from the behavior or issue while being firm on the issue and soft on the person. Someone with poor communication skills does the opposite. She or he “gets personal” by attacking the person and ignores or minimizes the problem.If you see poor communication between the two of you, it’s not the end of the world. If you’re both willing, improvements can be learned relatively quickly and put to effective use.

, As the saying goes, “once bitten, twice shy.” You usually need more time to trust after a bad break-up. The right person will understand and appreciate that that’s where you’re at versus running headlong into the first relationship that comes along., Opposites might attract but on a fundamental level, they often don’t work. Compatibility is the key to creating a lasting and deep connection with someone. For instance, if you want to prepare for the future, but your partner only wants to make money to party with, then you may want to reconsider a serious relationship with him or her.

, Learn from your past mistakes. Use your best judgment to determine whether he or she is trustworthy. Don’t let your emotions get the best of you when entering into a relationship again. If you feel that you are with someone who can’t be trusted, back-off from making a commitment until you know for sure. It could save you years of heartache!

, Mutual respect is critical for a healthy relationship. Without it, you will always be looking at him or her with dissatisfaction or even contempt. For example, if the person you’re with always drinks to excess and embarrasses you in front of your family or friends, it will eventually takes its toll on the relationship. The idea is to keep an eye out for behaviors that make you uncomfortable now before getting in too deep. If you’re not comfortable with how he or she is in the early phases, chances are high you won’t be comfortable with this person later on."

Decide the terms of where you are both going to be living and try to find an option that is affordable and comfortable for you both.


If you both still live at home, you may decide to pool your money and get a place together. You should then discuss who's name will be on the lease and how the rent will be paid, such as through your partner's account or your account, every month.
If you are moving in with your partner into their place, you should decide if your name will be added to the lease. You should also discuss the financial aspects of the move, such as whether you will pay your partner's landlord rent directly or if you will both pay together in one lump sum every month.;
, As you and your partner go through the process of moving in together, you should get together and decide how your new space is going to be set up. You should walk through the space and discuss how large areas will be set up, such as a living room or dining room. Doing this together will allow you to both feel part of the decision making in the space and contribute to the design of the space overall.You should also consider how you are going to position furniture and other items in the space. Perhaps your partner will take the larger closet because they have more clothing or you both agree to split the closet equally so you can both fit your stuff in the space.

, You should start by going through your existing furniture with your partner and deciding what to keep and what to throw away. You should work with your partner to try to make the space feel like it belongs to you both. Combining your existing furniture so they work together will make the space feel cohesive and like it belongs to the two of you.Discuss how you can combine your couch and your partner’s coffee table in the living room area, for example. You may also decide which mattress is comfier and go with the one that suits you both best for the master bedroom.
You should be willing to purge or throw away any items that do not fit into the shared space. You should also try to compromise on items, especially if you have a sentimental attachment to them. If the item does not fit in the space, you may need to let it go. Be willing to do this, as you do not want to end up getting into your first fight as a live-in couple over keeping an item.

, You should feel like you can collaborate with your partner on how the space should be set up and styled. Work together to create a design style that complements both of your tastes. This may mean you will have to make some compromises so you can both feel happy and comfortable in the space.For example, maybe your partner prefers a more modern aesthetic and you are more into a rustic, boho style. You may both sit down and make a mood board together to try to combine your design styles. You may also need to compromise on certain items or style choices so your aesthetics fit together better.

, You should also both invest in new items for your home together, as this will allow you collaborate on decorating the space. Go shopping for home furnishings and try to find items that complement both of your aesthetics. Look for items you both love and put them in your shared space.For example, maybe you both decide the living room needs a large rug. You may both go shopping together to look for a rug that you both like and that will be complimentary to the space.
If you are not a clearly committed couple yet, decide who each newly acquired item belongs to.

, A big part of living together is sharing household responsibilities well. It is important that you and your partner determine who will do household chores like laundry, dishes, and yard maintenance so it is clear what your roles are in the space. Try to divide the roles so they feel equal and you both feel comfortable taking them on.You may decide to create a chores schedule, where your partner knows to take out the garbage on Fridays or you both agree to set aside time on Sundays to do laundry together.
You may also play to your strengths and designate certain chores to you or your partner based on your preference and skills. If you are a good cook and enjoy cooking, you may take on most of the cooking at home. Your partner may then be on cleaning duty and do the dishes after every meal so you both feel you contribute to the household chores.
Consider rotating chores that neither of you wants to do. A rotation schedule may be the only fair way to divide the chores.

, Another element of living together is dealing with the household finances as a couple. You and your partner should discuss how all the bills will be paid. Doing this will allow you to both feel you are contributing financially and give you a better sense of each other’s financial habits.For example, you and your partner may agree to split the rent for the space as well as all bills. You may then pay your partner your portion every month so they can deal with the bills directly.
You should both try to be transparent about your finances and share financial information as necessary. You and your partner may decide to open a joint account so you can easily pay for household items together, especially if you plan to get married in the future.

, You and your partner should also talk about how the space will be maintained in terms of upkeep and repairs. If you have a landlord, you should both have contact information for this person. You should also both be willing to split the cost of any repairs or maintenance of the space.If you are moving in with your partner and it is a space they own or are already renting, they should share contact information for the landlord with you. You should discuss how repairs and maintenance are addressed in the space with your partner so you are on the same page.

, Cohabitating with your partner is a good way to get a sense of their living habits. You should try to accept your partner’s living habits, especially if they are minor and harmless. Getting used to their living habits will make the transition into marriage easier for you both in the future.For example, maybe your partner prefers to walk around the house in their underwear. You may accept this and feel comfortable doing the same.
Your partner may have living habits that you do not like, such as a bad habit of leaving dirty clothing lying around or forgetting to put food away. Consider if the living habit is real no-go for you. If it is, you should talk to your partner about it and try to get them to shift this habit to accommodate you.
If you each have habits that the other does not like, consider working together to make minor changes for each other. For example, your partner may be able to work on putting their dirty clothes in the hamper, while you may be able to start washing your dishes instead of leaving them in the sink.

, Another big part of living together is being able to create your own routines at home. You and your partner should work on having routines or rituals that you do at home, just the two of you. This will allow you to enjoy the living space together and create positive memories as a couple at home.For example, you and your partner may have a Tuesday Taco night where you have tacos and margaritas every Tuesday. Or you may have pizza party Fridays where you order in pizza and watch a movie together.

, Though you may be thrilled to be living with your partner, you should still try to carve out some alone time. Having alone time at home can ensure you both do not get too comfortable with each other and that you have time on your own. Even if you are a happy, functional couple, having alone time allows you to have a balance of time together and time to yourself.For example, maybe your partner goes out for the night with friends and you stay at home on your own. This could give you some alone time to do what you want to do in the space.
You may also try to create alone time while you are both at home, where you do separate activities in different rooms. This way, you are not feeling crowded or overwhelmed by each other all the time.

Get to know your boyfriend.,
Accept that he’s not perfect.,
Be respectful.,
Don’t make comparisons.",How to Like Your Current Boyfriend when You Still Love Your Ex1," One of the best ways to like your current boyfriend is to get to know more about him.There are things about him that you already know and like (or else you wouldn’t be with him), but there’s probably a lot about him that you don’t know yet. Learning more about your boyfriend’s interests, hobbies, quirks, etc. will make it a lot easier to like him even though you still love your ex.


Learn what things you have in common. For example, while you may know that you both still watch cartoons, you might not know that you both really enjoy classic Disney cartoons.
Find out what you can learn from him. Your boyfriend might be really good at painting, something you have always wanted to learn.
Discover what makes him smile and laugh, what upsets him, and what his fears, hopes, and dreams are.;
, Your new boyfriend will make mistakes, but you shouldn’t hold these against him. Don’t use his small mess-ups as a reason to not like him. Unless he is doing something that you consider a deal-breaker, cut him a little slack.No one is going to have all of the qualities you are looking for or do things the way you prefer all of the time.
Don’t expect him to know all your likes and dislikes yet. The relationship is still new, so give him time to get to know you.
When he does make a mistake, avoid telling him he is acting like your ex (or how your ex would have handled it better). That can hurt him and make him mad.

, It’s hard to like someone you don’t have respect for. So, to like your boyfriend, respect him. Value him as a person, as well as his presence and his opinion. Treat him like he is important to you when you are alone and in public.


You can show your boyfriend respect by not bringing up your ex a lot or doing things that indicate that you still love your ex.
Show respect for your boyfriend and your current relationship by acting like you are in a relationship (not like a girl trying to get over her ex), spending time with your boyfriend, and getting to know him.

, Comparing your current boyfriend to your ex is not a good idea for several reasons. Mainly it’s a bad idea because in order to compare the two, you have to think about your ex. A lot. It’s also not a good idea because you should like your current boyfriend for who he is — not because of how he is different from (or similar to) your ex.Try not to think about what your boyfriend does better or even similar to your ex.
Don’t look for things that your ex did better. It will reinforce your love for your ex, not help you like your boyfriend more.

Consider what has caused you to cease trusting people.,
Think about the ways you have developed your defense mechanisms.,
Be careful if you generalize about the ""whole world"".,
Determine whether you have tried hard to ""convert"" the wrong sorts in the past.,
Learn to spot the people who make you feel rejected, unwanted and unhappy.,
Work on letting people like you.,
Be a good listener.,
Tell people they matter.,
Join in with things.,
Be confident.,
Let go of the need for equal feelings.",How to Let People Like You," What things have happened to you in the past that caused you to put up a moat around you, to push people away? The person/people and events that did this to you are part of the past and are not a good guidance for all people or your future. You might like to work through what has caused you to adopt habits that keep people away, either through therapy or doing your own self-analysis.;
, You might be constantly irritable or grumpy. You might be curt and snap at people. You might try to make yourself invisible by not answering questions, not volunteering information and hiding away in the background. Whatever your behavioral habits targeted at driving away other people, it's essential to recognize them so that you can work on stopping them. For example, if you hide away and don't make eye contact, it will be important to start working on being able to make eye contact and being comfortable with talking to other people and being acknowledged.

, It is easy to say ""every human being is hateful"" because sometimes you feel so intensely about things that aren't going right in the world, that you feel all alone. The reality is that you're not all alone in these feelings and there are plenty of other people who see the injustices you see, who feel the pain you feel and who want this world to be a better, kinder and gentler place. When you generalize about everyone else being horrible, scary and awful, you cut off the potential for meeting the people who can bring light into your life and who can join up with you to do good in the world.


Don't let the people who have done wrong by you cause you to feel less than yourself or to assume that the rest of the world will feel the same way.

, If you had a savior complex or a need to ""fix people"", then you might have been attracted to the wrong sorts of people, mostly damaged or controlling people. You are right to want to steer clear of such people as they are harmful but they are not every person and form only a small percentage of any population. There are plenty of warm, caring, unconditional and helpful people still out there waiting to be found by you.


Take care not to so overthink the problems of the world that you lose heart. While it's all very noble to try to fix people and the things harming some people, no one person can fix everything and it is important to remember that every soul has their own responsibility in life to set their course straight again.

, The emotional vampires, the narcissists, the sociopaths, the hard-driven perfectionists, the control freaks, etc.––whoever pushes your buttons and causes you to feel as if all humans behave so abominably, avoid those people. If you cannot cope with them or feel drained by them, then ignore them when possible and work around them when it's not possible. Manners are an excellent way to deal with such persons––be ultra polite without actually connecting in any meaningful way. But whatever you do, don't let such people get to you. And remember, they are not ""everybody"", just some people, so be discerning.


Keep away from people who make you feel as if you're unlovable or who make their love/respect for you conditional. These people do not deserve to cause you to dislike everyone in the world.

, Once you've worked out a) why you push people away, b) what sorts of people bother you and c) that there are good souls in this world, it's time to let the people who matter like you. This will require dropping your protective façade around the people you've determined matter and whom you'd like to like you back. Some ways to do this include:


Smile and be friendly. A smile goes a long way to undo grumpiness, fear and hiding away.
Learn to chat, to use a little small talk. Base it on asking the other person about themselves. You don't need to have a full blown conversation but it's useful to have a list of questions to ask them, and they'll help the chat along nicely.
Be authentically friendly. Actually care about the person enough to let this come through in your speech and actions. When you want this person to like you, then authenticity makes all the difference.

, Listen to what people say. Even if you would rather switch off, be polite and stay present. It isn't forever and it does a great deal to put yourself in high esteem with the other person, as people love being genuinely heard. Repeat back your understanding of some of what the other person has said, to reinforce that you truly hear them, and care.

, If you see something beautiful in someone, if you see good in someone or if you recognize a kindred spirit, tell them! Don't hold back on such vital connecting material, as it can make all the difference in the world for both of you.

, It doesn't matter if you don't normally do the activity, sometimes it is about the spirit of participation. At the very least, you can say you tried; you might even end up liking the activity so much that you do it again. People enjoy having others try things with them and will appreciate the compliment of you being willing to give things a go, for their sake.

, Forever be confident in what you're doing. Let people know that you're confident. Think what you want to do, be confident with it and help people to feel that you're interesting to be around because you're interested in life.

, Finally, the most scary advice and yet potentially the most valuable, is for you to never be afraid of being the one who loves the most. Love is not a competition, it is a wellspring from within a healthy, positive and centered person. If you happen to love more than what comes back to you, don't analyze it or use it as an excuse to hide away again. Instead, realize that your love is endless, bountiful and will in many ways come bouncing back to you, from different people at different times. You just need to trust that it is worth continuing to send out more love into the world. Because it certainly is.

Understand body language.,
Detect a woman’s signals.,
Detect a man’s signals.,
Watch for eye contact.",How to Know when Someone Likes You1," 93% of all communication is nonverbal.This is broken down to their tone of voice, face, body, and finally their words. Men and women share some forms of body language, but also have specific subconscious signals they’ll give off if they like you.;
, Women are capable of over fifty signals conveyed through body language. While not all of these will be able to be detected, there are a few recognizable quirks you can find. Some of the bigger indicators to look for on a date or in conversation is:


She’ll pull up her sleeves and expose her wrist. This is a good signal, and most women are unaware that they do this. This exposes one of the more tender and sensitive parts of the body.
She will try to close the distance between you in some way. This can be done in many ways like moving her drink or a menu closer to you.She’ll find a way to touch you. Some women will do this smoothly. For example she says “come here” and she’ll show you an app on her phone. Then when you’re near your bodies may touch.

, Men are less equipped with a range in body language. One signal to watch out for is when the guy pushes his shoulders back and directs his breath to his chest. Another strange one is when a guy puts his fingers through his belt loops like a cowboy., Eye contact is the universal body language clue that can communicate so much. Both men and women will use eye contact when they like someone. Try not to hold contact for too long, or else you might ruin the mystique around it. The biggest give away is if he looks at you and you both hold eye contact for a moment and suddenly look away."

Believe it can work.,
Be open to new things.,
Talk about your ex.This does not mean have a long conversation about why your ex was so wonderful and especially not that you still love him.",How to Like Your Current Boyfriend when You Still Love Your Ex2," If you don’t believe your new relationship has a future, you aren’t going to be as invested in it or in liking your new boyfriend. Believing and wanting your relationship to work will help you be positive about the relationship and your boyfriend. It will also help you get over ex if you are fully invested in making your new relationship the best it can be.


Make a list of all the reasons you believe this relationship can and will work out.
Talk to your new boyfriend about how the two of you can make your relationship good for both of you.

, Don’t try to do what you did, the way you did it with your ex. Remember that this relationship is new and different. You don’t want to replay your old relationship with a new boyfriend. Trying new things, having new rituals, and making new traditions with your boyfriend will help the two of you bond — making it easier to like him even though you still love your ex.


If you and your ex ate lunch together every Wednesday and Friday, consider meeting your new beau for weekend brunch.
If you called your ex ""Baby,"" try calling your current boyfriend ""Sweetie,"" ""Honey,"" or some other nickname.

, You should, however, talk briefly about why the relationship ended.Talking about it is part of letting your boyfriend get to know you better. It also reinforces for you why your ex is your ex and not your boyfriend, which can help you like your boyfriend even more.


Keep the talk to the basics: who he was, how long you were together, why you aren’t together anymore.
Be honest. Don’t bash your ex if he honestly doesn’t deserve it and, at the same time, don’t glorify him. Just be truthful about him and your old relationship.
Talk about it once and then don’t talk about any more. Bringing it up over and over again will hurt your new boyfriend.
If you feel the need to talk about your ex more, then talk to a friend, or if needed, a counselor.

Accept that it’s over.,
Consider why you broke up.,
Think about if you're really ready for a new relationship.,
Avoid contact with your ex.,
Learn to see your ex in a new light.,
Let time do its work.",How to Like Your Current Boyfriend when You Still Love Your Ex3," One of the best ways for you to move on from your ex is to admit the relationship is over.Although you may be holding onto the hope that you and he will get back together, you need to let that hope fade. The relationship is over and he is your ex, not your boyfriend. Understanding this will help you move on and focus more on your current boyfriend.


Avoid still thinking of your ex as your boyfriend. He’s not. Try to avoid thinking of him at all.
Write in your journal or talk with a friend about the relationship ending. Be sure to refer to the relationship in the past tense to emphasis that it is over and include the reasons you broke up.
Every time you think about him, also think about why you are glad you aren’t together anymore. Make a list of reasons you’re glad if you need to.

, Sometimes, when we love someone, we overlook or ‘forget’ the reasons why they are not a good match for us. We remember the good things about the person, but skip over the bad. Thinking honestly about why you broke up can give perspective on the situation and help you accept that your new boyfriend might be better for you right now.


Did your ex do something wrong like lie to you or cheat on you? Were you two not compatible or did you grow apart?
Did he leave you for someone else or simply break up with you for no reason? Did you do something that caused the relationship to end?
Write a letter to yourself listing all of the reasons why your ex wasn’t right for you. Refer to it as often as necessary.

, If you are not invested in your current relationship, and you are not over your ex, you may want to evaluate if you are ready to date right now. It might be best to have some alone time to process your feelings before trying to force yourself to feel a certain way for your current boyfriend.


Ask yourself: Am I dating him because I really like him or for some other reason? Am I trying to get revenge against my ex or make him jealous? Do I just like the idea of being with someone and I don't want to be single?
Consider that, if you still love your ex, you may not be ready to enter a new relationship and you need to spend some time working through your feelings and healing before you are ready to date.
Spend some time with friends and family, work on achieving personal goals, and improving your self-esteem while you get over your ex.

, Unless there is a very good reason, you should not be in contact with your ex, and especially not on a regular basis.Keeping in contact will make it harder for you to move and have you stuck loving him. Eventually this will get in the way of your new relationship.


Don’t call, text, email, or go by to see how he is doing. He is fine.
Consider temporarily blocking him on social media so that you don’t have his posts popping up on your timeline remind you of him or tempting you to comment on them.If you must have contact, keep it to a minimum and avoid talking about your past relationship.

, Some relationships end for very good, clear reasons — someone cheated, or the relationship was toxic and unhealthy. But sometimes a relationship ends without an obvious reason — you love each other but you want different things, one of you had to relocate, etc. — and these can be especially hard to get over. Your ex may be an awesome person that is deserving of your love, but it just wasn't right. So how do you get over this person? Try to separate the familiar, admiration-type of love from the romantic type of love you had hoped for. Realize that loving them in a certain way — as a friend and someone you care about and respect — is okay, and you can do that while loving your new boyfriend in a romantic way.

, As time passes you will think less and less about your past relationship and eventually you will get over your love for your ex. It may take weeks, months, or even a year. But, you have got to be patient and allow time to help you move on.

Watch for insecurities.,
Have a talk.",How to Know when Someone Likes You2," People often times think they are only friends, while one of them develops intense feelings for the other.

, Here are some signs that a friend has fallen for you:


Touching your shoulders and ask for hugs.
Offering their sweater or coat in a chivalrous way.
Making jokes about the people/person you are dating.
Inviting you over more often.
Kissing you on the cheek or asking for kisses on the cheek.
Asking who you like, a lot.

, This may go with all types of attraction, but it especially happens in a friend dynamic. They might check your reactions to things consistently. For example, they’ll look at you to see if you laugh when they make a joke.


Be careful if you hear them talk about insecurities in their appearance. They might be self-deprecating and compare themselves to someone you find attractive.

, If you find that you actually like them, then that is great and you should tell them. If, on the other hand, you just want to be friends, you’ll need to be careful.


Honesty is the best policy. Don’t tiptoe around the elephant in the room. Be upfront about the way you feel and how much you appreciate your friendship.

Notice if they look for attention.,
Realize that some people are afraid of rejection.,
Watch for the signs.",How to Know when Someone Likes You3," This type isn't going to be open to you and admit they like you. These are the kind of people who occasionally make small talk with you. You might even catch them looking at you once in awhile.


Usually these types of people don’t date often. When they do, they tend to hold onto a relationship for awhile.
You can usually tell this type by the way they act around their friends in comparison to being around crushes., These people aren’t being deliberately shy. Some people don’t have as much confidence. You shouldn’t dismiss them because of it. A shy or awkward person might show you they like you when:


They say hey occasionally, but say it quietly where you can hardly understand them.
They might blush when you talk to them or touch them.
You catch them staring at you. If they turn away when they noticed you're looking at them, they were looking at you.
They may ask you for help on things they already know the answer to., Someone who likes you may do something to have you notice them. Watch if they talk louder when you're nearby, or starts laughing with their friends when you’re around.


They may not talk to you on a social website, but they’ll ""like"" a bunch of things you do online.

, Some people will do almost nothing to show you they like you because they are afraid of rejection and heartbreak.


This happens often with younger people who haven’t realized rejection is part of life.

, Even though this type of person won’t be too obvious, there are still clues to tell they like you. Pay attention for the following signals:


Bumping into you slightly just to be able to touch you.
Taking the seat beside you even though there are other choices. If they're brave, they might even inch closer to you over time.
Being the first to notice when you are sad or upset, since they pay attention to you."

This type might be the “player” who is just good at saying things you want to hear.Be suspicious of this type if they pull out a stock of pick up lines and you feel them trying to manipulate you.

, Whether or not you want them to like you, you need to handle it with respect. Nobody likes a jerk. Here are some signals that they like you:


They constantly talk to you to the point where it's on the border of being annoying.
They blush at the smallest things you do or say to her.
You catch them staring at you and then smiling or making a funny face when you notice.
They show no fear of starting a conversation.
They might ask you to hang out and give you their number., Never feel the need to wait around if you like someone. Waiting for the other person to ask you out is overrated. Take advantage of the life you’re given. Invite them out for coffee or to go catch a movie.


If you’re not interested and you know they like you, do not ignore them! Be open and honest about your feelings. Treat them with respect and don’t lead them on."

Your friend makes you feel uncomfortable, unhappy or distressed, a lot of the time.
Your friend is stealing from you, taking things without asking and pretending it's ""sharing"", breaking your things, etc.

Your friend is abusing you in any manner, emotionally, physically or both.
Your friend is committing crimes, is trying to get you to commit crimes or cover up for them, etc.;
, Keeping the contact details only tempts you to call them or email them when you reach a time where regret clouds your judgment.

, Don't be too harsh, but just calmly say that you weren't happy in this friendship and you think it would be better for the both of you if you cut ties.

, Think to yourself of all the cruel or abusive things they've done. If they were a true friend in the first place, they wouldn't have made you feel this way.

, People like to have the last word. When they confront you, say exactly what you said to them before, it will show you're the better person if you stay calm. Eventually they will realize that it's over.

, It's time to live in the moment and plan for the future. The past is the past and it's not coming back. Living in the past will only make you regret and miss them more, and then you'll come crawling back to them, and the bad friendship will start all over again.

, If you jump back into the friendship, they may seem like a great friend at first, but they will go back to their old ways.

, They might do this by acting like a 'wounded puppy' or telling you all the bad things you've done. They're just doing that because they're sad and scared of losing their punching bag (you).

, It will get better. You'll begin to think less and less of them everyday and you won't even notice. It'll all be okay.

Political alignment
Religious beliefs
Views on women’s rights and reproductive health
Views on recreational drug use
Emphasis on acquiring material goods and money


Being active when seeking and choosing friends is an important part of learning to select friends who are good for you.If you wait for your friends to select you, you may find you have little in common with them.
Evaluate the results of your analysis. If you have lots of things in common and you two get along great, then you probably have a great friend who would do anything for you. If your results show a high proportion of mismatched attitudes and interests --you’re a vegetarian, he or she is a hunter; you’re liberal and she or he is conservative -- you may have a hard time maintaining a friendship with that individual.
Mismatched interests and attitudes do not necessarily preclude friendship. Ask yourself: Do you truthfully enjoy spending time with this person? Do they enrich your life and experiences? Be honest with yourself. If you don't enjoy being with the other person, especially due to their divergent values, the friendship might not be worth it.;
, Did you feel invigorated and refreshed by your conversation? Or were you worn out and tired of talking with them by the end? If a long time has passed since you had a good talk with your friend, you might be drifting apart.


Do not expect someone who was your friend at one stage of your life to remain your friend throughout your entire life.As people age, friends change due to a variety of circumstances including occupations, geography, and familial commitments. Accepting that your roster of friends will rotate is an important step towards a healthy personal life.
The passage of time alone need not be grounds for ending a friendship. Friends often remain so for many years despite growing older, changing careers, or moving across the country.Email and social media make keeping a friendship alive easy despite the march of time.
Don’t feel obligated to remain friends with someone simply because they have been your friend for a long time. “Zombie friendships” which continue long past their expiration date are a waste of time for both of you. Instead of reminiscing about days gone by with someone you stopped really being friends with years ago, spend your time with your real friends who are engaged and involved in your life as it is today.

, How often do you and your friend spend time with each other? Did you two start off talking all the time, and now you hardly ever speak? Do you find that making time for your friend is just not as important as it used to be? If so, it might mean your friendship may be coming to a close. It may be that one or both of you are getting too busy to keep up with each other, and have other obligations which demand your attention.People sometimes move in different directions. Learning to let friends go is a difficult but necessary ability. There’s no need to excommunicate them; just gradually fade out from their life.
Good friends make time for each other.If the person matters to you -- and if you matter to them -- you will find time for each other and the friendship will survive.
If you are unsure about how much you value your friendship with this friend, try seeing less of him or her. If you usually see each other four days a week, try to see each other three days a week instead. If you’re comfortable with this level of contact, reduce the time you spend with your friend further. If you don’t value their companionship, you will not miss the time spent without them. However, if you value them, you will quickly feel the pangs of longing for the friend you’re seeing less frequently than you were before.

, If you and your friend communicate in different ways, you may not be compatible as friends. For instance, perhaps your friend finds vulgar language and offensive humor hilarious, while you do not. Since you and your friend have such different styles of communication, you can let go of this friend.


Perhaps your friend is socially awkward.A socially awkward person might not ask you follow-up questions after you’ve described your feelings or your day, or not know when to leave a party or get-together. They might also stand, stare, or sit quietly. Socially awkward friend might not understand or empathize with your challenges and difficulties when you share them, and therefore, make for poor friends.

Instead of ending your friendship with a socially awkward friend, you might try helping them along in the conversation. Coax reactions and affirmations of interest out of your friend by asking them questions directly about how your stories affect them or make them feel. Ask rhetorical questions such as “Isn’t that weird/interesting/sad?” where appropriate. Invite your friend to share a similar situation and model the behavior you’d like to see when communicating with them, such as reciprocity (“Yes, that reminds me of a similar situation...”), agreement, and acknowledgment (nod silently or say “Yeah,” “Uh-huh,” or “Wow!”).Try setting boundaries with your friend before cutting ties. Socially awkward individuals might not recognize when you want to be alone or want to spend time with other people. Be direct but sensitive when expressing that you do not wish to spend time with them. You might say “I’m sorry, but I don’t really feel like going out / hanging out tonight.” If your socially awkward friend is adamant, explain that sometimes you need your space and privacy. If they do not respect your decision and continue begging you to spend time with them, ending the friendship is the only choice.


Another communication problem is frequent or deliberate misunderstanding. Some people enjoy causing conflict because it gives them a sense of power and purpose. Such an individual might twist your words to accuse you of something you have not done. For instance, if you mentioned that you’re really looking forward to going to Florida for the summer, a friend who does not possess adequate communicate skills might interpret this (deliberately or not) to mean you do not want to spend time with them over the summer.

, Sometimes your friends will want to be more than friends. Lots of healthy romances start out this way, but if it’s not something you’re interested in, you might have to extinguish the friendship.If your friend puts the moves on you, be honest and tell them how you feel. If the individual truly values your company and companionship, they will accept your decision and stop pursuing a romantic relationship with you.
Sometimes your friend will not accept your decision to keep your friendship platonic. In this case, you will have little choice but to end the friendship.
A friend who wants a romantic relationship could be someone you were in a romantic relationship before. Staying friends with your ex is difficult proposition. The chances that one or the other of you will want to rekindle the romance while the other does not can easily lead to hurt feelings on both sides.
A possible exception to the rule against not being friends with your former lover exists when the passage of many years has allowed both of you to long ago move on.

, If your friend mistreats you or doesn’t show respect, letting that friend go is a good idea. For instance, perhaps he or she fails to take your concerns and problems seriously when you share them with him or her, or maybe they are kind in private but belittle you in front of others.Or, worse, they disparage you both publicly and privately.


A lack of respect toward you might be indirect, aimed at your work or your partner.If your friend is constantly making negative comments about your wife or husband (“She’s not very bright” / “He’s not very good-looking”) you should reconsider having that person in your life.
If you suspect your friend is talking badly about you behind your back, get as much information as you can. Who heard the comment? When and where did they hear it? If the source is reliable, you should take what they reported seriously. If more than one person overheard the comment, ask both separately what was said about you. If the reports about what was said correspond with each other, they are probably telling the truth.
With this information in hand, confront your friend about what they said. If they deny it, give them the benefit of the doubt. For instance, perhaps Sam heard your friend Joe call you stupid. After asking Sam when and where he heard the comment, confront Joe about the situation. Ask him if he was at the place Sam recalled overhearing the statement about you, and if he saw Sam there. Finally, ask Joe if he said what was reported to you. If he admits to making the comment, you should seriously consider ending the friendship. Badmouthing a friend behind their back is not a sign of friendship.
If you continually receive negative reports about things your friend said about you, it might be time to put an end to the friendship and stop believing their lies. Friends who disrespect you are not worth your time and energy.

, Does your friend constantly make you feel dumb? Are they critical of your point of view and unwilling to consider your opinions as valid? Do they persistently put you down for the way you do your hair or the clothes you wear? These are not qualities of a healthy friendship. If your friend does this, it is a clear sign your friendship is headed downhill.Your friend might make fun of your personal habits, such as how late you sleep, the foods you like to eat, or the clothes you wear.
Your friend might make you feel bad due to your circumstances as well.If your friend criticizes your social class, your parents’ occupations, or the manner or size of your home, they are not acting in accordance with the demands of true friendship.
Remember, always be yourself. Unless your behavior is hurting you or someone else, never change who you are just to satisfy someone else. A friend accepts you for who you are.

, Narcissists make poor friends. If your friend tends to interrupt you when you’re sharing tales of woe or personal victories, it indicates they are uninterested in your life.Alternately, they might constantly one-up you, insisting that something even greater (or more terrible) happened to them.


For example, you might be sharing a story about how you got high marks on your test and your friend retorts, “Oh, yeah? I got an A in that class and in chemistry, too!” A friend not worth having will feel obligated to steal the limelight whenever something good happens to you.
A good friend always listens patiently to your problems, and offers advice when appropriate. They will not try to make themselves the center of every conversation or insert themselves into your stories.
If your friend demonstrates a lack of empathy, understanding, or sensitivity to your life and concerns, they are not worth keeping.Do they listen to you carefully when you speak? Do they make eye contact? Do they ask follow up questions when you speak? If they do not, take their actions as an indication it is time to end the friendship.

, If your friend is constantly breaking promises, or you have to beg them to spend time with you, the friendship is not on stable ground. For instance, if you both agree to go to the hockey game over the weekend, then at the last minute your friend cancels, it may be time to break off the friendship.When your friend does not reply to your calls, it is likely she or he is deliberately avoiding conversation with you. Your friend might also not reply to emails, letters, instant messages, or text messages.
When your friend is bailing on you via text, you’ll know your friendship is basically at rock-bottom. Good friends confront each other directly with they know they are letting their friends down.
Be on the lookout for lame excuses (“I had to feed my cat”) or half apologies (“If you had told me sooner, I would have come”). These are signs your friendship is not important to the other person., Does your friend only contact you when they want something? For instance, do they mooch off you for rides to work or school? Do they only act friendly when you loan them money or pay their way at the movies, restaurants, or other social situations? Are they too busy for you, except when they want you to put in a good word with your connection at the place they are applying for a job? If your friend feels no moral obligation to pay for themselves (and especially if they do not return your generosity when you need it), you are dealing with a moocher. Cut off all contact posthaste to protect your finances and sanity.If you don’t feel the problem warrants ending the friendship, at least learn to say no. Do not allow your friend to continue using you as a meal ticket. Be courteous but firm in your rejection of their requests.
Friendship requires give and take. If you are constantly doing something for your friend and they are not doing anything for you, your friend is exploiting you. For instance, perhaps your friend expects you to treat them to the movies all the time, but they never treat you when you hang out. In this case, make your friend pay his or her own way in the future.
If a friend insists that you pay because they have become accustomed to it, let them know that from now on you want to take financial responsibility for yourself, and you expect them to pay their own way. If they insist on knowing why, let them know that you feel it is unfair to pay for them all the time while they do not return the favor. If they are a good friend, they’ll see the error of their ways and amend their behavior. If they are not a friend worth keeping, they’ll react with accusations, blaming, and anger. Should the latter situation unfold, rid yourself of this friend as fast as possible.

, If your friend is addicted to drugs or alcohol, they may need serious counseling. As a good friend, you want to support them in their fight against addiction but cutting ties in an act of “tough love” is often the only way to get them to wake up. An intervention is a serious event where the addict’s loved ones and friends gather to confront the individual in question about their unhealthy habits.


The upshot of the intervention is an ultimatum that unless they sober up, they will have no-one left to turn to for friendship or financial aid, as you and the rest of their family and friends can no longer stand by and watch them self-destruct. Interventions are serious affairs and should be treated as such.
Alternately, if your friend is a bad influence on you and encourages you to take up drugs and drink at the same rate they do, you should not continue to be friends with them. Such an individual is not looking out for your best interests. Ending a friendship with an addict who will not change is the best option to keep you healthy.
A friend with a drinking problem can be a threat not themselves and others, but a burden as well. You may find yourself worrying about them, or embarrassed to be associated with themA friend like this should be let go to protect your own mental health and well-being.

, Maybe your friend is irritating. He or she complains all the time. They are like a broken record about some (ever-changing) problem or fixation -- a new girlfriend or boyfriend, a “totally sweet” car they want, or a rotten boss at work.


For instance, maybe your friend wants a “totally sweet ride,” and can’t tell that you aren’t interested in looking at yet another picture of it or hearing how fast it can go from zero to sixty. A few days later, they do the same thing -- with another model car. The cycle continues. Being friends with annoying people is hard work -- sometimes, too hard. Such a friend may not be worth the trouble and irritation they cause.
Perhaps your friend calls or texts you nonstop. They do not care if you’re at work, school, or church, and no matter how much you ignore them, they continue to attempt contact.
Your annoying friend might not have done anything major to earn your irritation. Some people just rub us the wrong way. If your friend is annoying because of the words they use (especially a repeated catchphrase or slogan), tone of voice, or way they act, they might not make good friends. You have every right to be honest with yourself about your feelings, and if you are annoyed or irritated by someone, limit contact with them.

, Friends demonstrate their trustworthiness in a number of ways. A good friend will keep secrets you tell him or her safe. They will never lie to you, and always speak to you openly and honestly.


Friends should not reveal information about you which they know or suspect would be embarrassing or shameful if made public.Joking with people who are not your friends about your personal struggles, phobias, or sources of anxiety are acts which no friend should engage in.If your friend does this or shares other information you told them in confidence, they are unworthy of your friendship.
If your friend lies to you, it is probably time to end a friendship. Lies can be big (telling you they didn’t take your money when they really did) or small (telling you that you looked fine when in fact you had makeup smeared across your face). Don’t let a liar excuse their behavior with assertions such as “It’s not a big deal, it was just a white lie.” No matter the type or size of lie, lying friends will continue to let you down, and may even get you in trouble with their lies.
If your friend has a habit of lying, it’s best to let them go. They cannot be trusted, and trying to build a friendship without trust is like building a house on a foundation of sand: eventually, it’s going to come tumbling down.

, Setting boundaries means designating what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior between you and your friend. Your friend should show respect for your space and possessions. A friend who “crosses the line” on any of these boundaries should be relinquished.


If your friend doesn’t respect your possessions, they are not a friend worth having. Examples of a friend who doesn’t appreciate your boundaries around possessions might take your clothes and wear them without asking. They might also “borrow” your things and sell them to a store which accepts used goods, or just refuse to give them back when asked to do so.When a friend doesn’t respect your space, this is also a violation of personal boundaries. If your friend is constantly looking over your shoulder when you text or surf the web, or feels they can invite themselves over to your place uninvited, they do not have a healthy respect for your personal space.
Sharing your life and feelings with friends is crucial to growing the friendship on a deeper level. But it is important to let friends know that they cannot walk all over you. You’re better off without a friend who cannot respect your boundaries.
Decide if you are spending too much time with your friend. Clingy, needy friends are to be avoided. Set boundaries with your friend and ensure they understand them. Explain in clear, concise language that you cannot spend all your time with them, and you need alone time to decompress and process your own life.

If your friend is constantly calling you for advice and support regarding his or her relationships or interpersonal conflicts, it’s time to move on. Do not feel bad for “abandoning” a clingy friend.Being dragged into their messy life time and again is selfish on their part, and it’s important for your mental health to avoid the pressure, stress, and psychic pain of being constantly leaned on and forced to help them recover.



, Abuse can be physical or emotional. Physical abuse includes hitting, shoving, or slapping. Emotional abuse includes name-calling, making and then breaking promises, and criticizing without intention to offer constructive advice. An abusive friendship should be ended.


You need not suffer any lasting or serious bodily damage for physical abuse to be hurtful. Being pushed around or punched not only hurts physically, but can leave you feeling scared and disappointed in yourself. You might also feel frustrated and confused when someone you thought was your friend hurts you.
Emotional abuse could take a number of forms, but is characterized by making another person feel worthless, rejected, or alone. One example of emotional abuse could be a friend verbally berating you and calling you names. Another example could be the friend telling you that they are your only friend, and if you end your friendship with them, nobody else will ever like you.
Physically abusive friends might later claim they were only joking around or engaging in horseplay, and suggest you should not be upset about their behavior. Do not accept this explanation. Stand your ground and insist that they cease the behavior because you do not deserve it, and end the friendship if they demur.
Don’t accept emotional abuse in any form.Let your friend know you don’t appreciate their abuse and break off the friendship if they do not improve their treatment of you. Spend more time with your other friends who affirm your value and respect you as a person.

, If you feel repulsed by your friend, or if feel your chest tighten or your throat clench when you imagine them, these signs indicate the person is not a good friend for you. Does actually spending time with them make your skin crawl? If so, you may want to let the friendship end.Even if you can’t pinpoint a specific reason why your friend repels you, it’s usually best to go with your gut. Often, our instincts give us the right information even though we don’t understand the reasons completely.
If your friend makes you feel passive aggressive -- or even just aggressive -- it’s time to end a friendship. The feelings you’re experiencing are best avoided by staying away from the friend who inspires them. Yelling at, accusing, and passing judgment on anyone (especially your friend) are not healthy ways to communicate. Good friends should bring out the best in us.
You might also feel antagonistic toward your friend. Perhaps you hope that they do not succeed, or that they do not achieve the things they want to. These are not the things that friends wish for each other, and you should take this as an indication that now is the time to end this friendship.
Do you feel the need to emphasize your friend’s flaws all the time? Do you show little empathy toward them? These tendencies indicate you do not value the friend. Stay aware of these negative, unfriendly behaviors and use them as a gauge to decide if your friendship is worth keeping.

Consider the reasons why you do not have friendships.,
Accept yourself the way you are.,
Decide if you even want to be more social or not.,
Consider whether you might have social anxiety or another condition.,
See a counselor or therapist.",How to Live Without Friends During School Years1," Not having friends may be from a variety of different causes. Take some time to consider your reasons. Also, keep in mind that you can choose to change your situation and seek out friends if you want. Some questions you might ask yourself to determine the reason why you don’t have friends at the moment include:

Have you undergone a significant change recently? Going away to college or moving to a new city can be part of the reason why you may not yet have friends. Likewise, having a falling out with friends can lead to isolation. Did you recently lose a friend or group of friends for some reason?
Are you naturally introverted? If you tend to prefer your alone time to spending time with other people, then you might be an introvert. If this is the case, then not having friends may be due to a preference for solitude. However, you can still have friends and maintain your solitude.
Have you been struggling with emotional turmoil lately? If you have been feeling down for a while and unable to motivate yourself to go out and seek friendship, then this could also be part of the reason why you don’t have friends. If so, it is important to seek help. Talk to your school counselor, someone in the counseling center at your college, or a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, or religious leader.;
, It is important to accept yourself for who you are right now. Realize that there’s nothing wrong with you for being shy, different, or just not very social. Your worth as a person isn’t determined by how many friends you have, so don’t let anyone make you feel bad about yourself.If your peers try to make fun of you, stand up for yourself. Don’t get into a physical fight, but do let people know you aren’t a pushover.
If you want to make more friends in the future, accepting yourself as you are now is an important first step.

, Despite what society and other people might tell you, it’s perfectly okay to prefer spending time by yourself. There is nothing wrong with being quiet, introverted, and reserved. If you decide you don’t mind not having close friends, don’t let anyone tell you your preference is wrong.However, keep in mind that being alone all of the time is not healthy either. You may not want to be as social as other people, but having some degree of socialization is healthy.

, If being around people makes you nervous, ask yourself whether social anxiety could be holding you back from making friends. Other conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and autism can also make it difficult to befriend others.If you think you have a mental health disorder, ask your parents to take you to a doctor or therapist.

, If you feel persistently sad or hopeless, talk to your school counselor or a therapist. They can help you get to the bottom of your feelings and develop some strategies for coping socially."

Give her a role, if she wants it.",How to Live with a Mother in Law," When there are several generations of adults living in a household, it can be easy to get in a war about how the cooking, cleaning, and shopping is done.You and your spouse may have always done things a certain way and find yourselves having to submit to your MIL’s methods instead. To prevent such a bumping of heads, discuss the details of the household early on.


How you choose to handle things will depend largely on your personal preferences and your MIL’s. If the living arrangement is only temporary, you might feel okay releasing the reigns and getting a break from some of your household chores. Or, if you are temporarily moving in with her, you might not mind having to move up something like dinner time to suit her regular schedule.
However, if this move is permanent, the three of you need to decide who will take care of what from here on out. For example, you or your spouse might prefer to cook most meals, but request that your MIL (if physically capable) help out with the laundry and house-cleaning.;
, Similar to household chores, you will also want to outline how discipline will take place in your changing home environment. Although there are bound to be some disagreements between all the adults over what’s right or wrong for the children, talking about discipline beforehand can help to get everyone on the same page and set clear boundaries.You and your spouse should sit down with his mother and explain to her how disciplining is done in your household. Include everything that’s relevant—major infractions, typical punishments, and quirks of each individual child.
Then, you may want to explain what you expect of her. Perhaps, you want to leave the disciplining up to you and your spouse. In this context, your MIL might simply tell either of you when one of the kids is out of line and allow you to handle the issue. Just be sure that everyone understands their role.
Also, encourage your mother-in-law to respectfully support you and your spouse’s disciplinary decisions, or, at the very least, not verbally challenge or criticize them in front of the children. You might say, “Mom, I know you may not agree with all of our choices, but it would be great if you could show your support in front of the children.”

, Try not to be extremely stringent about the small stuff that doesn’t matter all that much to you. That way, you can continue to hold your ground about the big issues without seeming inflexible.


For instance, if your MIL has something that’s important to her that she wants to do, such as doing the laundry a certain way, don’t fight her on it if the change doesn’t really affect the household environment, and isn’t all that important to you.

, If your elderly mother-in-law is moving into your home, you may need to make some logistical changes to ensure her comfort. Many families often build an in-law suite which provides most of the essentials of a home and allows her a sense of privacy.Depending on your MIL’s health you may also need to modify bathrooms and other rooms to promote handicap accessibility.


Work with your spouse and your MIL’s health care team to determine what changes need to be made in your home before she arrives. For example, if you have a multi-story home, it may be best to set your MIL up in a downstairs bedroom to reduce her need to take the stairs. You might also need to install a ramp outdoors to accommodate her wheelchair, if she has one., Communication between you and your spouse should be top priority during and after the transition of living with your mother-in-law. The two of you need to be in accord and your spouse needs to be willing to maintain any limitations with his mom. If he or she falters in supporting your guidelines, you may end up continually at war with your MIL about this issue or that one. What’s more, you might also find yourself at war with your spouse.Presenting as a united front is incredibly important. For one, if your spouse doesn’t fully cooperate, your mother-in-law may not respect your decision and try to fight you on it. Seeing that the two of you are firm in your rules will minimize the chances of that.

, Working in accord also means that you should bring any problems to your spouse before discussing them with his or her mom. By doing this, you have a chance to vent your frustrations in a safe space. Then, the two of you can come up with an action plan as a couple.


Your spouse may want to address any issues with mom alone or with you present. Respect his or her choice either way. Hold your tongue if your mother-in-law says or does something in defiance of your boundaries.You can easily say something in the moment that you later regret.Spouting off in anger can quickly result in creating a divide between you and your spouse because you were disrespectful with his mom.
You might say “Honey, your mother criticized my parenting in front of the kids today. It really made me feel like we weren’t on the same team. Could you please talk with her about this when you get a chance?”

, Your mother-in-law living in the home can potentially eliminate the intimacy factor between you and your spouse. The time you and your spouse may have spent together watching TV after putting the kids to bed or after a long day’s work might be interrupted by her presence. It’s essential that the two of you cherish and protect your alone time, which will strengthen your bond despite the new household changes.Talk with your mother-in-law and explain your needs. You may be able to request that she babysit so that you two can go on a date. Or, you might simply let her know that on Fridays, you and your spouse enjoy lunch together, and you’d appreciate if you could keep it that way.
Balance your demands by doing plenty of things as a whole family, and also encourage your spouse to spend time with his or her mother, too.
An example of how to approach this subject might be “Ms. April, we usually go to dinner on Fridays as a couple. We would like to continue this tradition. However, we would like to start going to brunch on Sundays as a family, and would love it if you joined us.”

, Whether it’s a weekly mani/pedi, morning run or workout session, or a blissful cup of coffee before the kids wake, be sure you are practicing regular self-care. Three generations of family members are a lot to care for. You may now be responsible for caring for your kids, your spouse, and your MIL. You can’t pour from an empty cup, so be sure to make time to care for you as well.

, Building a positive relationship with your mother-in-law is significant to the well-being of everyone in your household. Plus, maintaining a friendly, respectful nature with her is good role-modeling for your children.One way to boost the connection between the two of you is to join in on one of her hobbies, or invite her to participate in yours.

, Even if you find your mother-in-law particularly difficult, she is still your spouse’s mother and, therefore, deserves your consideration and respect.Instead of shutting her out of the big decisions, consult with her. Doing so may make her feel like a valued member of the family. Likely, asking her opinion may present you in a more favorable light as well.


Keep in mind, asking her opinion does not translate to taking her advice. Grandparents truly want to be helpful. So, even if you choose to go a different route, it still counts that you asked and listened to her opinion on the matter.Here’s one way to ask her opinion: “So, we were thinking about visiting Cole in college soon. We would like all of us to go together as a surprise. Do you think it would be best to go the first or last weekend in the month?”

, Multi-generational families are becoming more and more common these days.Even if you are not so happy about having to live under the same roof as your mother-in-law, do your part to make her feel like a part of the larger family. This means that merely sharing meals or holding casual conversations is not enough. Include her in different outings to help her feel like a true part of things.


Although you might have a tense relationship, she is still family. Plus, your children probably love to spend time with her. Invite her out for a special dinner to celebrate the kids’ good grades. Ask if she wants to join in on this year’s summer vacation. These small acts of kindness may go a long way towards improving your relationship.

, With aging parents, the last thing you want to do is make them feel useless or like a burden.If your MIL has moved in with you, she may desire a way to contribute in the household. Depending on your mother-in-law’s abilities, offer her some level of autonomy within the household so that she does not feel like wasted space.


For example, if your spouse’s mom can safely and effectively babysit the children, it may be viewed as an insult when you hire a babysitter. If she is still able to operate a vehicle, you might assign her to after-school pickup duty.
Ask her “Hey, Mom, is there some way you would like to pitch in with the kids or in the house? If you would like to help out, we appreciate it.”

Use good manners in your day-to-day life, and treat other people the way you want them to treat you.When you treat other people well, your peers won’t have anything to use against you, and you’ll have an easier time making friends in the future if you want to.

, High school and college provide plenty of opportunities to get involved in interesting activities. Look for programs offered by your school or community center. Participating in a club or group can be a good way to stay connected to other people without having to become close friends with them.For instance, you could join a science club, a book discussion group, or a sports team.
You can also check out Meetup.com to find people who will share your interests.

, Animals can be wonderful companions, especially dogs. Some people even find that animals are better friends than people. If you don’t already have a pet, ask your parents about adopting one.Consider adopting a shelter dog or cat. These animals often have a hard time finding good homes, but they can make very loyal pets.
Having a dog may also help you to break the ice when you are out walking with your dog. For example, someone might compliment your dog, and this could be a good opportunity to strike up a conversation, such as by saying, “Thank you! Do you have a dog?”
Having a dog or cat might also provide you with something to chat about with neighbors or new acquaintances. For example, if someone brings up their pet, then you could say, “Oh, I just adopted a cat/dog myself. I really enjoy the companionship.” Then, you could show a picture of your pet and talk with the person about your pets.

, Search job boards and volunteer sites on the internet for positions that interest you. Working and volunteering are good ways to get involved with your community and interact with other people regularly.Start small. Even a job at McDonald’s or Starbucks will help you save money for the future.
Volunteering for a cause you care about will make you feel good, and the experience will give you a leg up when you search for jobs or apply to college.

, If you’re not spending time with friends often, your social skills might be rusty. Look for opportunities to practice introducing yourself to people, keeping a conversation going, and making people feel comfortable around you.If you aren’t sure why you don’t have friends and you know your social skills are a bit rusty, then this could be a potential explanation. However, keep in mind that having rusty social skills is often indicative of a deeper problem, such as a fear of rejection. Talk with an adult you trust, like a parent or a teacher, to talk about why you might be having some issues with social interactions.

Act interested.,
Be an active listener.,
Disclose something personal.,
Risk being rejected.",How to Live Without Friends During School Years4," If you want to make friends, there are a few tips you can follow to increase your chances of success. In general, people like to talk about themselves. So, as a rule-of-thumb, you can connect with others by asking them their stories.

Opt for open-ended questions or statements that allow the person to share as much as they like as opposed to questions which lead to simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answers. You might ask at an event, ""So, how do you know the host?"" or ""What kinds of things do you do for fun?"", In addition to being able to strike up the conversation and get people talking, you also need to be an active listener. Make occasional eye contact, nod in agreement, and use sounds to prompt the person to continue talking.Engaged listeners make great friends because many people often want to vent their problems or share their points of view. Practice being fully engaged while you are listening and be ready to respond with a statement that summarizes what you just heard.
For example, you might say, ""It sounds like you had a really rough day"" to sum it up after the speaker is done talking.

, Vulnerability is a necessary and truly beautiful ingredient in a friendship. Self-disclosure is one of the many things that distinguish friends from acquaintances. You might tell your friend about your parent's divorce, but you may not share that info with a random person. Make a minor self-disclosure to show the person that you trust them.Think of something small you can share with the other person about yourself like ""I had a pretty rough term last school year. My parents got divorced."" Then, see how they handle it to determine if the friendship goes any further.

, If you're ready to take your connection with someone to the friendship stage, you'll have to be willing to take a risk. If you and a potential friend have been hanging out in a group setting, invite the person to a one-on-one outing. This shows that you would like to get to know them beyond the group.

Say, ""Hey, you seem really cool. Would you like to catch a movie together this Saturday?"""

Understand that they are also human beings.,
Listen.,
Do not assume things when it comes to women but ask them instead when you do not know something.,
Make sure she feels safe before you expect her to tell you all her secrets.,
Make plenty of eye contact to make her the center of attention.,
Compliment her.,
Be presentable.,
Establish goals.,
Remember the little or small events.",How to Know What a Woman Wants," And just like you do not know what you want sometimes, they don't either. Thus, women are not ""all knowing beings"". In addition, all women are different. Just like all men are different. Only with time and effort you will be able to better understand women.;
, Use both your ears and all other senses and pay attention to a woman. She might tell things to you in words or by body language. You will need to understand what her words mean and also how she expresses herself.

, They might not always give you a fair answer but you can always try. Women are very sensitive so be comforting and sweet, they don't want a huge jerk of a boyfriend.

, This is one of the most important things if you want to know what women want. Because, when a woman feels comfortable with you, she will be more likely to open up and dare to speak her mind. You are less likely to hear the truth from a woman who does not feel safe with you.

, Also, avoid the urge to look around. When you do, it makes her feel like insecure and like you are looking for someone else. Make sure you lean in when talking to her and pay attention to what she is saying. If you are in a loud place, use this as an opportunity to lean in.

, Everyone likes to be complimented every once in a while. If this is not something you are used to doing, start by saying something about her outfit or her hair. As you become more comfortable, you can complement her features. Women love to hear that they have beautiful eyes, kissable lips, soft hair, and a nice figure.

, Women want a man who is presentable and looks good. This means nicely combed hair, a well-kept mustache or beard, and free from acne. A woman wants a man who she is proud to introduce to her girlfriends and family. She wants a man whose arm she is proud to hold onto during social events. This does not mean wearing designer clothing, but it does mean dressing nicely. No holes, stains, or dirt marks allowed.

, There is nothing sexier than a man who knows what he wants and isn’t afraid to go for it. When a man has goals, it shows that he has a life outside of the relationship. This is a good thing. Women do not want to feel like a man's life revolves around her. It can feel smothering and be stressful. When a man has goals, it shows ambition, strength, and determination.  It shows a woman that he is a good man that has life by the horns.

, A man who remembers little things is the man who remembers birthdays, anniversaries, important holidays, or the day you met each other. It also doesn’t hurt if you remember she’s allergic to chocolate or peanuts. Really, the important thing here is to show her that you care enough to remember.

Tell yourself all the reasons you should leave.,
Make a final decision to leave.,
Tell him you want to meet him in a place you know is risky for him.,
Tell him outright that you've had enough.,
Change your phone number, and do not program his in.,
Block him from your email, Facebook and Linkedin accounts, and so forth.,
Tell him you'll contact his wife if he does not leave you alone.,
Go out and do things you love.,
Pamper yourself.,
Be ready to cut him off.,
When you're ready, start dating.",How to Leave a Married Man," If you stay, you're just hurting yourself, his children, his family, and his wife. Also bear in mind that most men who cheat a first time will cheat again. Which means, he'll eventually cheat on you.;
, Perhaps you've left before, only to be promised that he'll leave his wife soon, and he told how much you were loved. Maybe he wooed you back. But it's been a while and he's still with her. And you have finally had enough. Make a decision to leave him for good.

, If he agrees to meet in a risky place, try to show him affection and watch him pull away. As difficult as it is, the fact that he won't be affectionate with you in public, or want to go somewhere he might be seen, will only make your resolve to leave stronger.

, That you want out and that perhaps you love him but it's not enough anymore. You've heard his promises for a very long time and he has never made good on them and you're done. Even if he pleads and begs be firm and strong. You are leaving him, regardless of his reaction.

, One of the best ways to break up with a married man is totally and completely. No late night calls, no calls during the day when he's at work away from his wife and kids. If he does not have your number and you don't program his in your phone, you'll be less likely to call him. And he won't be able to call you.

, You don't want any contact or reminders. So block him from everyplace you can think of. He needs to realize that you're done. This is just part of how you're showing him that.

, Usually the threat alone is enough for him to go away. And when he does, remind yourself of how easily he left and realize you will find someone much better out there sometime very soon.

, And while you're out, flirt. Maybe you're not ready for another romance, but don't stay in bed crying. Get out there and connect with other people, and other men. Show yourself you are a sexy, attractive woman who will find someone much better very soon.

, Take long bubble baths, wear lingerie just for yourself, because you deserve it. Reinforce the fact that you don't need a man, especially a married man, to show you and make you feel beautiful.

, If he shows up at work, have a co-worker ask him to leave. If he shows up at your house, don't answer the door and if he calls, hang up on him. Cut him off entirely. If you have nothing to do with him, you will move on faster.

, Then start a relationship with someone. Or, a few someones. Just don't become involved with a married man again. If you meet someone married, remember the heartbreak and move on without letting him get close. You will find someone single who is right for you.

Know he’s not the one if you can barely communicate.,
Know he’s not the one if he doesn’t get along with your friends and family.,
Know he’s not the one if you’re not better together.,
Know he’s not the one if he doesn’t share your values.,
Know he’s not the one if he doesn’t love you for who you are.",How to Know That He Is Not the One," Many people have this idea of “the one” as being this perfect, god-like person who will solve all of your problems and make every day of your life a fairy tale. However, the real way to know if you’re with “the one” is to see that you’re with a person you love whose flaws you are able to accept. If you’re able to deal with the loud belching, the bad taste in music, or the messiness of the man you’re with instead of cringing every time he does something you deem imperfect, then he’s the one.


This doesn’t mean that you can’t talk about having him change some of his flaws, like learning to clean up better. But if he’s not the one, then you probably can’t stand his imperfections.;
, If you’re with the one, it doesn’t mean you’ll be feeling butterflies 24/7, contrary to what you may think. However, if he’s really not the one for you, then you won’t feel a thing when you get ready to meet him or come home to him. You should feel a sense of excitement and expectation when you’re about to see him or spend time with him if he’s the one.


If you don’t feel any kind of joy about seeing him, then you may be looking at him more as a friend, or may just have gotten bored with him.
The next time you get ready to see him, ask yourself how excited you are. Does your heart race a little? Have you been looking forward to it all day? You don’t have to be over-the-moon happy every single time you hang out, but it should be something you look forward to for sure.

, If he’s the one, then you should already be thinking about living the rest of your life with him, whether this means getting married, having kids, and all the traditional things, or if it means being life partners and exploring life together. If you look forward a few years, or even think about what you’ll be doing next summer, and can’t imagine him being by your side, then you know he’s not the one.


Another sign that he’s not the one is that he’s never mentioned a future with you in it. If he gets nervous or changes the subject every time you bring up the future, then it’s a sign that he’s not serious about you.
Try to imagine your life in ten years, as crazy as that may sound. Does it seem impossible to picture him by your side, or not by your side? If you absolutely can’t see it, then he’s not the one.

, If he’s the one, then you should feel like you’re able to be yourself around him, instead of having to dress up or fit a certain role in his life. You should be able to look like yourself, talk like yourself, and express your views without worrying that you’ll upset or disappoint him. Though you can feel a little bit nervous just because you like him, you know he’s not the one if you’re constantly stressed out, anxious, or worrying about how he feels about you.


If you’re constantly worried that something you say will upset him or set him off, then he’s not the one.

, If he’s the one, then you should feel comfortable telling him the truth, whether this means where you’ve been or what your worries about the relationship are. You shouldn’t feel like every little thing you tell him will make him angry, jealous, moody, or just reserved. If he really cares for you, then you should feel like you can tell him anything without making you feel afraid or anxious. If he makes you feel scared every time you want to tell him what’s really on your mind, then he’s not the one.


If you feel like you have to lie to protect him or to keep him from getting angry, then he’s not the one.
If you feel like you can open up to him about your doubts and that he will listen and take you seriously, then he may be the one.

, You can sit down with your best friends and family members and you can go down a million checklists about whether or not he’s the one, but in the end, you’re the only person who can figure this one out. It can be helpful to turn to sources like wikiHow for advice, but at the end of the day, you’ll be the only person to know if the guy is not the one, no matter what anyone else says.


Remember that what is perfect for your best friend or favorite aunt may not be great for you; people can help you, but they can’t make the decision for you because you’re different people with different needs.
However, one sign that he may not be the one is that you’re on this page. If you’re already having your doubts about whether or not he’s the one, then you may have a problem.
As corny as it sounds, you’ll know whether or not he’s the one in your gut. It’s an intuitive feeling that you sometimes can’t explain. There may be a chance that you already know he’s wrong for you in your gut, but are looking for confirmation.

, Everyone flirts a little bit here and there, and if you flirt every once in a while in a harmless way, it’s not the end of the world. However, if your man is constantly flirting with other girls, talking about other girls, and disrespecting you by checking other girls out, then he’s just not the one. You can’t make excuses for him and can’t convince yourself that he doesn’t mean anything by it; if he really cared about you, then he would never show this type of behavior.


It goes without saying that if he cheats on you, then he’s not the one. It’s one thing if he cheated once and deeply regretted it and you’re working to forgive him and another if he’s a serial cheater. If he repeatedly cheats on you, then the sooner you get out, the better.
Even if he doesn’t cheat on you and it doesn’t go past flirting, the fact that he would do it in front of you or in front of your friends is a sign of major disrespect.

, If he’s the one, then he should be proud to show you off, to hold your hand or have his arm around you in public, and to spend time with you when he’s also with his friends or family. If he always makes up excuses about hanging out in public or having you meet his friends, then he’s not looking for a serious relationship. If he’s eager to hang out in your bedroom but won’t go to the movies with you, then he’s not the one.


Don’t make excuses for him or think he’s really busy when he doesn’t want to go out with you. If he really cared, he’d make the effort.
If you’ve been seeing each other for a long time and he’s never mentioned going out and meeting his friends, then he doesn’t take you seriously.

, Of course, this doesn’t mean that you should make him change who he is, but that, if there’s certain behavior you’d like him to change, such as flirting with other girls or not calling you back, that he should be willing to do that for you. If he’s stubborn and absolutely refuses to change in ways that would make him a more caring, considerate boyfriend, then he’s not the one.


It’s not easy for a man to change, but he should at least be open to a conversation about it. If he gets angry if you even mention something you’d like him to change, then he’s not the one.

, If he’s the one, then he should respect your love for running, your hard work in nursing school, or all the time you spend writing songs. He doesn’t have to participate in all of these hobbies, but he should ask you about them and be impressed that you’re putting in the effort and that you care so much. If he’s the one, then he should be appreciative of the person who you are and the person you want to be.


If he puts down your hobbies and makes you feel like they’re not important, then he’s not the one.
If he puts down your goals and makes you feel like you can’t achieve them, then he’s not the one.

, This is one of the most important signs that he’s just not the one. If he can’t go an hour without lying to you and you find yourself constantly catching him in a lie, then he’s not the one. If he lies about everything from where he’s been to what he had for lunch, then it’s a sign that he’s keeping secrets from you and that he can’t be trusted. If he lies to you, then he’s just not the one.


If you have evidence that he’s been lying and he denies it when you call him out on it, then that’s a red flag, too.
If he respects you, then he should give you his honesty instead of making you look like a fool. Think about it. If he was really the one, would he feel the need to be dishonest?

, If he’s really the one, then he’ll be there for you when the going gets tough just as much as he would when you were having the time of your life. If he’s there for the parties and the fun road trips and falls off the radar the second your grandmother gets sick, then there’s no excuse for it—he’s just not the one. True love means being with a person through the good times and the bad, and if he flees the scene every time you’re struggling, then he’s not the one.


Sure, he may be the perfect gentleman when you’re on a fun date or just chatting over the phone. But if he has nothing to say or has to go when you’re having a family crisis or lost your job, then he’s not the one. You can find someone who will be there for the hardship, too.

, If your man is abusive, then there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it—you have to get out of the relationship, and fast. There is no making excuses like, “He’ll never do it again” or “He really loves me, he just has a lot of problems,” when it comes to physical or emotional abusive. If he puts a hand on you and hurts you, then he is definitely not the one, and you should get out of the relationship as soon as you can.


Nobody said it was easy to leave a man who is abusive, especially if you’re afraid of leaving him. However, you need to talk to your friends and family and get some help in leaving him as soon as you can and as safely as possible.

, If he’s the one, then you should come to think of him as your best friend, as the person that you can tell anything and the one you feel the most comfortable opening up to. If this is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, then you should feel this way. Of course, if you have many close friends, then it can take a while to get here, but this is the feeling you have about him.


If you feel like he’s your romantic partner but like you can’t really open up to him, then he’s not the one.

, Everyone has communication problems, but if you feel like you and the guy can barely talk to each other without fighting or misunderstanding each other, then he’s not the one. If he gets angry every time you try to have a serious conversation, then he’s not the one, because he’s not willing to have an open, honest relationship with you.


If you avoid bringing up serious topics or things that are bothering you because you know he won’t do anything about it, then he’s not the one.
If you feel like he barely listens to you or even looks at you when you try to tell him something important, then he’s not the one.

, You may not think this a big deal when you first start dating each other, but once you’ve been together for a long time, it’s important that your man gets along with your friends and family. These are the closest people to you and they share at least some of your values, and if he can’t get along with a single one of them and doesn’t even try, then he’s not the one.


Of course, it may not be possible for him to get on with your friends and family 100%, and there may be a few people he just can’t click with. You may also have a particularly difficult family to please, and that’s fine. The most important thing is that he makes an effort—if he doesn’t get along with the people you care about and seems fine with it, then he’s not the one.

, The best part about being in a meaningful relationship with your soul mate is that you really do complete each other in some way and make each other feel better when you’re together. Your man should make you feel like a better person and should encourage you to grow and reach your potential. If you feel like he puts you down and makes you worse instead of better, then he’s not the one.


Think about how you’ve changed since meeting him. Have you become more driven, more motivated, or just a happier person, or have you started feeling more down on yourself and less capable of fulfilling your potential? If he’s slowed you down, then he’s not the one.
Of course, it’s important that you encourage him to be better, too.

, If you want to spend the rest of your life with this person, then you have to make sure you see eye to eye on a lot of things. This doesn’t mean you have to share the same religion or the same political affiliation, and there’s something to be said for opposites attracting, but if you feel like his take on the world is so different from yours that you can’t see eye to eye on a single thing, then he’s not the one.


If you’re a true optimist and he is always complaining and bringing you down and can’t find something to be happy about, then he can still be the one, but you have to ask yourself if this is something you’re willing to take for the rest of your life.
If you believe in charity and helping others, while he thinks it’s a waste of time, then you have to think about how important this is to you.
Though political affiliation alone isn’t a reason for a break-up, if being a liberal is very important to you and is a big part of who you are, then you may need to ask yourself if you want to spend the rest of your life who is opposed to so many of your ideas.

, This is the bottom line. If he’s the one, then he should love and appreciate the person who you are. He shouldn’t tell you he wishes you were skinnier, dressed more sexy, talked less, or stopped doing the things you care about. Though you can work on growing together and addressing your mutual flaws, he should like who you are at your core and should encourage you to be the person you want to be instead of trying to change you.


If he doesn’t really get you, criticizes you for having opinions or wanting things that are different from what he wants, then he’s just not the one.
If you find yourself trying to change just to please him, then he’s not the one.
If he doesn’t give you the basic respect you deserve, then he is not the one.

Notice if they show up on time.,
See if they keep their promises.,
Find out if they prioritize other friends over you.",How to Know if Your Friends Are Trustworthy1," If your friends seem to always find excuses for arriving very late, you may not be able to trust them when you need them to be there. People who you can trust will show up on time, either all or most of the time. They don’t leave you hanging.For example, let’s say you and your friends made plans to hang out over the weekend. You set a date, time, and location. They said they were free to come. You text them that you’re on your way to the place, and they don’t respond. You arrive, and they text you they’re running late, and then they show up more than an hour late.
Think about whether you can depend on them to be there when you need them for something important.;
, Some friends may promise to attend an event, or promise to work an important home project with you. They may have good intentions, but what happens when the time comes for them to show or to give support? They don't come through. Think about if you would be able to trust them if they do this,time and time again.Remember, too, to be forgiving. Sometimes people make honest mistakes, like double booking themselves, or the letting the time slip away, or emergencies. Instead of dropping them immediately, notice how frequently it happens and how important the events are. For instance, missing a coffee date is nothing compared to missing a wedding.
If your friends keep their word, they are likely trustworthy. You don’t have the question whether or not if they’ll stick to what they said.
But, if they get caught up in an exciting time and over-promise, then they may not be thinking through on what they’re saying.
For example, let’s say you and some of your friends make a pact to go to a concert together since you all found out that a band that you all love is playing in town soon. You get your ticket and then your friends don’t show or make other plans.

, Do you feel included or excluded when hanging out with some of your friends? Do they seem to put you in a different category than their other friends? See if your friends make you feel welcome when they’re hanging out with their other friends.


Do you make plans with a friend to hang out one-on-one, only to have them always invite others to join?
Do they cancel plans in order to hang out with other people? Do you feel as though you are often invited along to do something with your friends only as an afterthought?
Some friends will be closer to you than others. You’ll feel more trusting of people who are your closest friends, rather than friends you hang out with off and on.
Identify the difference between feeling welcomed by your friends, and feeling used by them. If they seem to only want you around for their own advantage or benefit, then they are likely less trustworthy.

"
"
Call them when you’re in need, and see if they respond.,
Evaluate if you feel judged or supported when you’re with them.,
Assess if you’re really comfortable being with them.",How to Know if Your Friends Are Trustworthy2," One of the key parts to a trustworthy friendship is knowing that you can call on your friend when you’re feeling down, upset, lost, or confused. They should try to make you feel better. Trustworthy friends know that it’s important to be present and caring.For example, let’s say you had a rough day at school or work, and you call or text your friend to chat or hang out. You explain that you’ve been having a tough day and the reasons why. They don’t respond until a day or two later, and it’s a generic response. Do you feel supported?

, A good friend won’t make you feel less-than or judge you harshly. Friends who are supportive and kind are likely people you’ll trust more with your emotions and your fears. Figure out if your friends seem make a lot of judgmental statements about you or other people. Do they seem to only focus on the negative aspects of other people’s appearance or behaviors?
Or do they do the opposite? Do they make positive and supportive statements? Do they encourage you to be happier and healthier in a loving way? This is a more trustworthy friend.

, When you’re with your friends, do you feel anxious or uncomfortable about what they’re doing or saying? Do you feel like you’re just “going along” with them, but don’t really enjoy their company?Notice if you feel comfortable enough with your friends to express a differing opinion. If your friends are trustworthy, they will respect your opinion and, while you may have a discussion about your conflicting opinions, it won't be a big deal. If you are afraid to express an opinion that is different than the rest of the group, this may suggest your friends are not very trustworthy.
Sometimes people make friends because they want to feel like they have a big social circle. But bigger doesn’t always mean better.
Evaluate whether you actually have similar interests and personalities with your friends. Trust yourself, and don’t feel like you have to be exactly like them.
For example, let’s say they only like to go to the mall and buy clothes, and you’d rather play music and start a small band. They don’t seem to understand why you play music, and don’t really like the music that you do. You may not feel very supported.

"
"
Evaluate if they have lied to you or others to get what they want.,
See if they can keep a secret.,
Assess if you feel comfortable sharing personal information with your friends.,
Determine if you can be 'real' with them.",How to Know if Your Friends Are Trustworthy3," Do your friends lie often to other friends, family, or teachers? Do they seem to manipulate others to get what they want on a regular basis? See if they really care about you, or if they’re focused only on themselves.The way your friends treat other people is a reflection on how they value others. If they are quick to judge other people and lie to get their own way, then they may end up doing the same to you.
Some people will ditch a friendship if they think something better is coming along.

, Have you told some friends a secret or some personal information? What happened after that? Did your other friends seem to know about it shortly thereafter?When you told a secret, did you ask your friends specifically, “Can you please keep this information confidential? I don’t want the information to get around.” If you didn’t word it carefully, consider your wording when asking for a secret to be kept.
But either way, think about how you would have handled the situation with the same information. Would you have kept the secret?
Consider only telling private information to those who are your best friends who you know that you already trust, or someone who’s not involved that you already trust.

, Ultimately, your friends are trustworthy if you feel that you trust them. If you feel comfortable with sharing personal information, and have no fears that they will use it against you or judge you, then that is what matters.


Do you feel like you can tell them about what's bothering you without feeling judged?
Do you feel comfortable with telling them about problems in your family or personal struggles you're facing?

, Do you feel like you're fake when you're around your friends? Do you feel yourself being honest, or just pretending to be happy? If you feel like you can't be your genuine self, you may not feel that your friends are trustworthy.


If they seem disingenuous about your interests, you may feel like you can open up to them about yourself.
Be true to yourself. Trust your instincts if you feel that you can’t trust your friends due to their past behaviors.

Negative emotions can manifest themselves in physical symptoms. You may feel physically tired or even notice aches and pains like a headache after being in this person's presence.

, You may not feel you have a lot of emotional support if you're in a negative friendship. Think about how you feel when you have a bad day. Do you feel inclined to reach out to this person, or do you feel like you're better off not bothering?In a negative friendship, everything may feel like it's about the other person. Your friend may constantly talk about their own problems and be dismissive of yours.
When you try to converse with the person, even casually, you may find it's difficult to get a word in. The person may not allow you to discuss yourself and your own issues as they constantly talk about themselves.

, Negative friendships are often very critical. Think about how your friend treats you. Do you frequently feel like your behavior and personality are being scrutinized?You may make attempts to grow and change. For example, you may try to apply for a new job or expand your social circle. Instead of being supportive, a toxic friend may put down your attempts to grow. For example, when you get a new job, your friend may say something like, ""Good luck, but I'm not sure you can handle that much responsibility.""
You may also just get general criticism. The friend may, for example, mock your personality, your sense of style, and other aspects of yourself. You may always feel ashamed and inferior around this person.

, A negative friend may frequently engage in poor behavior. It may get to the point you get nervous taking this friend out in public. You may cringe at the idea of your friend meeting other friends or family members.Everyone has embarrassing moments and good friends forgive one another for indiscretions. However, a toxic friend may habitually do and say things to embarrass you. Every public outing may come with the potential for poor behavior.
Do you feel like you have to hide this friend? You may, for example, not want to take this friend out to meet your parents or ignore her calls and texts when you hang out with others.

, A toxic friend has trouble with empathy. This person may be unable to relate or engage with other people's problems. They may be caught up in themselves and not seem to care what others are going through or experiencing.You may feel you can't get a word in with this person. You may try to vent about what you're experiencing, only to have them go on about their own issues.
For example, you may say something about being stressed at work. In response, your friend may say something like, ""That's nothing in comparison to my job"" and begin to talk about his or her work issues.

, If you've realized you want to ditch a friend, the first thing you should do is face this fact. Try to step out of denial and realize a friendship has run its course.Ask yourself difficult questions regarding why you're staying in the relationship. Do you feel sorry for this person? Do you feel obligated to continue the friendship simply because it's been going on for so long? Try to identify any reasons you're considering not ending things.
Accept the fact you have to do what's right for you. There's nothing wrong with ending a friendship if it becomes negative and draining.

, You may be tempted to simply let the friendship slip away. However, it's generally better to be direct. This can give you and your friend closure.You can plan a sit down talk if you want. However, you can also just send a text or email explaining how you feel. Try to be direct without blaming the other person. You can use what are known as ""I""-statements, in which you emphasize your feelings over objecting judgments.
For example, say something like, ""I feel a lack of connection between the two of us because we're two different people."" Let the person know you appreciated the time you had, but you need to move on. For example, ""I think it's better if we go our separate ways. I'll always value the time we had together as friends, and everything I learned from you.""

, It can be as difficult to lose a friend as breaking up with a romantic partner. Therefore, you should do some things to fill the void. Take your mind off the loss by filling your days with activities.Try to take up a new hobby. Start running or swimming. Begin a craft project. Read a book.

, If you had to ditch a friend, you want to make sure you don't get into a negative relationship again. All relationships have benefits. There may be a reason you're drawn to a certain type of person.What were the good things about the relationship? Maybe you liked someone pushing you out of your comfort zone. Maybe you enjoyed having a friend you competed with in some ways.
Maybe this person reminds of someone from your past. For example, maybe your relationship with your mother was rocky. While your friend does not treat you well, he or she may remind you of your mother. In the future, try to be more aware of why you're drawn to the people you're drawn to.

You might express yourself best through poetry or songwriting.
You can also try writing out a list of all the worries you have about this new move and what you can do about those worries.;
, You can write this letter to a friend, your parents, or to yourself. Write out your thoughts and feelings openly and honestly and then make a choice about sending or delivering the letter. You can keep these words just for you or share them, but either way sometimes having a direct person in mind when writing can help your words flow better.

, Finding out you are moving and leaving your friends can be very stressful and it can bog you down if you let it. Every day, take some time to take care of yourself. Take time away from your own negative thoughts and act positively instead.Go for a walk or exercise.
Take a hot bath and have an at home spa day.
Watch a movie or read a book you like.

, Though it may seem easiest to try to not think about the move or even perhaps to detach from your friends, allow yourself to fully experience true friendship with them in these last days or weeks that you have. Think back on how you met and all of the fun times that you have had since that day. Look back at old photos to remind you. Doing this will ensure that you don’t take this last time you have with them for granted.

, Just as you might be feeling tempted to pull away from your friends, they may be tempted to do the same to you. When you know that someone is about to leave your life in some way, many people react by trying to distance themselves from that person in order to self-preserve. If your friends do this, be understanding and patient with them and don’t lash out. Continue to reach out to them to try to spend your last days in that city with them.You could say something like “Hey, I know I’m leaving soon and I’m really upset about it because I’ll miss you so much. It would be easier for us, perhaps, if we just distanced ourselves from each other now, but I think that does a disservice to our friendship and to how close we are. Let’s try to spend time together before I leave, okay?”

, Moving can feel so sad and so stressful that we are unable to see the bright side or consider the potential opportunities that may exist. Consider, for instance, how lucky you are to have known these people that you are feeling so sad to leave. They must be very important and have made a significant impact upon your life. Rejoice in the fact that not only will you have them as friends but you will also have a whole new set once you move.


Write down all the potential positives of this move.
Write down everything you like about your friends.

, You may feel frustrated with your parents for this move or perhaps you are accustomed to moving every so often. Regardless of your feelings about the move, it is never an easy task to leave the friends that you love. Your parents have likely had to part from friends in the past because of a move, so ask them for advice. Talk to your parents about your worries and fears and they will be able to give you sound advice.You might say something like “Mom, I understand that we have to move away, and I’m dealing with that, but I do feel sad about it, especially because I’m leaving my friends.”

, Once you find out that you are moving, you may feel so shocked and upset that you don’t want to talk about it for awhile. However, your friends deserve to know so that they can begin dealing with this change now. Set aside some time to break the news about your move to them as soon as possible.


You might have them meet you at your house or tell them during lunch at school.
You can say something like “I’m pretty upset about this and feeling sad, but I wanted to let you know that my parents said we’re moving in a few weeks.”
They will likely be upset but allow them to respond without silencing them.

, Saying goodbye to your friends doesn’t have to be a completely sad and depressing ordeal. Don’t get so caught up in being sad that you forget to be happy and enjoy your time with them. Spend your last few days laughing, doing activities with your friends, and just having a great time in general.

, Think back on any traditions that you and your friends have created over the years. Though you will still be able to talk to them once you leave, many of these traditions, especially if they require that you be together in person, will be impossible. Do all of the things that you will miss doing with your friends and do them one last time before you go.For instance, if on the weekends you typically cruise around town or have a slumber party, do that!
Create new memories with them, as well. For instance, if you all have always wanted to go to the new theme park nearby, do that before you leave.

, Make sure that the place where you will have your final goodbye is the right place. If you are saying goodbye to some of your very good friends, you will likely want to have some privacy and be somewhere that is quiet. For other friends who you are not that close to, you may want to say goodbye to them at school.A park is a great place to say goodbye.
You can also choose to have your friend come over to your house. If you would prefer to go to their house, however, ask if you can do that instead.

, Another common mistake people make is rushing through a goodbye just to avoid feeling sadness. But you must remember that this moment would be unnatural without sadness. You will be moving away from your friends, and though this is not the end of the world, it is still a sad time. Don’t rush through that sadness but tell them how you feel and how much you will miss them.You might say something like “I wanted you to know how much this friendship has meant to me and how much I will miss you. My new school won’t be the same without you. I love you!”
Don’t be afraid to cry! Bring some tissues.

, It can be very sentimental to leave someone you love with a memento to remember you by when you part ways. Try to think of something very thoughtful to give your friend, something they can keep forever. Don’t fret over the cost; you can make a gift if you don’t have much cash or even give them something of your own.You might want to buy them a matching bracelet or necklace like yours so you can be bonded in that way.
Perhaps you have a book that they really like; consider giving them that and writing a note inside for them.

, Don’t leave your friends without them knowing how much they mean to you and how much you love them. More often than not, we regret more the things we didn’t say than the things that we did say. Don’t let any words go unsaid so that you can enter into this new move with a clear heart and mind. Your friend will appreciate hearing nice things from you.


You might say something like “I want you to know that you are one of the best people I’ve ever known. You’ve really taught me a lot about kindness and loyalty and I’m so proud every day to be your friend.”

, Remember that, though you are moving, we live in the age of technology. You can reach nearly any person at any time by phone which is an opportunity for you and your friends to stay connected even when you don’t live nearby. Call them or text them every so often so you can stay in contact.


FaceTime or Skype them. Another of the many blessings of technology is the ability to see someone and talk to them even if you can’t physically be with them. Utilize this technology to keep your friendship strong and still interact with your friends visually.
Make sure you have their phone numbers before you go!

, Though this may seem old fashioned, it is a great way to stay connected to them in a deeper way than a text will allow. Take some time to write your friend a letter about your new house and school and perhaps even send them a picture. Ask them questions about themselves, too to give them something to write about in their letter.Make sure you have their addresses.

, If it is okay with your parents and if you are not moving too far away from where you live now, see if your parents would be open to you driving to visit your friends every so often. You can even make a yearly tradition of this by planning at least one visit to each other annually. This will also give you something to look forward to.


See if your friends can meet you halfway.
See if your friends can come visit you.

, Before you leave, make sure that you are all connected on social media, whether that be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. This will allow you to stay updated about your friends' lives and for them to keep updated on yours as well. Many people use social media as a form of communication as well, so you can do that if you have a laptop/computer but not a phone.

, After a move, it can be very easy to lose touch with friends. Talk to your friends about creating a schedule or committing to speaking to each other at least once per week. You will likely become very busy as you are settling into your new life after the move, but you should not forget about your friends."

Do not engage in bullying.",How to Kick Someone out of a Group of Friends," You want to make sure everyone is on the same page. You should all get together to voice your opinions and decide what to do about the problem friend.Let everyone know you want to get together to talk about the friend in question. This will give everyone a heads up so they can plan what to say.
Pick the right time and place. Choose a time where no one has plans, so the conversation will not be limited by external deadlines. You should also choose a place where you all feel comfortable hanging out. If you all usually hang out in one friend's basement, for example, this may be a good place to talk.;
, Deciding to end a friendship is a big decision, so it is important to lay out your reasons for wanting to do so. As you and your friends talk, make sure that you are specific about the problems you are having with this person and why you do not want to continue a friendship with him or her.


For example, if the person often tells lies to you or about you, then that is something you should share.
Make sure that you provide examples of what happened, what you did, and how the friend responded.

, You want to make sure everyone feels heard. Ending a friendship is difficult, and some people may have reservations about doing so.Listen as much as you talk. If you feel strongly about something, you may be inclined to blurt out your feelings quickly. However, you need to allow others to participate.
If you find yourself saying things like, ""Let me talk before I forget what I wanted to say!"" you may be dominating the conversation. State your feelings clearly and directly, and then ask for other people's input. For example, ""So, that's how I feel about the situation. What do you guys think?"" If you are being interrupted, calmly say ""Please let me finish"".

, Keep in mind that some of your friends might disagree with you. While you might have had some negative experiences with this person, there is no guarantee that your other friends will feel the same way. Therefore, a compromise may be necessary to move forward.If one or more of your friends still want to be friends with this person, then do not try to stop them or force them to see things your way. Just express your desire to end your friendship with this person and allow your friends to make their own decision on the matter.
If your friends are all in agreement with you, then talk about what to do next. Do you want to end the friendship right now, or do you want to give the problem friend a chance to apologize?
Remember that you cannot control who is friends with who. You can only control your half of your friendship with someone else.

, Your friend may ask for another chance or offer to change. You and your friends should make plans on how to handle this kind of situation together.It can help for you all to consider the relationship. How much has this person hurt you? Does he or she have any redeeming qualities? If you all still care about this person, you may not want to permanently burn the bridge.
Think about your relationship as a group. What qualities do you look for when letting friends into the group? Does this person have these qualities? If not, you may decide you are not willing to give him or her another chance.

, You do not want to kick someone out who does not deserve it. Everyone can be difficult sometimes, and a friend who's causing problems may simply be going through something. However, some relationships are simply toxic and better off ended.How do you feel when you hang out with this friend? Do you and your friends always feel drained afterwards? Do you dread inviting this person to social events?
How does this friend treat you? Bad friends are very self centered. A bad friend routinely hurts other people's feelings without feeling remorse. They rarely acknowledge when your feelings are hurt, and want to win arguments more than they want to resolve a situation.
If your friend has been difficult for a long time, it may be time to end the relationship. While everyone slips up from time to time, if the behavior has been ongoing for awhile, the friendship may be better off ended.

, If you decided a direct conversation would be best, have one. Get together with the problem friend and explain to him or her why you're ending the relationship. Use ""I""-statements, which are statements designed to focus on personal feelings over objective judgements.""I""-statements can feel less judgmental as you're not placing an outside judgement on the situation. You're simply stating your feelings. You begin with, ""I feel..."" and then state your emotion. From there, you explain the action that led to that emotion. Lastly, you explain why you felt the way you did.
You may be inclined to say something like, ""We don't want to be friends with you because you gossip about us when we're not there. That's mean, and we don't like it.""
As this sounds hostile, rephrase the statement using an ""I""-statement. For example, ""I feel hurt when you talk about me and other friends behind our backs because I feel like you should confront me directly when you're upset.""

, If this friendship has not been going on for too long, gradually tapering off contact may be easier. You may not feel you owe this person a direct confrontation.You can be less direct with this approach. Simply don't invite this friend to group gatherings. If he or she asks you to hang out, say something like, ""Sorry. I'm really busy this week."" Do not engage too deeply with texts or online contact. Try to keep things surface level with somewhat generic responses like, ""Cool!"" or ""Okay.""
The acquaintanceship will eventually fizzle out. However, in the event the friend asks you what is going on, you may want to gently explain you simply do not want to be friends anymore.

, These can occur if you run into the friend again at school or a social event. If you're from a small school or community, this is very likely to occur. You and your friends should all know how to deal with awkward situations when they arise.You do not need to be scathing. You may feel inclined to get revenge, especially if the friend hurt you. It is a bad idea, however, to be rude or confrontational when seeing a former friend.
Just strive to be happy and in a good place. This is enough to get back on a bad friend. If you see him or her in public, be polite, but do not engage. Show the friend you are all doing better without him or her. Hopefully, your friend will learn how to treat people better.

, It's normal to miss someone you were once close to. You may experience feelings of regret or unhappiness after cutting out a friend. However, remind yourself of why you ended the relationship.Why did you and your friends decide you did not want to be around this person? While there were probably good times, the bad times likely outweighed the good.
Allow yourself to miss the friend, but work on being comfortable with your decision. You ended the friendship for a reason. Try to keep all the reasons in mind when you feel sad.

, You can't expect yourself to end a friendship and walk away without sadness. You and your remaining friends should allow yourselves to feel sad in the aftermath.You can try to take action to help yourselves process. You can all, for example, write goodbye letters to the friend. These should not be letters you intend to send. They are just a means to vent your feelings.
You may also want to plan a ritual. You and your friends can look through old pictures of the former friend together, for example, or watch movies and listen to songs that spark memories.

, This can help you forgive and move on. While difficult people are frustrating to deal with, oftentimes negative people have difficulties of their own. Try to see how and why your friend may have treated you poorly.Consider times you were mean to other people. Ask yourself why you behaved this way. Chances are, you probably were not feeling good about yourself when you lashed out.
Your friend may have issues with his or her own self esteem. It's not okay for anyone to treat you poorly. However, have some compassion. Understanding someone's actions better can help you take the mistreatment less personally.

, If you and your friends made a decision to kick someone out, this may be a sign your group is turning into a clique. While having a friends group can be great for social development, cliques should be avoided.Friends groups are brought together by common interests. You form friends groups with people you enjoy being around. However, with cliques, you do not usually have common interests with your friends. Instead, you come together as a means to gain control and power.
Does your group have a leader? If so, does this leader try to maintain control over the group? Do you feel like you have to follow the rules of the group without making your own decisions? If so, you may be part of a clique.

, If you feel like your group is a clique, kicking someone out can be a form of bullying. Bullying can have serious consequences for the target. If your group kicked someone out needlessly, take action to stop the bullying.Address bullying when you see it occurring in your group. Raise concerns about how you treat others. For example, ""It's not okay for us to all send mean texts to Marguerite. I don't want to participate.""
Reach out to people in your school who are kind and compassionate. Form friendships with those who take your side when you stand up to bullying. This can help you form a healthier, more inclusive friends group.

Analyse why your heart might be closed in the first place.,
Check your baggage at the door.,
Take a step back before you walk into wherever your date is.,
Don't judge.,
Offer some of yourself.,
Evaluate and move on.",How to Keep an Open Heart on a Date," Are you still reeling from previous pain and suffering or is your heart desperately stuck in the past hoping and pining that your past will somehow magically become your future. Without identifying how and why you heart is closed it will be impossible to truly re-open your heart on future date.;
, Not literally but when you leave the house to make your way to the date, which we all must do leave your past behind. Make yourself an affirmation you will not think about any past hurt and you will not compare this date to anything connected with your past. Treat this date as the fresh chance to meet a fresh person it actually is.

, Look at the world in it's entirety it is full of billions of individuals all unique, that means that each and every person in this world has good and bad in them and have their own unique contribution to the world. Remembering this bigger picture perspective will help you keep an open mind that the person on the other end of the table, is not a replica of the person who has previously hurt you and this person has a unique story and contribution to the world and you should treat them accordingly.

, This step requires the most mental discipline it is often second nature to come to conclusions about people very quickly based on their appearance, demeanour and the things they say. With these conclusions we decide rapidly if this person will fit into our lives or indeed if we want them in our lives. To really keep an open heart you need to not judge the person and their suitability to your world within the first five minutes. Remembering that this person is a valuable person and you can't possibly tell what impact this person could have on you in five minute or less will help you be more open. But at the end of the day the only thing that will stop this is your strength to combat years of accumulated behaviours of snapping to judgements

, Remember this date is not all about you and your needs there is another person at the end of the table. This doesn't mean monopolize the entire conversation about you, your life, your childhood etc but talk about something about yourself, your interests, your views on something. Being open to the other person about the type of person you are will help you keep an open mind and in turn an open heart.

, When the date comes to an end you should spend some time on thinking about how you thought and felt during the date, do you think you kept an open heart? did you give the person a chance? were you fair in the things you thought? It is healthy to evaluate yourself to give yourself a better chance at improving for next time. However you need to be careful to not overanalyze and dwell on things you did wrong, once you identify areas of improvement move on and vow to get them better next time.

They are quick to take to you, even if you are the most difficult person to tolerate, they only have a mission to destroy you.
They have the most wonderful compliments to give even when its obviously needless.
They will try to buy your heart with their sweet talks and are the first to ask what happened when you are in trouble, but would simply not offer a helpful solution.
They will present others as the enemy or pay too much attention in selecting your friends or telling you who to go out with, because they want you to be under their control.
They appear to be too close, wanting to know everything about you when they say little about themselves.
In public they quickly tell everybody how close you are and all the things you are to them, to make people trust them with you as well.
They will want you to bestow trust by hammering on it or creating reasons to force you to trust them;

Don't appear too random and maintain your dignity: Coming up to someone and saying, ""I want to break up with you"" won't cut it.,
You must act differently if something has triggered this: For example, maybe this girl has been using you, and yesterday, she partnered up with a bully and went against you.,
Don't talk to them in your classes or in the halls: If they ask for help, say you don't know, and they should get the message.,
When they asks why, state your reasons: If they've been doing this for a long time, it is okay to show your anger.,
Be prepared for them to argue: But go on stating your points.,
Keep yourself from feeling guilty: You did nothing wrong and you know it.,
Don't put restrictions on your other friends: Chances are, you and this 'friend' have mutual friends.,
The 'friend' will beg for second chances: Unfortunately, manipulative people don't change.",How to Imply to a Manipulative Friend That You Are Angry," If nothing special has happened and you simply want to break up with them because they've been using you for too long, you may state, ""I wanted to talk about something... you've been using me"", and state your viewpoints in a calm, rational way. Implying that you are angry instead of simply stating it when nothing has really triggered it, won't work.;
, You can now imply that you are angry. Gather your friends and tell them what happened.

, At lunch, sit at another table or continue giving them the silent treatment. Keep in mind that when they will eventually ask why, you must be prepared.

, Say something along the lines of, ""What you did to me wasn't right. You paired up with that mean guy/girl, and went against me. Yet you suppose we are friends.""

, ""You've been using me for a long time, but I didn't want to appear rude. You always copy off me even after I say you can't. You look off my paper, but when your friends come by, you run away from me like I was never there. I don't like it. If you were really a friend, you wouldn't have needed anyone to tell you all this is wrong.""

, Others who take pity sometimes simply don't understand unless it happened to them. The 'friend' themselves may appear very sad. Keep in mind that no matter what they say, it is only because they know you won't help them anymore. They aren't in your good books, and now they know it.

, Continue to hang out. If the 'friend' does keep following you and your friends when their friends aren't around, ignore them. Continue to give them the silent treatment. Your own friends may not approve of what you did, but that is because they don't understand. Most friends should surface out and talk to you in the end. If not, then they are conditional friends and not true friends.

, They will continue to use you as long as you let them. The best route to take is to try avoid them at all times.

Look at what your partner does, not what they say.,
Think about the kinds of ""dates"" you have.,
Beware of cheaters.,
Reflect on what your partner says they like about you.,
Look at the timeline.,
Be skeptical of what someone tells you before you have sex.",How to Know if You're Being Used for Sex," Do they call you at random times, and usually at the last minute to hook up?  A dead giveaway is the 2:00 in-the-morning text that reads something like this:  ""Hey baby, what are you doing?  Wanna meet up?""  What they really mean is: ""Get over here, take your clothes off, and then leave once I've had my way with you. Don't let the door hit you on the way out."" However, they will tell you anything they think you want to hear to get you into bed.


Don't be fooled into believing your partner wants anything more from you. Unless the two of you are meeting up often for non-sexual activities, any person who texts you at the end of the night is sending you a clear signal that you are only good for one thing.  They assume you are available at they convenience, and they think so little of you that they: A)  doesn't think you're special enough to take on a date and be seen with in public, and B)  think you have no life and will put all plans aside to be with him. Basically, they think you are easy and desperate. Prove them wrong.;
,  See if they initiate contact.  If they don't, you have your answer.  There is no need to read between the lines.

, If your partner tells you one thing, but their actions say another, always believe the actions. Actions are the most honest form of communication.  Be painfully honest with yourself: Does your partner treat you with respect and dignity? If you have to pause before answering this question, the answer is probably ""no.""  Hold your head high and walk away.

, If the two of you never leave the house together, chances are your partner only wants you for one thing.  A partner who is truly into you will want to take you out, show you off to their friends, and spend quality time with you outside of the bedroom as well.

, If your partner is committed to someone else while having an affair with you, this is a dangerous sign.  If they cheat with you, they will cheat on you. Statistics back up this theory.  Walk away now and maintain your dignity.

,  If their compliments revolve mainly around your physical attributes, then they are objectifying you.  It is normal for a person to be drawn to you for your looks, but they shouldn't value you only because they find you alluring.  Ask them what else they like about you, and if they struggle to find words or only use generic descriptors (e.g. ""smart and funny and kind,"" which could describe almost anyone), then it's unlikely your partner values your personality much. Spare them the headache and make a beeline for the door.


Keep in mind that some partners may struggle to quickly form words, especially ones who are autistic or have social anxiety. If your partner seems to genuinely respect you but acts flustered when asked questions like this, don't worry. (S)he probably cares deeply about you and simply can't think on the spot.

, If you have been hooking up for more than one month and you still aren't exclusive, your partner probably isn't interested in a romantic relationship.  Your partner may be using you until something better comes along.

, Place more weight on what they say afterwards. As they bask in post-coital bliss, they no longer have a strong motive to lie. Notice how your partner treats you during those critical moments.

If you are already friends with them or know them in some capacity, it may be easier to approach them with this information — and more risky. The more aware you are of your status with them currently, the better able you will be to develop an approach that will be successful.


If they are currently in a relationship, you should respect that relationship and not initiate any romantic contact.
If you are just acquaintances, you stand very little risk, but you also don’t know if they like you at all. You should assess their actions and move forward if you think you could have a chance or it feels important to you to express your feelings (though you should be good at handling rejection and not taking it personally before you take this risk blindly).
If you are just friends, you know them already, but you also run the risk of messing up your friendship. Think about if changing your friendship is worth it and if you could still be friends if they are not interested.;
, Your friends, particularly those who know the person you like, will be able to give you invaluable insight into whether or not you have a chance with them. Think about which friends will be honest with you — some of your friends may be too afraid to hurt your feelings and encourage you, even if they don't think you really have a chance with that person. If you have a friend with a history of being honest with you, even in difficult situations, ask their opinion of whether or not you should make a move on the person you like.


The next time you all are around the person you like, ask your friends to pay attention to the situation so they can give you feedback later.

, A group outing is a great way to assess their level of interest in a non-threatening way. Plan a trip to the bowling alley, movie theater, or mall and invite them as well as your mutual friends. This is a great way to interact with them in a safe setting and have your friends exist as buffers should you get nervous or should things get awkward. If they try to stay close to you throughout the night, more so than with others, you can determine that you do have a chance with them.


Group outings are also a great way to allow them to see you having fun which could result in them developing an interest in you.

, Often times, when people have a crush, they tell their friends and their friends give away clues. Notice if when you are around them, if their friends make little jokes or hint at a relationship between the two of you. If they encourage physical contact, like trying to make the two of you hold hands, this could also be a sign that your crush is crushing on you, as well., See if they have posted anything lately about having a crush or being interested in someone. Don’t search too far back into their history, however. Opt instead to just skim over what kinds of things they have been posting over the past few weeks. You never know, one of their statuses or tweets could be about you!


This may also help you figure out if there's someone else in the picture. If they post something like, ""Had and incredible day with someone really special!"" and you didn't see them all day, then you might consider that they have a crush on someone else.

, If your crush backs away from you when you get close, this could be a sign that they are not interested. If they remain in the same spot or move closer to you, however, then perhaps they do like you. When you are interested in someone, often times you want to maintain a closeness with that person.Think about if your crush goes one step further and initiates contact with you. Do they give you hight fives, hug, or tickle you? This may indicate they have feelings for you, too.

, One of the true markers of whether someone is interested is if they make an effort to be around you. If you do not know the person, this information may be less relevant, but if you are already friends or if you are in a class together, this can easily be assessed.If they try to spend alone time with you, this could be a sign that they like you.
If they try to be your partner on a group project or sit with you at lunch, this could also be a sign that they are interested.
Also consider how much and often they text or call you and if they regularly like or comment on your social media posts.
If you are acquaintances, notice if they say hello or make an effort to chat with you when you cross paths.

, One surefire way to know if someone is interested is to assess the kinds and quality of interactions the two of you have. Typically, when someone likes you, they will try to learn more about you, often through asking questions. They also tend to notice you more closely than the average person or friend would. Think back on any times that your crush remembered something about you or something you told them in the past. If you can think of such times, then it is likely that they like you.Consider the kinds of questions they ask you. The deeper the questions, the more likely it is that they are interested.

, Beyond them trying to get closer to you, consider other ways that people show interest via body language. Often times, when someone makes eye contact with you when you are speaking or when they are speaking to you, this can be an indicator of attraction. Eye contact is a way that people show interest in the conversation and, by extension, how they express interest in others.Notice as well how they interact with others. If you see them being touchy feely with everyone else, but not with you, then perhaps they are not interested. At the same time, treating you differently from everyone else could indicate they feel nervous around you. Because body language can be confusing, try to look at other factors, as well.
Notice if they face you in a crowd, gravitate towards you, or sit near you when possible.

, Their reaction to your touch says a lot. You might try touching them on the arm during conversation, such as when they make you laugh, or even resting your head on their shoulder if you are friends. These are great ways to test how comfortable they are around you. If they don't like you, they will likely tense up, and this can serve as your sign to stop touching them in that moment. However, if they feel comfortable with you, they will act normal or even better, eventually start touching you back! If they start touching you back, this is one of the biggest signs that they may develop feelings for you.Try touching their shoulder randomly for a second or two while they’re speaking or elbowing them gently and casually in the arm when they make a funny joke.
The safest way to touch them is to mirror the ways they touch you. If they do things like nudge you in the shoulder or hug you when they see you, then you can do those things with them as well, without them first initiating.

, Flirtation and expressing affection for someone is about much more than just words. Your body can also express your feelings. Use your body language to make gestures that indicate that you like them.Lean into them slightly when they talk.
Look softly at them in their eyes when they speak.
Smile brightly at them when you see them or when they say something cute.
Laugh at their jokes.
Put your hand on their shoulder briefly when you laugh at them or touch their knee briefly when you sit side by side and are speaking to them.
You can also hug them when you see them and when you are about to leave.

, This is a great way to let someone know you like them without actually having to tell them. Most people enjoy receiving compliments and your crush is likely no exception. If they look particularly attractive one day, let them know. If they do well on a school project or an assignment at work, let them know that you admire their intelligence and work ethic.If this is a little too bold for you, you might simply say, ""It's been really fun talking to you,"" as you part ways.


Don’t overdo the compliments, however. Too much of a good thing can sometimes be a bad thing. Stick to once or twice weekly for a while.

, Being a good listener is often a very attractive quality, and it shows that you are interested in their lives, interests, and opinions. When your crush is talking, ask questions and make eye contact so they know you are listening. Try to remember key parts of the conversation so you can bring it up again later.

For instance, if your crush was talking about a band that they like, you might go home and listen to them. The next time you see your crush, you can say, ""Hey, I checked out that band you were talking about!""
Or if your crush says they are nervous about a big test coming up, you can follow up later by asking them how it went.

, Whether your crush likes you or not, you should always maintain respect for them. People respond positively to being respected and treated well and your crush is no different. Whether you begin dating this person or if they ask you to maintain your distance, never speak badly of them and always respect their boundaries.In addition to only speaking kindly of them, respect their wishes. If they ask you to tone it down on the flirting, you should do so. Give them the space that they need.

, If you have determined that you have a chance with your crush, whether that chance is slight or large, you should go for it. Set aside some time to talk to them in person and tell them how you feel. Do it in a quiet space like a park so that noise does not distract them. Face to face interaction is best, but if you cannot do so, you can also write them a letter or call them on the phone. Good luck!


Remember that if they are not interested in dating you, it's not a reflection on you. It simply means this isn't the person for you. You deserve to be with someone who is excited to date you, so try not to waste any more time on this person.

, Before you make a decision to pursue this person fully, you should think critically and carefully about why you like them and why you want develop a relationship with them. Sometimes, we find ourselves developing false attractions to others just because they are popular or because someone else likes them. Take a few moments to think about the things that you like or that intrigue you about this person and determine if a relationship with them is worth exploring.For instance, if you want to date them just because they are attractive, this may not be a good enough reason to pursue a relationship.
However, if your heart skips a beat when you see them or if it makes you jealous to see them date other people, your feelings may be worth exploring.

, After taking some time to think about the person you like and why you like them, consider writing out your thoughts on paper or in your diary. Many people benefit from processing their thoughts via writing and this can often help elicit thoughts and feelings that you may not have been aware of.


Write out a pros and cons list of pursuing a relationship with this person.

, Often times, we can be so caught up in the emotions of liking someone that we forget to consider logic. Though having a crush can be an exciting time, it can also be a time when people make foolish decisions. Certainly follow your heart, but make sure your head is involved in the process.Consider the values this person has and if they align with your own values. For instance, if you are very religious but this person is not, that could be a problem in the future. Don’t ignore this.
If you don't know the person very well, you may not know much yet about their values. You can, however, look for any glaring red flags. For instance, you may have heard that this person is always getting hauled into the principal's office for bad behavior, or has even been in trouble with the law. As cute and mysterious as this person might seem, this is a red flag that you probably shouldn't date them.

, Though your friends can be a great source of help and support, sometimes you can’t beat the advice of mom and dad. They have likely experienced many more crushes in their lives than your friends have and might have very good advice on how to proceed and whether or not you should proceed at all.


You might say something like “Hey Mom, I was wondering have you ever had a crush on someone but didn’t know if you have a chance with them? I’d like some advice.”

, Perhaps you are a person who keeps to themselves and is very quiet. You may find it difficult or stressful to make friends or interact with new people. Instead of thinking of yourself as being nervous, consider yourself as being excited. Often times, the feelings these emotions elicit are very similar but it is up to us to control our minds so that we can be the masters of our own destiny. Stay calm, take deep breaths, and approach the situation with confidence and excitement.


Make a list of your strengths to help boost your confidence.
Try writing out what you would like to say to your crush. Practice your conversation in the mirror, and visualize the conversation going really well.

Pay attention to how often you say “yes” to requests.,
Make a list of how often you take on other people’s work for them.,
Reflect on how often you apologize.,
Identify how often you put other people’s needs ahead of your needs.",How to Know if You're Too Nice for Your Own Good1," It is fine to be willing to help out your friends, family, and coworkers when you can, but problems may arise if you are always saying ""yes"" and never saying ""no.""Think about how many times you have said yes when people ask you to do something for them. Do you ever say no?


If you say yes most of the time, then you may be too compliant and people may even be taking advantage of your willingness to help all of the time. This can be harmful to you since saying yes constantly can cut down on your free time and make it difficult to take care of the things that you need to.
Try to practice saying no when you do not want to do something. You can simply say, ""No."" Or, you can say something like, ""No, I can't do that."";
, If a friend or coworker is overwhelmed, do you tend to offer to do things for them, or let them struggle through on their own? It is fine to offer your assistance now and then, but if you are regularly picking up the slack for someone, then they might be taking advantage of your kindness.For example, if you have a friend who often puts off doing his homework, and you often end up completing it for him, then you are being too accommodating.
The next time someone tries to get you to finish his or her work, try saying something like, “I am happy to help you out now and then, but I feel like I have been doing this more than I have the time or energy to. Have you talked to your parents/teacher/boss about the challenges you are facing with completing your work?”

, People who are too nice are often people pleasers, and this can cause them to apologize profusely for their actions. It is normal to apologize when you are genuinely at fault for something. However, if you apologize constantly for minor offenses, or even just out of habit, then you may be too worried about other people’s reactions.Before you apologize to someone, consider whether it is really necessary. Were you really at fault? Or are you just worried about how the other person might react?
For example, if you are late for meeting a friend, then it is appropriate to say, “I’m sorry I was late.” However, you do not need to apologize 20 times for being a little late.

, It is fine to think about other people and try to be kind to tem. However, if you are always placing the needs of other people before you own, then you may be being too nice.For example, if a friend asks for your help moving into her new apartment, and you already have plans to go out of town with your boyfriend for the weekend, then you should not cancel your plans to accommodate your friend.

Identify your motivation for doing what people want you to do.If you often cave to people’s requests of you, then it might helpful to examine your motivations.,
Make a list of what frightens or worries you.,
Identify ways that you judge yourself harshly.,
Note any feelings of resentment.",How to Know if You're Too Nice for Your Own Good2," Do you give in because you feel like other people’s needs are more important than your needs? Or do you give in because you feel that you do not deserve to enjoy yourself? Do you give in out of guilt?


Either way, you may be disregarding your own needs and desires out of a sense that they are not as important as other people’s needs and desires.
Try using a mantra to help you assert your own needs and desires. For example, you might simply tell yourself something like, ""I matter, I have needs, and my time is important. It is okay to put myself first.""

, You might better understand your behavior if you consider your fears and worries about saying no to people. Feeling frightened or worried that people will not like you or that they might reject you for not doing what they ask of you is a negative thought pattern that can drive you to do things that are uncomfortable for you.The next time you are considering helping someone with a request, ask yourself if you are doing out of a genuine desire to help or out of fear or worry. If you are doing something out of fear or worry, then this may be a good time to take a step back and tell the person no.
For example, if a friend asks you to go to a party with her and you do not want to go, but you are afraid that she might reject you if you don’t do it, then you would be acting out of fear of rejection if you agree to go.

, Judging yourself harshly can also cause you to be overly accommodating to other people.Think about how often you are critical of yourself and how that may be affecting your behavior.


For example, do you tend to think you are less intelligent than other people or less important? If so, then you may be giving in to other people’s requests out of a sense of inferiority.
Try to identify these thoughts and challenge them as they occur. For example, you could reframe a thought like, “I am not very capable” to something like, “I have accomplished many things and I can do whatever I set my mind to do.”

, Even if you are giving in to other people and doing nice things for them all of the time, you may not always have positive feelings towards them.You might feel resent towards people for taking up your time and energy. However, you might not be expressing these feelings and they may be building up in the form of resentments, or pent up anger towards other people.


Try to express these feelings to help you see when you have been too accommodating to someone. For example, you might say something like, “I wish I had not given up my evening plans to watch my sister’s children. I really needed that time to relax and I feel angry at her for asking me to give that up.”
The next time someone asks you to do something that you don’t really want to do, consider whether it might lead to resentment. If the answer is yes, then you might want to say no.

Note a tendency to avoid situations.,
Ask yourself if people appreciate and reciprocate your efforts.,
Pay attention to your energy levels.,
Ask yourself if your stress is under control.,
Determine if you are nice to yourself.,
Remind yourself that it is okay to say no.",How to Know if You're Too Nice for Your Own Good3," If the thought of having to say no to someone or of being in a situation where you say yes out of guilt causes you to avoid some people and situations, then you might be too nice for your own good.


For example, if you avoid going to an event at your child’s school because you know the teacher will ask you to help with something you don’t have time for, then your niceness is interfering with your life. It is important to learn how to be assertive and say “no” in these situations so that you can do the things you want to do.

, Just because you are being nice to someone does not mean that he or she will return the favor. However, if people in your life have shown that they really appreciate your efforts and make a point of paying you back when they can, then this might be evidence of an equally kind relationship.To determine if you are giving without receiving, look at how often people thank you or pay you back for all of the nice things you do for them.
If a person does not thank you or pay you back in equal ways, then he or she may be taking advantage of your kindness. You may need to learn how to be more assertive with this person and say no to the next request.

, Low energy can indicate that you are doing too much, which is a common problem with people who are too nice. You might be saying yes to every request you get and doing more than you have the time or energy to do.If you often feel tired and drained of energy, think about what your schedule is like. Are you often running around and doing things for other people? If so, then it might be time to cut back on these favors and give yourself some rest.
Try saying something like, “I can’t continue to help you in this way. It is wearing me out and affecting other areas of my life.”

, Being accommodating to other people all of the time can take a toll on your stress levels as well.If you often feel stressed out because of the things that you do for other people, then you might be going above and beyond in a bad way.


Try using some relaxation techniques to get your stress under control, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga.
Doing things you enjoy can also help to get your stress back under control, such as exercising, making time for a favorite hobby, or listening to music.

, You might be incredibly kind to other people, but not so nice to yourself.You might berate yourself, discount your needs, and wear yourself down physically. Try to start being nicer to yourself, such as by doing things like:



Setting healthy boundaries.
Making sure you get enough sleep.
Preparing healthy meals for yourself.
Giving yourself enough time to groom yourself.
Dressing yourself in clothes that fit you well and make you feel good.
Saying nice things to yourself rather than beating yourself up for mistakes.

, A big part of being too nice to other people is never saying “no” when they ask you to do things for them. Doing this shows that you place more importance on other people’s needs than your own needs. To change this pattern, try to get into the habit of putting yourself first and saying “no” more often.The next time someone asks you to do something that you do not want to do or don’t have time to do, try saying something like, “No. I can’t help you with that.” Or you can say, “No. I don’t have time to do that.”
Keep it simple when you say ""no"" and don't make excuses for why you are saying ""no."" You have the right to tell people ""no"" and you don't have to explain yourself.
To feel comfortable saying “no” to people, you may also need to work on being more assertive. You can learn these skills with some time and effort.

Think about what you want in your friends.,
Look approachable.,
Use open, inviting body language.,
Invite friends over to your house.,
Maintain your current relationships and friendships.,
Stop fearing rejection.,
Be yourself, not who you think other people want you to be.",How to Improve Your Social Life1," Improving your social life is as much about knowing what you want as finding people who want to be with you. Take some time to think about the kinds of people you like to hang out with. What do they do? How do they act? What are their ""perfect Friday night"" plans? Think about old friends you've had and why you enjoy their company. Think about:


Hobbies (what would you do together?)
Demeanor (serious and academic vs. humorous goof-balls, or a mix of both)
Interests (similar tastes in books, movies, music, sports, etc.)
Conversation habits (sit, relax and talk vs. do a lot of activities)
Energy levels (raging at a bar vs. chilling at a quiet cafe);
, Keep a smile on your face, stay well groomed, and wear decent, clean clothes. It's not about being shallow, but about giving a good impression of yourself. This makes people feel comfortable coming up to you to spend time.


Make sure you are as clean as possible. Teeth properly brushed and flossed, good deodorant, good perfume, hair clean, deeply clean and moisturized skin and clean clothes.Keep up with a nice style that is still ""you"". You do not have to ""dress up"" to be more sociable, you just need to take care of yourself.

, This signals to people that you are willing to talk and want to be social. People will naturally flock to someone who exudes positive, social energy, and your body language is one of the easiest natural ways to do so. To have open body language:


Keep your arms to the side and your shoulders back, opening up your chest.
Make eye contact with whoever is talking.
Smile frequently.
Turn your shoulders to face people as they speak.
Keep you chin up, parallel to the floor.
Stand and sit tall; avoid looking hunched over., This is a great, low-key way to practice your social skills in a location that you feel comfortable. You can control the number of people, the activities, and the amount of time you are hanging out. If you are especially shy or have trouble initiating conversations in a group, practicing at home is a great way to improve your sociability.


Have a dinner party or invite a person to eat with you at lunch.
Host a sport or TV watch party, allowing you to tune into the TV if there is a lull in the conversation.

, Most relationships only get better with time and age, but they take some work to maintain. This helps you realize what is important to you in a friendship and the types of conversations you enjoy having. These skills will transfer over to your new friendships as well, and your old friends are often the ones who introduce you to new friendships.


Talk to your friends once a week or month.
Keep making plans with old friends.

, Don't worry if you don't immediately gel with someone. This isn't your fault, it just means that you and your friends were not compatible. Making friends and being sociable is not about ""winning"" or racking up the largest amount of friends. It's about finding the one or two people you feel comfortable with.


Focus on the quality of interactions, not the quantity. You don't want a bunch of half friends and acquaintances -- you want a few great friends to build a social group around., Lots of people are ""normal,"" and no one wants the same friend over and over. Be weird, be quirky, be interesting-- be yourself. You'll attract similar friends, and these are the connections that you will cherish. Trying to change yourself will only lead to awkwardness and missed connections, because you will never keep up the act.


Being more sociable is about being friendly, not cool."
"
Start small by making friends with current acquaintances.,
Ask your current friends to bring their friends to events.,
Go places that you feel comfortable.,
Check out local meet-ups for people with similar hobbies.,
Join a recreational league or team to meet other people.,
Go volunteering.,
Make time in your week for meeting people.",How to Improve Your Social Life2," There is no reason to run out and go clubbing if you feel your social life is stagnating. Take small steps to build your network of friends, starting by making the most of your current acquaintances. Have a conversation with a co-worker or fellow classmate who you don't normally interact with, reach out to your neighbors, and spend time with someone you don't normally see. You'll be surprised how friendly people will be if you make the effort to talk about something other than work or school.Take advantage of nearby events, like company get-togethers or after-school events, where there is a natural social connection.
Accept invitations, even if you feel a little out of place at first. By showing you are receptive to social settings you open yourself up to future groups of friends.Things may be awkward at first, but know that this is natural until you know each other a little better.

, The best way to meet new people is to use the people you already know. If you're going out, encourage your friends to invite a ""plus one."" Because you already know your friend, you have a natural introduction that can help get over awkward first meetings. Moreover, your mutual friends likely have common interests and hobbies, meaning you are more likely to connect with someone who is a friend of a friend.Go to your friend's events or parties, especially if you won't know everyone there.
Introduce your own friends to get the ball rolling -- bringing an extroverted or interesting friend along signals that you want to meet new people.

, You don't have to go to a super fancy restaurant if it's not your style. This can lead to shyness and a difficulty fitting in with nearby people. You must go places where you feel good, as it will be easier to find similar people to be friends.


Love outdoor adventure? Head to your local rock wall and ask for a belay partner to make an instant connection.
Love music and concerts? Read your local newspaper for live music venues and check out a concert.
Love art and culture? Go to small art galleries or shows in your area and ask the artists about their work, or other people's opinions on the show.

, Ask around town about craft classes, book clubs, and discussion groups that fit your interests. Many newspapers and online town blogs have exhaustive schedules of common meeting places, and new websites like Yelp and Meet-up are social media sites that aggregate meetings by interest or hobby., Contact your local Parks & Rec department and ask about adult and children sports leagues. Most departments have teams made up of similar people looking to make friends, so don't worry about joining without a team of strangers -- you won't be the only one.There are also a variety of single sports, like tennis and bowling leagues, that fit any person's hobbies.

, Volunteering is a great, low-key way to meet people from all walks of life. You have a natural conversation topic in the work you're doing, and you can keep coming back to the same sites to know people better. There is no commitment, and you can show up as often as you'd like.Check out the SPCA, Red Cross, and American Cancer Society in your area, as most counties have at least one of these offices with volunteer opportunities.

, At the end of the day, friends are only going to find you if you take the time to look. Make an effort once a week to go out and meet people wherever you feel comfortable. This could be the local bar, a school football game, or the break room at work. You need to put yourself out there and see what happens -- you'll be surprised how quickly you start making new friends after you commit to making them.Bring along a close friend along to help you feel comfortable, but make sure you don't spend all your time talking to them.

Give the occasional compliment.",How to Improve Your Social Life3," It is amazing how many people ignore this simple greeting. If you are shy, however, this is a great, low-pressure way to show that you are interested in making friends and being kind. If you make eye contact, simply say hello to someone. There is no pressure to lead to something bigger, but it opens the door for a more sociable relationship.


If they say hello back, introduce yourself! Say your name and ask their name as well.

, This shows that you are interested in them and are sincere about becoming friends. Remembering someone's name is a small but crucial step to creating a lasting friendship.This small step may seem obvious, but remembering and saying someone's name shows you care and makes them feel valued -- a key part of improving your social life., When you are first meeting someone there is a wide variety of things you still have to learn about them. Instead of being daunted, look at this as an opportunity. There is a ton of topics you can cover, and there are very few wrong topics. While you might steer away from hot button issues like religion, politics, or sex, there is still a lot to talk about:


""What do you do for a living?""
""Did you grow up here?"" If the answer is no, ask where they grew up.
Comment on the location -- have you both been here before? Were you introduced by a common friend?
""What do you like doing outside of work?"", It is impossible to relax when you are telling yourself to relax. Instead, focus on the other person in the conversation. Listen to them and be curious about their life. Ask questions and get to know them. You don't need to share your life story with someone right off the bat to make conversation, you just need to be able to thoughtfully listen.


Follow up questions are key. If you ask ""What do you do for work,"" you can follow up with ""do you enjoy what you do?"" This keeps the conversation rolling fluidly forward.
Being an active listener takes the pressure off of you to keep talking, which makes it easier to hold a conversation., When someone asks you a question, don't dismiss it and move on to another question. Take some time to elaborate on it. Give your opinion, tell a short, related story, or give some reasoning or background behind your answer. Aim to talk for 1-2 minutes before asking them a question or switching the subject.This allows the conversation to flow naturally. The more you talk, the greater the chance you'll inspire another question or a new topic to discuss, as long as you still take the time to listen to their answers., Flirting, whether with potential dates or friends, is simply a way to show your interest in someone. It feels good to hear a genuine compliment, and it creates a bond that can move beyond acquaintances and into friendship. The compliment does not have to be huge -- a simple ""I love that scarf,"" or ""that's a really good point"" is a nice, light way to be a friend.


Make sure you compliments are genuine, as people will be turned off if you seem like a ""suck-up,"" or brown-noser.

Trust your instincts.",How to Improve a Relationship with Random Acts of Intimacy," If the well has been turned off for a while, you're going to have to start slow, but still fast enough to make it clear to your partner that you're trying. 


If things are only just starting to slow down, you can just make a concerted effort to speed it back up on your own.
If the relationship has been stunted for months or years, you can even let him/her know that you are aware that you've let things get a little bland or boring and you're going to start making an effort to makes things better, but you need time to get back into the groove, and need them to be patient and supportive. 
If things are teetering on the edge of destruction, this might give your relationship the life support and hope it needs, in the short term, while you get comfortable building it back up in the long term.;
, When the relationship was young, love and intimacy happened without a thought, and in fact you probably had to consciously stop yourself at times just to get other things done.  Yes it would be great if it stayed that way forever, but the fact that it doesn't isn't a sign that you love each other less, it's just you returning to a normal state of being. 


In the early stages your body released chemicals to put you into a hyper-sexy state of being as a way to get those babies coming as quickly as possible.  It's those same chemicals that make you think the annoying things your partner does are cute, and helps you to see past that extra twenty pounds they might have around their gut, or ignore their crazy relatives. 
Unfortunately your brain can't keep those chemicals going indefinitely, and in fact stops them in an effort to motivate you to move on to someone else to spread the genetic makeup of the species as wide as possible, and also to allow you to return to a more productive way of life (hunting and gathering).

, Not necessarily having sex, but kissing, touching, looking, fantasizing, etc. 


These days, the idea of intimacy probably crosses your mind somewhere between giving the dog a bath, and getting the rustproofing re-done on your car. It's easy to forget to feed the relationship on a regular basis. But it, like our bodies, needs nutrition in order to survive. Start making a conscious effort to remember to take time for your partner/spouse at least once a day. 
This doesn't have to be a big mind-blowing sexual encounter, but it needs to be something intimate enough that you wouldn't want to do it with anyone else. This tells you're partner that they are special and an integral part of your life.

, Try to do something for your partner at least once a day to gently remind them of your presence.


Leave them a nice note of encouragement, or make a meal that is especially for them in the evening. Even small gifts can be a way of acknowledging their presence in your life.

, In any relationship, each person has different levels of desire, different intimacy requirements, and different ideas of what intimacy is.


As a committed member of your relationship, it is your job to find out what that is for your partner. Inevitably most of the problems in any relationship are caused by not communicating these differences in perspective. 

, One partner may be able to live with slightly less or a lot less and still feel perfectly connected, while the other may need more attention. 


For the person who desires more frequency, they typically find themselves always being the one to initiate, and they might end up feeling like their partner is never interested, or worse yet, disinterested when requests are met with rejection. In turn those feelings may present themselves as resentment, loneliness or low self-esteem.
The low desire spouse, perceives challenges also; the constant pressure to perform is an additional stress to everyday life that makes it that much more difficult to get in the mood.
Neither spouse is to blame, but both need to step into the other's shoes and extend a little understanding so that the stage can be set for building the relationship back up with understanding and compromise.

, If your partner comes to you with an intimate advance, saying no might not be the best automatic response. 


If your partner is the high desire spouse, chances are they've been waiting for you to come to them, holding off their own advance for as long as possible to avoid the possibility of rejection.
If your partner is the low desire spouse and they come to you with an advance, do everything you can to drop what you're doing and accept this as the gift it is. 
Show appreciation and joy for the moment, however fleeting so that they can see the happiness it brings you without any other baggage.
Whichever side you're on in the relationship, when you're partner comes to you for an intimate moment, they are at their most vulnerable.  They are exposing their most fragile side to you and in that moment you must treat it appropriately, and see it for the precious gift that it is.

, That may be as simple as deciding to stop what you're doing for a moment or two to participate, or suggesting a less time or alternative for that particular moment. 


If the first step can not be attained apologize for not being able to take part in that moment. Suggest an alternative time when you will be able to take the time to be with your partner in a more sincere way.

, If you have to say no to an advance to your partner and have suggested a different time, place and activity, you absolutely must follow through with the promise. 


It could be that your partner will be busy and have to put it off themselves, it may even be blatantly obvious that will happen but you need to make the offer anyway. 
Chances are they have been waiting patiently since you re-scheduled and if you miss the moment, or forget (or seem to have forgotten), it will be a significant setback to your progress, and a reminder of less affectionate days gone by.

, We'd all like to believe that we just know what our partner is thinking when they are thinking it. The fact is, even the most connected of couples have no idea what's going on in their partners head at any given time.  


Even if you were able to get perfectly in tune with each other in that regard, next week something could change. Maybe they saw something in a movie, or read in a book, or overheard someone talking about a topic on the bus, and suddenly they have a whole new set of desires they'd like to explore.
Chances are if you were to list off the ten things your partner found to be the most intimate signs of affection, then gave it to them to read, you'd probably miss the mark on eight out of the ten. 
The way around this problem is to make a list of what you see as signs of affection, love and lust ... and then give it to your partner. Ask them to do the same.

,  Don't fill your list with fairy tale situations because that's what you think is expected of you based on societal expectations, but don't actually do much for you at all, fill it with things that you truly want your partner to do for you or to you on a regular basis.


Accept the list from your partner without judgement or feelings of past inadequacies.  If your partner has been as open and honest as possible, they are baring their soul to you in a very fragile state, met them with acceptance. 
If you find things that don't appeal to you or you don't understand, take a moment to go over the lists with each other and talk out the ones that don't suit you perfectly and see if there is a middle ground that can be reached that will be appealing to both of you.
It's also very easy to look at the list as being a message from your partner telling you all the ways that you aren't living up to your spousal duties and all the ways that you fall short in their eyes.  That would be a very damaging perspective. 
The list is simply that, a grocery list of everything they find sexy, affectionate, fun, or whatever.  It should even contain things that you already do and don't need to be reminded of.  It's not something to be taken personally as in ""why haven't you been doing this all along"" —it's something to take the guessing out of the relationship.

, If you are using the list method it should contain everything you can think of that makes you feel good, makes you feel loved, turns you on, or excites you. 


It can be things that your partner can do to you or for you, or it can be things that you want your partner to let you do to them or for them. 
It can be small generic physical things like a kiss every morning/evening/exit/etc., or situational things like taking care of the kids so you can have a peaceful bath.
It can also be detailed and explicit things that you might expect to see on an adult website. 

, Now that you've made the list, you've gone over each other's items together and understand each item to the best of your ability, what do you do with it? 


Hang on to it, read it over often, add to your own as often as possible and update your partner's copy, then perform at least one item from the list daily. 
The longer the list is the better the effect, so try to aim for at least 30 to 50 items to start and add to it over time.  This list is intended to last you a lifetime, so the longer it is the better, and it should grow and change as the two of you do.

, Make sure to keep the list somewhere it can be easily accessed, but probably not somewhere that the kids or the neighbors will see it. 

, You may think that it will take more than this to save your relationship but no matter how far apart you've grown, as long as there isn't an insurmountable roadblock in your way (abuse, affairs, sexual dysfunction, or health issues).


The fact is even the largest most impenetrable buildings are all built one small brick at a time, the best relationships are realized with small, but frequent moments of affection and intimacy.

, At first, it's going to seem a little robotic, possibly awkward and even a little forced; this is normal, especially if your relationship is in especially bad shape, but the key at the beginning is to get the pace going. 


You'll both recognize when things are being done straight from the list and that's fine.  Avoid feelings that you should be trying to be more creative. 
At first you want to be observing the effect each item has on your partner and the overall improvement in their mood, day to day. 
You'll be surprised how quickly things improve in the relationship as long as you keep it up and don't get lazy or fall back into old bad habits.

, Once things have been going well, and you've been following the list for a few weeks or even months, you can start to get creative. 


By now you will know which things create which responses and you'll be able to add your own twists or combinations to start bringing some mystery and unexpected excitement into each moment. 
Keep referring back to the list as always acceptable expressions of intimacy.

, Schedule a date night.  It could be the same night every week, or change it up.


It should be understood that at the end of that night (or sometime during!) you will be having sex. 
This may seem contrived and unromantic, but it carves out a designated time in your hectic life when you know you'll be crossing paths and connecting, and you'll be surprised how much you start to look forward to it during the week and throughout the day. 
It may seem unromantic in concept, but in practice it will be exciting and fun for you both.

, Go out, stay in, make it a quickie, make it long and romantic, do it in the morning, do it at lunch, do it in the middle of the night. The possibilities are endless, just make sure you do it. 


If you're out of town and separate from each other, call up and have some phone sex, send naughty pictures or dirty texts, then the minute you get back together, make up for the missed night.

, Just because you now have a date night too, doesn't mean that you only have sex on that night.  In addition to doing things from your list daily, if any of those things motivate you to go further and have sex, go for it. 


The date night is just a guarantee that you will be connecting at least one night a week.  If the feeling moves you in between though, take advantage of it, especially if you are the low desire partner, your high desire partner will love the surprise.

Set a budget.,
Discuss what you hope to achieve.,
Choose the right destination.,
Pack for the unexpected.,
Make vacations a regular occurrence.",How to Improve Your Relationship During Your Vacation1," Before you begin booking a flight or packing your bags, you should figure out how much you can realistically spend on your vacation. Part of setting a budget should include input from your partner to see how much you can both afford to invest in your trip.Take your partner's budget into account. Just because you can afford to spend an extra couple hundred dollars, it doesn't mean your partner can or is willing to.
A tight budget doesn't necessarily mean you can't do fun, romantic things. You may just have to cut back in other areas.
If you plan a spa day one afternoon, cut back on costs the next day by going to the beach or taking a hike together. You can also cut back on food expenses by bringing a picnic on your outings.;
, It may seem strange to think of your vacation as having a ""goal,"" but this can help you in the planning process. For example, if you want to relax and unwind, you might enjoy a beach vacation. If you're looking for something more adventurous, a trip to the mountains may be better.


Consider your partner's desired vacation activities, as well as your own. This may shape where you are realistically able to go.
Talk to your partner about finding a place that meets both of your needs. Ideally, you should choose a destination that is special or important (or could become special) to the both of you., Once you've decided to take a vacation, you'll need to figure out where you want to go. This should be done together as a couple or as a family. Be sure to find a destination that meets everyone's needs and interests as much as possible.


Whether it's a romantic retreat with your partner or a fun family vacation, ask the other person or people you'll be going with for input on where they'd like to go.If you're vacationing with your partner, choose a romantic, relaxing getaway. For example, many couples vacation in tropical cities and other places close to the beach.
If your relationship is still relatively young, try to focus on starting with shorter trips that only last a weekend or so. Aim to stay relatively close to your hometown, too, so you don't feel trapped with one another far from the comforts of home.
If you have kids, you'll need to go someplace where they have activities for children. For example, you may want to visit a theme park that has children's rides or attractions.
Try to find a balance between what your kids want to do and what you want to do. For example, if your kids want to visit a theme park, spend one day there and the next day doing something relaxing, like swimming or lounging at the beach.

, Nothing can ruin a vacation quicker than an unexpected obstacle. While you can't prepare for every possibility, you can pack for a few unexpected (but still realistic) possible situations.Anticipate rain and sun, plus any other weather anomalies you might encounter at your destination.
Bring supplies to prevent and treat sunburn, allergies, minor injuries, and a cold or flu.
If you wear prescription glasses, bring an extra pair in case you lose or break yours. You should also bring sufficient quantities of any prescription medications you take.

, Going on a vacation is a great way to bond with your partner or your family. However, vacations shouldn't just happen every 10 years. It's important to plan vacations at least once a year so that you and your partner or family can form fond memories and have time together to bond.


Vacations don't need to be expensive. All that matters is that your trip is fun, relaxing, and memorable."

Dedicate your time to one another.,
Try something new together.,
Pamper yourselves.,
Do something romantic each day.,
Make time for intimacy.,
Express affection.,
Work on what you both need.",How to Improve Your Relationship During Your Vacation2," With all of the technology available today, it can be difficult to unplug from the digital world. However, if you're serious about improving your relationship on a romantic vacation, you'll need to do just that.Agree to turn off your cell phones and laptops for the majority of the day. You might compromise on some online time in the morning or evening, but try to focus on spending time together.
If something comes up from home or work and you need to take a phone call or respond to an email, let your partner know the situation and ask their permission first. This lets your partner know that you're trying to take their feelings into consideration.

, Engaging in new activities as a couple can help strengthen relationships. That's because the excitement of doing something new together allows you to feel like you did when you first started dating.Try an exciting activity like hiking, parasailing, or taking a dance class together.
Any activity that increases your heart rate and releases adrenaline will help you feel the excitement you felt when your relationship was new.
In addition to new activities, you can start a new ongoing hobby for future vacations. For example, you might start collecting souvenir snow globes everywhere you visit together., Many couples like to do relaxing, pampering activities that they wouldn't normally engage in at home. This is nothing to feel guilty about.In fact, pampering activities can actually foster a greater sense of intimacy in some couples.Take a spa day together or get a couple's massage.
Engaging in relaxing, pampering activities will help you both relax. This relaxed energy between you can strengthen your bond and improve your relationship.

, One way to build intimacy on your vacation is to do something romantic with your partner every day. This may be a grandiose gesture, like going out to a world-class restaurant, or it may be as simple as holding hands while walking along the beach to watch the sunset.


Ask your partner for input on what they'd like to do. You can surprise your partner with a few romantic gestures, but you should also let your partner have a say in what you do together.You can insert romance into your daily routine with little gestures like holding hands while you walk or snuggling during downtime.

, Physical intimacy is an important component in most relationships. You and your partner may have difficulties coordinating your schedules at home, but on vacation you should make time to express your love in physical ways.Try experimenting with your partner. Having sex in new ways can help improve your satisfaction with your love life.Set a romantic mood by lighting candles and bringing massage oils. You can buy electronic candles to reduce the risk of a fire in your hotel room.
See this as an opportunity to be more adventurous in your physical intimacy. For example, you might ask your partner what their fantasies are and act them out together.

, As relationships go on, many couples lose the sense of affection they once had for each other. However, these displays of affection are important for most healthy adult relationships, and vacation time is the perfect opportunity to bring these rituals back into your daily lives.Expressions of love can be verbal or nonverbal, and there are many ways to show your partner that you care.


Say kind, affectionate things to your partner on a regular basis. Tell your partner you love them every day, and make it a habit to compliment your partner (for example, by saying, ""You look really beautiful."").
You can also express affection with acts of kindness.Even little gestures, like making or bringing coffee for your partner in the morning, can help improve your relationship.Bring some romantic souvenir from your past. For example, you could bring a bottle of the wine you drank on your first date (if you're old enough to legally drink), or you could bring commemorative wine glasses from your wedding.Expressing your affection for one another, both verbally and through gestures, is particularly important if your relationship has been struggling., Part of planning your vacation together should include a conversation about what you think your relationship could benefit the most from. Then you can focus your efforts on improving that facet of your relationship. For example, you might focus on making time to talk and listen to one another, increasing your physical intimacy, or focusing on mutual hobbies and interests.


Ask your partner for input on what they think would most benefit your relationship.
Plan out your itinerary accordingly, making sure that both of you feel like you're collaborating on the most important aspects of your relationship.

Consider making your trip phone-free.,
Create memories.,
Set boundaries on work time.,
Give yourselves down time.",How to Improve Your Relationship During Your Vacation3," It's very easy for children and adults alike to get distracted by and absorbed in a smartphone. However, your vacation time together will ultimately be more memorable and enjoyable if you limit or prohibit phone use, at least while you're out sightseeing.Have your kids keep their cell phones turned off during the day when you're doing things together. You may have to negotiate with them, like letting them have some phone time after dinner.
Keep your phone(s) silenced. Your kids will be upset if you make them turn their phones off and they see you texting or checking your email.
Check your phone periodically, just to make sure everything is okay at home. If you don't have a message from your housesitter, babysitter, or petsitter, don't respond to any missed calls or texts until the evening.

, All vacations create memories, but you can improve the chances of making lasting memories by doing out of the ordinary activities. These don't have to be lavish or thrilling. Simply changing up your routine could be enough for some families.Do something exciting that you can't do at home. Engaging in some activity unique to your vacation will help you build and cement fond memories of your trip together.
Having positive memories of unique experiences together will help your family bond. Months later, you'll still be able to reminisce about your trip together.
Recalling your vacation together weeks or months after the vacation can help you build stronger, lasting memories and improve your family's satisfaction with one another., If your work can wait while you're on vacation, it's best to leave it for when you return home. If you must catch up on some work, though, that's fine - you'll just need to set boundaries for how much you work and when.If work is unavoidable, try to schedule it for the evening when your kids are watching TV or sleeping.
Limit how much work you're willing to do each day. If at all possible, don't let work cut into your time together as a family.

, If you're busy rushing between theme parks or beach destinations, you may feel rushed and exhausted at the end of the day. It's always a good idea to make the most of your vacation time, but you also need some time to relax and recharge. That includes taking breaks during the day and getting enough restful sleep each night.Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Teenagers need more sleep, averaging around 8 to 10 hours each night.Young children (under three years old) need anywhere from 10 to 17 hours of sleep each night, while school-aged children (under 13 years old) need between 9 and 13 hours of sleep each night.

You may learn about random facts or specialize on topics that you’re passionate about like sports.


A random fact can be something like the king of hearts is the only king without a mustache in a deck of cards.;
, Whether you gain experience for your career, gain culinary experience, a hobby or just life experience, personal growth is always admirable amongst friends. Updating your friends on what you’ve been up to or simply showing them pictures or examples is a great way to impress them.


For example, you could show off a new recipe you’ve learned or tell your parents about a promotion you’ve just received.

, The world is so large that simply traveling to somewhere new always insights interest. Talk about future travel plans or past adventures. Show off souvenirs and share profound life experiences with friends.


Travelling can be quite costly so make sure to budget before leaving for a trip. Take the time to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.

, Changing your body can impress your friends especially if it is a drastic change. Set a goal to lose weight and get healthy. Talk to a healthcare and fitness professional to find out the best course of action on how to achieve your goals. Find exercise routines and diets that suit your schedule and lifestyle.


Don’t overdo it. Set realistic goals. There’s no point in jeopardizing your health just to impress your friends. You should be trying to get in shape for yourself.

, Languages can be very challenging to learn. Find a tutor, visit a language center, download audio books, listen to podcasts, or download language apps to help you. Set a goal to learn a language and then plan a trip to the country as your reward.

, Not everyone is musical. Persevering through lessons and being able to play music will impress your friends. Watch tutorials at home and begin with a used instrument before investing in anything professional .

, Find something that you are passionate about and share it with your friends. Joy can be very infectious. Your friends don’t have to participate but they will be very impressed with how much you have learned and the new skills that you have picked up so fast.


Hobbies can include sewing, painting, running, etc

, Let your friends know your goals and give yourself timelines. You can update them on your progress to your goal. The more challenging your goal, the more impressed your friends will be. However, don’t set a goal simply to impress your friends. A goal will be more rewarding if it is something personal for you.


You can set goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, going back to college, or restoring a car with your son.

Don't be rude or offensive if you don’t agree with your friends.,
Travel as much as your budget and schedule allows.,
Become a certified expert.,
Avoid talking about something to death.,
Avoid trying too hard.",How to Impress Your Friends2," Everyone has their own specific interests. Find a topic that both you and your friends are interested in and have a conversation. A broad topic like music is a great way to impart your knowledge and learn from shared musical tastes.


For example, find artists and songs that can bring you and your friends together. Discuss certain sounds and genres you enjoy and see if there is anything you guys have in common. Often times you can even discuss about pop artists and their impact on culture., You‘re trying to use a shared interest to come together not go against each other. Learn from each other. For example, you can introduce each other to new sounds that you haven’t heard of yet. Be supportive and they will appreciate the effort you'll make.

, Your friends may not have the ability to travel as much as you do. They will be impressed by the fact that you’ve gained knowledge from all over the globe. You can also just travel outside of your state. Expanding your horizon allows you to bring a new experience to new things.


For example, you can attend concerts in Spain and compare it to your experience at home. Also, just the small experience of going to another airport or visiting a similar restaurant in another state can be impressive to friends unable to travel., Whether you enter a career or make something a full time hobby, becoming the de facto expert amongst your friends can be impressive. For example, if you are a music DJ you will learn new and up-and-coming sounds to stay on top of your craft. Your new knowledge allows you to speak from a place of authority.


Keep informed of what’s new and what sounds great together. Give your friends the inside scoop of what the next great song will be.If you continue to gain knowledge in your chosen area of expertise, you may find opportunities to travel and become famous sharing your knowledge. This will further impress your friends as your reputation grows. You may even namedrop famous friends you meet in the industry. For example, if you are a music DJ, you may dj festivals, workshops, or concerts and meet famous artists or media moguls.It’s okay if you’re friends aren’t familiar with the names you mention. They will be impressed that you have become a cog in the music industry. Don’t limit yourself to just meeting industry types. You may run into an actor or athlete at a concert. Introduce yourself and get a picture with them. It’s okay to be a fan.

, You may need a wealth of knowledge to impress some friends. Telling the same stories or repeating the same facts may become obnoxious or annoying.


For example, if you’re talking about music, a song or artist may dominate the headlines for a period of time. There is no point in saying something that has been repeated incessantly. Stay ahead of the trends and don’t make the same observations that the rest of the world is making. For example, if a singer makes a lyp-syncing gaff at an award show it will be in the headlines for the next month. Talk about it the day after and leave it alone., It will be obvious to your friends if you are trying too hard to impress them. They may view it as obnoxious. Just have fun and enjoy your friendship. Have normal conversations and act as the situation dictates.


For example, if you want to impress your friends with your dancing, just dance and don’t try to intentionally make a fool of yourself to get a cheap laugh. Having fun allows your friends to let go of their inhibitions and join you in the dance floor. There should be no judgement on the dancefloor. Being a wallflower is never cool. Impress your friends with how much you love music and how confident you are in letting yourself be free."

You may also ask skeptics to hold their fists together and challenge you. Repeat the same procedure to move their fists apart with a single finger to prove them wrong.

, Get a large volunteer to sit in a chair. Get four volunteers to put their hands together, interlocking their fingers, keeping their index fingers together but pointed outwards in the shape of a gun. Have two volunteers put their pointed fingers under his arms and the other two volunteers under his knees. On the count of three get them to lift him. Your friend will appear to levitate despite his size or the strength of the four people.For added effect, ask the four people to try to lift him one by one or to try to lift him together and see how high they can lift him. Compare this first height to the levitation height after you teach them the proper technique. He will significantly be raised higher while they exert less effort.

, Ask two people to lift you by your elbows. At first keep your arms loose from your shoulders down. The volunteers will find it extremely difficult to budge you. Next, keep your elbows pressed tightly to your side and your arms rigid against your body. They will find that lifting you is much easier with your elbows in and arms rigid.You can ask more people to try to lift you with your arms loose to prove how difficult it is to lift you up. Your friends will be impressed with how easy it is to lift you once your have your elbows in and arms rigid.

, Stand facing a wall and push against it. Keep your arms and back straight. Flex your legs and ask volunteers to try to push you against the wall copying your stance. One by one, add another person to the back of the line to try to push you against the wall. No matter how many people push against you in that line, you won’t topple over.


The more people you add to the chain, the more impressive your feat will be. You may also get a child to push the wall and repeat the display.

Think back over the origins of your relationship.,
Observe the following matters to know whether the relationship is exploitative in financial aspects:


He or she has not paid even a single time throughout the dating period.,
Note whether he or she introduced you too soon to his or her family and friends.,
Consider how often you feel guilty around your partner.,
Consider whether both of you talk about big things before they happen.,
Check your own confidence levels.,
Note your own blinkered vision towards this person.,
Consider the extent of sacrifices you've made for this relationship.,
Watch for deliberate withdrawal of affection or intimacy.,
Beware the constant mood swings.",How to Identify when You Are in an Exploitative Relationship," If you found that your partner was insistent from the outset on physical intimacy (sex) and didn't hide this urgent need but insisted on pressuring you, this is a sign of the potential for exploitation. If you gave in to this insistence or willingly surrendered to your date, even though in the back of your mind you did not want to do so, this likely established a pattern of demanding that you concede and having you do so. You followed your partner's lead because you thought it was fine to do so.;
, Even if he or she did, you had to persuade him or her and ask him or her to do so. When he or she did, it would be during ""major events"" such as Valentine's Day, your birthday or his or her birthday. Maybe there is a series of ""break-ups"" prior to such events, with make-ups after the event has taken place, making gift giving easy to avoid.
Your partner asks you to invest for him or her with Your Money.
Your partner asks you to purchase everything for him or her, from food, for his or her cats/dogs/pets to his or her desktop Mac and laptop, clothing, costly sunglasses in an expensive brand and gifts for his or her family during Christmas.
You agree to almost all of your partner's requests to go for a mini-vacation with him or her and end up paying for them all. Make sure that you get all the rewards where you both stayed - that's the best you can do for yourself so you can apply the points towards your next break away from him or her––for good!
Your partner asks you to pay for his or her monthly car payment or other expenses he or she has.
He or she asks for your credit/debit card and also your PIN number so he or she can use it towards anything possible in your absence.
The relationship starts to evolve more with what he or she wants and how much he wants you to spend on him or her than us. You just cannot catch a break from not paying anything or everything for him or her.

, When a person introduces you too soon to his or her friends and family, this can be an alert for you. It may be because his or her biological clock is ticking and he or she is being exceptionally desperate or obsessive. If your partner introduces you so suddenly within a week or a month when you have not yet been given the chance to know more of who your partner is, etc., this is a red flag. It's an attempt to get you to think he or she is serious with you. No matter how hot the sex is between the two of you and how insanely handsome or beautiful he or she is, do not be clouded by this particular action. If you're considering it in retrospect, put this action in with the others to determine whether or not you're being used.

, If your partner constantly makes you feel guilty if you do not comply or ""obey"" to his or her wants and needs, this is a sign of absolute manipulation. For example, your partner acts as if he or she knows it all and should things did not work-out, he or she will say, “I told you so. You should listen to me more often."" Inducing guilt is a classic sign of manipulating a person to get preferred behavior and actions that benefits the manipulator.

, For example, if your partner makes a major purchase, such as an automotive purchase or a home, to give you an impression that you both are exclusive and that the purchase is for both of you, but failed to discuss this with you, watch out. Even if he or she used his or her own credit to attain it, the lack of any thorough discussion between the two of you is a warning sign that your wishes don't count and that he or she is seeking to boss you about. A balanced relationship requires two people to sit down and discuss the big things with each other.

, Sooner or later, when you realize that your partner's exploits diminish your personality and individuality, you'll also discover that you are no longer the happy and cheerful self which you were before. As much as you look forward to seeing him or her and spending time together, you may begin to dread it more and more. You become a person who you are not, possibly cagey, anxious and jumpy, and you may begin to become withdrawn from the outside world. Another possibility is that you neglect your other loved ones, such as your family, especially your children and work colleagues, because he or she becomes your priority. Remember that your family and friends deserve to share you in their lives. When you've lost all self-respect for who you are in the hope of keeping this manipulator happy, it's time to realize that you deserve to start feeling that you are worth it, and that what has happened to you owes much to having been exploited.

, Because of your blinded love for him or her, everything this person does and says can risk becoming endearing to you, and you no longer perceive the faults. You neglect to take notice of his or her mental, emotional and perhaps even physical abuse.


For example, if your partner has managed to brainwash you to believe everything he or she says, causing you to push aside your priorities such as your family, friends and work, then your personal life suffers a great deal. When he or she keeps chiding and criticizing every move you make because it is not according to what he or she desires you to be, see this as a red flag.
Note how often your partner shows loving care towards you. If he or she rarely compliments how you look but will carelessly say something along the lines of, ""I would like to date someone else - how do you feel about that?"", it's clear he or she isn't caring about you.
Does he or she listen to you? When you confide in him or her about your problem such as a tough day/week at work, he or she refuses to listen to what you have to say, or even he or she does, manages to turn the focus back on himself or herself, on how hard his or her life has been.
Is there abuse involved? If, when you decide not to give in to your partner with what he or she wants, he or she will start yelling at you and calling you names. In some cases, this may escalate to physically abusing you. Do not let physical abuse occur. Once you have established the emotional and mental abuse, immediately seek the help needed to get out of the abusive relationship before you get hurt. You do not deserve the harm.


, Because of your belief in this person and hope that the relationship might work, especially your ""never ending love"" for him or her, it is probable that you will do whatever it takes to make ""sacrifices"" for the relationship. In doing so, it is easy to become irrational and end up using all your funds from your retirement funds to your savings and everything else in between that he or she can convince you hand over. Worst of all is when you borrow money from your friends and family to support his or her ""idealism of a perfect relationship"". Seek immediate professional help in the case of financial losses before it gets too late. Do not commit anything illegal which will jeopardize you entirely; such relationship is never worth it!

, Until a manipulative partner gets what he or she wants (whatever that will be), he or she may seek to take power over you. This can include limiting the sexual intimacy which a normal relationship requires. A manipulative partner controls that aspect of the relationship to ensure that he or she gets what he or she wants.

, Men and women have mood swings from time to time but this is infrequent and shouldn't be a constant occurrence. In the case of manipulative behavior, he or she is likely to change moods daily.


Watch for change of plans. Say that you spend three days in a week with him or her. However, when you both made plans (usually he or she will make the plans), he or she will change it at the last moment. For example, he or she plans on going camping for the weekend and when the weekend comes along, your partner said he or she would rather you both go to the movies.
Notice his or her feelings for you. One day he or she will express undying love for you and wants to be married (even though he or she repeatedly scoffs at commitment) but the next day, he or she wants to date other people. This is all said to hurt you.
Notice the angelic behavior in public. In the presence of his or her family and friends, this person will be extremely charming and very loving towards you. Away from others, he or she will not show any affection at all and will repeatedly reinforce that you both are just friends.
Watch for jealousy. It is a common factor in any relationship but is also a good sign of exploitative behavior.


These mood changes will be more apparent and escalated throughout the relationship when he or she does not get his or her own way - whatever it is that your partner wants at the time in his or her agenda.

Define attachment.,
Learn the different types of attachment.,
Assess your level of security in yourself and your relationships.,
Check for clingy behaviors.,
Decide if you shy away from intimacy.",How to Identify Your Attachment Style1," Attachment is the ability of one being to form emotional bonds with another. When attachment is in its healthiest state, you can build stable and enjoyable relationships with friends and family. However, if for some reason you have developed an insecure attachment as a result of traumatic experiences, then attachment issues may develop and make it difficult to form and keep stable relationships.

Your ability to develop a healthy attachment style is not based on a one-time learned experience. Your attachment style is developed and molded repeatedly from many experiences and events that you are exposed to early on in your life. For example, how the caregiver responds and nurtures you as a child, any trauma you may have witnessed, and maybe a predisposed biological, cognitive, or psychological condition may impact your ability to develop healthy attachment styles.;
, There are different types of attachment an individual may have. Understanding the different types will help you understand yourself better, and if there are issues that may need to be addressed with the assistance of a professional. The different types of attachment include:


Secure attachment. The ability to have a stable and healthy relationship. The capacity to see others in a relationship with little to no distortions. The person with a healthy and secure attachment style is able to value the relationships he is in, and able to verbally and behaviorally express their affections. They can freely love and receive love from others.

Dismissive attachment. This person may appear to be standoffish, and gets uncomfortable when others attempt to show affection or a deeper connection in the relationship. A person with this type of attachment style can seem to be dismissive of the emotional and physical needs of the other person(s) in the relationship. This individual will also have difficulty voicing his needs and desires to others as well. Other personality traits that may be associated with dismissive attachment are passive-aggressive and sarcastic behaviors. They may have a fear of being dependent on the other person because they perceive this as weak.

Preoccupied attachment. Someone with this type of attachment style is overly preoccupied with relationships and attachment. These people will typically relive and tell their stories over and over again of their past poor relationship experiences. They may constantly review their internal dialogue and reexperience all of their past pain and rejections signifying a lack of resolution. Other personality traits that may be associated with this attachment style are, controlling behavior and difficulty to conforming to rules, argumentative, and impatient. Some people may be manipulative and plan out actions to get what they want out of the relationship. They also can exhibit a strong sense of creativity and charming qualities.

Disorganized attachment. These individuals will often exhibit disorganized thoughts and relationship patterns. People with disorganized attachment style may have other underlying diagnosis, such as, Borderline Personality Disorder. These people may have had a traumatizing childhood of abuse, neglect, or frequent experiences of loss. Caregivers, during their childhood may have been emotionally unavailable, unresponsive, or inconsistent. They learned not to fully trust others, and develop insecurities with getting close to another person because they see themselves as unlovable and not good enough for healthy support. Other behavioral characteristics that may be expressed with those who have disorganized attachment are, antisocial behaviors, lack of empathy and remorse, selfish and controlling, and a disregard for rules. These individuals are at a higher risk of substance abuse or dependence, abusing others, and criminal behavior.

, People with secure attachment styles have high self-esteem and are comfortable receiving and giving love. They don’t look towards others to find value with themselves and feel comfortable with intimacy, but aren’t co-dependent. They also stay calm in arguments and are mentally flexible.


People with secure attachments often had stable and loving upbringings. They had their needs met and lived in a nurturing environment., Ask yourself if you are clingy in relationships and constantly worry about what others think of you. If you look to others to complete you, want your partner to rescue you, and are in fear of rejection and abandonment, you likely have an anxious attachment type. People with this attachment style crave intimacy and become obsessed with the details of their relationship. They worry that the slightest changes in a relationship mean that it is going to end.


Those with anxious attachment styles grew up unsure of what kind of treatment they would receive from their parents. Sometimes they were met with love and care, while other times they would experience insensitivity and abandonment. As a result, they are constantly seeking the approval of others., Those with avoidant attachment styles try to detach themselves from relationships. They are often emotionally distant and tend to withdraw from others. They are able to turn off their feelings and become non-reactive, even during an argument.


People with avoidant attachment styles are often raised by parents who are insensitive to their children’s needs. They themselves are emotionally withdrawn and typically discourage their children from crying or showing emotion. They want their children to become independent as soon as possible and have little reaction when their child is upset or in need of nurturing."
"
Take a look at your self-esteem.,
Ask yourself how you respond in arguments.,
Think about your romantic relationships.,
Ask people close to you for their opinions.",How to Identify Your Attachment Style2," It’s no secret that the way parents treat their children affects their self-esteem for the rest of their lives. How you feel about yourself is a good indicator of what attachment style you have. Be honest when evaluating yourself and you’ll get the most reliable answer.


Are you happy with yourself or do you have feelings of self-hatred? Do you value yourself or do you think you are worthless? You likely have a healthy attachment style if you have high self-esteem. Those with low self-esteem typically have unhealthy attachment styles., How you engage in an argument says a lot about your attachment style. It reveals how you handle conflict and probably reflects the way you saw your parents behave in arguments, as well.


Do you stay calm in arguments or do you walk away and try to avoid the situation all together? Do you scream, lash out, name call, and vow to “get even” during a fight? The answer to these questions can reveal your attachment style., Your behavior in a romantic relationship is perhaps the biggest clue when determining your attachment style. The way in which you respond to your partner and how attached you become to them says a lot. Being honest with yourself in this department may be difficult, but it is imperative when trying to determine your style.


Ask yourself if you are open to love and intimacy or if you shy away when someone wants to get close. Are you constantly worried your partner will leave you and do you become clingy early on in the relationship? Perhaps you enjoy being in a relationship and are completely secure in them. Whatever your answer is says a lot about your attachment style., It can be difficult to access your own personality because you are so close to the situation. However, if you ask your partner or your family or friends to give their opinion on how you behave in certain situations, you may get a better idea than trying to determine it on your own."
"
Ask about your first two years of life.,
Determine how your parents behaved towards you.,
Seek out professional help.,
Find out how you behaved as a baby.",How to Identify Your Attachment Style3," Attachment styles are often formed from infancy to two years of age. The type of attachment style you developed is based on how you were taken care of as a baby. Ask those around you about your primary caregiver during this time. Those answers can clue you in on your attachment style.


Ask people who were around you during this time how the caregiver responded to your needs and if they were consistent in doing so. The type of interaction you received during those first two years paved the way for your attachment style., Think back to how your parents treated you. Ask yourself if they were always around, nurturing you and providing for you, or if they were withdrawn or unreliable. The way they interacted with you likely had a huge role in your attachment style.


For instance, if your parent made you feel safe and secure, you likely have an attachment style that is healthy. If they made you feel unsafe or were inconsistent in their giving, you may have an attachment style that errs towards the unhealthy side., Depending on what attachment style you have, and the level of severity of your emotional and relational experiences, it may be best to seek individual profession help from a therapist. If you are an adult who has never addressed any past issues with prior relationships (even those as a young child), you may benefit from effective therapeutic treatment.

Treatment will allow you to fully explore your childhood and life experiences as related to any losses you may have had, or exposure to trauma from abuse or neglect. Therapy may help you gain closure of past experiences, and develop healthy coping skills so you can improve your attachment style to one that is more secure.

, You can likely determine your attachment style by inquiring about your behavior as a baby. Ask someone who was old enough to remember how you responded when you were away from your parent. Their response can give you an idea of what attachment type you are.


For example, ask if you cried a lot when your parent left and how your behavior was when they came back. Did you stop crying when they returned, or did you push them away? Did you even notice when they left and came back? Their answers can shed some light on your style."
"
Watch for verbal abuse.,
Observe how the individual views jealousy.,
Take note of controlling behaviors.,
See if they pressure you for commitment.,
Take an inventory of their expectations.,
Watch the way they treat their parents.,
Check for any signs of cruelty and abuse towards children and animals.,
See who they blame for problems and emotions.,
Attune to any and all signs of anger.,
Watch how they control their temper.,
See if they use or attempt to use any form of force during an argument.,
Note well if they strike and destroy objects.,
Observe their sensitivity to setbacks.,
Consider the abuser's childhood.,
Be open to information from past boyfriends or girlfriends, close friends, colleagues, and other acquaintances.",How to Identify a Spousal Batterer," If the individual consistently communicates in ways that tend to degrade you, make fun of you, or belittle your accomplishments, proceed with caution.


If your potential partner continually curses or often expresses words of anger, take this as a red flag and proceed into the relationship with utmost caution. Whether they mean it or not, their words and treatment of you reflect their disrespect and lack of consideration of other people's feelings.;
, The individual may question you about who you were talking to or who you see throughout the day. They may get jealous of the time you spent with others or they may check on you excessively or ask a friend to watch you. At the worst extreme, they may even forbid you from being with certain individuals or talking to them.


Be careful if this person accuses you of flirting with others for a very shallow reason or has no basis at all for such accusations. This is an indication that your potential partner lacks good judgement and needs to back off.

, At an early stage, such behaviors may seem to just be concern about your safety and your decision-making ability. It is best not become too comfortable with this kind of attitude, though. Controlling behaviors may later get worse and, after you get married, your partner may assume all control of the household and your life.

, Potential abusers may appear to be madly in love with you and pressure you early in a relationship to get married or live together without getting a chance to know each other better.


Do not let them make you feel guilty for wanting to slow down or end your relationship. Invoking the sentiment of guilt is used primarily to distort your judgment and strengthen their manipulative abilities. Give yourself a chance to get to know them better before you jump in.

, Abusers often have impossible expectations and presume that you are there primarily to meet their needs. Later on, they often come to expect that you take care of literally everything in the realm of domestic and emotional needs. If they cannot understand your limitations and won't accept you for who you are, then you might want to think twice about whether you really want to settle.

, Women should watch the way men treat their mothers and men should watch how women treat their fathers. If they are not kind towards their parents, they probably aren't keepers. If they talk back or are rude to their own parents, it won't be impossible that they can do worse to their partners.

, You will know people more deeply if you look closely at how they treat their inferiors. If they are mean to them or constantly bully them, how do you think they will treat you and your children in the future?

, Most abusers would never accept their faults and shortcomings. They are always the victim.


A major sign that a person can be an abuser is them not assuming responsibility for their own emotions and behavior and making themselves appear to be the one who has been aggravated or wronged.

, In particular, notice whether they can admit their behavior or they deny it. Abusers are often incapable of solving problems through a good conversation and may not even be willing to admit to actions born of their anger, no matter how obvious.

, A sudden ""emotional outburst"" for a very small reason is a sign of a personality disorder, from which everyone should flee.

, Holding you down, tightening their hands into fists, restraining you from leaving, pushing, and even a snarl or growl are positive indications.

, Think of slowing down the pace of your relationship if it is apparent that it is too easy for them to break things of sentimental value, or anything on sight, punching the wall or the mirror, kicking the chair. There is some possibility that they can do this to their partner later on.

, An abuser may take almost everything personally and will overreact even to slightest criticism. Do not tolerate a partner who easily gets upset or insulted and considers feedback as a personal attack. These people are impatient, defensive, and incapable of forgiving others.

, Most people who were raised in an abusive household have a greater chance of exhibiting abusive behavior towards their family-to-be. You may discreetly ask the people who have watched them grow up about their childhood experiences.

, The answers to such questions as: ""How were they as a boyfriend or girlfriend?"" or ""Did they show any signs of abusive attitude with you?"" are very telling.


It may be better not to ask their acquaintances in a dry and direct manner. Instead, it might be best to get to know these people, do some casual talking, and then lead them to the topic.

"
"
Lie if necessary.,
Stay aware of your own unconscious invitations for affection.,
Show affection to another girl.,
Watch what you say.,
Utilize distractions to keep her attention from you.,
Limit the time spent with her.,
Act disinterested.,
Avoid gazing at her.She is, in your eyes, the purest beauty the world has ever seen.",How to Hide Your Feelings from a Girl You Like1," If the girl you like confronts you directly, hiding your feelings from her can seem impossible. Stay cool and react in a realistic way. Acting startled or surprised might give away the fact that you’re hiding something. Do not reply in a nervous manner.


There are many forms direct questions can take, but if she asks “Do you have a crush on me?” or “Do you have feelings for me?”, you might respond, “No, why do you ask?” or “Certainly not, whatever gave you that idea?”
If you don’t feel comfortable lying, rely in an ambiguous way. For instance, using the above example, you might simply reply “What makes you think that?” or “Why do you ask?” without including the explicit denial.Lying might not be the best option. She might be asking you about your feelings because she has feelings for you too.;
, There are certain unconscious cues indicating attraction conveyed by body language. For example, frequent, seemingly unnecessary grooming (touching your hair or smoothing your clothes),facing your body towards her, and thrusting your chest out and your shoulders back all provide indications that you’re attracted to someone in your presence and yearning for them to notice and touch you. Most of these can be stopped once you are aware of and looking for them in your own behavior.


Keep in mind that these cues are effectively invisible unless someone is consciously looking for them. You have no need to worry that you're sending out ""messages"" of attraction.

, If the girl you like believes you have a girlfriend already, or are interested in someone else, she’ll be unaware that you have feelings for her. By showing or expressing affection for another girl, you’ll effectively hide your feelings for her. Mention to a friend in an offhand way that you think another girl is cute when you’re within earshot of the girl you have feelings for. This will lead her into thinking you’re not interested in her.


Do not date another person just to mislead the girl you like. This third party could have their feelings hurt., Stay quiet around the girl you have a crush on. If you do talk, make sure your words are thoughtful and carefully considered. Talking too much, or too nervously, will tip her off that something in your attitude is amiss.


If the conversation veers toward romantic topics, or topics which might induce awkward feelings for you, try to steer it back toward subjects which aren’t so close to home.
Always speak in a steady, normal way. Don’t stutter or mumble when you’re speaking to her. Communicate as you always do with friends and acquaintances.

, Distractions can be either a solitary activity (like a TV show) or a shared activity (for instance, a puzzle you work on together). In either case, your distraction should be something which doesn’t necessitate conversation. If you’re forced to talk to each other, you might find yourself in a situation where it’s hard to hide your feelings.


Distract yourself if you’re unable to distract her. When she’s around, busy yourself with a videogame, a book, or your phone/tablet. Find an activity you can do alone, even if she is nearby. Whatever you do, ensure it precludes the possibility that you will express your feelings to/about her.

, When you’re with her, it is more difficult to avoid situations in which you feel the emotional pressure to confess how you feel about her. If you must spend time with her, do it in a big group or at a party. In group situations, you can easily avoid her and spend time talking to someone else, or wander off so that you’re not near her.

, When the girl you’re interested in is around, maintain a pleasant but detached disposition. Be casual. Don’t ignore her or pretend you’re too busy to be bothered with her; that will upset her and hurt her feelings. Rather, show mild interest in what she has to say, but no more than you would with any other friend or acquaintance.


Do not become withdrawn or uncharacteristically quiet when you’re around the girl you like. Such behavior is a telltale sign that something in your emotions is amiss., You only have eyes for her. But leaning forward in your seat, palms on your chin, is a sure giveaway that you have feelings for her. Wear sunglasses (weather permitting) if she’s around, and look away at the ground or at a fixed point in the opposite direction from where she is located in order to best hide the way you feel.

"
"
Don’t talk to anyone about your feelings.,
Keep a diary.,
Take up a new hobby like painting, skateboarding, or playing a musical instrument.,
Do not spend time with her.",How to Hide Your Feelings from a Girl You Like2," If your friends know that you have feelings for a certain girl, its possible that they will tell their friends, then their friends will tell their friends and so on. At some point, this knowledge will reach the very ears it was never meant to -- those of the girl you like.

, Write down all the thoughts and ideas you have about the girl you like in the diary. Write down the things you’d like to say to her but aren’t ready to yet.


Do not express your feelings on social media like Twitter or Facebook. Even if you’re vague, it’s possible that someone could piece together what and who you’re talking about, and your cover would be blown.

, The more you focus elsewhere, the less you’ll be focused on her. Your new hobbies will give you a needed distraction, and help you hide your feelings. Find something that you enjoy and that engages your attention and energy in positive ways.


Developing a skill will help you build confidence. If you feel uncomfortable revealing your feelings to a girl you like because you doubt your ability to woo her, gaining confidence by learning new abilities can potentially solve your problem.

, If you’re not around her, there’s no way to reveal your feelings. You’ll never be faced with a situation in which you inadvertently admit to your affection for her, or in which you just become so frustrated by not admitting how you feel that you spill the beans. Further, you'll never have nosy friends picking up on your potentially unusual behavior when you're in the presence of your crush. Spend time with family and friends instead of her.


Avoidance includes online interaction and texting. Do not browse her social media profiles or text her as an alternative to spending time with/around her.

"
Do it when your parents are away.,
If your partner's parents are more open-minded or else leave the house more, go over there as much as possible.,
Seize the moment.,
Use a car.,
Talk to mutual friends about other options.,
Venture into the outdoors.,
Look for another indoor space.,
Be aware of the risks.",How to Have Sex Without Your Parents Knowing1," Know their schedules, and plan for a time when they will be away for a least a few hours. Make sure that there's a large enough window before you get too excited. Listen for talk of date nights, weekend events, and movie plans. These are usually good for about 3-5 hours of parental absence during which you can plot your own secret rendezvous. If they ever go out of town and leave you in charge, you’ve hit the jackpot., This is probably the easiest option.


If your parents won't let you go over to a partner's house, you can always lie and claim to go to a friends house or out shopping, however, this could cause more trouble in the long run.

, You never know when a perfect opportunity is going to appear. If you and your partner are raring to go, you should be ready to jump on the chances that you get., Having sex in a car is doable as long as you can find a secluded place to park. This option might be a bit cramped, but it certainly can be done. If you live in a rural area, try pulling over on a country road. Business parks are usually fairly deserted on weekends and after hours. You can also try to hide in plain sight with lots of other cars around in a big parking lot.


Try to avoid parking near buildings or businesses. Otherwise, make sure to look out for security cameras, and make sure to read any signs that indicate you're not supposed to be there. You don't want to draw the attention of police or security guards!
Keep in mind that many public places are closely monitored at night, when people have less reason to come and go. If this is your only option, try to do it during the day if you want to avoid suspicion from police, park rangers, and security guards.

, You might be able to arrange for some privacy at a social gathering or the house of someone whose parents are less uptight than yours. It’s a long shot, but totally worth looking into.

, Remote natural settings like parks and forests are usually good places to get some alone time. Pack a picnic with food, drinks, and blankets, and hike around together in search of secluded spots. Make sure to pick a place that is safe and private.


If you know of a good spot already, feel free to take your romantic liaison there. Perhaps there is a ""make-out point"" near your community; maybe you know about an old treehouse in the woods, or a quiet place where no one goes.
Make sure that your partner is up for roughing it. Not everyone is comfortable with the great outdoors. Make your intentions clear beforehand.

, Book a cheap motel room, if you can afford it. Take your partner to an unused or low-traffic room at school, at work, or at another community building. Perhaps you have the key to a storage room at your school or at your work, or maybe you know about a corner in the church basement that no one ever checks. Try to think outside the box!

, It is illegal to have sex in many outdoor and public spaces. It is illegal to have sex with a minor (younger than age 16, 17, or 18 in the U.S.), even if you yourself are a minor. If you really like this person and you are able to find a discreet place, then legality need not stop you – but make sure that you understand the consequences! If you are caught violating these laws, you might be arrested or fined, and legally labeled a sexual predator. Even worse, your parents might find out!


Check the legal age of consent for your state or country. If you live in the U.S., the age of consent may be 16, 17, or 18, with a corresponding ""acceptable difference between ages"".If the age of consent for your state is 18, this means that sex with anyone younger than 18 is illegal – even if you are 18 and your partner is 17, or if you are 17 and your partner is also 17.
Many teenage lovers have been branded sexual predators over the years. This label follows you into adulthood: you have to register as a sex offender whenever you move to a new address, and you may not be allowed to live within a certain radius of a school.Whether the law is fair or the law is blind, you should be aware of the consequences of what you're doing!

Talk to your partner.,
Prepare yourself mentally.,
Agree on an alibi for every encounter.,
Be discreet.,
Keep the noise down.,
Consider sexual activities beyond full intercourse.",How to Have Sex Without Your Parents Knowing2," You should both be ready to have sex and ready to accept the consequences. Make sure you are both on the same page about all of this. It might be awkward at first, but you'll need to talk about sex in order to arrange the best way to do it secretly. If you're going to keep your parents from finding out, you need to communicate.


Find a discreet way to talk about these things. If your parents read your text messages, then you shouldn't discuss your plans over text. If you go to the same school, you can talk there. Consider agreeing on a ""code"" to refer to sexual things so that you can make plans more openly.

, Lying may seem easier than telling your parents up front, but pulling it off may take a lot of quick thinking and mental energy. Sneaking around means plans, alibis, codes, and cover-ups. This comes more naturally to some people than others. There is no room for error if you are going to do it right. If not, you might as well just tell your parents everything right now!

, Do this even if you don’t think you will need it. As your parents leave the house for dinner and a movie, tell them you plan to spend your evening doing homework or watching TV. If you are going to a social gathering that your parents might not approve of, think of a more wholesome activity you could claim to be doing for the night: e.g. a study group or a sleepover. Use your imagination, but be ready to back up any claims that you make.


Be careful what you say. Your parents might know more than you think they do, and you don't want to give them any reason to be suspicious. Be aware that parents often talk to other parents.
Make sure that your story matches the stories of other people who will supposedly be around. If you say that you're sleeping over at a friend's house, make sure that A) your parents won't ask your friend's parents about it, or B) your friend's parents will cover for you.

, Secrets are best kept on a need-to-know basis – so be careful who you tell. This also means covering your tracks to avoid detection. Don’t leave your diary, a gift from your partner, a pack of condoms, or any other evidence lying around.

, You can’t expect to keep this under wraps when you make a clumsy ruckus every time. Explain to your partner why you need to keep quiet. After you learn to do your business swiftly and quietly, you may even be able to get away with it in a house full of people., Mutual masturbation, oral sex, and other non-penetrative sex acts tend to be much easier to hide. You may find many unexpected opportunities for a quick session when you wouldn't necessarily be able to go all-out.

Understand the risks.,
Make sure that you're ready.,
Use protection.,
Visit a gynecologist.,
Talk to an adult.,
Consider telling your parents.",How to Have Sex Without Your Parents Knowing3," Unprotected (and sometimes even protected) sex can lead to unwanted pregnancy, various sexually-transmitted infections, general health concerns, and psychological repercussions. Sex is great, but it's also a great responsibility: to your body, to your partner, to your family, and to your future. Read up on safe sex online to make sure that you're doing everything you can.


DO NOT go without protection for risk of your parents finding out. An unexpected pregnancy or STD is far harder to explain than a box of condoms or pack of pills. , It's important that you are mentally as well as physically ready to have sex. Sex is a fundamental part of being human, and it can change the way that you see the world. Be sure that you're doing this for the right reasons. Are you truly ready to have joyful, responsible sex, or are you responding to peer pressure and outside expectations? Do some soul-searching.

, It is best to combine methods if you want to prevent pregnancy as well as STDs. You can buy condoms at most drugstores, grocery stores, and convenience stores. Visit Planned Parenthood or another clinic, and they will give you a bag of free condoms. Girls: ask your doctor about birth control pills and other long-term solutions if you're planning to be sexually active. It might be embarrassing to talk about this at first, but everybody does it – and it's better to be safe than sorry!Free condoms are available to the public at clinics and doctors' offices, the Department of Health and Social Services, and some schools – visit the school nurse. Stash them in your locker or any secure hiding place that is safe from prying eyes. Always keep more condoms than you think you will need, but do not use them after the expiration date stamped on the package.
""Pulling out"" is not a sure way to prevent pregnancy. Even condoms are not 100% effective – but they are much safer than the alternative.
An STD (sexually transmitted disease) could pose serious health risks, and it might haunt you throughout your life. Think about who you're having sex with, and think about who they in turn have had sex with. A huge part of sexual responsibility is communicating with your partner about sexual history., All sexually active females should see a gynecologist at least once a year for cancer tests, STD screenings, and birth control. Most young women do not have reasons to visit the gynecologist before becoming sexually active, so it might be hard to get your parents’ support without blowing your cover. However, this is an important part of safe sex, and it is well worth your while to set up an appointment., If you can't talk to your parents about sex, think about other adults in your life whom you're comfortable approaching with sensitive questions. Try talking to a doctor, a teacher, a trustworthy family member (brother, sister, aunt, uncle,) or a counselor. If you can't think of anyone, visit the nearest Planned Parenthood clinic and make an appointment to speak with a clinician. Sex is a big responsibility to take on alone, and it might be helpful to get advice from someone more experienced.An older sibling can be a great person to talk to, depending on your relationship with them. They're experienced with sex, but they also understand where you're coming from. Consider their advice before moving forward.

, They might be more helpful and understanding than you expect. By sneaking around and trying to have sex without your parents knowing, you will always be at risk of getting caught. Think about whether that's a chance you want to take.Have a confident, mature conversation with your parents about your decision. If you can explain why you're ready to have sex, they might give you the space to make your own choice.
Find out if your partner’s parents could handle the news. If so, talk to them. This kind of thing often goes much more smoothly if somebody’s parents know what is going on.

Ask yourself deeply why you want an open relationship.,
Understand that an open relationship does not mean that your love for your partner should decrease.,
Find the right time to discuss the topic.,
Bring up the topic of an open relationship and ask what your partner thinks about it.,
If your partner seems to react positively, introduce what an open relationship is and why you want it for the relationship.,
Discuss what the limits and goals for the open relationship should be.,
Establish ground rules about how far each partner can go.,
Talk about protection.,
Discuss whether or not you want to tell your friends and family about the new aspect to your relationship.,
Finally, be sure to express that communication will be the absolute key to making the relationship successful.",How to Have an Open Relationship," Are you no longer satisfied with your partner? Do you simply want to try it? Do you think it will enhance your relationship with your current partner? These are all important considerations to make before trying to discuss the topic with your partner.


Be sure your motives are very strong before trying to discuss the topic with your partner. For some people, the topic is incredibly taboo and negative. Unless your partner has mentioned it in the past, do not assume that your partner will accept it.
Ask yourself if it is worth pursuing. It is possible that bringing up the topic with your partner will create a rift between you two. It may sound like you are no longer happy in the relationship. Be sure it is something you absolutely want to pursue, because you could possibly lose your current partner.;
, In fact, many think that having a successful open relationship requires an even deeper bond between partners to maintain a connection.


If you cannot accept this fact, you should strongly consider whether or not an open relationship is worth it. You may be looking for a way out of a relationship without actually breaking up, which is a poor motive to enter an open relationship.
You will need an even deeper connection with your partner because you may be drawn to love other partners. Ask yourself if you will be able to maintain your love for your partner while still seeing other people.

, Try to schedule a time and make sure you both have set aside an hour or two to deeply discuss the topic. Undoubtedly, you will need plenty of time to discuss the nuances of the relationship and whether or not it is something you and your partner want to pursue.


Try to get rid of any distractions, like cell phones, or computers before starting the conversation.
Make sure your partner understands that the time to talk should be fairly serious. You don't want your partner to be surprised.

, Try to gauge their opinion before progressing any further. If he/she reacts very poorly, do not try to continue pushing the topic. It is better to cease discussion of it immediately.


Make sure to express that there is nothing wrong with your current relationship but you want to try adding another dimension.
Pay close attention to your partner's body language as it may convey emotions which words may not.

, Be honest and open as to your motives to express that you are not trying to devalue your partner's role in the relationship.


Explain clearly that this type of relationship is giving and not selfish. It's one that is not codependent.
Be sure to express that the open relationship can be on a trial period. It is okay to stop it at any time if either partner feels uncomfortable with the situation.

, Outline clearly for your partner what you hope to gain from the relationship and where the limits should be. Then, have your partner describe what he/she believes the limits should be. Come to a compromise based on this information.


Discuss with your partner whether you should ask each other permission before becoming involved with someone else. Some people prefer to have the right to ""veto.""
Discuss whether you expect to be told about the other partner's activities. Do you want to know whenever your mate has been involved with someone else? Or would you rather not know?

, You may decide that each of you can do any sexual activity with anyone else, or you may draw the line somewhere, or ask that your partner only be involved with someone of a particular gender. Some couples even establish geographical boundaries, such that the relationship becomes ""open"" when the couple is separated by a long distance.

, If either of you gets a sexually transmitted disease or infection, it will affect both of you, so this is important to discuss. Will each partner confirm that the person they're getting involved with is STD-free? Is verbal reassurance enough, or do you want to see medical papers? Will each partner use protection when engaging in ALL sexual activity, or just some?

, Many will not accept an open relationship so it is a touchy topic.


It is perfectly okay to not tell your friends and family about the open relationship if you feel uncomfortable doing so.

, Agree that honesty is the best policy. If you and your partner are lying to each other about what is happening with other people, suspicion and paranoia will grow.


Make sure that your partner understands that he/she can stop the open relationship at anytime.

Spend time just as friends.","How to Have a Healthy ""Friends With Benefits"" Relationship"," Whether the physical relationship has already been initiated or not, have a conversation with your friend. Perhaps they have already indicated that they would like to enjoy a sexual relationship with you or maybe this has not been discussed. Wherever you are in the process, have a talk with them about the situation and their comfort level.


If you haven’t had sex yet, you might say “Crystal, I really enjoy our friendship and we have such a close bond. But, I’m single now and I really would like to take our friendship to another level. I’m not looking for a relationship though, but I do think about sleeping with you often.”
If you have had sex, but haven’t had a conversation, you might say “You know, the other night was great. I know that on my end I still want us to be friends no matter what but I would like to keep having sex if you want to.”
If they are not interested in having or continuing a sexual relationship with you, move on and do not pressure them.;
, After you have had a talk and both of you have agreed to being friends with benefits, discuss a potential timeline for this situation to end. If it is your true intention to not have a romance with this person, settings these limitations will be necessary so that you don’t develop feelings. Consider setting a six month limit on your tryst.You might say “Chris, I’m moving in a few months, so why don’t we just do this until I leave?”

, In addition to setting limits on the relationship, set limits on how much time you are spending alone together. Try to limit any interactions that you might have to just two hours or less. Spending too much time together may cause you to develop a deeper emotional attachment to them., Though this person is your friend and you may want to chat often, find other friends to chat with occasionally. Don’t allow your FWB to become the only person you talk to or rely on.For instance, perhaps you might agree to only speak every other day and to not have phone calls that last for more than 30 minutes at a time.

, In addition to these other restrictions, it is typically best to keep your friends out of your FWB relationship. Though you may want your friends to know just so you aren’t keeping secrets, keep the details light. Don’t share information with them about your sex life or any other personal details.This will also help keep you maintain your friendship with the person after you FWB relationship has ended.

, In order for this new sexual dynamic to work between you and your friend, be sure to keep your expectations low. Often times, when in a relationship you might have high expectations of your partner, but remember that this person is not your partner. Don’t expect them to always want to see you when you reach out or to always answer your calls. Keep a chill attitude about the arrangement.If you feel that you cannot be chill, consider ending the relationship.

, Avoid performing romantic gestures for your friend, like purchasing them expensive gifts. This can inject confusion and ambiguity into your dynamic, unless you already bought them gifts before you became friends with benefits.If you want to get them something for their birthday or for a holiday, consider putting a monetary limit on the gift, like $50 or less.

, After you and your friend have sex or fool around, it can be tempting to fall asleep at their place or let them sleep at yours. However, doing so is a surefire way to develop feelings for them. Avoid staying over after hanging out.Set an alarm if necessary so that if you do fall asleep, you can leave before the morning comes.

, Another way to maintain your friendship without being romantic is to avoid pillow talk after sex. Avoid cuddling up for extended periods of time or chatting romantically after sex. One of the times that people feel the most connected and bonded is during sex, so try not to allow that romantic haze to extend beyond the physical act if you want to maintain your friendship., Another way to prevent romanticizing your relationship is to avoid going on dates. Don’t go out for candlelit dinners or go out with groups of couples. Keep your relationship friendly and continue to act as friends outside of the bedroom. Avoid spending romantic holidays together like Valentine’s Day.You can still hang out and go to the movies or to dinner together, but keep it friendly.

, During this time, be sure that you are maintaining trust between your and your friend. This might be a person that you have known for years or maybe just a good friend that you’ve had for a few months. Whatever the relationship, keep your promises to them and always be honest.If you start dating someone, let them know, especially if you plan to have sex with this new person.
If you tell them you will hang out with them or call them later, do so. Continue to be a good friend to them.

, Make sure that you are also being very kind and courteous to them, perhaps even more so than when you were strictly friends. Sex introduces a new closeness and bond, and you might find that your relationship is a bit more sensitive because of it. Always treat them well, check in with them regularly, and ensure that the FWB relationship is still working for both of you., In these kinds of situations, tell your friend if you develop feelings for them. Know that this is natural as this is a person with whom you share a friendship and a sexual relationship. Tell them how you feel and discontinue the FWB relationship if they don’t want something more.You might say “Jamie, I’ve enjoy these last few months being friends with benefits, but I think now I want something more. If you don’t, I understand and respect that, but I can’t continue to just have sex with you because of these feelings that I have.”
If they tell you that they have developed feelings for you, be honest with them about your own feelings. If you don’t want a relationship, tell them that.

, Continue to develop your friendship outside of your sexual relationship. Hang out with your mutual friends often. Explore your interests together outside of the bedroom. Continue to be honest with each other and with yourself about what you want.

Approach the girl from the side you intend to hug.,
Tighten your arm with your hand at her shoulder.,
Embrace for a moment and release.,
Get close to the girl you’re hugging.,
Bend at the waist and put your arms forward.,
Stay bent for the duration of the hug.,
Release after a few seconds.,
Don’t make it awkward.,
Don’t just stand there.,
Keep your arms away from their neck and head.,
Don’t lift her up unless she asks.",How to Hug a Girl Who Is Shorter Than You," This will almost certainly be determined by how the both of you are standing. Most likely you’ll already be oriented in a certain way to one another, so it won’t be a matter of choosing a side to hug. As the hug is beginning, you’ll need to step close to the girl in question.


As you get close, move the arm that will be used for the hug (it should be the arm closest to her) out to the side of your body. Begin to position it horizontally in anticipation of the hug.
Wait until both of you have sides touching before placing your arm on the girl you’re hugging; keep your arm out to the side instead.
One of the strongest advantages of the side hug is avoiding the girl’s head being pushed directly into your waistline or lower, which can be embarrassing for everyone. While the side hug alleviates this issue, you still might consider bending if the girl is still at or below your belt line.;
, Once you’ve both come close and are against one another, position your arm around her so that your hand rests on the shoulder opposite you. Be sure to avoid placing your arm or hand on or around her neck.Keep your arm above hers, it can become sort of a tangle if your arms criss-cross in the hug.
If you do bend down, it will be best to do so from the knees when in a side hug. Bending at the waist will create a difficult angle for the girl to put her arm around you.
Whatever the height difference, the mid-waist and shoulder are really the only acceptable places to rest your arm and hand. You’ll always want to avoid placing your hand(s) at their chest or neck/head. One will end up being a bit awkward and the other is uncomfortable.

, A concern for any two people hugging, deciding how long to hold the embrace will simply be a matter of how close the two people hugging are. Conventional wisdom would suggest holding the hug for no more than three seconds for anyone who isn’t a romantic partner.As the tall one in the hug, don’t rush to remove yourself from the hug to avoid any awkward bumping. First relax your arm and move it away from her body. Let her back up and return to standing before you do the same.

, Since in this method you’ll be approaching the girl facing forward, it will be easier to gauge where on your body her height reaches. Especially with a forward-facing hug you’ll want to be sure her head doesn’t end up right at waist height or lower.For the forward-facing hug you’ll want to bend so that her head can meet your shoulder, or at least your lower chest.

, As mentioned, bend enough that your chest is at the height of her head. Bring your arms forward in front of you and let her come the rest of the way. This way it will be her decision whether to place her head into your chest or into the bend of your neck.


Fold your arms across her upper back as you would with any hug. Avoid placing them around her neck instead.
Keep your head facing forward, don’t turn it to either side to avoid bumping heads or breathing in her face once she comes close.

, Some might make the mistake of thinking they would only bend at first to begin the hug and place their arms, and afterwards relax their pose. Better instead to stay bent for the short time of the hug. Trying to straighten your back will just end up in some awkward movement while you try to stay in the hug.

, Again, the length of any hug will simply depend on your relationship with the one you’re hugging. When you’re hugging face forward, you’ll want to release and step back first as the tall one. Since you’re sort of surrounding the girl you’re hugging, you’ll want to move your arms out, straighten your back and step backwards., You don’t have to apologize for being tall, and the girl you’re hugging doesn’t have to apologize for being short. There’s no need to say “guess I’ll need to bend down” or “sorry I’m so short;” two people hugging will always recognize the size disparity between one another.


However, there’s always room for some playful honesty in moments like this. It won’t hurt to be upfront and say “ok, how would you like to do this?”

, Plenty of guys might overthink the situation and wonder if it isn’t better to just allow the girl to position herself however she’s comfortable and let their own arms rest wherever seems appropriate. This, however, isn’t really fair to whoever you’re hugging. Be sure to be proactive at the start of the hug.


As suggested, be sure to bend down if hugging from the front or move your arm(s) out when hugging for the side.
It’s not a terrible instinct to allow the shorter person to position themselves, but you need to meet them halfway by doing some positioning yourself.

, In either a side hug or a front-facing hug, your arms may very well be at the level of the shorter person’s head. Since when two people of equal height hug they simply put their arms forward, the instinct is to do the same with any other hug. As you can imagine, having your head squeezed doesn’t really constitute a great hug.

, Unless the girl you’re hugging is your significant other, don’t assume that just because a girl a short and you’re tall that she'd like to be lifted into the air. Some might assume it’s a playful and comical way to address the height difference, but it can quickly turn into an uncomfortable experience for the person you’re hugging.

Choose whether you are up to having a conversation : take a moment to reflect whether you're really fully ready-physically, mentally and emotionally.,
Determine whether the person you wish to have the conversation with is ready, and on the topic you wish to converse on.,
Check whether you really care for the other person in context of the topic of conversation--as a boss, a parent, a friend or a partner.,
Be clear on the purpose--is it just a selfish purpose, or a manipulative one, or can it really be helpful to both parties.,
Check the level of trust between you.,
Listen.,
Learn to like silence as much as words.,
Measure the words you are using.,
Continuously watch for how the other person is reacting.,
Finally, be true to yourself, genuineness is the most powerful part of yourself you can bring to a conversation.

",How to Have a Meaningful 1 on 1 Conversation,";
, Ideally if the other person starts off, and you are ready to respond, a meaningful conversation can ensue. If you're not sure, ask the other person.

, If you do not, it's visible and felt. Unless a conversation adds positively to both parties, it's likely to be debilitating in some way.

, Even advise given through a conversation is useful only if both parties see value in it.

, Most dialogues (with no preformed strong opinions) would require a level of trust. If there is a lack of trust on either side, the first step would possibly be to build some trust. It can be built through the conversation itself and sometimes by being upfront and open about the level of trust. Unless you understand and put the problem on the table, the solution will not emerge.

, The term conversation is misunderstood as speaking. Listening is the most important part of a conversation. Deep, empathetic listening can raise the quality of the 1-1 interaction immensely.

, If fact, if you look back, some of the most meaningful and understanding conversations are characterized by the quality of silences in it.

, Words, and more importantly, the tone and body language, can take away from the effectiveness of any face to face conversation.Pay attention to how you come across, watch yourselves speaking in front of the mirror. Or record yourself through a camera having a conversation and play it back--it's amazing what you'll see and hear.

, People give you instant feedback through their body language, tone and voice.It is great feedback to work on yourselves and the conversation.

Unfriend her on Facebook.,
Walk away.,
Find sources of support.,
Take the high road.",How to Ignore a Girl Who Hates Your Guts1," Cyberbullying is just as hurtful and harmful as real life bullying. People can easily use your social media profile as a place to spread rumors and share unwanted information.

Plus, deleting her from your profile will show her that you’re not interested in further communication.To unfriend someone on Facebook, go to their page, click on Friends, and then click on “unfriend.”
This goes for all forms of social media. Unfollow her on Instagram and Twitter and don’t watch her Snapchat story.;
, Bullies like to feel as if they have control over your emotions and actions. They’re looking to provoke a specific reaction from you. Walking away will not only keep you from engaging in a conflict, but will show the bully that you’re not willing to let her have any form of control over your life.Avoid making eye contact. Keep your head held high and look straight ahead. This will show her that you’re above any kind of petty interactions.

, Talk to a trusted outsider about a girl who is mistreating you. Somebody else might be able to help you deal with the problem better than you can yourself.


If you are being bullied by a girl in school, talk to a teacher, parent, or other trusted adult figure about how to handle the situation. An adult will be able to help you and prevent the girl from being aggressive with others later on.If you are dealing with a romantic or workplace issue, try having a friend mediate a conversation or seek the help of a counselor.

, It might be tempting to be mean right back when a girl is attacking you either in person or behind your back. Don't gossip, yell, or cause drama. Be an example of good behavior. If she sees you acting kindly, she will be forced to reconsider her own behavior.If she attempts to get other people on your back, calmly explain to them what's really going on. It’s important not to perpetuate further gossip among 3rd parties. Say something like: “I don’t know what Sarah’s told you, but here’s my take on the situation.”

Don’t engage with a bully.,
Try not to take it personally.,
Find the humor in the situation.,
Try to empathize with the bully.,
Stand up for yourself.",How to Ignore a Girl Who Hates Your Guts2," One of the best ways to ignore somebody is to show them that you’re disinterested in communicating with them. If a girl is bully with you, don’t stoop to her level. Instead, try not to engage in distasteful conversation. Be as formal and polite as you can so that she’ll have no choice but to leave you alone.Say you run into the girl at school, and she starts yelling at you from across the hall. Don’t respond. Politely say “excuse me” and keep walking forward.

, Usually, bullies act the way they do out of low self-esteem. Oftentimes they are targeting you just because they need somebody to pick on, so it is important to avoid taking the bullying personally.To avoid taking the bullying personally, try considering the importance of the relationship. Is this someone you really care about, or someone who you just know? Does his or her opinion really matter? Will it affect how those who really care about you will treat you?
You can also try thinking about how this person treats other people and why. Is she mean to most people or does she pick on a select few people? Why do you think she does this? Is she insecure? Does she struggle at school? Is there something else that might be causing her to lash out?

, Laughing at mean comments will make you feel better about yourself, and will also confuse the girl so much that she might stop. Bullies are looking to provoke you, and if you respond with a positive attitude, they will likely stop feeling the need to pick on you., Bullies act out because they themselves feel hurt or misunderstood. Try to see the girl as a human being who is hurting, and who is dealing with her problems by trying to make you hurt, too. Don’t let her do this to you. Instead, feel empathy for the girl and don’t let her get to you., If ignoring her still doesn’t work, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Try not to yell or get too worked up. Say something simple and direct, like: ""I don’t like the way you’re treating me. This needs to stop.”Saying something honest is always disarming. If you encounter the girl and she is being loud and mean, quietly say “I’m really bothered that you’re acting this way” instead of coming back with an equally offensive comment.

"
"
Take responsibility.If a girl hates you, there could very well be a reason why.,
Initiate a conversation.,
Change your own behavior.",How to Ignore a Girl Who Hates Your Guts3," Instead of spending the rest of your life ignoring her, take accountability for whatever actions caused her to hate you. It’s best to confront her about this in a private setting.


The easiest way to take responsibility is to apologize. Take the girl aside and say, “I know you’re really mad at me for how I treated you last semester and I just want you to know that I’m sorry. I hope we can work things out so that you don’t feel this much anger towards me.”

, Whether a girl hates you because of something you did or simply because she’s a bully, it’s a good idea to talk through the issue. Ask the girl to join you for a coffee or tea so that you can work out what’s bothering her. Even if you haven’t done anything wrong and are baffled as to why you’re being picked on, it’s still a good idea to get some clarity on the situation. Plan to talk in a quiet but public place to ensure privacy and safety.


Say to her: “I’d really like for us to work out this issue together. Can we meet at Starbucks later this afternoon to talk it out?”
Use “I” statements to avoid making her feel defensive. For example, you can say something like, “I feel sad when you call me names.”
Say what you would like to have happen. For example, you might say something like, “I’d like for you to stop calling me names.”
Avoid criticizing, threatening, advising, or assuming that you know what she is thinking. Stick to saying how you feel and what you want.If you are dealing with a bully in school, have an adult mediate a conversation.

, You can't control other people’s actions, but you can control your own. Depending on the situation, there are a few ways you can radically change your behavior so that the girl will stop seeing you as someone to hate.


If you’re being bullied, try to see that the girl is probably bullying because she is in some kind of personal pain. Say something nice to her every once in a while or invite her to sit with you at lunch and see if she changes her attitude towards you.
If you have wronged the girl in the past, a great way to change your actions is to do something kind for her. Buy her a coffee or a chocolate bar with a note attached saying you’d like to be on better terms. This might not make the girl like you any better, but at least you’ve sent out a positive message.

Approach your friend for a conversation.,
Start the conversation on a positive note.,
Be kind, but direct and straightforward.,
Suggest other options.,
Take action if your friend does not listen and continues asking for your money.",How to Get Your Friend to Stop Asking for Your Money," Is he/she poor, or does he/she just need extra money to go to Subway, buy cough drops, etc? Finding out why the person wants your money is a key first step to assessing the situation.
, Having a conversation about how you feel is key to resolving the situation., Show that you have compassion for the person, especially if he/she is in poverty and in need of a lot of money. For example, you could say ""I know you are poor, and I have compassion for you""., Tell the person that you are happy to give some of your money, but you need plenty for yourself as well. Having someone continually ask for your money can be very frustrating and exhausting, but make sure you say it in a sensitive way, rather than being hurtful and harsh. Do not say ""I'm so sick and tired of you always asking me for money! I wish you would leave my money alone!"" but rather say it like ""I understand your situation, and I am happy to give you some of my money, but I can't be giving it to you all the time. I need enough to fend for myself as well""., If the person is poor, suggest that he/she get help from a homeless shelter or from the local government. If the person is just in need of extra money, suggest that he/she get cash from an ATM., Raise your concerns in a firmer way. Tell your friend that you asked him/her to stop asking for your money all the time, but he/she continues to do it, so you will have to end the friendship because you don't want to constantly be taken advantage of all the time."

Don’t feel the need to get defensive.",How to Get Back at a Jerk," Take a counter intuitive approach and break the jerk down by being stubbornly, persistently nice. As the old saying goes “kill them with kindness.” Treat the jerk's insensitive comments like jokes, or disarm them by asking personal questions with genuine interest. Interact with them like they're a close friend, rather than an enemy who needs to be taught a lesson. A lot the time, jerks act unfriendly because they feel a lack of friendliness themselves. By being nice to someone who’s mistreating you, you’re telling them that it’s more important to get along than to argue.Think of kindness as a kind of cure for rudeness. If a jerk receives enough kind treatment and doesn’t feel the need to be on the offensive all the time, they may begin to change their ways.Practicing kindness also keeps you from being at fault. Rather than seeing two people bickering, those around you will view the situation as it is—a mean person acting hostile towards a nice person.;
, Do your best not to be phased by a jerk’s verbal assault. Instead, grin and exhibit unshakeable confidence. It’s a surefire way of letting a jerk know that their tactics won’t work. Acting self-assured shows that you can’t be baited into quibbling with a small-minded person with nothing better to do than act cruel toward others.Projecting an assertive appearance may discourage a jerk from lashing out altogether.Even if it doesn’t convince a jerk to lay off, an attitude of confident superiority will make you feel more secure. There will be no need for you to get involved in a dispute.

, Let your smile and positive attitude be your defense against a surly sourpuss. Chances are, the last thing a jerk is going to expect then they’re trying to make you feel inferior is for you to let out a hearty laugh. In the best case scenario, he or she will see that they can’t bring you down. In the worst, it will give them something else to set their sights on—and you won’t be bothered by that, either.Not only is smiling and laughing a good way to neutralize people with bad intentions, it can actually make you feel better the more you do it., Make it known that the way they’re acting is senseless and hurtful. This could is as easy as saying “that’s really uncool” or “I can’t believe you would say something like that” or simply using body language to express disapproval of their jabs. It’s hard to be a jerk to someone who isn’t fighting you back. Without opposition, the jerk’s unreturned words and actions will be deflected back at them, and they’ll be forced to examine their own behavior.Find ways of rebuking a jerk without appearing like you’re trying to pick a fight. This can usually be accomplished by taking issue with the person’s words or actions, not them themselves.Show empathy toward other individuals that become targets of a jerk’s abuse. This type of compassion reinforces that person’s humanity and may cause an aggressor to rethink what they’re doing.

, Encourage the people around you to express their disapproval along with you. Let the jerk know that you're not going to tolerate their attitude, and neither is anyone else. Jerks usually act the way they do to make themselves feel bigger and more important in front of others, so it's unlikely that they'll continue if they sense that their tactics are having the opposite effect.Take the lead. Sometimes, people will be afraid to speak up until they see someone else doing it. Be the one to let the jerk know that what they're doing is unacceptable and others will follow suit., Take the spring out of a jerk's step by calmly belittling them. Point out something embarrassing to distract from their attempts to put you down, like their zipper being open or having a booger hanging out of their nose, or call out their motivations directly. Say something like ""you must have a really fragile ego to act like that."" They may feel the need to defend themselves, but they'll no longer have the will to keep being deliberately obnoxious after they've been exposed.By confronting a jerk head-on, while being careful not to get worked up or incite an argument, you're stripping them of their power.
Keep your cool and respond in a matter-of-fact tone. Never resort to name calling or angry, nasty attacks when cutting a jerk down to size. You'll just be playing their game.

, Your mom’s advice on dealing with the schoolyard bully as a child was spot on—just ignore them. Most jerks feed off of the negative reactions they get from the people they torment. If you try to stand up for yourself when there’s nothing to be proved, it just feeds the flames. Jerks will always try to rock the boat, so don’t let yourself be thrown overboard.Don't spend your time around people who make a habit of being malicious. It's better to just avoid them altogether when you can.
It may seem childish, but if a jerk’s every barbed comment is met with silence, they’ll have no choice but to desist. Carrying on would just be like talking to a wall.

, Stay calm and don’t let yourself get upset. Getting aggravated is just playing their game. If a jerk knows he or she is getting under your skin, they’ll continue to needle you in order to feel like they’re in control. When they see that their efforts are being wasted, they’ll eventually give up.Remember, the only person that has control over your emotions is you yourself.

, Point out the jerk’s rude behavior and let them know that you don’t appreciate it. Do this politely to avoid making a scene or causing angry feelings to flare. It can really take the wind out of someone’s sails to have the person they’re harassing call attention to their nastiness. Simply make a calm, level-headed statement like “you’re being rude right now, and there’s no reason for it” and move on.Try to stay poised and reasonable. Write off the jerk’s behavior the way you would explain a scientific fact.
Take care not to come across as on-edge when denouncing a jerk. It may seem like their behavior is getting to you, and this could potentially just egg them on.

, Sometimes there’s just no getting through to a jerk. If your attempts to diffuse the situation aren’t working, all you have to do is leave. Making a swift, unceremonious exit sends the message that you’re not interested in getting caught up in a dispute loud and clear. Putting yourself in a different place from the source of scorn is one immediate way to make the problem stop.The jerk might interpret you leaving as a sign of victory: they got to you so bad that you fled in disgrace. Let them think that. There’s no sense in arguing with them. If you don’t even care to be around them, why bother trying to change their perception?

, Focus on breathing and keeping your cool. Make an active mental effort to calming yourself down. This isn’t always easy, but it prevents you from making a heated mistake and playing into a jerk’s hands. Feelings of resentment and the desire to get even can quickly overthrow your better judgment if you’re not careful.Breathing helps sooth your autonomic nervous (fight or flight) response and gives you something to fix your mind on other than coming up with something to say or do in retaliation.
Draw in a deep breath, hold it to the count of three, then exhale. Do this four or five times. Imagine that the irritation you feel is slipping out with each breath.

, Pause to mull over what’s going on rather than allowing yourself to be baited. Is the jerk actually saying anything worth listening to? What are you getting worked up over? Once you try to logically account for certain emotional impulses, you’ll find that they quickly fade away.Give yourself thirty seconds to a minute to consider your possible reaction before acting it out. At the end of that time, you’ll probably think better of it., Pull back and stop interacting with the mean person directly. If there are other people around, talk to one of them until you cool down. Otherwise, find something else to focus your attention on to take your mind off an unkind comment or action. If possible, go somewhere else and do something soothing to help you relax. Even if you don't have a way of escaping, you can demonstrate your indifference to the jerk’s antics by directing your attention elsewhere.Talking to the people around you will also take their attention away from the jerk, meaning they won’t get the conflict that they crave.
If all else fails, pull out your phone and pretend to text a friend. That way, you can ignore an antagonist without the need to just sit in uncomfortable silence.

, You have nothing to prove to mean-spirited critics. Don’t engage them or feel the need to confront them over meaningless words or you’ll just be stooping to their level. Getting defensive is like revealing a chink in your armor that the jerk will zero in on and try to damage further. If they don’t allow them to feel justified in attacking you, they’ll just be hurling empty abuses.Arguing with a jerk only serves to validate their conduct.
There may be times when it’s necessary to speak out against a jerk, like when the person just won’t stop, or when they’re bullying someone else around you. In these cases, try to take a stand without coming off as aggressive. This can just motivate a jerk to push back even harder."

Make sure your friend is actually leaving you for the popular crowd.,
Give your friend a little time.,

Ask your old friend to refrain from speaking poorly about you. Sometimes people don't realize the affect their words and actions have on others.
You can say something like, ""I understand that you have chosen a new group of friends, but please do not insult me or talk poorly about me behind my back anymore.""

, If the insults continue, you may need to seek out the help of an adult, such as a principal, teacher, guidance counselor, or parent. Unfortunately, kids and teenagers can be mean and relentless. An adult can help you confront your friend., Oftentimes, people who put others down are actually insecure and self-conscious. Let the negative comments go in one ear and out the other.

You have to let it out. Crying sometimes if the best release of negative feelings.

A good friend would never insult, belittle, or consciously hurt a friend.

, Do not try and force your mutual friends to pick sides. Doing so will only create more tension and drama in your life.

Put yourself back on the market.,
Introduce yourself to someone new.,

Join a new class, club, sport, or organization.",How to Get over the Fact Your Friend Left You for the Popular Crowd4," Open yourself up to the idea of making a new friend. Keeping an open mind and possessing a friendly and positive attitude will attract others to you., Start a conversation with someone you’ve been sitting next to in class all semester. Ask someone you’ve never worked with to be your partner for a class project. Say hello to the person whose locker is next to yours. Your new friend could be someone you never paid attention to before.

, Instead of focusing on what’s on your phone, tablet, or computer, focus on who is around you. Make eye contact and small talk with those around you. Simply saying hello and smiling is a good start., Choosing to take part in a new activity will open up your chances of meeting new people and people who share similar interests with you.

Extricate yourself from the conversation.",How to Get Along with People Who You Don't Like1," Don't bring up politics or religion, and avoid topics that have triggered an argument before. Instead, talk about the person's hobby, the weather, food, or a shared friend.


Parents usually love to talk about their children.;
, If you are forced to have a conversation with someone, make an effort to keep your contributions polite and short. Deliver a small compliment on the person's clothing or house when you join a conversation with him. Ask him short, basic questions about how his day has been going, or whether there's anything new with his family. Listen to the answers without interrupting, even if he talks for some time. The less you say, the less likely you are to reveal your dislike.


If you can't think of anything nice to say, just smile and nod instead.

, Rubbing the back of your neck, crossing your arms, or shifting your weight back and forth can signal that you are bored or nervous. If this is someone you don't want to offend, try to keep your feet still and your arms at your sides.

, Subtle humor can be easily misinterpreted as offensive, especially if you accidentally let your real opinion show through in your tone of voice. Only make obvious, straightforward jokes, or none at all, and don't tease the person you dislike, even in a ""friendly"" fashion.

, A socially savvy person may end the conversation herself once she sees that you are only giving short responses. If she doesn't, however, politely excuse yourself by saying ""It was nice talking to you! I've got to get back to (my errands/my work/my day.)""


Another option in a group conversation is to ask another person questions so the focus shift to him instead of the person you dislike.
If you do not have the option of leaving permanently, give yourself a ""time out"" by excusing yourself to the bathroom for a few minutes.

Don't turn one interaction into someone's personality.,
Question whether someone's behavior is directed at you.,
Look for positive attributes.,
Ask questions.,
Meet in other contexts.",How to Get Along with People Who You Don't Like2," People often assume what they see is someone's personality, not a temporary reaction. If you see someone shouting, that is often the result of a bad day, not anger management issues.


Psychologists call this the ""fundamental attribution error"" or ""correspondence bias.""

, People tend to think events are more about themselves than they actually are. If someone is acting stiff or rude, it's often because he's thinking of something else, not trying to offend you. If someone doesn't mention your new haircut, it's usually because he hasn't noticed, not because he wants to make you unhappy.

, Find something good you can say about the other person, and repeat it to yourself or out loud when you start complaining. If you don't know about any positive actions this person has done, compliment her on her clothing or her car. If she talks frequently about a topic, even if it's not one you are interested in, tell her you're impressed by her depth of knowledge on that topic.

, Get to know the other person by asking questions. Stay away from personal topics if you don't know him well, but follow up threads in the conversation by asking more about a person, place, or event that he mentions.

, Some people behave very differently in large groups or energetic environments than they do in one-on-one conversations or in quiet situations. If you would like to give someone another chance, try meeting them in a different context than you normally would. Invite them to a gathering with a different group of friends, or talk to a coworker over lunch in a cafe.

Focus on small goals.,

Create an anti-awkwardness plan.,
Focus on the countdown.,
Deflect requests for online contact.,
Politely ask someone to cease unacceptable behavior.,
Break ties only if necessary.",How to Get Along with People Who You Don't Like3," There are plenty of people that you have to see every week, or at least every holiday, but don't get along with. Remember that your goal is not to befriend these people or get to know them better. Aim for basic, easy goals like these:


Say hello, say goodbye, and not get anyone upset or offended in between.
Don't respond to any of your coworker's offensive statements this week.
Finish the collaborative project without revealing your irritation.

, If you know that someone you dislike will be at a particular event, plan an excuse in advance so you can cut the visit short. Ideally, create a real reason so you can't be caught in a lie. For example, only hire a babysitter for half of the evening, or make plans with a family member so you are ""forced"" to leave early for family reasons.

, If someone tends to cause uncomfortable silences, or talk about offensive topics, have a conversation topic ready in advance. When she joins a conversation, comment on a current event that you read in the news, or mention a popular movie or music you saw recently.


Avoid political news and other controversial topics.

, Remind yourself that you only have to be stuck with this person for a limited amount of time. Count how many minutes you have left, and concentrate on that number if you find yourself getting annoyed or angry.

, If asked for your email address or social media information, claim that you don't check it often (if this is believable). If they do contact you through one of these avenues, don't respond, or respond only after a few days with a short message apologizing for being too busy to reply at the time.

, If someone is intruding in your personal space with unwelcome physical contact, or trying to contact you constantly, politely address the issue. ""I'd appreciate it if you'd stop."" is all you need to say to communicate your boundaries politely.


Use ""I"" statements, such as ""I'm not a fan of hugging,"" and avoid using the word ""you,"" which can sound accusatory.

, If someone's presence in your life is causing serious stress, and the other person isn't picking up on your more subtle cues, try to end the ""friendship."" It's best to do so as politely as possible, and is not recommended for people you work under or are in contact with every day. If you have no other options, tell the other person, ""I'd prefer we didn't spend as much time together.""

Ask yourself if you like your friend.,
Think about how often you have conflicts with your friend.Do you and your friend often have massive, unresolved arguments and misunderstandings?,
Do not tolerate hurtful friends.,
Recognize when you are not important to each other.,
Avoid narcissistic friends.,
Accept that friendships change.People change.",How to Decide when a Friendship Is Over1," Sometimes people who have been in our lives a long time seem to acquire a kind of permanence, such that even after your lives have taken vastly different directions and have little in common, you still find yourself considering the person a friend. If you feel your friendship has become stale or if you don’t feel any particular affection for the individual who you call friend, it is probably time to accept that the friendship’s dead.Evaluate the condition of the friendship. Do you care about your friend? If so, does he or she care about you to an equal or lesser degree? How important is your friendship? Look for signs of a weak or waning friendship.;
, Do you constantly feel disappointed in your friend? Does he or she express similar frustration with or disappointment in you? If so, you should decide to end the friendship.


Friends don’t get along all the time, but you should be able to feel that basically, you and your friend see eye-to-eye most of the time.

, If your friend is constantly criticizing you behind your back (or worse, to your face), it is time to end the friendship. While we do not always get along with our friends, they should, on balance, be kind, thoughtful, and considerate of our feelings. Deciding to end a friendship with individuals who are not is easy.


For instance, if you see a social media message that reads, “is such a dummy. They don’t know anything!” you should not be friends with that person.
Hurtful friends might also share secrets with others who were not meant to know them. For instance, suppose your parents are getting divorced and you told your friend about it and requested that they not share the info with anyone else. The next week, several other people who are not your friends ask you about the situation. In this case, your friend has clearly betrayed your trust and you should rightfully decide to end the friendship.

, If you and your friend do not make time for each other, or only communicate when you see each other at school, at work, or in other convenient social situations, you can safely decide to end the friendship.Friends will make each other a priority, and will be there when the other is in need. Conversely, friends who are not eager to spend time with one another, or who are only around when things are easy, are poor friends. Exchange them for individuals who are more willing to put themselves on the line for you.
You can still be friendly to the other person, but think of them as an acquaintance, rather than a friend.

, Narcissists think they’re the center of the world. If your friend always talks about him or herself and never asks you about your day or what’s going on in your life when you spend time together, he or she is probably a narcissist.At the very least, they clearly don’t value your company. Make the right choice and end the friendship.


A friend who doesn’t apologize after you two have a row is also a narcissist.

, Sometime this is good, and sometimes it is not so good. If you and your friend can change and grow together, and your ideas and attitudes remain in sync, great! However, if you and your friend grow apart, don’t pretend that things are just as they always were. Allowing this “zombie friendship” to continue is futile for both you and your friend.


Your friends do not have to be clones of you, but if you do not share the core values and interests as your friend, then the friendship has little common ground on which to build.

"
"
Confront your friend about the problem.,
Always be direct when dealing with your friend.Tell your friend what’s on your mind if there is a problem that’s bothering you.,
Ask your friend what they want from you.Provide an open forum for your friend to air his or her grievances.",How to Decide when a Friendship Is Over2," If you are considering ending a friendship because of a particular problem or issue you have with your friend, let them know. Real friends will always be honest with each other and address any problems they have with one another directly.


Do not make casual remarks about a problem you want to address with your friend. For instance, if your friend does not listen to you and instead always insists on doing things their way, be assertive and draw attention to situations in which your friend exhibits the negative behavior.
For example, do not say in an ambiguous way, “I’m not sure that I want to go to the farmer’s market.” Instead say, “I already said I didn’t want to go to the farmer’s market. I feel like my opinion is not valued when I am left out of the decision-making process. Let’s try to make a decision about our plans today together.”
Use “I” statements as in the above example, and avoid accusatory “you” statements in the form of “You never listen to me” or “You always ignore my feelings.”, Be honest about how you feel and let your friend know in unambiguous terms what you want.


Do not just ignore your friend and hope that he or she will figure out that you’ve decided to end the friendship. If you do that, your friend might be confused or worried about you. They might involve third parties like a mutual friend or your parents. They might also try to confront you directly at your home or place of work to figure out what you’re feeling or thinking.

, They may or may not pertain to you. For instance, perhaps your friend’s marriage is not going well and they feel that they cannot share it with anyone. Letting your friend know that you are able and willing to listen and empathize can improve the friendship and put your friendship back on the right track.


Sometimes our friends have a hard time just coming out and telling us what they want. Therefore, asking your friend directly if they need anything is an important step in showing you’re committed as a friend and want to build a strong friendship.
For instance, if you think something is amiss with your friend, ask him or her general questions like, “Is everything alright?” If you suspect a specific problem, you might ask, for instance, “How are things with your spouse these days?” A close friend will open up to you and confess they have a problem or are feeling badly.
Some friends have a difficult time talking about their feelings or personal problems, though, and in these cases all you can do is respect their privacy.
Being there for your friends in times of need is what friendship is all about.Remind your friend, “If you ever want to talk about anything, I’m here for you.”

"
"
Be more thoughtful with your friend.,
Forgive your friend.,
Take a break from your friend.Even if you enjoy hanging out with a certain friend, sometimes their expectations and yours are different.",How to Decide when a Friendship Is Over3," If you value your friendship and do not want it to be over, look for simple ways to improve it.Perhaps, for instance, your friend has ditched you and the rest of her friends in order to be with her boyfriend. Even though this is her fault, make an effort to understand her and let her know that you’re still her friend. Invite her to lunch or a shopping trip, and let her know that you miss her company.Of course, improving the relationship should not be a one-sided affair. Look for signs that your friend, too, is putting an effort into maintaining a strong friendship with you. For instance, if your friend agrees to make time to meet up, this indicates that he or she is still interested in a friendship but has, perhaps, been too busy with work and other duties.

, Friendship often means letting bygones be bygones. Is the offense your friend committed totally unforgivable? Or is it something which, in a week or two, will start to lose importance? While a given act or comment might seem truly heinous at the time, take a step back from the situation and try to put your friend’s behavior into a reasonable context.


Do not make excuses for your friend. If they did something wrong, they should admit it and apologize. Friends who do not take responsibility for their actions are not good friends.
Forgiving your friend does not mean forgetting what they did. While it would be wrong to constantly bring up a past sin, you should keep you friend’s bad behavior in the back of your mind at all times and be on the lookout for similar behavior in the future. Their disappointing behavior might be part of a larger pattern.For example, if your friend said they were going to pick you up from school and then never did, you might rightly be upset with them. If they said they were asleep and didn’t hear the alarm clock go off, their behavior might be forgiven as a fluke. However, if they consistently don’t follow through on promises they make, and consistently have a lame excuse, you should be confident in your decision to end the friendship.

, If your friend tries to pressure you into spending all your time with him or her, and does not respect your boundaries, they might be clingy. Clingy friends form unhealthy attachments with others and can be very annoying and difficult to deal with. You don’t have to end your friendship with a friend who is clingy or overbearing, though.


Explain to your friend next time he or she offers to come over, or invites you to hang out, that you are a bit burned out and just want to stay in. Do not reply promptly to texts or messages you receive from a clingy friend, and be firm when announcing your decision to stay in (or go out) alone.Even if your friend is not particularly clingy, you might feel fed up with them for some other reason. If you and your friend are constantly hanging out and doing everything together, or if your friend is just always asking you to hang out, you might start yearning for some privacy and alone time.
Your break from your friend can last as long as you want it to, from one day up through one month or more. Give yourself the space you need.
If your friend does not respect your need for a break, or becomes hostile when you suggest a break, think about ending the friendship altogether. A friend who does not respect your wishes is no friend at all.

Accept that the friendship is over.",How to Decide when a Friendship Is Over4," After deciding the friendship is over, do not let your friend know with an email or text message.The best way to end the friendship is by talking about how you feel and what you want for the future of your friendship in person.


Find a time when you can both meet and ensure that your friend does not have anything planned after your meeting (like going to work or a family gathering), since ending friendships can take an emotional toll.
If you believe your friend might grow hostile or violent, do not meet them in person. Instead, write them a letter or an email explaining that you wish to end the friendship and provide your reasons for doing so.
If your friend refuses to meet you at all, write a letter to your friend expressing how you feel. Write the things you wish you could say to them. You do not have to send the letter, though you certainly can if you think your friend would read it., Explaining to someone that you’ve decided to no longer be their friend can be hard. The circumstances behind the dissolution of each friendship are unique. However, being honest and structuring the inevitable conversation in a logical way can help the process proceed more smoothly.


Open the conversation with an acknowledgment that you have -- at some point -- enjoyed being friends with the individual. For instance, say, “We’ve had some great memories together. Remember when we went camping at Big Bear Lake?” Use happy memories and reminisce together for a few moments.Move slowly into talking about the period in which the friendship started to decline. Frame it as a transition. You might say, “Ever since I started university, I feel that we have been moving apart.” Use passive terminology to avoid placing blame on your friend or yourself. Don’t beat them up verbally.

, Close your conversation with some resolutions. You could say simply, “I no longer feel that our friendship is in either of our best interests. Let’s avoid unnecessary pain and difficulty by ending our friendship amicably.” Shake hands with your friend and wish them well when your meeting has concluded.


Sometimes you can’t end a friendship on a good note. If the other person remains angry, hostile, and bitter about what you think or feel, or does not forgive you, tell them, “I’m sorry you feel that way,” or “I’m sorry I offended you.”Do not, however, compromise on your resolution to end the friendship just because they are angry or hurt.
Remember, you are in charge of your own feelings, not your friend’s. Even if your friend reacts in an immature or childish way, you should not. Stick to the high road.

, If, for whatever reason, you’ve decided to end your friendship, you should not feel guilty. When people grow apart, it is nobody’s fault. If one of your friendships ends, it does not make you a bad friend.


Don’t feel guilty for deciding that a friendship is over just because the friend has few other friends. You have to do what is right for you; sometimes that means deciding a friendship is over.
Try to think about it as an opportunity for you and your friend to make new friends.

, Now that you’ve decided the friendship is over, you have to live with that decision. Think about the good times you’ve had with your friend and understand that friendships -- or relationships of any kind -- can be temporary.People change! Don’t keep yearning for the friendship to fix itself, or wish that you could go back to do things differently.


Don’t try to “fix” or change your friend. Only they can change themselves.While it is normal to feel sad after deciding to end a friendship, you should not obsess over it or let the memory of it cloud your judgment. Remember, the friendship is over for a reason.
If you’re having trouble accepting that your friendship is over, talk to another friend or trusted family member about the situation.
If you and your friend part on a bad note, recognize that you cannot control what happened. Focus instead on your future. You don’t have to forget your friend, but you can’t live in the past.Look at each day as a chance to meet new friends.

Join a club.There are tons of clubs out there catering to interests and hobbies of all sorts.,
Attend a religious service.,
Get to know your coworkers better.,
Join a sports team.",How to Decide when a Friendship Is Over5," Book clubs, astronomy clubs, movie-going clubs... the list goes on. Check social media and sites like Meetup.com for clubs and hobby groups in your area.


If book clubs are your thing, contact your local library. Larger libraries in big cities probably feature multiple book clubs, perhaps catering to particular types of literature. For instance, you might be able to find a history book club, an African-American literature book club, and so on.

, If you believe in a higher power, attend the religious service of your choice. In addition to fulfilling your spiritual needs, attending a religious service can be a great opportunity to meet new people who share your beliefs. Look for local services in your area and find one that’s right for you.Don’t be afraid to try several different churches, mosques, etc. before settling on one. Remember, it’s free to attend, so you should go to as many as you can until you find one you like.

, Becoming friends with your coworkers can make your work life more lively and enjoyable.Invite some coworkers out for drinks or dinner after work one night. Suggest to them, for instance, “Would you guys/gals like to grab a bite after work? I know a great place not far from here.”


Do not tell your coworkers you know a great place that is quite close to your place of employment if you in fact do not.

, There are many opportunities to join sports teams. Whether it’s an informal neighborhood basketball team or a well-organized community soccer team, sports can be a great way to make friends. The bonds built while training, playing, winning, and even losing together can last a lifetime.

Real friends will help you move furniture, ride to the airport with you, and assist you with your homework.
Avoid making too many demands of your friends. If you're in a constant need of help, it might be difficult for people to get close enough to you to consider you a friend.;
, If you're good friends with someone, you'll remain friends with them, regardless of what your plans are. Hanging out together should be enough of a reason to have a good time, and being together should be its own reward. How does your friend react if you decide to change plans? If you were planning on heading out for the night, see if your friend would rather stay home and watch a movie by their self.


If a friend declines your request, that doesn't automatically mean that you lost a friendship, but the way they react can tell you a lot about them. Does your friend react as if your plan is the lamest idea ever? That's a bad sign. Does your friend legitimately want to go to a movie and be a homebody? That's different.

, School friends or acquaintances aren't interested in helping you get through tough times. They're just interested in having friends who are convenient and simple fun on Friday nights. That's not to say that there's not a place for these kinds of friends, but if you're wondering who your true, good friends are, you need to open up and see how they react.


Tell your friend how you're feeling about a date, or about a situation with your family that's stressing you out. Don't expect answers, but if you don't get a sympathetic ear, or if your friend seems annoyed, that's not a great sign.
This is different than gossip. Lots of people like to gossip. That doesn't make them good friends.

, While it's possible to have good friends that don't necessarily mesh with your parents and your siblings, if your friend gets along well with your family, that's a good sign. If your friend enjoys hanging out at your house, and your family enjoys having your friend around, it's a sign that your friend feels comfortable around you, and you can take what they're saying at face value.


Invite a friend over for dinner with your family for an easy and quick way of testing the situation. Make sure to ask your parents first, to make sure it's ok.

, Just got a car in high school, and now you're suddenly ""friends"" with lots of people who didn't give you the time of day before? Often, people will act friendly when they want to get something from you. It's usually best to avoid these types of relationships. Users will flatter you and try to make you feel good with their attention, but won't ever be willing to hang out with you when the circumstances aren't right.


If you've got a friend using you for your car, your Xbox, or your pool, ask them to hang out at another time, or say your car's in the shop. If they cancel, that's a bad sign.

, Sometimes, friendships can suffer from jealousy, especially if the two members are at different points currently. If you and your good friend both made the volleyball team, for example, but you made varsity and your friend didn't, your friendship can start to suffer. But good friends can learn to look past an initial jealousy and put the friendship at the front. Signs of jealousy include:


Your friend never celebrates your accomplishments, or criticizes instead of congratulates
Your friend becomes more distant
You sense a ""negative"" energy
Your friend disappears you when you're struggling and need help

, Anyone who bad-mouths you to other people isn't a friend. If you're getting mixed messages from someone, or if you're picking up that someone is talking about you differently to your face than to other people, that's not a friend.


Talk to your other friends, if you're curious how you're spoken about in private. Good friends will let you know the truth.If anyone bad-mouths you to your face, that's obviously not a friend. Joking around with someone is one thing, but if somebody puts you down and doesn't recognize that it's hurting your feelings, that's not someone who has your friendship in mind.

, If you suspect a friend might be jealous, or two-faced, or using you for something, but can't quite figure it out, sit them down and have a one-on-one talk when you're feeling calm and ask them, point blank, ""Are we friends?""


While it might sound like a weird question, and the person will likely be taken aback, you can follow up with what you've been noticing. ""I've noticed that you only want to hang out when you can use my pool and that you're talking trash about me to other people when I'm not around. That doesn't seem like a friend. What's going on?""
Let people explain themselves. If you don't like what you hear, or if they try to defend behavior that indefensible, that person is not your friend.

, All friends and all friendships are different. A lot of how you're feeling about your friends will be a knee-jerk, gut-decision. If you feel like someone really cares about you, and you feel confident that they're a friend, it's probably because they are. If you even have to wonder, it's probably a sign that they're not.


Ask yourself the test questions, even if you're not sure of the answers, and go with your gut: Would your friend pick you up from the airport at midnight, if you needed it? Would your friend sit through a boring Sunday dinner with your grandparents, just to be a good friend and hang out afterwards? Would your friend be able to celebrate with you, if you won something and she didn't?

, Friends should be around to help hold you up and celebrate the good times with you, and to help get you through the bad times. Anyone who doesn't support you emotionally isn't a friend. Someone is your friend if they:


Compliment you sincerely
Talk favorably about you to others
Seem genuinely excited when you succeed
Empathize with you, when you're having a tough time

, Friendship shouldn't be based on superficial or external things. If someone wants to be your friend because of your car, because of your pool, or because you're the ""cool"" kid in school, they're not your friend. Friends need to support you for who you are as a person. Someone is your friend if they:


Don't pressure you to do things you don't want to do
Don't judge you for opening up
Don't embarrass you, and aren't embarrassed by you
Act the same way around you as around other people
Don't make demands of you

, Friendships aren't all laughs. Good friends are willing to have your best interest in mind, especially if you're the one making the mistake.This can get tricky, because you want friends who will accept you, but also friends who know when you're slipping, and are willing to help you out. Someone is your friend if they:


Politely disagree with you
Don't attack you personally
Have your best interest at heart
Know what you want and what you need

, If your friend always seems distracted when you're together, or like they'd rather be elsewhere, hanging out with other people, that's not a great sign. This can happen to old friends, who you might have known for a long time. But sometimes, something can suddenly change, and the relationship isn't what it once was. Someone is your friend if they:


Stay in touch, even if you're both changing
Make your friendship a priority
Want to hear about the details of your life
Remember past conversations you've had

, Friendships aren't always rosy, but they shouldn't have to feel like work. If you dread the idea of hanging out with someone, or if they seem to resent having to hang out with you, it's probably not a functional friendship anymore. Someone is your friend if they:


Are easy to hang out with
Make you feel relaxed
Don't add to your stress
Don't cause ""drama""

, Unless you're being a real jerk, if you mess up, your friends should forgive you when you apologize sincerely. Friends should be willing to look past what might be minor shortcomings and slip-ups, if they really know you and have your best interest at heart. Someone is your friend if they:


Accept your apologies
Forgive your failures
Don't expect you to be someone you're not
Don't dig up dirt from the past

, If you want to attract good friends, make sure you're being a good friend in turn. It's not enough to expect that all your friends are going to surround you, support you, and listen when you have to talk. If you're not going to bother returning the kindness and the generosity that friendship requires, then go back up through this list and do the same things for your friends that you expect of them. You can then be confident that your friends are real, true, and lasting.

If you don't have a particular person in mind, start your search for a potential partner in places where people who share your hobbies and passions like to hang out. For example, if you're into basketball, check out your community recreation league. If sustainable farming is your thing, try your local farmer's market.


Humans are visually stimulated creatures, but resist the urge to judge a potential partner based solely on his or her appearance.
It's important that you're attracted to your partner, but don't let your ideal physical traits overshadow the search for a partner with a beautiful personality.;
, If a potential partner is frequently fighting with their friends and family, this could be a warning sign that s/he isn't ready for a mature relationship where communication and problem-solving are key.


Also notice if s/he acts differently toward you when other people are around. If your potential partner pays particular attention to you, it's a green light to spark up a relationship.
If you feel ignored when in a group of people, s/he could be embarrassed to publicly acknowledge your budding relationship or want to appear single. Be careful, this is a warning sign that someone isn't ready for a mature relationship.

, With text messaging and facebook at your disposal, you may be inclined to disclose your intense feelings right when you feel them. Take the old fashioned route and let the relationship develop before texting your paramour a love confession at two o'clock in the morning.

, Don't assume a monogamous relationship or attempt to justify your singleness without talking to your partner.

, When you're in a serious relationship, your partner's friends and family usually become an extension of your friends and family. Make the effort to get to know them and earn their respect.

, This way, you can clearly communicate your expectations and avoid feeling disappointed or disrespected if your partner isn't acting a certain way.


Discuss your sexual desires and needs. The sexual aspect of a relationship is important for many, and less important for some. Let your partner know what your expectations and limitations are to avoid feeling ignored or disrespected.
Discuss your emotional desires and needs. Let your partner know what sort of affection you expect and when you expect to be consulted on an issue.

, Show a genuine interest in and concern for your partner's life by asking about the little things like how his/her day was, as well as bigger things like past experiences and future goals.

, A mature relationship requires total openness and honesty.


If you're uncomfortable about or jealous of your partner's relationship with another person, voice your concerns.
Don't hold in your feelings as this usually leads to passive aggressive behavior that can spark an argument. Deal with the problem when it arises to avoid big blow-ups in the long run.
Most couples will get into an argument at some point during a relationship, but avoid hurting your partner by calmly talking the issue out rather than screaming at each other.

, Support your lover in their pursuits, whether they be academic, professional or personal.


Don't change yourself or abandon your personal goals for your partner, and don't expect them to change for you. You will have to adapt and meet each other halfway sometimes, but don't let your passions take a back seat to theirs.
Accept traits that you see as flaws. While you might not be able to overlook your partner's Republican enthusiasm if you're a die-hard Democrat, be forgiving of smaller flaws such as a bad nail-biting habit or the way s/he squeezes the toothpaste tube.

, If your lover is having a hard time with his/her family and friends, or is simply stressed out by an upcoming test, let s/he know you are there to help.


Listen to your partner. Instead of immediately offering suggestions concerning how to solve a problem, first listen to what your partner is saying.
Let him or her know you care. Make sure to follow up with your lover if they tell you about something that has been bothering them. Ask questions about how things are going in the aspect of their life that has been troubling them.
Offer to help solve the problem and come up with strategies to quell the issue at hand. Make sure not to belittle your partner by telling him or her that their problem ""isn't a big deal,"" even if that's how you feel.

, Even if you've mastered the suggestions above and your relationship is thriving, couples often get into such a comfortable routine that the passionate flame can start to dim.


It's great to have the same interests and hobbies as your partner, but make sure to reserve time for yourself, especially if you live with your beau.
Establish a regular ""girls night"" or make room for ""bro time"" to keep in touch with friends and avoid becoming a homebody.

, Even though you and your partner are comfortably settled in, always pay attention to the little things.


A gift of chocolate and flowers or a random home-cooked meal are always appreciated and can keep the initial passion burning.
Experience new things together. If you've both always wanted to go sky diving or simply to try a different style of cuisine than you normally eat, do it together! Sharing exciting experiences helps you keep your relationship interesting.

, Between you and your partner's busy schedules, it can be difficult to find time for romance. Establish one night a week as your ""date night"" and treat yourselves to a romantic night out or a candle-lit homemade meal.

",How to Deal With Threatening Parents of Ex Best Friends," While some parents go wrong in involvement, keep in mind that some may have the right intentions. Did you break up over something trivial? Are you still not sure whether or not you want to be friends? Or, may it be better to forgive, forget and move on?;
, It's possible your ex-friend did go wrong and now, his/her parents simply want the best and support him/her. Maturely talk to your own parents, as it is unwise to attempt handling this alone. Tell them about the fight and why you cannot be friends, and about parental involvement.

, They can explain something along the lines of, ""Without wishing to get involved in whatever happened, I would just like to say I believe our kids are old enough to make their own decisions, and if they don't want to be friends, then we need not get involved."" Having a parent on your side can strengthen your case.

, Often, in such cases, the parent of the ex-friend can be very scary to you, and appear threatening. Keep a calm mind and remember that they likely will stop.

, Sometimes, the parent(s) of the person you just broke up with can go crazy and take it to a new step. They may start coming into school and talking to you, threatening you, etc. Don't get your parents to do this as well, it will only worsen the situation. Calmly tell this parent, ""I am really not interested in being friends. Please stop harassing me.""

, If this person seems threatening, take all precautions and stay in well-populated areas of the school. Let your teachers and principal know about the problem, and make sure to tell your parents.

Instead, try to find out what is going on in your friend’s life that may be causing him or her to behave in selfish ways.


For example, you might say something like, “I have noticed that you have been having a hard time engaging in conversations lately. What’s going on?” Or, “You seem really wrapped up in the bad things that have been happening in your life. I think it might help if you talk to someone who can help.”
If your friend indicates that she is depressed or that she is dealing with other serious issues, then encourage your friend to seek help. Advise your friend to talk to a school counselor or a therapist.;
, What does your friend do that irritates you? Does she say negative things to you, constantly demand your attention, or talk only about herself without stopping? Get a good handle on exactly what it is that bothers you about your friend.Some friends constantly ask for help but never give any in return. In this case, the issue is that the person is trying to take more from the relationship than he or she is giving, leaving it one-sided.
Other friends may talk about themselves all the time but never ask how you are. Many people are guilty of this, but sometimes friends take it to the extreme. In this case, the problem is also the one-sidedness of the relationship. Your friend may want you to listen to her, but she may not listen to you in return.
Another type of selfishness is constant attention seeking. Some friends may constantly text or call you, trying to get you to hang out or talk. This kind of relationship turns irritating quickly, and the problem is that the friend does not respect your need for alone-time.

, The underlying problems of selfishness may give you a little something to go on when talking to the person. You may also be able to develop a little more empathy for your friend if you consider why he or she may be acting in selfish ways.


People who are extremely selfish or self-centered may be insecure or distressed. Many selfish people look for attention or try to get others to think about them because they have a negative self-image.
Upbringing may also have a lot to do with selfishness. Your friend may be used to a lot of attention from her parents, so she may expect it from everyone else. Or, your friend may not have gotten much attention at all as a child, and now she may be desperate for attention from others., Selfishness is a normal human behavior and we are all guilty of it sometimes. Think about times that you’ve been selfish to get some perspective. You may have been selfish unintentionally and hurt others' feelings. Think about whether you've ever been guilty of some of the same offenses as your friend.For example, have you ever interrupted someone during a conversation? Or have you ever gotten bored when someone else was talking and started thinking about a problem of your own? Try to think of examples of times when you have been selfish as a reminder that everyone is selfish sometimes.

, The most important thing to do to change someone’s behavior is to talk about it. Make plans to talk to your friend, and make sure the setting is private and quiet. Your friend may be upset with you when you say how you feel, so a public place may not be the best idea.


Pick a time when you'll have enough time to talk. You'll want this conversation to be an in-depth one, so you'll want to make sure you have enough time to get all of your thoughts out. Try to schedule an hour-long block.
Choose a place with privacy. This could be either one of your homes, or an open air space where not many people gather. Try a quiet park or another quiet area.
Avoid restaurants, shops or bars. While these are normal places to meet up, it may be hard to talk about personal issues when you're surrounded by many people. Also, if your friend reacts poorly, it may become embarrassing if too many people are around.

, Stay respectful and positive, and let your friend know that your relationship is alright but needs some work. You'll want to be direct and explain the issues as clearly as possible.For a friend who asks too many favors, say: “It’s really bothered me lately that you expect so much of me, but you don’t give me much in return. ” Don't use negative language like ""I'm sick of your selfishness,"" or ""I hate how many favors you ask of me.""
For a friend who talks about herself constantly, say: ""You spend a lot of time talking about your feelings, but you never have much time to listen to me talk."" Again, avoid negative language that places the blame all on your friend. Don't say: ""I hate how much you talk about yourself. It's so annoying.""
With a friend who often asks for your help dealing with crises, say: ""I know you've had some trouble recently with situations, but it's difficult for me to keep helping you out. You're a great friend, but I feel like I'm doing too much work."" Don't say things like: ""You can't get your life together, and it's really irritating. I can't keep helping you out every time you mess up.""

, Selfish people spend most of their time thinking about themselves, and hardly the feelings of others. If you speak directly about how their selfishness makes you feel, it will be a chance to get through to them about their negative behavior.For a friend who often asks for money, talk about how this behavior makes you feel. It might make you feel like they don't value the hard work that you do for your money. It also might make you feel as if your friend only wants you in her life because you have money, and not because you are a good friend or a good person to be around.
For a friend that constantly complains but has no time for your problems, talk about how you feel less important in the relationship. Talk about how your relationship feels one-sided, and how it makes you feel as if your friend does not value your problems or your issues.
Some friends may spend time at your house and make messes that they don't clean up. Talk to this kind of friend about how you feel frustrated when they don't pitch in, and about how you feel sad that they never offer to help clean up a mess that they've made. However, keep in mind that this may not be due to selfishness. This might be due to growing up in an environment where making messes and not cleaning up is acceptable.

, If you are respectful and kind while talking, most likely your friend will offer an apology or give some reasons about why she has been selfish. Make sure to listen closely to the reasons that your friend gives, and try to understand how he or she is feeling.


If your friend says that she never realized how bad her behavior was, you're on the right track. Many selfish people behave poorly and never notice the outcome of their actions. If you've shed light on the problem for your friend and she seems eager to repair the friendship, then you'll be able to work out a plan.
If your friend gives excuses, try to be understanding. Many people are greatly affected by problems in their lives, and they cannot see outside of their problems, which often affects their friendships. If the problems are large, like a bad breakup or a death in the family, you'll have to be patient with your friend until she’s in a better frame of mind.
If your friend seems uninterested in your concerns, it's not a good sign. Many selfish people, when confronted with their flaws, are unable to see the problems with their behavior. Your friend may not see a need to change, and it's unlikely that she ever will. You may need to end this type of friendship.

, If your friend values your role in her life, she should agree to start making some changes. Make sure that you are specific about the types of behavior that you would like your friend to work on.


For example, if you are tired of you friend talking all of the time and not listening to you, then you might request that your friend make more of an effort to listen when you are talking.

, If your friend starts falling back into her old behavior, make sure that you say something about it. Say something to your friend each time it happens. Let your friend know how the behavior makes you feel, and remind her that she agreed not to work on it.If your friend shows selfishness by constantly demanding attention, let her know when she is doing it. If she asks you to change your plans with others constantly, or she texts you incessantly, stop the conversation and tell her that she’s falling back into her old ways.
Say, for another example, a selfish person in your life spends too much money on herself and is always asking you for money. If she has promised you that she will change but asks for money again the next week, remind her of the promise that she made to you. Hopefully she will realize her mistake and learn not to make it again.

, Many people behave in selfish ways because other people let it happen. If a person asks for excessive favors or talks about herself without stopping, stop the behavior right away. Don’t allow the person to walk all over you.


Say, for example, a friend often invites you out for coffee to talk for an hour about her problems. You're used to this kind of invitation, so if you receive one, you know how it will go. The next time she invites you out, say no. You could also say yes, and then change the direction of the conversation over coffee to what's going on in your life.
If your friend is always looking for sympathy, stop giving it to her. Many people like to complain, and don't seem to do anything else. The next time the person asks if you feel bad for her, say no. Instead, try to offer solutions or help your friend see the positive side of the situation. Or, you can list ways for your friend to be grateful for his or her life. You can end the conversation on a positive note, like, ""So, why would I feel bad for you? You have a lot going for you.""

, If a selfish person treats you poorly, it’s not because you’re not worth being treated well. Selfish people ignore their friends or neglect their obligations because they only think of themselves, and this has nothing to do you or your value as a person. Don’t let your friend’s behavior get to you or make you feel bad about yourself., Spend some time thinking about whether the person has been truly committed to changing. Often, you will see immediate changes because the person is embarrassed and had never realized that she was selfish. Other times, changes will be slower, but you’ll see your friend taking small steps to change. Try to stay patient.


Talk to your friend every few days. See if they're doing better in their personal lives, or whether they're holding up their promise to be less selfish.
Hang out. Hanging out with your friend will be the best way to tell if their behavior is changing. Spend time together as you normally would, and see if your friendship feels different or improved.
Talk to mutual friends. See if your friends promise has bled over into their other relationships. Other mutual friends may see an improvement in your friends behavior, or they may see the same old selfish actions. Talk to them about whether they've noticed a difference.

, If the person’s behavior is truly intolerable, take a break from being around them. Selfish behavior is draining to those on the receiving end, and you deserve better. Whether it’s just one day alone or a whole week without seeing them, spends some time to yourself. They may even “get a taste of their own medicine” if they’re the type of selfish person who ignores you., If you’ve been patient and tried to help the person as much as possible without seeing any results, it might be time to end your friendship. While it’s hard to do, toxic and negative people deserve no part in your life. Politely tell your friend that you can no longer see each other, and hold to your promise."

Look into any differences between how you love each person.,
Think about your needs and wants.,
Consider your take on emotional monogamy.",How to Handle Being In Love With Two People1," If you find yourself in love with two people, these people may be meeting different emotional needs. Identifying the different reasons you love each person can help you figure out how to move forward.What do you get from each person? Your current boyfriend may bring you stability, but your love for him may feel like friendship love. You may have passion for another person that's missing from your current relationship.
If you're experiencing two different types of love, there are ways to navigate this. At the beginning of a relationship, you may be more passionate about someone. If you're feeling passion for someone new, you can limit your contact with that person to conversation, for example. You can learn new things about someone and allow yourself to experience the emotional infatuation of a romance while staying physically faithful to your current partner.
However, be careful. You should be comfortable letting both parties know what is going on. If you're hiding something from your partner, you may be having an emotional affair.;
, Our culture tends to value monogamy, both emotionally and physically. However, you may want and need different things out of a relationship. Only you can define what you want and need from romantic relationships. You need to know what that is before you can move forward.Do you feel you need to be emotionally invested in one person at a time? Some people only want to focus on one person at once. Many people find their capacity for love - romantic or otherwise - is not finite.
Think about how loving two people makes you feel. Do you feel exhausted by it, or invigorated? Is it something you feel guilty about, or do you feel comfortable with the fact you love two different people?
Identify what you need. Do you need a relationship with only a single person, or are you open to loving two people at once?

, For some people, love has to be monogamous to work. You may need to be loyal to one person on an emotional level as well as a physical one. For others, emotional monogamy is not necessary. You can be physically faithful to one person, but have feelings for people outside of your relationship. Think about your feelings on the subject, and whether you're okay being in love with two people.For some, the ability to love one person at a time is vital to a happy relationship. Some people feel you cannot truly fall in love with two people, as love requires you have an intimate connection with only a single person. Not everyone shares this sentiment. If you are in love with two people, you may able to have an intimate connection with two people that is equally deep and meaningful.
You may not believe love has a finite value. If this is the case, monogamy may not be in your best interest. Consider pursuing a relationship with both parties at the same time, keeping your expectations open. Dating casually can allow you to explore your options. You may eventually settle on one person.

Consider whether you're having an emotional affair.,
Evaluate whether your feelings for your partner are waning.,
Discuss your feelings with a therapist.,
Talk to your partner, if you feel comfortable doing so.,
Cope with an emotional affair.",How to Handle Being In Love With Two People2," If you're currently in a relationship, loving two people can pose problems. If you and your partner have not agreed to an open relationship, being in love with another person can constitute an emotional affair. This can cause feelings of pain and betrayal for your current partner. Look for any signs you're having an emotional affair.You may feel the need to justify your behavior due to latent guilt. You may, for example, need to reassure yourself constantly you and this person are ""just friends"" or think of justifications for spending time with this person.
You may also feel the need to cover your tracks. If you're hiding something from your partner, you may be doing something wrong. You may, for example, delete text message or lie to your partner about spending time with the other person.
Do you obsessively think or daydream about this person? Do you feel excitement when you know you get to see this person? If so, that's definitely a sign it's emotional infidelity.

, If you're in love with two different people, this may be a warning sign about your current relationship. If you're traditionally only able to love one person at a time, you may be falling out of love with your current partner.How happy are you in your current relationship? If there have been problems for awhile, your attachment to another person may be a warning sign. Do you complain about your partner to this person? Do you share details about your relationship problems you would withhold from others?
Do you find yourself comparing this person to your partner? You may find this new person has qualities you feel your partner lacks. Is this person very different from your current partner? If so, you may be latching onto someone completely different because your current relationship is not working.

, If you're struggling with feelings for someone else, a therapist can be helpful. If your partner expects emotional fidelity, loving another person is a problem. A therapist can help you figure out how to sort through your feelings and proceed in your relationship.


If you're not currently seeing a therapist, you can get a referral for one through your regular doctor. You can also see what therapists are covered under your insurance network. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your school.
If you believe your relationship is in serious trouble due to outside feelings, consider seeing a couples counselor with your partner to discuss these issues.

, In some cases, you may want to talk to your partner about how you're feeling. If you believe your feelings are a threat to your current relationship, you should have a sit down talk to your partner about how to proceed.Pick the right time to talk and eliminate distractions when you have the discussion. Make sure you turn off phones and computers. You should also strive to talk at a time when neither you nor your partner have outside commitments.
Have empathy. It can be painful for your partner to hear you're in love with someone else, and you don't want to minimize his or her pain. Allow your partner to feel what he or she is feeling. For example, don't say something like, ""Lots of people have been where you've been and have gotten over it."" This may come off as dismissive.
Form a game plan together. You may decide it's best to end the relationship, or to open up the relationship. Your partner may want you to lessen contact with the other party to salvage things. Whatever you decide, make sure you set clear boundaries both you and your partner agree to and fully understand.

, If you had an emotional affair, you need to take time to heal. It can be difficult to come to terms with the fact you were unfaithful, even if it was not physical. You want to give yourself time to let the affair go, and focus on your current partner over the other person.Try to schedule times to think about the other person. It may sound strange, but it can actually be helpful to daydream and obsess about the object of your affection for a set time each day. Trying to never think about this person may backfire. If you give yourself a little leeway once a day, it may help you get over this person longterm.
Allow yourself time to grieve the relationship. A non-physical relationship can be as intimate and close as a physical one. It will take you some time to feel better about ending the affair. It's normal to miss the person in the aftermath. Try to keep busy and surround yourself with friends.
Invest in your current relationship. If you've made the choice to stay with your current partner, you need to spend time repairing any damage done by the emotional affair. Spend a lot of one-on-one time with your partner. Try to become physically intimate through sex, cuddling, and touch. Remind yourself why you fell in love with your partner to begin with, and why your relationship is worth it.

Make a choice.,
Let the person you did not choose know you want to talk.,
Break things off in a clear fashion.,
Give a specific reason, if you feel comfortable.,
Move forward with the other person.",How to Handle Being In Love With Two People3," If you're not currently involved with someone monogamously, you may be dating two people at once. You may have feelings of love for both people, but want a monogamous relationship. Figure out which party to choose. There are several factors you can use to decide who is best for you.Think about your goals. Compatible romantic partners have similar goals and values. Choose the person whose goals more closely align with yours. You and this person should have similar moral values, and want similar things for the future.
Think about how much each person influences you. In a romantic relationship, you are heavily influenced by another person. You'll find yourself adopting their tastes and interests. If you find one person influences your personality more, that person may be right for you.
You should also consider your feelings for someone. People tend to feel more infatuated with compatible romantic matches. You may find yourself putting one person on more of pedestal. You may play up one person's good qualities slightly more.

, If you make a choice, you should let the other party know. It's best to have the conversation face-to-face, if you feel comfortable doing so, so give the person a head's up you would like to have a serous discussion.For example, you could send a text that says something like, ""Hey, there's something that's been on my mind. I would really like to talk to you as soon as possible. Are you free for coffee tomorrow?""

, You want to end things in a clean fashion. Do not leave any ambiguity in the breakup. Make sure you state things are over on no uncertain terms. For example, ""I've decided I want to end the romantic portion of our relationship.""Avoid phrases like, ""I think we should..."" and ""I feel..."" Such statements can make you sound uncertain.

, Many people crave closure after a breakup. If you feel comfortable giving a reason, do so. However, it can get tricky when you're leaving for someone else. If you feel like this information would be best left out, give other reasons that contributed to you choosing the other person without explicitly mentioning there's someone else.If you feel comfortable mentioning the other person, say something like, ""As you know, I've also been dating Ryan. While I value the time you and I have spent together, I think Ryan is a more compatible match for me longterm. I would like to start seeing him exclusively.""
For many reasons, you may rather leave the other person out. Instead of explicitly mentioning you've chosen someone else, mention the factors that contributed to your choice. For example, ""I just feel like, longterm, we don't have the same goals and values. I think we would both be better off with someone who's on the same path.""

, Once you've broken up with the other party, move forward. Work on establishing a new relationship with someone you love. You may have some lingering feelings for the other person, but limit contact with that person as you focus on your new romance. With time and distance, those feelings will fade.

Learn about polyamory.,
Set clear boundaries.,
Ease into any new rules in a relationship slowly.,
Keep communication open as you move on.",How to Handle Being In Love With Two People4," Polyamorous people are open to having multiple romantic relationships at once, as long as all parties consent to this kind of romance. Many people find they are polyamorous, and try to date people who are okay with open or semi-open relationships.People who are polyamorous do not feel monogamy is necessary to a happy and fulfilling relationship. Polyamory is not a choice. A lot of it depends on your emotional comfort level and your feelings about love and romance. If you're able to be in love with two people at the same time, you may be polyamorous.
There are many ways to figure out if you're polyamorous. Look back on your relationships. Are you able to be fulfilled by a single person, or do you frequently find yourself craving love and sex outside of your relationship? If it's the latter, you may be polyamorous. If you feel capable of being in love with and committed to two people at once, you may be polyamorous.
There is some stigma against polyamory, but work to shut that out. Remember, when it comes to relationships, one size does not fit all. If you are polyamorous, you should feel comfortable exploring your feelings on the subject without feeling guilt.

, Boundaries are always important in a relationship, and especially so if you're in love with two people. Make sure all parties involved know the rules for the given situation, and that everyone is comfortable with the game plan.If you're looking into an open or semi-open relationship, make sure everyone knows what is and is not okay. Are you allowed to be physically intimate with both parties? Can your partners pursue relationships outside of their romance with you? Should one party be prioritized over the other? These are questions you need to ask when proceeding with an open relationship.
If your current partner does not want a completely open relationship, he or she may want you to taper off contact with the other person. If this is the case, make sure you know the kind of contact you're allowed to have and what sorts of contact violate your partner's trust.

, If you want to have an open relationship with someone, you should ease into the new routine. Transitioning from monogamy to polyamory can be difficult. There's no reason to rush the transition.If your partner is comfortable with you pursuing outside relationships, consider whether you should do so right away. There is no reason to rush polyamory. You may want to give both you and your partner time to adjust to the idea of an open relationship before either of you act on it.
Expect some tension. Polyamorous or open relationships can be healthy and loving. This does not mean that, in the beginning, things will not feel somewhat messy. Keep things open in regards to communication. Be willing to compromise and smooth over any differences that arise.

, However you decide to proceed, you and your partner should keep communication open. Talk to your partner regularly about your feelings. If you're seeing two people at once, let both parties know if your feelings regarding them change at any point in the future.


If being in love with two people is causing a lot of tension in a relationship, you can talk to a couples counselor. A qualified counselor can help you and your partner figure out better ways to communicate.

Cultivate open communications.,
Be non-judgmental.,
Be curious about how your boyfriend thinks and feels.,
Have fun, silly conversations.",How to Have a Deep Connection With Your Boyfriend1," Share intimate thoughts, dreams, and ideas together. Tell him about the dreams that drive you and the hopes you hold for the future, including a future with him.Try to spend a few minutes every day talking about personal subjects like serious hopes, dreams, and fears.Encourage him to share as well, but don't try to force him to verbalize his thoughts or feelings.
Don’t just assume that he can read your mind, or that you can read his.
Try asking, ""Where do you see yourself in five years? What are some of the most important things you want to accomplish in life? What values drive you most and motivate your actions?"";
, Create a safe, non-judgmental atmosphere. You cannot get to know another person well without listening unconditionally and standing in the other person's shoes. Try to understand his perspective, and encourage him to be comfortable with sharing without any fear of looking silly or foolish.


Reassure him that he can be himself around you without having to impress you. Tell him you appreciate him for who he is.
Understand that many societies have definitions of masculinity that discourage sharing fears and intimate emotions. Know that men often want to fix problems rather than share their own.Try saying, ""You know you can confide in me and I won't judge you. We've been together a pretty long time now, and I love you unconditionally. You should never feel embarrassed about having fears or doubts - you'll probably find that I share them!""

, Find joy in continuously learning about your boyfriend. Actively show him that you’re invested in his interior life, and want to know more about what makes him who he is. Think of questions you can ask him that will reveal things you don’t know.Try asking, “What was the happiest moment of your childhood? What was the most difficult part of growing up?”Ask him, “Who’s been the most important influence of your life? Why?”
Ask, “What are your most important values? Why do you hold those values so dear, and how do they inform your actions?”
Be sure to ask, “What are the things you look for in a partner? How can I be a better partner to you?”

, While you shouldn’t avoid serious topics, and should have a good daily talk, don’t make your communications in general too serious. It’s equally important to have silly talks that engage your imaginations. Incorporating fresh, light discussions where less is at stake can also keep communicating from becoming a chore.Talk about each other’s days, especially about silly things you came across while going about your days. Mention funny things you saw on while out and about, or silly things you came across online.
Ask him lighthearted questions that will still help you to get to know each other. Consider asking, “If you could be any cartoon character who would you be?” or “If you could have any superpower which would you choose?”
Use humor and laughter to keep things fresh: having funny conversations and joking around with each other can help you both look forward to communicating with the other."

Know yourself and your emotions.,
Pay attention to emotions on the surface.,
Look and listen for emotions your boyfriend doesn’t express.,
Reestablish emotional connections as soon as you can.,
Find creative ways to put your feelings into actions.,
Have fun together.,
Spend quality time together.",How to Have a Deep Connection With Your Boyfriend2," To build a deep emotional bond with another person, it’s important to understand and accept your own emotions. It can be tempting and easy to brush off an emotion, or to deny yourself from experiencing a powerful emotion. However, you should take the time to process an emotion, and use reason to understand the experience.Be emotionally honest with yourself and try to understand how you emotionally respond to different situations.
When you’re feeling emotional, ask yourself, “What emotion am I feeling right now?” Name it: say, for example, “This is anger that I’m feeling. I’m feeling angry because I don’t think my boyfriend is listening to me right now.”
Reasoning through your own emotional experiences can help you avoid emotional suppression and help you better understand another person’s emotions.

, Learn to observe the emotions that he chooses to display on the surface. Once you’ve built a safe and comfortable space for communicating, you should both become more confident in sharing your emotions. This means you’ll both emote positively and negatively, so it’s important to for you both to respond openly to both ends of your emotional ranges.Don’t be threatened if he’s had a bad day and is visibly angry or upset. Try not to take it personally, but do your best to be someone he can vent to or give him space to decompress if he needs it.
Try to help the other understand your surface level emotions better. Say, “Hey, when I get home from work I’m usually pretty cranky, and I’m really sorry in advance if I seem short,” or “Babe, Wednesdays are my long days at school, and I just want to let you know that when I get out of my last class a big hug would go a long way.”

, As you get to know your boyfriend better, cultivate your own sense of empathy so you can anticipate his emotional needs. Listen to your boyfriend attentively, and hear the things he doesn't say as much as the things he does. It’s difficult and takes time, but learn to recognize how your boyfriend emotes. If he freaks out about something, learn to see how it connects to a deeper emotion. For example, maybe he seems hypersensitive about having his own space and gets upset when you rearrange his stuff. Don’t jump to the conclusion that he must be hiding something, but try to see things from his perspective.
Does he have siblings? Maybe he never had his own space when he was younger having his own room, apartment, or other personal space is important to his sense of individuality.
Try to look beyond the surface and see how his actions express deeper emotions, then try to convey to him that you understand and support his emotional life. Say, “I totally get that you need your space. Gosh, you grew up with two brothers, and you’re all only a couple years apart in age. You must not have had much space of your own, so it’s important to me that you’re comfortable now.”

, Every relationship has ups and downs, and we all lose touch with our partners sometimes. When you and your boyfriend find yourselves going through a patch of emotional distance, try to resolve it as soon as you can. Try not to force him to talk if he doesn’t want to, but do your best to reestablish an emotional bond before too much time passes.If you’re fighting, don’t use emotional disconnection as a weapon. If you feel that he is disengaging emotionally as a fighting tool, call him out on it. Tell him that you respect his need to have his own space, but that you’d like to set a time in the next couple days to talk about how you’re both feeling.
Say, “I know that we’re not on the best terms right now, but I’d like us to make time to talk about how we’re both feeling. I care about how you’re feeling, and really hope you care about my feelings. Let’s try to talk this out so we can understand this situation and each other’s reactions a little better.”Check in a day or two after you have resolved an argument. For example, you might say something like, “I know we talked about this, but I just wanted to make sure that everything was settled and you don't have any residual feelings about _____.”

, Try not to confuse emotional intimacy with physical intimacy, and don’t let sex be the only way you translate your emotions into actions. Find more interesting ways to show how you feel other than just being physical.Do nice things for each other as often as possible.


For example, you might make a special dinner for each other on a Saturday night, start a hobby together, or spend one evening giving each other back massages. Learn and do the little things that bring you both joy.
Let physical intimacy complement and express your emotional lives, rather than have your emotions be dependent on sex.
Talk openly about your sex life, about ways to keep things interesting, and make sure to set time aside to be physically intimate, while not letting it control your relationship., In addition to doing special things together, try to have fun together as often as possible. Find out what you both enjoy doing, and pursue those activities together.


If you both enjoy going to the movies, make a weekly or bi-weekly movie date. Or stay in and rent or stream a movie. Take some time to talk about your tastes in movies.
If you have fun doing different things, take turns doing those activities. If you love ice skating but your partner can't skate, go on a skating trip and try to teach him. Then, the next week, do something that they think is fun and try to learn more about it.

, Try to make the most of the time you spend together. When you're hanging out with one another, do your best to include meaningful conversations about your emotions and any concerns you might be feeling on that particular day.


Try to schedule time on neutral ground, or at places away from your respective homes or the home you might share. This is as simple as going for a walk or grabbing a coffee.
It's great to do work or other necessary tasks when you're together, but try to dedicate a significant amount of time every week to focus on your partner. Keep a regular date night, go on daily walks, or play board games. Do activities that don't require too much concentration, so you can incorporate a quality conversation. Try to take pleasure in learning more about each other every time you spend time together.

Imagine what a deep, spiritual connection looks like.,
Practice your shared values.,
Try not to change each other.,
Discuss the future as a couple.",How to Have a Deep Connection With Your Boyfriend3," You should each take time to visualize what a deeper connection means to you. Make lists of key images and words. Know what the other's key relationship values are.Imagine the healthiest, most ideal couple: what do they do that makes them your idea of a perfect couple? How do they discuss problems and celebrate success? How to they touch one another? Visualize even smallest details, like how close they stand to each other or what it looks like when they laugh together.
Share these images with your boyfriend, and have him tell you what his ideal couple looks like. Identify where your ideal deep connections overlap, and look for what they share in common.
Discuss ways to make each other’s visions into reality, including both small and large concerns. For example, if you both imagine an ideal couple holding hands when walking down the street, then make an effort to hold hands more.
Let the differences between your imagined ideal couples inform and enlighten you. Consider that love might look different than how you imagined. Take this exercise as a lesson in being surprised and open to love as it unfolds., Identify the philosophies or beliefs you both hold dear. Learn these commitments inside and out as you come to know each other better, build an emotional life together, and begin to bring your goals and dreams into alignment. Find ways of engaging and nurturing your shared beliefs and values.If you participate in the same religion, go to services together and find ways to nurture your relationship through practicing that religion.
Consider meditating together, going on retreats or pilgrimages together, or pursuing any other spiritual activities.

, While it’s great if you and your boyfriend share similar outlooks, it’s okay if you have some beliefs that don’t completely overlap. Try to find ways to enhance each other’s spiritual beliefs, rather than try to change the way the other sees the world. If you’ve built healthy communications, created a robust emotional life together, and have laid the groundwork of a deep connection, chances are that you would have found out by now whether or not you’re spiritually compatible.


Being spiritually compatible in no way requires you to hold identical beliefs. It means that you can enhance each other and help each other become better people because your values and beliefs are in harmony, even if they’re not the same.
If you don’t participate in an organized religion but both have spiritual beliefs about the natural world, nurture your bond by deepening your connection to the natural world. Go on hikes together, travel, or pursue other means of witnessing the beauty of nature.
Find associations between these experiences and each other, and use memories of these times to deepen your feelings for each other., When you feel that you are close enough to think about sharing the future together, start talking about it as a couple. Imagine how the two of you can bring your lives together into shared goals, hopes, and values. Visualize where you see yourselves living, working, traveling, and having children.


Ask, ""What are you goals in life? What kind of job do you want to end up with? What kind of a house do you want and where do you see yourself living? Do you want a family?""
Be sure to discuss the possibility of children, and sooner rather than later is best as you and your boyfriend become more serious. Ask how many children, if any, your partner is interested in having. Being compatible on this issue is important and is something that will cement a deep connection.

Assess the remarks.,
Decide if you want to let it go or speak up.,
React to the remarks based on your judgement.",How to Deal with Insensitive Remarks from Friends1," Start by taking a moment to assess the remarks that have been made as well as how and when the remarks were made. The type of remarks made may affect how you respond to them. If the remarks are made about you personally, for example, you may more compelled to respond.For example, your friends may have said insensitive remarks about a person’s race, gender, or class that you know personally. Or they may have made insensitive remarks about a group of people that you do not know personally.
Keeping the method in which they were delivered — such as in a Facebook post versus in person — can later help you decide how you wish to respond to the remarks.;
, Once you have assessed the remarks, make the decision to let the remarks go or speak up about how they make you feel. Think about your level of comfort with your friends and whether you are emotionally able to respond to their comments. Decide if speaking up is important to you or if you would prefer to let the remark go.There may also be other factors like who you are around when the remarks are said. If the insensitive remarks are made in front of others who may also be offended, you may decide to speak up because you will have others who will support you.
If the insensitive remarks are said in the workplace, for example, you may feel more of a responsibility to speak up based on the fact that the remarks are unprofessional and may upset others.
If the insensitive remarks are said around young people or children, you may feel it is important to speak up because you want to be a good role model and not make it seem like insensitive remarks are okay.
If the person making the remark is much younger than you are, you may be tempted to let it go based on their age and inexperience, but it's actually better to address it right away. Generally, the earlier the person is made aware of their insensitive remarks, the better chance they have of being open to learning about empathy, compassion, and considering other view points.

, Think about whether you are able to respond to the remarks in the moment, in front of your friends. If you think you will react emotionally and not from a clear, logical place, you might want to wait until you have had time to calm down and think through your response. Or you may decide to let the remarks go and speak up the next time they are said.You may also decide to address the remarks later, after you have had time to think about your response. You may have a response that is more calm and clear if you take some time to process the remarks and avoid getting drawn into an emotional argument in which you might say something you regret.
It is also possible you will be so shocked in the moment you won't know how to react, or you won't realize until later the full gravity of their remark.

Don't fall for the image.,
Act unimpressed.,
Stage an intervention.,
Set boundaries.,
Encourage empathy.,
Think about the triviality of status.,
Find what you excel at.,
Put your own needs first.,
Leave when it's appropriate.",How to Deal With Friends Who Think They Are Better Than You," Even if your friends' lives seem perfect in every way, they probably aren't. If you really get to know your friends, you will find out that not everything is as it seems. They might be struggling at school or they might have a really difficult home life, and these things may be causing them to feel insecure. Don't point out all of your friends' shortcomings to them. If they are the type of people who feel the need to emphasize their superiority, they will not respond well to this kind of criticism. Instead, use this knowledge to help you better cope with your friends' behavior.
Your friends may even be envious of you. Some people have a very hard time accepting that they are not the best at everything, which causes them to put successful people down.;
, Snobs thrive off of other people's willingness to accept that they are inferior to them. If you drool over their expensive clothes or praise them excessively for their accomplishments, you're only fueling their feelings of superiority. Instead, try not to show any emotion when they start bragging. Just say, ""cool"" or ""congratulations,"" and change the subject. If your friends are genuinely more knowledgeable about a topic than you are, it's fine to be respectful of their knowledge, but if they are acting so superior that they refuse to let you contribute to the conversation, you need to stand up for yourself. Try doing your research so that you are well-informed about the topic. This will put you in a much better position to engage your friends with thoughtful commentary, and maybe even to let them know when they are wrong., If you think your friends might be willing to change their behavior, but need a bit of a wake up call first, you might want to stage an intervention, in which you sit them down and honestly talk to them about how their behavior affects you and the other people around them. You can also suggest ways that they can change. Interventions are typically used for people who are struggling with substance abuse, but they can work well in this kind of situation as well.Telling narcissistic people that they are arrogant or selfish will only cause them to become defensive, which will likely make their behavior worse. If you are going to confront your friends about their behavior, you need to do it in a nurturing, non-insulting way.Don't expect too much from this interaction. If your friends truly believe in their superiority, they are unlikely to offer you any recognition or acknowledgement. Even if they don't change, however, you can still be proud of yourself for being a good friend and trying to help them.
You can stage an intervention by yourself, but if you have other friends who are also affected by the behavior, a group intervention may be even more effective.

, While you need to be cautious about insulting your friends' personalities, it is perfectly reasonable to let them know what kinds of behaviors you find unacceptable. Make it clear that if they don't respect the boundaries, you will walk away.If, for example, your friends tease you about your looks, tell them that you are not okay with it and will not tolerate it. The moment they begin to engage in the behavior, you should end the conversation and walk away.

, Many people who feel the need to put others down do so because they are afraid of being vulnerable and relying on others, not because they are completely lacking in the ability to express empathy. Help your friends feel more comfortable relying on you by praising them whenever they display empathy and by letting them know how special the friendship is to you.It may help your friends let down their walls if you can be a little vulnerable around them. Once they realize that you are not a threat to them, they might be willing to expose their own insecurities. Try having a conversation with them about your fears and encourage them to contribute.

, If your friends are making you feel jealous or inadequate, it's important to take a moment to consider how trivial status can be. People outside of your small circle of friends are unlikely to attribute much meaning at all to your friends' elevated statuses. Remind yourself that your friends' superiority is entirely in their own heads.Even if your friends are prettier, wealthier, or smarter than you, try being grateful for the natural advantages that you possess instead of being jealous of what they have. It's important to let go of the childish notion that everything in life needs to be fair., Chances are you can do at least one thing better than your friends. No matter what this thing is, embrace it and do your very best. The point is not to prove to your friends that you are better than them, but rather to prove to yourself that you are worthy and unique.Instead of comparing yourself to your friends and trying to be as good as them, focus on constantly becoming a better version of yourself. Keep in mind that your friends' success is not in any way related to your own, so their achievements should never take away from yours.If your friends truly believe they are better than you, they will never recognize your accomplishments, even if you succeed in outdoing them. This is why it's so important to recognize your own accomplishments.,

Try not to think about what your friends will think about every little decision you make in your life. Chances are, they will put you down whether you try to accommodate them or not, so don't worry about it. Do what makes you happy and don't worry about getting anyone else's approval., If your friends are abusive, deceptive, or in denial about their behavior, it's probably time to end the friendships. You can do so much better, and you will be much happier with friends who treat you well."

Talk to friends in person.,
Respond to the comment, not to the person.,
Explain how the remarks make you feel.,
Offer to educate and share knowledge.,
Be prepared to agree to disagree.",How to Deal with Insensitive Remarks from Friends2," Try to have a discussion about your friend’s insensitive remarks in person, face to face. Confronting friends in a text, over the phone, or on social media can make it difficult for you to have a meaningful discussion. Set up a time where you can talk to friends in person so you can interact in an open, honest way.If it is not possible to talk to friends about their insensitive remarks in person, you may send them a private message online with your thoughts. Commenting on a friend’s remarks on a public forum, such as Facebook, can lead to more conflict and may make it difficult for you to get your points across in a helpful way.
Responding in a comment on someone's post, for instance, makes the conversation public and other people may become involved in the conversation as well. Your friend may also become defensive and be less likely to listen if they feel you are attacking or embarrassing them in a public forum. Try a private, direct message or text instead. You might say, ""Can I talk to you about your Facebook post?""

, If you decide to speak up and address the insensitive remarks head on, start by responding directly to the comments made, not the person who made them. This means focusing on what was said, rather than judging or attacking the person who said them. Having this kind of approach will allow you to have a discussion with the person about their words without launching into a personal attack. Personal attacks on the person often lead to anger and conflict.For example, you may say to the person, “I am uncomfortable with what you just said. I do not think your remarks are sensitive or fair. I am not upset at you as a person, but I am bothered by your comments.”
Avoid saying something judgmental, like ""Only a racist person would have that opinion.""
Responding calmly and with tact can help you learn to be assertive and set boundaries with others. Speaking up against what you believe is insensitive is a good skill to have regardless of age.

, Focus on your reaction to your friend’s comment. Use “I” statements to express how the remarks make you feel. Let your friends know why and how their remarks bother you. Call them out in a way that focuses on your perspective of their words and why they may be hurtful or harmful.For example, you may say, “I want you to know that your remarks make me feel hurt and upset. I am offended by your comments because they stereotype black people.” Or you may say, “I am feeling angry and upset by your remarks. I feel as though your remarks are insensitive and hurtful to women.”

, As part of your response, you can offer to educate your friends and share knowledge. Often, insensitive remarks come from ignorance and a lack of knowledge about history or current events. Offer more information about why a remark may be insensitive to friends who are interested, especially if the discussion is going well and they seem to be listening to what you have to say.For example, you may discuss the racial history behind an insensitive remark that is made. Or you may send your friends links to information online that discuss why a remark may be insensitive.
Do not try to force any knowledge on your friends if they do not seem interested. Sometimes simply expressing your dislike for their remarks is enough of a response.

, Though you may hope that your friends come around and support your perspective, this may not always happen. Be prepared to agree to disagree with your friends, even after you have expressed your discomfort with their remarks. It may take time for them to accept your point of view, or they may not change what they say in the future. What matters is that you spoke up and expressed your discomfort to your friends.If you are bothered that your friends do not change what they say, even after you have expressed your disdain, you may decide to distance yourself from them.
You may also try to avoid talking about subjects with them that could lead to insensitive remarks, especially if you know their remarks will bother you or upset you. You may decide to avoid talking about politics and religion with this person, for example, because you know that it always leads to a heated argument.

Speak to like-minded friends.,
Lean on others who can relate to your experience.,
Talk to a mentor or parent.",How to Deal with Insensitive Remarks from Friends3," Dealing with insensitive remarks from friends can be draining, especially if you do not agree with what your friends are saying. Try to find friends who are like-minded and who will listen to you discuss your feelings about the remarks. Maybe you have friends in another social circle who may be sympathetic to your perspective. Or maybe there is one friend in your friend group who feels similar to you.You may seek out like-minded friends so you can talk together and share your feelings. This could help you cope with the insensitive remarks and feel less alone in your point of view.
These friends might have a similar opinion of the remarks and wish to join you in speaking up. If you know that the person in question often dismisses your concerns or says you're just being sensitive, being approached by multiple people may show them that you are not the only one who is offended by their behavior. Approaching the person as a group will send the message that those types of remarks will not be tolerated in the friend group.

, You may also look to family members, coworkers, and other friends who can relate to your discomfort and anger at insensitive remarks. Confide in others who can relate to what you are dealing with so you feel less alone and so you can feel supported.Maybe you have a family member who has experienced insensitive remarks from those around them in the past. Or perhaps you have coworkers who are also dealing with insensitive remarks from friends.
Organizations may provide you with more information about how to go about addressing insensitive remarks. The Anti-Defamation League, for instance, can provide you with assistance in dealing with anti-semitism.

, If the insensitive remarks from friends are really bothering you and you are feeling anxious or stressed, you may seek advice from a mentor or a parent. This may a good option if your friends are young and you are not sure how to confront them. Talking to a mentor or parent can help you feel less upset and allow you to express your feelings without judgement. It can also give you the confidence to then confront your friends directly and express your feelings about their remarks.


For example, you may speak to your parents for advice on how to handle the situation. Or you may talk to your teachers, coaches, or other community members for guidance on how to deal with insensitive remarks from friends.

What is a sociopath?,
Figure out exact moments when you have felt abused within the friendship.,
Identify the signs of sociopathy.,
Confront the friend and evaluate their reaction.,
Take care if you end up feeling like the guilty one.,
Deal with the initial denial.,
Let go of your anger.,
Break the friendship.,
Inform other friends who have also befriended the sociopath.",How to Deal With a Sociopathic Friend," Understanding what sociopaths are like is critical to reevaluating your relationship. Contrary to some beliefs, sociopaths are not serial killers by definition. Here are some definitions of sociopathy:Sociopaths are more likely to be manipulating, pathological liars who get close with people in order to hurt them.
Sociopaths are not interested in friendship. What they want out of their “friendship” with you is a loyal follower. They might treat you like a friend to gain access to your companionship, but it is not sincere. As long as you provide some value to them, something they need, they will keep you around. But once they tire of you, you will be abandoned.
Sociopathy is connected to mental disorders, usually Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) and/or Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). The sociopath does not usually feel any guilt or remorse for the things they’ve done to others, nor do they feel normal compassion or love (although this is not always the case). Their friendship with you, along with any outward aspects of charisma, charm, caring, or affection, form part of their public persona.;
, Wrap your head around all the details, and try to identify whether there has been a lack of conscience, guilt, on your friend's part. To help clear your thoughts, write down the facts and your feelings for each moment when you felt wronged. There may be trends or correlations.

, This is always difficult, for a sociopath hides their true nature and tends to be very cunning. Signs of sociopathy may blend with signs of just someone who is simply a bad friend, or someone who has little experience with social interaction. Or, your friend may just be incredibly self-absorbed without being a sociopath.

, Be calm and explain your reasoning in straight facts. Be honest, and don't try to make things sound better than you actually feel they are. Don't sell yourself short.


Sociopaths may become aggressive when their integrity is questioned. Rather than fighting the facts about their lying or manipulation, they may attack the person, or you, who is doing the questioning. They may use aggression, or even charm, to reclaim their lost ground.

, When confronted, the sociopath will seek to make you feel sorry for them. When you feel sorry for questioning them, they consider this a victory rather than caring about the reasons for your doubt.

, Your friend's sociopathy will be hard to accept. Having been friends for so long, your friendship seemed so honest and true. However, it is important to remember that this friendship in itself is a farce. Here are things to remember:


Your ""friend"" is not actually a friend. The words ""sociopathy"" and ""friend"" are mutually exclusive because sociopaths are not capable of feeling positive emotions such as caring. They may have never been interested in your genuine friendship, just your loyalty and complicity.
Understand that you have been abused and manipulated. Even if your awkward feelings are small, they are signs that not everything is right with your friendship.

, Once you realize you have been victimized by a sociopath, you may feel like getting even. But be warned: the sociopath has a lifetime of experience in screwing people over. You don't. Your chances of getting even are very small and risky. It's better to get over your anger than to seek to even the score. In fact, by wanting any sort of revenge, you keep buying into the sociopath's game playing; by letting go, you snuff out any final connection that allows you to be manipulated and used up.

, Tell the sociopath to leave you alone. Be assertive, firm, direct, and consistent. If you are unable to make your own decisions and stick to them, anyone can manipulate you with ease.


Breaking the friendship may actually be easy. To the sociopath, the friendship has been practically meaningless. It was only special to you. You need to realize a sociopath does not care about you, or your friendship. It has been nothing but a game to him/her. After breaking contact, you will notice the sociopath has immediately forgotten about you.

, Do not talk negatively about your sociopathic friend. Instead, calmly explain examples of his sociopathic behavior. This is necessary because negative talk would make you highly unpopular amongst your other friends, and drive them deeper into the arms of the sociopath.

Ignore the outbursts.,
Play it cool.,
Listen.,
They may be insecure.,
It may be natural.",How to Stay Friends With a Drama Queen," If your friend is being dramatic, and you don't like it, just pretend you don't notice. When the drama queen becomes dramatic, just walk away and start a conversation with someone else. When a drama queen finds that no one is paying attention to them, they stop. However, if the drama is directed towards you, you can't walk away from your friend, or it would seem rude. Answer the outburst with ""mmm-hmm"", or say ""Sorry, but I can't talk right now,"" and find an excuse to break away from the conversation. Some excuses would be talking to a teacher, finishing homework, going to another class, or being called by another friend.;
, Do not get frustrated by the drama queen, that won't help you. Instead, carry out your tasks like you always do. Perhaps get up to sharpen a pencil while they are talking. If they tag along, just keep going. If you end up yelling at them, you could scare them off for good, leaving you feeling guilty.

, Sometimes, a drama queen acts dramatic because they're trying to get across a message. It could be about the way people treat them, or their home life, or their grades. The friend may whine about things like school being hard, which may mean they are stressed out and possibly need support.


If the friend dramatizes about certain people, groups, or even mention something like ""People never liiiike me!!!"", it could mean people are treating them badly. Try to find out who is doing that to them, and if the bullying stops, the dramatizing may stop.
If the friend dramatizes about how they hate their moms addiction to cigarettes, or their dads alcohol issues, they may not have a supportive home life. Try to act as a support in place of their parents for them. If you notice that the parents are a real and serious problem, a trusted adult may have to interfere. Physical and emotional abuse can cause children to have later traumatizing memories.
If the friend dramatizes about how hard school is, or how good at school you are, they may be struggling. If they are struggling, they will feel that everyone is better than them and that no one will help. They may want you to know about the problems, but are not able to downright tell you. So they may try to give to clues by voicing their opinions on school. For instance: ""Science is sooo confusing. I never know what to do. You're soooo good at science, I wish you could help me."" If they ever hint that they could use your help, it is very embarrassing, so you may feel the need to keep quiet or change the subject. You could comfort them by saying, ""everyone has trouble with something, you'll fix it."" Just remember, its possible your friend may have an actual learning disability, for example, dyslexia.
If the friend dramatizes about you, they are jealous. If they say how pretty you are, except for one little thing, or that they would never date your boyfriend, they are most definitely jealous. To deal with jealous friends isn't that easy, but there are some tips for it in the tip section.

, During the stage where most kids would be dramatic, it's usually when they are feeling unimportant and insecure. It may be a change of schools or a divorce. It may even be the pressure of friends and classmates. When kids feel pressured by new experiences, they tend to want help but not to talk about it. Your friend may be feeling out of place, and if they are, cut them some slack. Perhaps you could randomly bring up a topic of insecurity and give some cleverly disguised words of advise.

, Some kids are naturally attention seeking or dramatic. It is your choice whether to put up with it or not.

Be reliable.Your dependability will initially be tested with small things.,
Keep their secrets confidential.Prove that you can be trusted by respecting their privacy.Never share any confidential information that they give you.,
Be honest.When someone learns that you've lied to them, they're naturally going to assume it will happen again.,
Trust them first.By sharing something personal with your friend, it shows that you feel a sense of trust around them.",How to Gain Someone's Trust1," Even if these things seem insignificant, they matter when you’re trying to develop trust. For example, always return things that you borrow undamaged.If you say you are going to be somewhere, show up and be on time. When you say you’re going to do something, no matter how small, do it.


Every time you prove that you’re dependable, trust grows.
No one is perfect. Occasionally you are going to be late, lose a borrowed book, or forget about something you said you would do. When this happens, apologize and own up to it immediately.
If you have to break plans that you have made with someone, then make sure to call and let the person know as soon as possible. Try not to do this too often though because it can have a negative effect on your relationship if you are always canceling at the last minute.;
, If you do, that person probably won’t feel comfortable trusting you with their secrets again for a long time, if ever. The only time you should consider breaking a confidence is if the person is in some kind of life-threatening danger and you need to alert someone.


Even then, the person will probably be angry with you for breaking their confidence.
If this happens, apologize and explain that you only did it because you were truly worried about their safety.

, Be truthful with them, even when it’s hard. If you think telling them the truth might hurt their feelings, try to find a considerate way to tell them. If you make a mistake, take responsibility and own up to it.Be upfront with them. Don’t let them find out about it some other way.


Work on showing that you’re an honest person – even if your friend isn’t directly involved in the situation.If they witness you being honest about other things and with other people, it will make them feel like you’ll be honest with them, too.
If you need to be honest with your friend about a difficult topic, try starting off like this, ""Jen, I really love how our honest our friendship is, and I want to keep it that way. I need to talk to you about something...""
You could also bring up the topic like this, ""Eric, this is hard to tell you, but I'm your friend and I feel like you should know about this...""

, Relationships are give-and-take situations. Sometimes, in order to receive something, you have to demonstrate that you're willing to give it. By trusting them first, you are showing them it’s safe for them to do the same thing.For example, you could ask for their advice about a personal problem you’re experiencing, or go to them for help on a project.
You could start off by saying, ""Danielle, I know I can trust you. I really need to talk to someone I trust about this...""
You could also say, ""Jim, this is kind of embarrassing, but I am failing algebra right now. If my parents knew, I'd be in serious trouble. You're great at algebra, do you think you could help me?""
You might feel vulnerable at first, but learning to trust someone usually begins by putting yourself out there."

Show kindness, respect, and acceptance.To build trust, it is important to show that you are kind, respectful, and accepting of the other people.,
Spend time with them.,
Be sincere.Meaningless flattery and only telling someone what they want to hear isn’t the same thing as kindness.,
Be accessible.When your friend texts or calls you, try to reply or call them back as soon as you can.,
Listen without making judgments.",How to Gain Someone's Trust2," Be understanding and show them compassion when they need it.Always respect their thoughts and beliefs, even when they are different from yours.If you disagree on something, be respectful about it. For instance, don’t say, “I don’t believe in your religion at all. It sounds really weird.”
Instead, say something like, “My beliefs are pretty different, but that’s ok! I respect all religions.”
Also, be accepting of your friend. Don’t try to get your friend to change for you.

, Trust is built over time, so be ready and willing to invest time in someone if you want to gain their trust.Each time you hang out, it’s an opportunity to have positive interactions and show your trustworthiness. Avoid only being around them when things are going well. Be there for them during the ups and the downs.Your willingness to be around them when they’re going through a hard time shows them that they matter to you.
You aren’t hanging around just to have fun and enjoy the good times – you want to have a real friendship.

, You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but you also don’t want to lie to them. Avoid being vague with them. Be specific and really mean the things you say. For example, if your friend asks you how they look in an outfit and it doesn’t look flattering, don’t automatically say, “It looks great!” when you know it doesn't.


However, you also don’t want to say, “Honestly, you look a bit overweight in that.”
Instead, you could say something like, “That color looks awesome on you! I like the style of the outfit, but I’m not sure about the neckline. Let’s look for something else in that color.”

, If they send you a text and you don’t respond for days, it creates the illusion that you either don’t care enough to reply, or you’re busy doing something that you can’t talk to them about. Try to be available when they need you.


For example, if you’re busy at the library and your friend texts you, send a quick response like, “In study group right now! Will get back to you ASAP.”
Another example: If you’re on a vacation with your family and you’re going to be busy for days, don’t leave them hanging. Respond with, “Out of town with my family – we’re skiing! Will be back Sunday – I’ll call you.”

, When someone tells you a story or expresses a feeling, it is important to listen without making judgments. Make sure that you keep an open mind when you listen to people and do not express judgment for the things they share with you.


For example, if a friend shares with you that she had a one night stand with someone, don’t tell her that she shouldn’t have done that or try to give her unsolicited advice about what to do. Just listen to her and offer your support if she expresses worry over the situation.
Avoid thinking about what you are going to say next. Just focus on what the person is saying.Pay attention to their facial expressions and body language as well to get insight into how they are feeling.

Avoid gossiping.Never gossip about your friend to other people – most of the time, they are going to find out about it.,
Keep your promises.Each time you break a promise, trust decreases.,
Be supportive.,
Help them.Be there for them, even when you aren’t asked.",How to Gain Someone's Trust3," It’s hard to rebuild trust when someone feels that you’ve betrayed them in this way. You should also avoid gossiping to your friend about other people. When you do this, it plants the idea in their head that you might also gossip about them, too.


When you gossip with someone, it can sometimes feel like you’re bonding with them because you’re sharing privileged information together.
However, this is not a healthy way to bond with your friend. Nothing positive ever results from gossiping.
If you hear other people gossiping about your friend, stand up for them. This will very clearly demonstrate your loyalty.

, Be true to your word and avoid making promises that you can’t keep. If you do break a promise and it’s something minor, be sincerely apologetic and try to make it up to them in some way. The damage is usually minor in this situation. If you break an important promise, however, things are going to be a lot harder to make right.


Depending on the nature of the broken promise, gaining their trust may no longer be possible.
The best approach is to avoid making promises that you can’t keep. Always try your best to keep the promises you do make.

, Support your friend’s dreams and goals, even when no one else does. Encourage them when they lose hope.Always have their back and show them that you can be counted on to be there for them. When someone knows that you are going to be supportive, they will feel more comfortable sharing things with you.


For example, ""Darrell, I know how much you want to get into film school. I know your parents don't agree, but I think you have what it takes to get in. I got a really nice camera for Christmas, but I honestly don't use it much. I want you to have it...""
Being supportive doesn’t mean always being in favor of everything they do, especially when it’s harmful or dangerous for them.
Always try to make it clear that you want the best for them.If you aren’t supportive of something, explain to them why. Be honest with them.
For instance, in a negative situation, you could say, ""Whitney, I'm your best friend and I want the best for you. I would never be unsupportive of any of your choices unless I felt truly worried about you. I honestly feel like your new boyfriend is a bad influence on you...""
Make sure that you remember important dates as well, such as anniversaries, birthdays, and other special dates in your relationship.

, If you see a friend struggling, do what you can to help them through it. For instance, if your friend is failing a subject in school, don’t just sit back and watch. Offer to help them with their homework and study with them.


If you step in to help them with something when the chips are down, without even being asked, they will feel like they can count on you.

Recognize when spending time with your friend leaves you feeling empty.Spending time with good friends leaves us feeling happy, upbeat, refreshed, and optimistic.",How to Deal With an Abusive Friend," Oftentimes, abusive friends are unaware they are being abusive.Perhaps they are just having an off day or made a rude comment without thinking about it. In these cases, or when your friend is only rarely abusive, you can try to reason with them.


If you want to meet the friend in person, bring another friend who has been apprised of the situation with you. They will defend you and could act as mediator in the event that the abusive friend reacts badly.You are not obligated to confront your abusive friend in person. You could also write them an email or call them on the phone in order to have a conversation about why you don’t appreciate their abuse.
Draw attention to their negative behavior by using “I” statements such as “I do not like being called stupid.” Avoid accusatory “you” statements in the form of “You always call me stupid.”
Be polite but firm when telling your friend that you will not tolerate their abuse. Say, “I treat you with respect, and I expect the same.”
Be as serious as possible. Smiling or laughing about their abuse will send the message that you are not very upset by their behavior.;
, They communicate in abusive or domineering ways, and make you the center of the conversation. Responding to this type of communication can be difficult. The best way to take back control of the conversation is to focus on their abusive behavior or speech instead of any shortcomings that they perceive in you.


Ask questions that could lead them to rethink their abusive approach. If your friend calls you names or bullies you, tell them, “Please do not call me names. Don’t I deserve the same level of respect I give you?”
You could also say to your friend, “If you continue to speak to me without regard for my feelings, I am going to leave. Is that what you want?”

, You might feel hurt or angry. That’s okay! As long as you express your feelings in a positive, healthy way, there’s no reason not to feel a certain way. Don’t hide your emotions or pretend you aren’t bothered by your abusive friend’s behavior.


Tell your abusive friend, “I don’t like the way you’re talking to me,” or “The things you’re saying are very hurtful.”
Share your feelings about your abusive friend with other family and friends, too. They might be more willing to listen to you than the abusive friend is.

, For instance, if your friend is criticizing you for being stupid and they just mentioned they failed a test, you could reply, “You just failed your math test, but I’m stupid? Really?”


Humor can give you a feeling of greater control over the situation.
Use humor only in cases of mild abuse.

, The types of consequences you enact will vary depending on the situation.


If you work alongside your abusive friend, tell them they need to cease their abuse or you’ll inform the human resources department or department manager of the abuse.
If dealing with an abusive friend at school, tell them you’ll get your teacher or principal involved unless they stop abusing you.
If dealing with a friend who won’t stop harassing you online, tell them you intend to block them and will contact the forum or website administrator to have their abusive content removed.

, Is your abusive friend very close? Are they regularly abusive, or is their abusive behavior something you need to deal with only occasionally?


If you think remaining friends with the abusive person is a possibility, talk to them about their behavior in an open, honest way in order to give them the chance to change.
If you think the abusive friend is not worth the trouble they bring you, don’t bother trying to make them change. End the friendship and move on.

, The boundaries you set should be established over time, and continually revised in the face of the changing relationship between yourself and your friend.


Specific boundaries will vary with individuals. However, whatever boundaries you set should enable you to live a full, healthy life free of fear, obligation, and guilt.
Do not put yourself in situations where you will be abused.If you are not hurting anyone else, your feelings, desires, wants, and opinions should be respected. Any friend that disregards you in these respects should considered abusive and dealt with as such.
Take care of yourself emotionally. Don’t ever feel guilty for disagreeing with an abusive friend or expressing yourself.
Don’t let yourself be walked all over, controlled, or taken advantage of by an abusive friend.

, Remember, you are not forced to spend time with people you don’t like. When your friend wants to hang out, politely decline and, if you want to, offer an explanation like “I’m spending time with my family” or “I’m just staying home tonight.”

, There’s no right way to end a friendship. You could gradually reduce the time you spend with your friend until you have cut them out of your life altogether, or you could drop them cold turkey and just refuse to see them again. If you want to meet in person, choose a public space to end the friendship, or contact them via email, text, or phone with the news that you don’t want to see them again. Say, for instance, “I value the good memories we had as friends, but I no longer want to be the victim of your mental and verbal abuse. I think it’s best if we don’t spend time with each other anymore.”


Always be empathetic when ending your friendship and plan what you’re going to say before telling your friend that you want to end the friendship.
Look at the end of your friendship with your abusive friend as a new start. Join clubs to meet new friends or deepen your friendships with other friends.
Don’t use the end of your friendship as an opportunity to unleash pent-up frustration in a torrent of your own abuse., Speak to your friend in a calm, even tone. Use only kind words, and avoid calling your friend names out of spite. This will only escalate the abusive situation and will not lead to a productive resolution.


When your friend is being abusive, take deep breaths and count to ten. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
You could also take a time out from communicating with your friend by saying something like, “Let me get back to you,” then making an exit to a safe, quiet space where you can collect yourself and gather your thoughts.

, While you should not excuse your friend’s behavior, it will help you to understand it. Using your knowledge of your friend’s life history and experiences, try putting yourself in their shoes to see why they’re acting in an abusive way.


Create a sentence using the form “It must not be easy...” For instance, you might say, “My friend is so abusive. It must not be easy for them to have been raised by overly critical parents.""

, You are never responsible for your friend's actions. Nothing that you’ve done or haven’t done could ever justify your friend’s abusive behavior.When you catch yourself giving mental space to ideas like, “My friend is only abusive because I deserve it,” fight them off with a positive mantra. For instance, you might tell yourself “I am a good person and I do not deserve to be abused emotionally or verbally.”

, If you’ve long tolerated an abusive friend, you might have developed an expectation of abuse from other people in your life. Were you raised by a mentally and verbally abusive family? Do you have a spouse or partner who is abusive, as well? Individuals who suffer abuse tend to seek it out from others later in life., Remember, your friend is the one who is behaving poorly, not you.

, Some people stay friends with an abusive person because they are worried that they will not find another friend. Don’t be that person. Acting out of fear only makes it harder for you to deal with your abusive friend directly and resolve the situation.


If you have long-term abandonment issues and anxieties surrounding the possibility of losing people close to you, consider talking to a psychologist. Psychologists are trained to help you understand your own feelings and fears in private therapy sessions.

, For instance, they might ignore you by not responding to your texts or calls if they feel they’ve been wronged. They might also tell you explicitly they don’t care what you do, or show interest in your feelings and thoughts.

, Typical narcissistic behavior includes an inability to laugh at themselves, admit their own shortcomings, or apologize when they were wrong. They might also blame you for their own problems or unhappiness.

, For instance, perhaps your abusive friend insists that you change your clothes when you go out together in public, even when you’re dressed appropriately. An abusive friend might also insist that you buy them food, clothes, or other goods or services.

, Constant criticism and judging are the hallmarks of shaming behavior. If you have a certain opinion on something and your friend criticizes you for it, they are engaging in abusive shaming.


For example, if you say you want to eat vanilla ice cream and your friend says vanilla ice cream is for babies, they are engaged in shaming behavior.
Friends that shame you might respond to your insistence that they apologize or recant rude criticism by claiming that what they said was “just a joke.”

, If you feel exhausted from the constant criticism and sniping comments your friend directs toward you, you should think about ways to deal with them.

Get to know your true self.,
Examine your behavior when you are around your poisonous friend.,
Keep your core values in mind at all times.,
Surround yourself with positive influences who share your core values and who make you feel good about yourself.,
Assert your independence a little at a time through your actions.,
Distance yourself from your friend, but do this very slowly.,
Be wary and protect yourself.",How to Deal With Poisonous Friends," Grab a blank notebook and start writing. Who do you want to be? What do you like about yourself? How do others see you? What are your values? If you could change anything about yourself, what would you change? Decide how you want to live your life. This does not have to be a comprehensive evaluation, but it should include those things which are most important to you.;
, Do you say what you honestly think or feel? Do you put others down because you know that he or she will enjoy it? Do you feel like you have to impress him or her? Do you fight for his or her attention? Ask yourself questions like these.

, From now on, you will be true to yourself and your values. Think before you speak or act. It might be difficult to begin asserting your true self, but it will be worth it.

, Don't be afraid to be apart from your poisonous friend.

, Get a hobby. Invite a new friend to a movie (do not flaunt this to your friend, though, since that would make you a somewhat poisonous friend). Join a gym, volunteer or do something that makes you a better person and makes you feel good about yourself. Just try to set yourself apart from your friend.

, Be discreet and gradually reduce the time that you spend with this person. Remain polite and friendly when you see your friend but don't make bigger arrangements to see each other.

, Don't share personal information or secrets with someone you do not absolutely trust, as that person could break your confidences. Be kind to everyone, but be choosy when it comes to developing close friendships. This is not snobbery, this is wisdom.

Steer away from envious people.,
Examine his behavior.,
If you would like to do something, and he says things like ""You can't"", ""You suck at..."" or ""You're not going to make it"" then those are signs of envy.,
Try to help him out in that situation, talk to him about this feeling.,
Talk to somebody about that.,
Envious people talk with others about you.

,
Investigate what made him that way.",How to Deal With an Envious Friend," They will not admit they are envious typically. Steer away from this person. Keep away until they confess and say sorry. If not keep away, you can not afford to keep envious people in your private world. People that envy you are not your friends.;
, See his actions, words, etc. Sometimes they may make a facial response, so be alert.

, For example: You would like to sing, and he says you shouldn't because you are a bad singer but others say you have a great voice, something's wrong.

, If you don't succeed try to Break Up with that friend.

, You might not see he's envious, but if you tell others the situation they may identify it.

,, You might be mistaken for something you did that he hated and he's trying to take revenge. Or maybe he's in a bad mood; and people who are always in a bad mood often try to make others feel like dirt.

Be assertive, not a doormat.,
Call them out when they’re rude.,
Don’t feed into their arrogance.,
Limit the time you spend with them.,
Make sure your expectations are realistic.",How to Handle an Egotistical Friend1," A common theme for those who befriend egotists is being unable to stand up for themselves. But, if you want to maintain this friendship, you will have to stop letting your self-centered friend walk all over you. Learn to be clear and brief when you state your needs.When your friend asks your advice, actually give your opinion.
Practice saying “no.” If you don’t agree with something or don’t want to do something, say so.
Don’t feel guilty. Everyone has the right to speak up for themselves.;
, If you’re friends with an egotist, you are probably no stranger to being the butt of mean, sarcastic jokes. Your friend may laugh it off like they’re just teasing, but these comments are rude. One way to set boundaries is to speak out when your friend does this and let them know you refuse to be treated this way.You might say, “Hey, that’s not cool, Frankie. I’m going to leave if you don’t stop.”

, Egotists really like being the center of attention. However, just because others in your social group eat up their every word doesn’t mean you have to. Stop giving them special treatment. Instead, treat them the same way you treat all your other friends.Let’s say someone asks what you’re doing for the summer and the egotist interrupts and starts telling about their summer plans. Politely say, “Actually, Donna, I think Judy was asking me that question.” Then, go ahead with your answer.

, People who are self-conceited are often described as “energy vampires” because it drains you to be around them. If this characterizes your friendship with this person, start getting some distance.For example, if you’re having a tough day and don’t have the energy to deal with them, back out of your plans.
It may seem rude, but you need to do what’s best for your emotional health and your sanity.

, If you want to continue being friends with this self-centered person, you may have to lower the bar. Take advantage of the feel-good vibes you often get from hanging out with this person, but know your limits. Don’t expect the egotist to ever support you emotionally or show any concern for your needs.

Also, limit what you confide in this person. Unlike non-egotistical friends, they may not understand the importance of a secret, which means they just might share it with others or throw it back in your face later."
"
Be honest: Whatever you do, lying or pretending will only hurt you in long run.,
Ask the question: Do this in private...not in front of a large group of friends!!!,
Don't accuse.,
Be the better person: If they were ""back biting"" you, it was an attempt to elevate themselves socially.",How to Deal With Overhearing Your Friends Backbiting on You," Don't say anything that is not true or cover up the truth (unless the truth is hurting the other person for no reason). You can confront the person if you want but be prepared to face denial.;
, You don't have to admit that you overheard them, but you could ask something like, "" did I hear you or someone else say this about me?"" Or ""I may not have heard this right, but did I hear you say ...?"" But don't reveal the other person's name. It would just end up being a blame game so better keep the source out of the conversation
Don't approach them with an accusation. Go and try to understand what they were saying. It is always possible that you didn't get the story exactly right. This takes some guts to do.
The success will be primarily through your attitude. If you honestly go to them and desire to hear the truth, they will see that. However, not everyone has the guts to accept their faults. But if you approach them like a lion ready to pounce on them, they will sense that too and maybe become even more defensive about their stand!

, You can tell them what you feel, but don't tell them how they are or what kind of a friend they are (or are not). It is MUCH more powerful to tell a friend that ""you hurt my feelings when you said..."" than it is to say, ""you are a horrible friend for saying ..."" They cannot argue with the way you feel, but they will become more defensive and hurtful to you (both at that moment and in the future) if you begin to accuse. All this does bring anger to you when you come to know that your friend reacted in a manner which was not acceptable to you, but staying calm is probably the best for you( mentally and physically)

, They wanted to look and feel better than you. It must also mean that they felt you were better than them. Don't fall into the trap of doing the same to them in future. If you are able to forgive them and understand that they are not perfect, you are more likely to forgive yourself and realize that you are not perfect either. Or maybe they were also irritated my your attitude/action in the past which probably provoked them to take such steps or react. The best possible thing is to forgive them. Easier said, forgiving enemies is easier than forgiving a friend who back stabbed.

Look deeper.,
Have empathy.,
Be patient.",How to Handle an Egotistical Friend2," A person with a big ego may surround themselves with admirers and put down others only because doing so makes them feel good. Take a closer look at your egotistical friend. Their attitude may get under your skin, but could there be more underneath the surface?For instance, many arrogant people lack self-esteem deep down. They may play the role of being super-confident, when they really aren’t.

, Even if they may never admit it aloud, there’s a reason this person acts the way they do. Exercise your friendship skills by showing them love and compassion. This doesn’t mean feeding their ego. It just means treating them like a worthy human being.

Tell them you appreciate their friendship or value a specific trait they have. You never know, you may be the only one who has said this to them., Being friends with an egotist requires a great deal of patience. Even when you show this person empathy, they may still behave the same as they always have. Continue to have compassion for this person and realize that their behavior is an act of self-protection. It’s nothing against you."

Make friends who can meet your emotional needs.,
Practice self-care.,
Work on your self-esteem.,
Question if you want to maintain the friendship.",How to Handle an Egotistical Friend3," Egotists have a hard time listening to others or caring for others’ emotions. This can put you on the short end of the stick a lot, especially when all they do is talk. Balance out time spent with this person by developing relationships with others who are able to truly be there for you.For example, you'll want to choose friends who are good listeners, who are able to put your needs first sometimes, and who don't compete with you for attention.

, Being friends with an egotistical person often means you are usually pouring your emotional energy into someone else. They may rarely, if ever, pour back into you. Take care of your own emotional health, particularly when you have been drained by your self-centered friend.

Be sure to do kind things for yourself like sipping a warm cup of tea before bed, doing yoga, or calling your mom to chat. Pour back into your own cup as often as you can., If you intend to stay friends with an egotist, you need some strong armor in place. That means you can’t allow this person’s look-at-me attitude to make you feel less than you are. It can be hard to be around someone who is conceited and not feel your own confidence take a nosedive. So, purposefully take strides to boost your self-esteem.Make a list of all your strengths and keep it with you. Recite it regularly.
Try out new things, such as interesting hobbies or sports. You’ll feel better about yourself when you take on new challenges.

, If being friends with a self-centered person is bringing you down, know that you have options. You aren’t required to keep this person around. In fact, you have a duty to make sure you surround yourself with positive people who love and care for you. If this person isn’t meeting those criteria, consider whether they’re worth keeping around.Ask yourself whether you really want to keep being friends with this person. If not, make the hard choice to separate yourself from them.
You might say, ""I'm sorry, Tori, but I don't think we should continue being friends. I don't feel valued and truly seen by you.""

"
Change the subject.,
Avoid competing with them.,
Set an example for your friend.,
Don't insult your friend.,
Change the way you compliment them.",How to Deal With a Bragging Friend1," Sometimes redirecting the conversation can curb bragging behavior. If your friend starts bragging, change the subject to something you both find interesting. Maybe you could talk about a class you're both in or a book you both love.You could even compliment a mutual friend and encourage the bragging friend to praise others.


If your friend continually turns the conversation back to themselves, politely tell them you don't want to talk about that right now. You don't have to tell them why. You might say, ""Very cool, Jacob! Hey, have you seen the trailer for that new superhero movie yet? It looks pretty awesome. What kinds of movies do you like?"";
, If your friend is always one-upping you, you may feel the urge to brag back. This will only worsen the problem: your friend will want to best you and you will feel even more angry. When you feel the urge, hold your tongue. Stooping to their level will not help.Never lie about your accomplishments in an attempt to best them. Even if they don't find out, you will likely feel bad for lying., If you notice yourself bragging, correct yourself out loud and avoid bragging in the future. Apologize to your friend and say something like, ""I didn't realize I had been bragging. I'll try not to do that in the future. I know it makes people feel bad.""If you make an effort to stop, your friend might follow suit.


Even if your friend knows they have a problem, they might feel too embarrassed to change their behavior. Knowing that other people struggle with it, too, can push them towards improvement.
Do not brag on purpose just to self-correct yourself. This is passive-aggressive.Your friend may not necessarily pick up on the hint, but they may pick up on your anger. Instead, become self-aware of your own bragging habits.

, People often don't realize how their bragging hurts others. Your friend might not mean to hurt your feelings. Treat them kindly and with respect. Ganging up against them will not solve the problem.

, How you praise them can either reinforce or curb their bragging behavior. Complement their actions rather than them. Saying, ""You're so amazing!"" may give them incentive for bragging in the future. Instead, say, ""You did a good job!"" It puts emphasis on the action, not them, and encourages them to work hard.If your friend is fishing for praise, you do not have to compliment them. Treat them kindly, but put attention on something else besides their actions. You might say, for example, ""I appreciate how much effort you put into the group project, Becca. We couldn't have done it without your persistence.""

Ask your friend to have a private conversation.,
Speak calmly.,
Tell your friend what you've heard.,
Listen to your friend's side of the story before making assumptions.,
Tell your friend how you feel.,
Ask your friend if you did something to bring about their backstabbing.,
Don't turn the conversation into an argument.,
Get a trusted opinion.,
Determine if the friendship is worth saving.,
Improve communication with your friend.,
Establish expectations for your friendship.,
Be willing to forgive.,
Remove yourself from the relationship.,
Delete your friend on social media.,
Remain civil when you see each other.,
Self-reflect.",How to Deal With a Backstabbing Friend," Before you make any decisions, it's important that you get to the bottom of the situation. Tell your friend that you'd like to clear some things up, and that you'd appreciate them meeting with you.


If you don't see this friend at work or at school, ask them to meet you in a public place such as a cafe. It's best to meet in a public place so that neither of you feel uncomfortable.
Always talk to your friend away from other people. You can't have a serious conversation about your relationship issues when other people are around.;
, Yelling or getting overemotional won't typically help your situation. Talking in a calm voice will help you get your point across and will also help your friend remain calm. We often think much more logically when we are calm, so you'll be able to better explain your thoughts and feelings if you don't let your emotions get the best of you.Stay calm by taking slow, deep breaths – deep breathing is a great tool to keep you relaxed.
If you start to become upset, calm yourself down by internally telling yourself to relax, and/or thinking of imagery that keeps you calm – such as a beach or waterfall.
Carry a stress ball to squeeze when you get angry. This is a great way to physically get out your anger and tension in an extremely calm way., Avoid mentioning names and simply tell your friend whatever you heard they did or said. Express to them how those actions hurt you. The more straightforward you are, the more straightforward they'll be.


Seek the truth before you make your final decision. Most of the time, we find out about backstabbing friends through other people. It's important to get your friend's side of the story before you take another person's word as fact. What you've heard about your friend could be a rumor, or it could be true. Either way, it's important to know the truth., Tell your friend that honesty is important to you and your friendship, and that you'd like to know the truth. Use open-ended questions to encourage discussion and avoid verbally attacking your friend. If they feel like they have to be defensive, they won't be honest with you. Simply ask what happened and listen attentively., Be honest with your feelings and don't beat around the bush. Be straightforward when you're telling your friend why you're upset with them and how their actions have made you feel. Remain as calm as possible.


Use this guideline to express your feelings: ""It upset me when you _______. Your actions made me feel like _______ because _______.""

, It's important to know whether you have somehow contributed to the issue at hand. Perhaps they feel hurt by you in some way and this is their way of ""getting back"" at you, or perhaps there has been a misunderstanding. It's important to clarify the possibility that your friend sees things in this light.Avoid interrupting. Let your friend finish talking before you interrupt them or ask additional questions. It's important that your friend feels heard.

, If your friend won't answer your questions or continues evading the issue, gently push them for answers, but do not attack them. If you turn this into an argument, it will only cause your friend to withdraw from the conversation. Your friend may feel embarrassed that you found out about their actions, so they may be hesitant to be honest with you.To avoid arguing, be sure to listen to your friend instead of waiting for your turn to talk. Listening to one another will give you both a better understanding of what happened.
Don't raise your voice. This will just get both of you upset.
Don't focus on who is right and who is wrong – focus on truth and honesty. If you're trying to prove one another wrong, you won't have a productive conversation. Instead, be honest with one another to figure out how to fix the current situation.Don't be disrespectful or condescending. Even if you're upset, it is not okay to disrespect someone, especially if you're trying to fix a problem. It is important to treat your friend the way you wish to be treated.
If things start to get tense, suggest taking a short break from the discussion to allow yourselves to cool down., Talk to someone else you trust, such as a parent, a spouse, another friend or even a counselor. Discuss what happened with someone neutral who can give you an honest opinion on the situation. Sometimes when we are emotional, we can overlook things that an uninvolved person might notice. It's important to talk with someone who will be honest with you, and not someone who will only tell you want you want to hear. It's also important that you listen to them., If your friend is open and honest with you about their actions, there's a strong possibility that your friendship is fixable. If you and your friend can admit to your mistakes and commit to working on a better friendship, put in the effort to fix things. All of our relationships have their ups and downs, so look at this as an opportunity to improve your communication and make your friendship stronger.If your friend is not willing to be honest about their actions, or if this is a recurring issue with this person, it might be best to go your separate ways. Friendship is a two-way street, and you can't be the only person putting in the effort to keep it going. A negative relationship is not worth fighting for, and it will be better for both parties to end your friendship.

, In all relationships, communication is key. Many fights and misunderstandings stem from a lack of communication. Going forward, it's important to be 100% honest about your actions and feelings in your friendship.If an issue arises in the future, make it clear that you'd like to resolve those issues by talking with each other instead of talking to other people or doing something that either of you may regret.
Bring issues up immediately instead of bottling up your feelings. When we suppress feelings and emotions, we are more likely to boil over and say or do something we regret. If a problem arises, address it right away.

, It is important to know what you and your friend expect out of a friendship in order for it to work. For example, you may deal with situations differently, or some things may bother you more than others. This is why you must establish expectations.


Tell your friend what you need from them in a friendship. Being honest will help your friend to better meet your needs. Explain to your friend what you need from them using the ""I-message"" formula: ""I feel _____ when you _______ and I need for you to _______."" Refrain from assigning blame to your friend, though.
Ask your friend what they need from you in a friendship. Again, friendship is a two-way street. Therefore, you need to meet your friends needs as well. Ask them to be honest about how you can be a better friend to them.
Be ready to meet both needs. Resolution begins when you start understanding each other and the situation. As you hear similar needs from each other, the differences are put aside and you are able to work things through., It's impossible to move forward if you are unable to forgive. Holding onto anger or grudges isn't healthy for you and will ruin any chance you have of a real friendship. It takes a lot of strength to forgive, but it will help you grow as a person and as a friend.Tell your friend that you forgive them – it is an important factor in rebuilding trust for both of you. It will mean a lot to your friend to hear that you forgive them, and saying ""I forgive you"" will help you move on from the situation.If you cannot forgive this person for their actions, you cannot be friends with him or her. Trying to have a relationship with someone you hold anger towards isn't healthy for you or for them. Life is too short to hold grudges., Although it can be hard, it is sometimes best to end a friendship that has become negative or toxic. If a person continues to hurt you, it's unhealthy to keep them in your life. Once you remove a negative relationship from your life, you'll be able to focus on the true and trustworthy friends that you still have.Tell this person that you no longer wish to be friends with them. Remain calm and keep your ""goodbye"" conversation simple. You don't owe them any explanation, but it will make you feel better to be honest with them and give yourself closure.
If you're unsure of what to say, use this formula: ""Because of _______, I no longer wish to be friends with you. Your actions hurt me and made me feel ______.""

, Technology makes distancing yourself from someone more difficult, so don’t leave any window open for them to hurt you even more. Unfriend / unfollow them so that you don't have to see any of their posts, or block them if they're doing things like harassing you.


Don't check your ex-friend's social media accounts. You need to give yourself space from them, and checking what they post on social media might upset you., If and when you meet accidentally, stay calm and collected. If you have friends in common, it may be difficult to avoid each other. If this is the case, it's not fair to ask your friends to choose between you two. Instead, ask your friends to let you know if the ex-friend will be at a gathering, and avoid going if he or she attends. If you do see your former friend in public, keep your distance and ignore them., There is something to learn in every situation, and this is no different. Look at this outcome from a positive point of view, as opposed to a negative one. For example, you now know that this person isn't a real friend, so you don't have to let them hurt you anymore. Hopefully you've learned how to better deal with conflict and how to stand up for yourself.Learn from this experience. You should never treat a friend the way this ex-friend treated you. This goes along with the famous saying ""Treat others as you wish to be treated.""

Determine if your friend is being manipulative.,
Look out for the warning signs.,
Think about whether you really like them, or whether you just feel guilty if you don't spend time with them.,
Confide in other friends.,
Confront your manipulative friend.,
If they are abusive to you, or fail to admit they have a problem, cut them off.,
Look for past victims.,
Forget.",How to Deal With a Manipulative Friend," The signs are very easy to spot, but most victims don't believe they're being manipulated and instead think they have the problem. The goals of the manipulator are fairly simple: they like power, control, attention and sympathy. Generally, manipulators are not stable and secure people.;
, These can vary a lot, but generally these are some good indicators:


They control your life as much as possible, especially your friends. They'll find any reason to not like your friends. ""She's weird"", ""She makes you act different"", ""She's rude"", and if it's not one of those then you better believe they can find another reason. If that's not enough to lure you away from your friends, depending on their limits the luring could get worse.
They will do things such as give you money or advice, even just once in a while, but will forever hold it against you. ""Oh, you borrowed a ton of money from me so the least you can do is buy me this!""
They constantly start minor arguments with you and then accuse you of being nasty to them.
They tell minor, but constant lies, but will claim to be real and say that they never lie.
They are tolerable in person, but are often vicious and abusive through emails and Facebook.
They accuse you of insulting them and offending them, and will tell you you're sounding a bit 'moody' or 'bitchy' to them.
They say that you have a problem, often that you're a nasty person who gets on people's nerves.
They will make subtle threats, such as 'You need to start being nicer to me, because I don't have to put up with you' or 'I'm always trying to convince everybody that you're actually a nice person, you could at least put some effort in'.
They try to convince you that everybody around you hates you except them.

, If they constantly tell you that they don't like you, but still remain friends with you, you have to think about their motives.

, People the manipulator doesn't know are best, as they won't hear her spin on the story.

, This is often the hardest part, as they will fight tooth and claw to humiliate you, to make you feel sad, lonely and guilty, and to convince you that you have the problem, not them. The key is to remember that you're the victim, and that this isn't friendship, it's abuse.

, They may often resort to childish or hurtful tactics, such as turning all your friends against you, or spreading rumours about you. Ignore them, refuse to talk about them, make new friends and generally try to avoid all contact with them, so that you are never exposed to their mind games.

, Often, there will be other people that they have repeated the cycle with, and that will make you feel slightly less alone.

, This final step is necessary for getting your confidence back and moving on with your life. Most likely your former friend will try to find ways of getting you back into their life. Just distance yourself from them, and think of how much better you are without them.

Consider when the jealous comments are made.,
Evaluate the content of their envious comments.,
Speculate about what your friend is trying to achieve.,
Differentiate between jealousy, negativity, and depression.,
Talk to your jealous friend as soon as possible.,
Maintain an open mind.,
Encourage, support, and build-up your friend.,
Determine if this friendship is worth saving.,
Confront the toxic friend.,
Set clear boundaries.,
End the relationship and move on.",How to Deal With a Jealous Friend," When your friend makes a critical or harmful remark, pause and think about what possibly triggered their spiteful comment. Were you telling them about something good that is happening to you? Did you just share your plans for the future? Had they just come from spending time with other people? After a few days or weeks, you will start to notice a pattern. Recognizing this pattern may help you know how to steer a conversation and or reveal your friend’s insecurities.


If your friend always makes jealous, spiteful comments while hanging out in a group, they may put you down in an effort to bolster their waning self-confidence.
If your friend always makes envious remarks after you’ve shared plans with for your future, they may feel like their future isn’t as promising as yours.;
, Jealous comments reveal a lot about the person making the invidious statement. These comments, while directed at you, aren’t necessarily about you. Think about content of the comments. What do they reveal about your friend’s point of view and sense of self? Is your friend always telling you that you’re not good at something? Do they frequently make fun of your appearance?


If your friend is super critical of your possessions, they may be struggling to define their identity outside of their possessions and finances.
If your friend makes negative comments about your success, they may be jealous about the opportunities you are receiving or envious of your talents.
If your friend constantly critiques your appearance, they may feel insecure about their own physical appearance., Jealous comments usually serve a dual purpose. First and foremost, these remarks are meant to make you feel bad about yourself. You should also consider that your friend may be mad at you, building herself up by cutting you down, or trying to manipulate you. There is also the possibility that your friend treats everyone they encounter in this manner.


Your friend could be mad at you for numerous reasons, petty or otherwise. Is there a reason your friend might be angry with you? Did you recently fight? Did you forget to call them back? Were you gossiping about them?
In order to diminish and distract from our own faults, insecurities, or fears, we have a tendency to point out other's failings. Is your friend struggling with self-confidence or body image issues? Are they feeling unsure about their future?
Cutting someone down can make a person feel more powerful and confident. Does your friend thrive on feeling superior and in charge?, Humans are complex beings. Our emotional, mental, and physical health are interconnected and inform our mood, actions, and words. While you may perceive your friend's comments as jealous statements, there may be more to their envious quips than meets the eye. Instead of writing your friend off as jealous and petty, ask your friend how they are doing.


Some people struggle to manage their negative thoughts. If your friend is constantly comparing themselves to you, they may caught in a cycle of self-doubt and self-loathing. Their seemingly jealous remarks are making them feel worse instead of better about themselves.Recent studies suggest that individuals struggling with depression have a difficult time distinguishing between negative emotions. If they truly are envious of you, they may not identify their actions or comments as such; if they are angry or sad, these emotions may manifest as jealousy., Good friends are hard to find—don’t let the conflict fester for too long or you could lose a great companion. If you value the friendship, address your friend’s jealousy directly. Bring up the envious comments tactfully—instead of accusing them of being green with envy, acknowledge that these negative statements concern and hurt you. Note that you are worried about the status of your friendship and alarmed by the shift in their demeanor. Communicate your feelings clearly and listen attentively to your friend’s response.Ask your friend how they are doing personally. Are they struggling at school, home, or work? Are their parents fighting? Did they just get out of a relationship? Were they passed over for a great opportunity? Are they coping with these challenges by acting out in jealousy towards you? Do they think your life is so much better or easier than their life?
Ask if you did something to offend or upset them. Did you forget their last birthday? Did you fail to text or call them back? Did you host a party and forget to invite them? Did you gloss over their most recent success?Use I statements to express your feelings and concerns. “I felt hurt when you said _____.” Do not transform your I-statements into You-statements with the words “should” and “ought” or the phrases “I feel that” or “I feel like you.”Practice active listening. Put away all forms of distractions. Maintain eye contact with your friend, while leaning forward and tilting your head slightly. Do not interrupt your friend., Throughout the discussion, your friend’s explanation or justification for their jealous comments and actions may surprise you. While you might perceive that your friend’s behavior is driven by jealousy, your friend may insist that they are not envious of you at all. Your friend’s critical words may be due to their disapproval of your actions or a new relationships. Or, perhaps the source of your friend’s jealousy seems completely ludicrous to you. Instead of disputing their claim, listen carefully to their explanation. Attempt to see the issue from their perspective.


Instead of dismissing their emotional response, validate their feelings. “I understand why you feel that _____.” “I can see how my actions upset you.” “I get why you felt jealous of my (success, wardrobe, vacation, etc.).”
If you take issue with your friend’s justification for their actions, remain civil, acknowledge the validity of their response, and politely agree to disagree.Don’t tell your friend how they do or do not feel.

, As a trusting, loving, and devoted friend, you are a great person to help your friend overcome their jealousy. You can assist them through this process in a variety of ways. Perhaps they need to see that you are not as perfect, happy, or put together as you appear or maybe they need to hear from you that they are valuable, special, and successful.


If they are jealous of your success, help them recognize the value in their accomplishments.
If they are struggling with depression, assist them through a difficult time.
If their life at home is less than ideal, provide them with an opportunity to get out more or share struggles you’ve had with your own family.
If their trying to overcome a negative body image, compliment them everyday.
If they are struggling with insecurities, reveal some of your own fears., Toxic friendships are detrimental to your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. Is your jealous friend really just a toxic individual? If so, your attempts to rationally discuss their jealous behavior may prove fruitless. Common characteristics of toxic individuals include:


Need to control others
Disregard for personal boundaries
Selfishness
Need to always be right
Dishonesty
Inability to accept responsibility for their actions
Tendency to play the victim, If your friend is a toxic individual, it may be in your best interest to take steps to either confront their negative behavior in an effort to improve or end the relationship. When you confront their harmful behavior:


Acknowledge that you are coming from a place of love and honesty. “In the best interest of our friendship and my wellbeing, I must tell you the truth.
Tell them explicitly how you feel. “I feel _______ when you _______.”
Ask them to stop their behavior. “Are you willing to stop _______ so that we can have a healthier relationship?”, Boundaries can provide structure and stability to a toxic relationship. Once you set these boundaries, they are non-negotiable—do not let your friend bully you into changing the boundaries. You can start to set boundaries for your toxic relationship by answering these questions:


When can your friend contact you?
How can they contact you?
In what circumstances will you contact your friend?
How will you contact them if you must get ahold of them?
Will you ignore or acknowledge them when you see them in public?
Will you block them on social media?
May they remain in contact with your family members?, If this individual can not honor the terms of your agreement, it is time to sever ties. Let them know that you can no longer maintain a relationship with them. When you confront this individual, have a clear and concise explanation ready.


They may pressure you for further details or attempt to manipulate your words. If this occurs, remind yourself that you don’t need to justify your decision.Ending this relationship will be a process. Toxic individuals struggle to respect boundaries. As a result, cutting these individuals out of your life becomes a long, trying process. Remain firm in your resolution as you persistently work towards distancing yourself from them."

Take stock of the things that your friend does that bother you.,
Deal with your emotions.,
Determine whether or not the problem warrants a confrontation.,
Develop strategies for situations that do not require confrontation.",How to Deal With a Mean Friend1," When you are alone, think about the things you’re your friend does and identify the reasons why they bother you. Identifying these issues in the relationship will help you to work out strategies for how to cope and, hopefully, improve the relationship. Does she often cancel plans with you at the last minute? Does she yell at you? Does she flirt with that guy that you like, even after you told her that you like him?


If you have trouble identifying exactly what your friend does that bothers you so much, you may want to discuss your friend with another friend or someone else that you trust. ;
, After you have identified the things that your friend does that bother you, think about how those things make you feel. It is important to acknowledge the pain and other emotions that your friend has caused you and deal with those emotions in a healthy manner. If you refuse to acknowledge your emotions and deal with them, they may erupt in an unexpected or inappropriate manner. , Confronting your friend will be difficult for you and even more difficult for him or her. Before you decide to confront the person, think about whether or not the issue is a big enough deal to require a confrontation. If you confront the person and the issue is rather minor, you may end up looking like you are nit-picking and that can cause more problems in the relationship. , Not all problems are worth confronting your friend about, but you should still prepare yourself to handle common situations that you think may not be worth a confrontation. Having strategies in place can also help you to feel more in control when your mean friend says or does things that upset you. If your friend often cancels plans with you at the last minute, make backup plans to lessen the damage of her canceling on you. If certain topics cause your friend to make rude or insulting comments, avoid discussing those topics with him or her. "

Stay calm.,
Ask what is wrong.,
Ask what you can do to help.,
Change the setting.,
Ask if your friend wants you to stay or leave.",How to Deal With a Moody Friend1," When someone is moody, it doesn’t help them if their friends are also tense or upset. It is unlikely that your friend’s moodiness is the result of something you did, so don’t take it personally.If you feel yourself getting upset or tense, use some calming techniques before talking to your friend. Taking slow, deep breaths is a well-known way to reach a calm place. You can also try counting backwards or actively counting your breaths. This will distract you from a stressful situation and help you center yourself.;
, If your friend is normally even-tempered, their moodiness might be caused by something that is happening in their life. Maybe they are sick or tired. Maybe they’ve failed a test. Sometimes just knowing someone cares is enough to bring them out of their funk.Make sure your tone says you are asking because you care. You can try stating what you see, then asking if everything is alright — ""You don't seem to be yourself today. Is everything OK?"" or ""Your reaction seemed a little over-the-top. You OK?""
Your friend might not be able to articulate what is causing them to feel sad one minute and happy the next. But just trying to put it into words will often take the emotion out of the situation and help your friend get back on an even keel.

, Your friend might just want a hug to feel better and you won’t know if you don’t ask. Or maybe they just want someone to sit and listen without judgment. Asking if you can help will also make your friend realize that their moodiness is being noticed, and sometimes that is all it takes for a person to change their mood., If you friend is feeling sad, a change of scenery can help. Try taking them out for lunch or plan a fun activity with other friends. If you friend is laughing inappropriately or feeling manic, suggest that the two of you go someplace quieter.

, Sometimes moody people just want to be left alone until they feel better. Other times they want to talk. Ask your friend and let them guide you.


If your friend asks you to leave, be sure to check on them later. You don’t want them to feel abandoned.

Tell them you love them for themselves.,
Foster a safe atmosphere when you talk to them.,
Approach your friend about their bragging.,
Speak clearly about your concern.",How to Deal With a Bragging Friend2," Some people brag because they feel insecure and feel that others will only love them if they are amazing.Tell your friend that you care about them no matter what. Explain that you are not the kind of person to judge someone for their successes or possessions, and that what matters to you is their heart.


Make an effort to tell your friend how much you care, and compliment them on little things. You could tell your friend, for example, ""Dakota, I really loved spending time with you today. You're great to talk with.""
Once they know that you are not impressed by their bragging, they may feel uncomfortable bragging around you in the future.

, Often, people who brag are less self-confident than they appear. Your friend might brag because they feel insecure around you. Build a safe space in your conversations where you and your friend can express themselves authentically.Creating this safe space depends on your attitude. If you approach them compassionately, this will show and your friend will feel comfortable. If you feel angry around them, they will sense this, too, and become more nervous.

, If nothing else works, talk to them about how their behavior hurts. Tell them that you feel alienated when they one-up you or that you feel like they don't care about you. Ask them if they could be more conscious of their behavior.


Avoid seeming confrontational. Instead of putting the blame on them (e.g.: ""You brag too much!""), put the emphasis on your feelings (e.g.: ""I feel hurt when you one-up what I say.""), While you might feel tempted to vaguely mention how much you hate bragging, your friend might not take the hint.


Say something like, for example, ""Hey, Henry, can we talk? I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I felt hurt when you started talking about your dog after I told you my dog just died. It made me feel like you aren't paying attention to me. I feel like I listen to you when we talk. Can you please listen to me?""

Ask yourself if the relationship is healthy.,
Give yourself space.,
End the friendship, if needed.,
Move on.",How to Deal With a Bragging Friend3," If nothing else works, you may consider limiting or ending your friendship. Letting go of a friendship is a serious decision. Think carefully about your friendship and whether it is worth holding onto, or if you need time away from them.You and your friend might just be going through a rough patch. Has your friend always been the one-upping type? If not, they might be struggling in their personal life. Postpone ending the friendship until you know what's going on.
Face the tough questions. How do you feel when you're around them? Does this person bring out your best, or your worst? Do you care about them, and do they care about you?

, If you don't want to be friends anymore, temporarily separate yourself from them.Think about how you feel. Do you feel better or worse? Do you miss them? How do you want to proceed?


Let your friend know. Tell them the purpose and duration of your break, and answer any questions they have. If you ignore them for seemingly no reason, they may feel confused.Wording this conversation can be hard. Say something like, ""Kelsie, I appreciate our friendship but think we might need some space. I need time to cool down and think about our friendship. Could we take a break from each other for a few days? If you have questions, I'd be happy to answer them.""



, After your break, return to the decision with a clear head. If you felt happier during your separation, ending the friendship might be best.


Don't ignore the person. You don't have to engage with them, but they still deserve basic respect.Tell them your decision. If you avoid them with seemingly no reason, they may feel hurt. Keep their feelings in mind, and avoid insulting them.

You might say, for example, ""Robin, I've appreciated your friendship but think it might be best if we spend less time together. When you brag, I feel like you don't care about me. I know we talked about this in the past, but I don't think either of us changed after we talked. You are a great person, but I think we might not work well together. I think it would be a good idea if we spend less time around each other. Is that alright?""



, When you've been hurt by a friend, painful feelings might linger. You may feel anger, grief, or a deep sense of loss. In the case of painful relationships, distance is the best medicine. Do whatever you must to move on.Block their number and avoid spending time around them.


If your old friend persistently contacts you, do not respond more than necessary. Be polite, but avoid falling into old habits.
Do not react if they insult you in-person or through social media. Instead, let a close friend know, and tell a trusted adult if you are underage. They can help you deal with the situation.
Your friend might realize how their behavior affects others and apologize later. It's up to you whether you want to rekindle the relationship: don't let them pressure you into it if you're not ready.

Wait until your anger has subsided.,
Plan out your complaint.,
Structure your complaint as a cause and effect statement: “When you _____, it makes me feel _____.”


Remember to keep your complaint short and to the point.,
Confront your friend.",How to Deal With a Mean Friend2," Don’t confront the person while you are still angry or upset. Wait until you have cooled down and vented your feelings to another friend or in writing. Confronting your friend while you are still angry or feeling hurt makes you seem vulnerable and it may affect the results of your confrontation. , Write out what you want to say to the person to help guide you when you actually confront him or her. If you think you might get flustered during your conversation, having your main points written out on a notecard may help you when you actually deliver the complaint to him or her.

, Do not include any unnecessary details in your complaint. Providing too many details will lessen the impact of your complaint and it may leave your friend confused about the exact purpose of your complaint. If you feel especially nervous about confronting your friend, you may want to practice with another trusted friend to make yourself feel more confident.

, When you feel prepared to confront your friend, take a deep breath and deliver your complaint how you practiced it. Keep a low, even tone to your voice and be kind and polite as you confront the person. If you seem calm, your friend will be more likely to respond in a like manner.


Don’t lose control or retort with insults if your friend becomes irate. If things begin to fall apart, simply thank your friend for hearing your complaint and excuse yourself. In a worst case scenario, you can still control your own behavior and you will feel better knowing that you handled the situation in a mature, intelligent manner. "

Learn to love yourself.,
Defend yourself.,
Respond calmly and kindly.,
Refuse to be insulted, even if it’s passive aggressive or subtle.,
Get out of the relationship.",How to Deal With a Mean Friend3," Part of the reason why certain comments that your mean friend makes may bother you so much is because he or she is commenting on things that you are self-conscious about. One of the easiest ways to defend yourself against these types of remarks is to deepen your acceptance of yourself. Learning to love yourself (even your imperfections) is not easy and it will take time, but working on your relationship with yourself can help to protect you against mean comments and behavior. Accept yourself for who you are. Take time each day to appreciate the person you are. Acknowledge your strengths and triumphs (even the small ones.) Forgive yourself when you make a mistake. Don’t beat yourself up if you make a mistake, just forgive yourself and move on. Treat yourself well. Don’t do things that make you feel uncomfortable or allow others to pressure you into doing things that you don’t really want to do. Do things that make you feel happy and fulfilled. Learn to say no. Don’t say yes every time someone asks for a favor or wants you to do something with them. , If your friend says something mean to you, let him or her know that those comments were hurtful and that you’d like them to lay off. At first, respond with a casual comment to let your friend know that his or her comments are hurtful. Try saying something like, “Ouch! That was kind of mean. Could you not say things like that to me, please?” If the meanness continues, let him or her know that you are serious by saying something like, “I’m not joking. You are being unnecessarily mean. Knock it off.” Practice delivering these requests until they sound natural. Be firm when you speak and use direct eye contact so that the person sees that you are confident and serious. Be persistent. Don’t stop defending yourself just because the behavior continues. The more you practice this type of self-defense, the more your friend will get the idea that their words are hurtful and that you will not tolerate them. , If your friend yells at you, he or she probably expects you to yell back. And if you do yell back, he or she will yell back louder, and so on. Instead of retaliating in like manner to your friend’s anger or meanness, respond calmly and kindly. This unexpected approach will confuse and redirect the behavior. For example, if your friend yells at you for a mistake you made, don’t yell back. Respond in a calm, kind voice. Say something like, “I am sorry that what I did upset you, but I don’t think it was such a big deal that we can’t discuss it reasonably.”

, If your mean friend tends to belittle or speak to you in a condescending tone, respond to this type of behavior by calling him or her out on this behavior. This technique works especially well when others are present who will support your condemnation of this type of negative communication. For example, if your friend says something to insult you (or someone else), try responding with something like, “Come on Jimmy, making remarks like that is beneath you. Show everyone that you are better than that.”

, If this person is constantly beating you down and refuses to change after you have confronted him or her, your best option is to get out of the relationship. Don’t hope in vain for things to change because it is more likely that they will become worse the longer you are attached to the person. If the person is someone you have to see on a regular basis because you go to school together, work together, or something else, try to engage with the person as little as possible. "

Take care of yourself.,
Be matter-of-fact about what you want to do.,
Take a break.,
Ignore their moods.,
Put some distance between you.",How to Deal With a Moody Friend2," Sometimes, your friend's emotions can overwhelm you. If you feel yourself being drawn into their drama, give yourself permission to ignore their texts and calls, or to join another group at lunch. Engage your friend on your terms to keep your life in control.


Some moody people use their moods to control their friends and gain attention. If you feel you are always tip toeing around a friend, and always the one who is making compromises to avoid a scene, your friend might be manipulating you. Be kind, but don’t feel you always need to do things their way just to make them happy or avoid drama.

, When stating what you'd like to do, don't sound timid or, on the other hand, aggressive. Simply say something like — ""I'd rather go to the movies than the mall. Want to come along?"" or ""I'm not going to be able to hang out today. See you tomorrow.""

, Don’t feel you need to be with your moody friend 24/7. No one has that much energy to give. Go have fun with someone else. Go for a walk. Getting away for a while will boost your energy and make it easier for you to help your friend., You can’t change how another person feels, but you can change how you react to them. Treat your moody friends the same way you treat your non-moody friends., If nothing you do seems to help, and your friend’s moods are interfering with your ability to enjoy life, it might be time to step back from the friendship. It might seem drastic, but sometimes the best thing you can do for someone is let them experience the natural consequences of their behavior."
"
Get help for excessive mood swings.,
Help your friend find professional resources.,
Get help immediately if your friend mentions suicide.",How to Deal With a Moody Friend3," If your friend is having intense mood swings, you should look for professional help. School counselors are a good place to start. Your friend’s parents or partner should also be notified if the mood swings seem too far out of normal.


Some signs that your friend needs more help than you can give include uncontrollable sadness, anger and crying. Uncontrollable laughter and manic highs are also signs that your friend’s mood swings are more serious than normal.Your friend might need professional help if their moods swings are caused by drug or alcohol abuse. Eating disorders can also cause mood swings. Friends exhibiting this behavior need more support than you can give. Don’t hesitate to seek outside help., If your friend’s moods are interfering with their life or ability to keep friends, counseling can help. Your friend might not be able to focus enough to find help themselves. You can do the legwork and research to find appropriate resources.


Corporate HR offices and school counseling centers can help guide you. There are several help lines listed online that will provide trained personnel to talk with your friend and suggest local resources. You can also look for free or low-cost services through the mental health division at your local hospital or medical center.

, Most people hesitate to do anything when their friend talks about wanting to die because they don’t want to over-react. But if your friend talks about suicide, you need to get help right away. Don’t assume they are just kidding or looking for attention.


Encourage your friend to call a suicide hotline. They can reach an adviser by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255). If your friend won’t call, you can call to get guidance on what to do."

Ask yourself what you need changed.,
Know why you want these changes.,
Pick an appropriate time and place to talk.,
Talk to your friend calmly.,
Make your boundaries clear.,
Reinforce the boundary that you have set.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Refuses to Change1," If you plan to approach your friend and tell them to change, you need to lay out examples of what you expect to change. This may be that a friend is overbearing, too needy, or otherwise interferes with your personal space. It may also be that the friend is being self destructive, and you feel the need to intervene.Making a bulleted list may seem harsh, but is a good way to stay on point and address issues with your friend. For example:

Please do not discuss my relationship unless I bring it up.
Please do not comment on how much money I make.
Please refrain from trying to convert my religious views.

;
, Are these changes for your convenience, for your friend’s well-being, or a necessary factor in continuing the friendship? When you tell your friend that they have to change something about themselves, they are likely to ask why. You need to be ready to open up and give them the truth.If you are addressing several behaviors, make sure you have a good reason for each one. Express how they make you feel, and how they can be improved.

, You should have this talk in person if at all possible. Texts and emails are not reliable ways to communicate highly emotional messages. Pick a time when neither of you are too stressed and meet somewhere that you won’t be interrupted.You might decide to meet for a Saturday morning coffee at a quiet local coffee house, for example.

, Your friend deserves respect. Use “I” statements and avoid placing blame on your friend. Make your case for change without raising your voice or threatening your friend with consequences.You might say something like “I feel very judged when you compare our incomes. I am not comfortable with it, and I want you to stop.”

, Avoid vague statements like “things need to change.” Be very direct with your friend and tell them exactly what changes are needed and when your boundaries have been violated. You should remain polite and avoid being insulting, but be assertive.For example, if your friend constantly talks badly about your significant other, you might set a boundary about this kind of talk. You might say something like, “I enjoy being your friend, but I also enjoy my relationship. I feel hurt when you talk badly about my significant other. Please keep those comments to yourself from now on.”

, Setting a boundary and getting someone to respect it can take time, practice and patience.Be prepared to educate, adapt, and remind your friend when the new boundary is not being acknowledged.


For example, if your friend makes a disparaging comment about your husband, then you could say something like, ""Remember when I asked you not to speak negatively about my husband? That comment is an example of what I'm talking about. Please don't say that about him.""
If the person continues to make the same kinds of comments, then you can set a new limit. For example, you might say, ""I've told you how those comments make me feel, and you continue to say them. If it continues, I'm leaving,"" or ""If it continues, I won't be accepting any more of your invitations to dinner.""
If the person continues to ignore the boundary you have set, then follow through with what you said you would do. Leave the room or stop accepting dinner invitations.

Identify how your friend is annoying you.,
Spend time together in a group.,
Limit the amount of contact you have.,
Ignore the person when they annoy you.,
Encourage your friend to have other interests.",How to Cope With an Annoying Friend1," What exactly is your friend doing that is getting on your nerves? Is your friend too clingy? Does your friend gossip or say mean things to you? Is you friend constantly making fun of you? Are you just annoyed by your friend for no reason?The source of the annoyance will help you figure out what you need to do.
If your friend is too clingy, you need to create space between the two of you.
If your friend is being mean and hurtful towards you, you should let them know how you feel.
If you cannot identify why you are so annoyed with your friend, you might need to do some self-evaluation. Have you changed or out grown your friend?;
, Instead of spending time alone with your friend, only see them when other people are around. This can create a buffer between the two of you. You will not have to talk to your friend as much. If your friend starts being annoying, you will still have other people you can talk to.


Make sure that other people are around when you hang out with your annoying friend. For example, make plans with some other friends and then invite the annoying friend to come along or eat lunch with a group of people instead if just you and your friend.
If your friend invites you to go somewhere and you know it will only be the two of you, decline the offer or ask if you can bring someone else along.

, If you want to maintain the friendship, you can create some space between the two of you. This will give you the break from the person and send a signal to the person to change their behavior.


If the person calls and/or texts too much, do not respond to them every single time. Only answer when you feel like it or really want to talk to them.If you have to call them back, call them when you are about to do something else. This way you can keep the conversation short. For example, you could call and say, ""Hey, I saw your missed call. I'm about to eat dinner with my family, what's up?""

, Your friend may be engaging in certain behaviors because they enjoy the response and attention you give. Your friend may say negative things or complain a lot to get sympathy and attention form you. Your friend may make fun of other people to get laughs. By responding, you may actually be encouraging the annoying behavior.The person may eventually stop the behavior if you ignore them.
For example, if your friend is always making fun of others to get laughs, stop laughing and do not respond at all when they make a comment.
If other friends have noticed the annoying behaviors, all of you should stop responding.
When you ignore the person, do not roll your eyes or make a face.This is still a reaction to what the person is doing. You may also hurt your friend's feelings if you are rude.

, If you have a clingy friend, encourage them to try a new hobby or spend time with other people. This will take some of the pressure of off you. Your friend will be less annoying to you when you spend time together.You may tell your friend, ""I love being friends with you, but I think we should try to meet new people too.""
If your friend tells you about an activity they did without you, tell them how great that is and you are proud of them.
You can also suggest specific activities for your friend to do. Choose activities that your friend is interested in, but you are not interested in. For example, if your friend likes to draw but you do not, find an art class or art exhibit and tell your friend about it.

Realize that you do not make decisions for your friend.,
Set boundaries for yourself.,
Control your response to the unwanted behavior.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Refuses to Change2," Even if you feel like your friends decisions are bad for them, they aren’t your decisions to make. If you have talked to your friend about changing, you can do no more. If you have decided to remain friends, you must respect your friend as a person.Do not try to manipulate or force your friend into doing things your way. You can voice your opinion, and then accept the decision that your friend makes.

, Though you do not make your friend’s decisions, you do get to decide what you will participate in and/or tolerate. Make your boundaries clear to your friend and don’t do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Be clear that your friend must show you the same respect that you show them.If your friend likes to drive recklessly, you might want to say “I will go out to eat with you, but I will not ride in the car with you.”

, You are always in control of your behavior. If you don’t like something your friend is doing, you have the right to remove yourself from the situation. This does not give you the right to belittle your friend or hurt them. They will act as they see fit, and you can act as you see fit.For instance, if you friend is sneaking into the park pool to go skinny dipping, you are under no obligation to go. This doesn’t mean that you should yell at your friend about how irresponsible they are.

Tell your friend that you can no longer be friends.,
Allow yourself to grieve.,
Let yourself be happy.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Refuses to Change3," You should have this conversation in person if possible. You will be able to more kindly end the friendship. Know what you want to say to your friend and be honest, but kind. This will allow you and your friend to have closure to move past the ending friendship.If you are ending the friendship because your friend has offended you in a way that you cannot forgive, tell them what they did as calmly as possible. For example, you could say “I know we have been friends for a long time, but your comments about the way I parent crossed the line. I think it is best that we go our separate ways.”

, Losing a friend will hurt. It won’t matter if you made the decision to end the friendship or not. Give yourself closure and time to get over your lost friendship. Let go of grudges and forgive yourself and your friend for the failed relationship., Do things that you enjoy doing. Shop at your favorite stores, take a vacation, or try a new activity. Making new friends that have behaviors more like your own will provide you with a support system and happiness for years to come."

Tell your friend how you feel.,
Listen to your friend's point of view.,
Come up with a solution together.,
Give your friend time to change.",How to Cope With an Annoying Friend2," Your friend may be doing something that you find annoying, but have no idea that it gets on your nerves. Your friend probably cares about you and does not want to annoy you. However, your friend won't be able to stop if you do not tell them.For example, your friend may joke with you a lot and it hurts your feelings. However, your friend thinks that it is all in good fun. Simply tell your friend, ""Hey, it kind of hurts my feelings when you pick at me like that. Could you stop doing it so much?""
Be as nice as possible when you talk to your friend. Write down or practice what you will say.

, Once you tell your friend how you feel, it is important that you allow your friend to respond and to listen to them. Your friend may explain their behavior and why they have been acting a certain way. Ask your friend why have they been engaging in the annoying behavior. Your friend could also have a negative response and be unwilling to change.


If your friend is unwilling to change, you might need to change the nature of your friendship permanently.For example, if your friend refuses to stop gossiping, you may need to set new boundaries for your friendship. Maybe you will not talk about certain topics with this friend from now on.
Your friend could just be going through an annoying phase or be having some personal issues. For example, your friend could be trying to get more attention from you because they are having some family problems at home. It is important that you listen to the other person to get to the root of the problem.

, You may be able to help your friend with their annoying behavior. Tell your friend that you really value their friendship, but you two need to make some changes so you can stay friends. The solution is more likely to work if both of you contribute. You do not want your friend to feel like you are being bossy or critical of them.


For example, if your friend needs to stop gossiping, tell your friend that you will remind them to stop when you see them gossiping. You could even create a little hand signal to do when the two of you are around other people. This way you can tell your friend to stop without embarrassing them.
If your friend is annoying because they are constantly complaining about something, volunteer to help your friend improve in that area., Change does not happen overnight. If you and your friend had a good talk and your friend is willing to change, give your friend some time. If you have set new boundaries for your friendship, it will take time for both of you to get used to them.


Friendships go through ups and downs and change over time. As long as both you and you are friend are willing to work through your issues, you two can still be friends.You may need to have multiple conversations about your friendship throughout the process.

Know when to end the friendship.,
Try a trial separation.,
End the friendship if necessary.",How to Cope With an Annoying Friend3," All friendships are not meant to last forever. You may do everything you can to stay friends, but it just does not work out. Always give your best effort before you decide to stop being friends with someone. You may need to end the friendship if:You and your friend are constantly arguing and can never seem to get along.
Your friendship makes you feel bad about yourself or hurts your self-esteem.
If you always feel uncomfortable or nervous around your friend.

, If you feel like you no longer want to be friends, have a trial separation so you can be sure.This will give you time to see what it would be like to not have this person in your life. Having time away will also give you a clearer head and a different perspective on your friendship.


When you decide to take a break, be clear about the purpose and the length of the break. You may say, ""Hey, we have not been getting along lately. I think we should spend some time apart. We can talk about things in 2 weeks.""
Use this time to think and journal about your friendship. Do you miss the person? Are you happier now that you are not spending time with them? What things need to change?

, You may be ready to make a decision once your friendship break is over. If you decide to end the friendship, let the person know. Do not cut them out of your life without telling them. If you were truly friends, you owe them an explanation.Be honest and respectful of the other person's feeling when you talk to them.
You may say, ""I care about you a lot, but our friendship has changed. I am really sad about this, but I don't think we should be friends anymore.""

You might remember their phone number or their email address, but removing them from your phone, computer, tablet, address book etc. can make it at least a little bit more difficult for you to quickly contact them.
For example, if you delete your ex’s contact information from your phone, it’ll be less tempting to just tap their name and send a text or give them a call — at the very least, it’ll make you think before you do so.;
, If the person still calls or texts you, if you have a smart phone you can download an app that blocks their calls and texts so that you don’t receive notifications.


Doing this is particularly useful if you’re working hard to keep your mind off of them, as every time they call/text you’ll be reminded of them, and you may be tempted to respond.

, If they often contact you via email, have their messages immediately directed into a separate folder instead of your inbox. You can do this by creating an email filter — directions on how to do this will differ depending on the provider.

, If you’re struggling to get over someone, having them on your Facebook, Twitter etc. is a terrible idea. Instead of just deleting them, block them; this way, you won’t see anything that they post, and vice versa.


It may be tempting to see what the person is up to on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or some other social media site. Avoid the urge to check up on them, as this will only make it more difficult to get over them and move on with your own life.

, Delete old texts and other communications such as emails, FB messages, WhatsApp chats etc. You have better things to do with your time than pour over those old messages and feel upset.

, Before getting rid of photos, think about whether they depict a part of your life that you really want to forget forever.


As time goes on, you might look back on the relationship or at least the time period in your life fondly.
If there’s a chance you’ll regret getting rid of the photos, consider putting them in a box or on to a flash drive, and then giving them to a friend for safe-keeping until you’re feeling well enough to look at them again.

, Go around your room or house and remove anything that reminds you of the person. You may want to put those things in a box until you feel ready to deal with them.


You may want to donate or even burn those things at some point, but for now, just stow them away so that they’re not constant reminders of your loss.
If you do decide to burn things, ensure that you do so in a safe area where having a fire is legal — for example, an outdoor fire pit, not your bedroom floor.

, Studies have shown that we have a better chance of regulating our feelings when we view them scientifically, as controllable (albeit perhaps unexpected) points of data in the experiment of life.If you received unexpected results in an experiment, you’d examine the experiment, see where it deviated, and look at the results in light of the deviation. You’d then come up with a plan for your next steps. It may feel sociopathic, but it really can help to approach your broken heart in this way.
It may not feel as though you have control over your feelings right now, but with some persistence, you can train your brain to respond in a controlled manner — for example, to view things calmly and objectively instead of taking them personally.

, Losing someone you love can throw you through a tornado of emotions: shock, numbness, disbelief, anger, sadness, fear — even relief and happiness. You might even feel some of these at the same time.


Instead of fighting your feelings, try to accept them and allow them to just be. It can help to take a step back and try to observe your emotions, detach yourself from them. Remind yourself that what you’re feeling is totally natural.
You might say to yourself, “I’m grieving the loss of this relationship, and these are the feelings involved with that.”, You can do this by writing them down or even recording yourself speaking about them. The important thing is not to keep your feelings bottled up inside, as this can make it more difficult to move on.


Some experts recommend journalling every day. This can help you get in touch with your feelings and even figure out how to get over them.
If you’re out and you feel the need to vent, use a notepad or a note-taking app on your phone to jot down what you’re feeling.
Recording your feelings can be particularly useful when you want to communicate with the person you miss or are upset with. Instead of contacting them, write them a letter or record yourself saying what you'd like to say to them. Do not send them the message though. This is just to help you. You might even find it useful to destroy the letter/recording once it’s done.

, It takes 2 people to start a relationship, and 2 people to end it. This means you did not have complete control over the relationship, as you can only control yourself.


Don’t play the relationship over and over again in your head. Don’t dwell on what could have been done differently; it’s over now, and in any case it may have had little to do with you -- for example, you might have just wanted different things in life.
Instead of asking yourself “why me” or telling yourself “I’m worthless”, think about what you would have changed about how you behaved, and use that to grow and move on.
Rather than beating yourself up, work on taking care of yourself. You can start by feeling proud of yourself for having the maturity to want to grow from this experience.

, When a relationship ends, many of us fixate on the good things and torture ourselves thinking about what we're missing out on. By reminding yourself of the bad things in your relationship, you can start to see the breakup as a positive thing.


In addition to the things you didn’t like about them and the relationship, think about whether the person brought out things in you that you didn’t like — for example, “When I was with you, I was flakey to my friends and always ditched them for you. I also didn’t pursue my own hobbies any more, and felt like I was just becoming a version of you.”
It can be helpful to make a list of all the bad things in the relationship; just make sure that you keep it in a safe space or destroy it. Don’t show it to anyone else — especially not the person you’re trying to get over. It’ll only cause drama and make it harder for you to move on.

, When someone does something hurtful to someone else, it often comes from a place of hurt within that person. That’s why it’s important to see them with compassion.Instead of feeling hateful and angry toward them, try to feel sorry for them. They might be dealing with something on a conscious or even unconscious level that you know nothing about.

, Studies have shown that people recover faster from trauma if they can talk about it.Whether it’s your friends and family, or people you’re close with online, reach out to people who you know will take your feelings seriously and help console you.


Don’t talk to people who will be dismissive of your feelings, as they will only make you feel worse.
If you’re really struggling with your feelings, you might even consider seeing a counsellor. A good counsellor will be able to give you practical advice for moving on.
While it’s healthy to talk about your feelings, you need to make sure that it’s not all you talk about, otherwise you’ll risk alienating the people closest to you. If you’re worried you may be talking about it too much, ask the person you’re talking to how they’re feeling. A good friend will let you know what’s up without getting upset at you.

, Studies have shown that while it is necessary to let your feelings out, if you dwell excessively on them, you may suffer the same negative consequences as you would if you kept your feelings bottled up.Studies have shown that focusing on yourself and not taking action to get out of your own head and lift your mood can land you in long-term depression., Healing from an ended relationship takes time; don't expect yourself to get over it right away. You may never fully stop loving this person, but with time, the love will fade.


It’s likely that one day you’ll look back and be able to smile at how intensely you thought you loved this person, when all they are to you now is a memory of a very different time in your life.

, As you try to get over this person, you’ll have good days and bad ones. Being positive doesn’t mean ignoring your bad days; it means believing that the good ones will come again.


Some days you might even find it difficult to get out of bed. That’s okay. Have a positive attitude toward it. It can be helpful to even let yourself have a whole day in bed just reading or watching movies, or listening to sad music and crying your eyes out. Tell yourself, “Okay, I'll take this day to acknowledge my sadness, but tomorrow I’ll go for a run. I know I’m strong enough to get through this.”

, Examine the data of your failed relationship. Where did it go wrong? Studies show that viewing your relationship scientifically can help you regain a better sense of self and heal more quickly after a breakup.Try to take a step back and consider what the contributing factors might have been that could have caused the breakup. Just remember not to spend too much time on it — you are trying to learn a lesson and grow from it, not beat yourself up over where you went wrong.
This doesn’t necessarily mean thinking about where you went wrong. It might even be something simple like “We are actually very different people with different goals.”
You can have fun with this by spending a few hours on it and really treating it like an experiment, with charts and graphs.

, It’s easier to accept our mistakes in life when we view them as opportunities to learn. Regarding the end of your relationship as an opportunity to learn might help you view it in a more positive light.


It’s common after a breakup to feel as though you’ve wasted your time. If you view the relationship as a learning experience, it’s not waste of time at all. Things that help you grow and learn are not a waste of time.

, When you lose someone who you love, it can feel like you’ve lost half of yourself. It will help you move on to rebuild your sense of who you are, apart from the person you loved and lost.A good writing exercise to build your concept of self is to simply label a page “Who am I?” or “What makes me, me?” and then note your responses.

, Studies have shown that forbidding yourself from thinking about something will only make you think about it more.Instead of telling yourself not to think bout the person you want to get over, when the thought comes into your mind, gently remind yourself that they’re no longer part of your life, and then put your attention back on something that benefits you., When someone we love leaves us, our minds can become consumed with thoughts about them. Telling yourself not to think about the person doesn’t work, but telling yourself “not now, later” does.


Whenever a thought about the person comes into your head, push it away and tell yourself that you’ll return to the thought later when you’ve reached the time in the day that you are allowed to think about that person.
When the time comes, you can sit quietly and think about them all you want. Set a timer to make sure you don't go too long. You might try starting with two 10-minute periods a day — one in the morning and one in the evening.
Try not to make the person the last thing you think about every night. If possible, read an engaging book or do yoga before bed; thoughts of the person might still come into your mind, but you can tell them to go away until the next time you’ve set to think about them.

, Sit down somewhere comfortable and try to visualize a box in front of you. Put all of your memories into that box and then close the lid.


Hold the imaginary box in your hands and then blow it away. When the thoughts come back into your head later, tell yourself “No, those are gone now” and try to quickly think of something else.

, Each day, try to focus on the moment in which you're living. To dwell on the past or future might only make you long to be elsewhere in time. This isn’t useful, as the only time you have is right now.


It’s still important to have goals and work towards them, but you do not need to think about these goals all the time. If you do, you might be so focused on the future that you forget to do the things that must be done in the present in order to reach your goals!
You don’t want to look back on your life a year from now and realize that you've wasted the past year being depressed and doing nothing because of how sad you were about the loss of that relationship.

, Studies have shown that the simple act of smiling, even if you’re feeling unhappy, can help you feel happier. Try it now — just let the corners of your mouth turn up, and hold it there for at least 30 seconds.


At the very least, you might get a small kick out of how insane you look, staring at your computer and smiling falsely in an attempt to bring on a real one.
If you’re really struggling to do this, try watching some stand-up comedy or something else that will bring a smile to your face, no matter how small it is.

, Do things that will prevent you from giving in to the temptation to contact the person you’re trying to get over. This means making plans on nights when you know you’ll miss them most, and staying busy.


If you know that you’ll feel lonely on Friday night and want to call them, make plans for Friday night. Do this even if you’re depressed and don’t want to do anything. Make plans and try to live in the moment while you’re out with others.

, Socialize and take up new hobbies or revisit old ones. The key is to have fun without the person you loved, because as impossible as it may seem, you are capable of doing so.


You must do things to lift your mood, otherwise you’ll just dwell on your situation and become depressed.Examples of hobbies: music, art, sports, dance, movies, video games, reading, cooking, attending plays or local festivals, checking out museums etc.

, Experts say that the best way to kick an old habit is to adopt a new one. Start a new hobby or rediscover your love for an old one.When you begin to feel sad and like something’s missing, direct your energy toward your new habit instead of thinking about your lost love.Note that this does not mean you should start seeing someone new or otherwise try to replace the person you loved with a new person. That would be an unhealthy thing to do.

, It can be hard to move on from a relationship when you feel like part of you is missing. Rebuild your concept of who you are without that person.


A good way to do this is to spend some time alone and explore your hobbies, feelings etc. This might not be possible for the first few weeks or months. You’ll know you’re ready when you’re not thinking of that person every single waking second of the day.

, When you’re dealing with grief it’s more important than ever to take good care of yourself, both mentally and physically. Do things that make you feel good on the inside and outside.


Eat well, drink plenty of water, get enough sleep and exercise, meditate — you might even buy yourself a new outfit or get a nice haircut.
Experts say that stress is the primary trigger for indulging in addictions, and this includes exes. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, tired or otherwise stressed out, you’ll have more difficulty resisting the temptation to connect with the person you’re trying to get over.Studies show that nurturing the parts of yourself that you neglected during a relationship can help you move on., Think about what unhealthy behaviours you turn to when you’re feeling upset or stressed, and try to avoid these. Common unhealthy coping behaviours include the following:


Drinking, using drugs, eating too much or too little, isolating yourself from loved ones, engaging in aggressive or violent behaviour, spending too much time on the Internet, or pretty much any other excessive behaviour (gaming, shopping, watching pornography, exercising etc.).
For example, if you know that you tend to binge eat, counter this by going for a walk or a run, or doing something with your hands such as drawing or crafts.

, It’s common to desire justice when you feel you’ve been wronged; however, studies have shown that far from making people feel better, revenge actually increases stress and impairs health.Some studies have shown that taking revenge can actually force you to play the situation over and over again in your head, whereas not getting revenge helps make the situation seem less significant, making it easier to forget., You are not a worthless person. That person you loved did not throw you away; things just didn’t work out. It’s not being conceited to know that you’re a worthy person (that is, as long as you don’t think you’re more worthy than others).


If you struggle to see your worth, sit down and write a list of things you like about yourself. It might only be one thing the first day, and even that might be a struggle, but if you do it every day, maybe within a week you’ll be able to come up with five good things about yourself — maybe after a few months you’ll be able to fill a page.

, You are responsible for your own happiness and your own life choices. No one else is. If you don’t do things to lift your mood and change your life, you will stay sad and could even enter a depression.


If you’ve been hurt by someone, don't let them hurt you any more than they already have by sinking into a depression that may stall your life., Having meaningful goals to work toward will give you a compelling reason to stop dwelling on the person you lost and start working to make your life better.


For example, if you’re about to go from high school to college, challenge yourself to get the best marks possible and to get into a college program that you will love.
If you’re unsure of what you want to do next in life, take time to explore your options. If you’re in school, see a career counsellor. If you’re not, try asking some close friends and family about your strengths, and what they think you’d be good at.

, It may not feel like it right now, but you’ll meet someone else who works even better with you. When you meet them, you’ll be grateful that things didn’t work out with the person you’re trying to get over right now.


The more you grow, the more you know what works, and this will help you find someone who better suits you.

, There is no set time for how long it takes to get over someone. It varies by person and relationship — some people may only need a couple of months, while others will need years.If you’re still thinking about your ex regularly, you will not be able to devote the necessary attention to a healthy new relationship.It’s important to feel confident in yourself before starting a new relationship. If you’re scared to be alone, this is not the time to start something new."

Look at couple’s counseling.,

For example, when you go out for dinner or drinks, talk to your partner in advance about whether one of you will handle the bill, whether you will split it evenly, or whether you want to split it by item.
If you live with your partner, sit down with them a few times a year to have conversations about your current financial situation. Discuss where you both are financially, what you are working toward, and what goals you each have for the future.
Understand that there will be some things you and your partner may not agree on. The point of having a conversation is to understand where your partner is coming from, not to make them see things your way.;
, A partner with a lower education level may want to pursue further education, or they may be happy with their current education and want to focus more on career or personal goals. Each partner should set individual goals for their life that they can clearly communicate with one another regarding their future.Let your partner know, “I do not want to pursue any further education, but I would like to work more developing a career that helps people.”
Clearly communicating your expectations for yourself will help your partner understand what you want and how to best support you.
Do not set goals or expectations for your partner. Those who allow their partners to choose their own path and support them as they are have the best chances at long term happiness in their relationship.

, Different education levels and differences in career are likely to bring about different ideas of what constitutes success and what constitutes failure. Instead of comparing your partner to your personal metrics, foster empathy within yourself and celebrate or be sad with them as they see fit.If, for example, your partner seeks a higher education while you work, take pride in their accomplishments like high marks on an exam and let them vent their frustrations about a difficult day with a professor.
Approach your relationship with the idea that the two of you may have different problems, but that their joys and concerns are no less valid than yours. Be proud of your partner for their successes, whatever they may be.

, If you feel resentment or a sense of discomfort caused by your educational differences, it may be helpful to talk about them openly and honestly with your partner. Before you have this conversation, however, ask yourself why you think you are having these feelings toward your partner. Remember that a person's level of education does not indicate their worth. If you feel that a difference in education is an issue in your relationship and is leading to resentment, you and your partner should try to understand why that is.


When talking with your partner, use ""I"" statements to affirm how you feel, but try to avoid using ""you"" statements and casting blame.Listen openly and completely to your partner's responses. Allow this to be a discussion rather than an argument.
Let your partner know that you are seeking understanding and compromise. Look to meet in the middle on these issues, with them acknowledging that your feelings are valid and you showing a willingness to work on addressing these problems together.

, You and your partner are likely together at least in part because you have some things in common. Make a daily practice of reminding yourself and your partner about your shared interests and values.


Give your partner small daily compliments such as, ""I love our relationship because we both care deeply about saving rescue dogs. I like that I can see that kind and compassionate side of you.""
Try doing something like reading the same book or taking a class together to engage your shared interests and foster discussions between the two of you.

, Set aside time for you and your partner to actively engage in things you both enjoy, whether that’s staying and watching movies or going out and enjoying the town. Talk with your partner and set aside time that’s dedicated to be just for the two of you to do something you both enjoy.While you might often have evenings where you end up watching movies or playing games together, it’s important to also set aside distinctive “date” time that is dedicated to enjoying your relationship.
Plan your date out a little bit in advance with your partner. Talk about when you want to have your date night and what you both want to do.
Try to make date night a regular thing. Aim to do it anywhere from once a week to once a month.

, Maybe you spent six years getting an advanced degree in Russian literature, or maybe you decided that you didn’t need years of school but you love restoring old motorcycles. Introduce your partner to things you love that they aren’t too familiar with.Be your partner’s guide. If you’re passionate about restoring old motorcycles, for example, walk your partner step-by-step through a specific part of the restoration process. Show and explain the process to them to help them understand more completely.
Understand that your partner may or may not come to love your passions and hobbies the way you do, but that they will still appreciate them because they make you happy.
When it comes time for your partner to introduce you to what makes them happy, give it a fair chance. It does not need to become your new passion, but try to enjoy and engage with it knowing that it is important to your partner.

, You are likely with your partner because you feel a connection with them both emotionally and physically. While sharing hobbies and having open discussions will go a long way in keeping the emotional connection alive, it’s just as important to keep the physical connection going.Be generous in your physical relationship with your partner. Make sure they are receiving what they need to completely enjoy their intimate time with you.
Don’t be afraid to let your partner know what turns you on and what gives you the best results. Speak openly about your interests.

, Generally speaking, your friends and family are likely to have a similar education level to you, and it’s important to keep them close as a support network. When there is something that your partner struggles to empathize with or something you don’t feel comfortable talking to your partner because of your varied background, turn to your support system.Be open and honest with your partner about what is going on in your life. Do not, however, rely on them to provide all of your emotional and mental support.
If there is an issue that your partner is not equipped to handle, talk to someone else in your support system. Likewise, don’t be afraid to tell your partner if there is an issue you cannot address.
If, for example, your partner is working on publishing a monograph and you’ve never been through the publication process before, suggest that they get coffee with one of their colleagues who has already published.

, Counseling can benefit even the happiest and healthiest of relationships by giving couples a space for each partner to be heard. Work with a couple’s counselor on addressing any ongoing issues caused by educational difference in your relationship.


Look specifically for a counselor that specializes in working with couples. You can determine this by looking at profiles online or speaking with the counselor’s office over the phone before an appointment.Talk to your counselor about what you both want to get out of counseling, whether that is to address a specific issue or simply to strengthen your relationship overall.
Counseling is often work. Be prepared to attend weekly or bi-monthly appointments on a regular basis as a pair.

, If you are afraid that a difference in education is going to translate into difference in financial means, bring in a financial planner as an impartial third party. A good planner can help you create a financial plan that takes both of your individual situations into account and works to further the relationship.Research your planner well in advance. Look online for planners that specialize in working with individual households and with customers of different financial backgrounds.
Alternatively, some financial planning firms offer workshops on areas like investment planning and budgeting to help you and your partner get started. Check with local firms to see if any new courses are available for the two of you.

Decide on how close you two are.,
Engage her like you would any friend.,
Compliment her.Compliments go a long way in any type of relationship.,
Make eye contact.,
Tell her you’re excited to see her.,
Ask her what she’s been up to.",How to Greet a Girl1," Depending on how close your relationship is, figure out what feels comfortable between the two of you. If you’re close friends you can probably be more physical, but if you two aren’t super close it’s probably better to keep contact minimal.


Do what makes you feel comfortable. It’s good to step outside of your comfort zone from time to time but when you’re greeting a girl, in general, the more comfortable you are the more she’ll be.;
, Just because she’s a girl doesn’t necessarily mean you have to treat her unlike your guy friends, especially if your relationship is platonic. But also use common sense here and don't do something inappropriate. A simple “Hello” or “Hey” is always a great place to start.


If you’re greeting a girl who is more like one of your guy friends, bump fists with her or give her a playful nudge.
If you two are close enough give her a hug, as physical touch can strengthen relationships., Noticing something about her appearance or even something she has recently done that she’s proud of is a great way to make her feel more comfortable with you, and shows you’re genuinely interested in her.


This doesn’t have to be done in a flirty way, just notice something you like about what she’s wearing. Maybe you like her shoes, or she has a new haircut. Noticing details and pointing them out will make her comfortable around you.

""I really like your shoes. looks really good on you!""
""Did you get a haircut? I really like the new look, it works for you.""



, By looking her in the eyes, you’re making a connection and showing genuine interest.


Keeping eye contact is also a good way to help you stay calm and comfortable. Just focus on her and forget about everything happening around you.

, People like to feel wanted in any capacity and telling her that you’re glad to see her shows that you value her in your life and you like that she’s a part of it.


""It's great to see you! I'm excited we're hanging out.""

, Even if you’re shy by nature or feel awkward in social situations, especially with girls or women, just treat her like any other friend and show that you care about her.


You can even reference something you saw that she did on social media. For example, if she went on a trip a simple ""I saw you went on vacation. I'm so jealous, it looked awesome! Did you have a good time?"" works well.
By asking questions about her day you are further showing interest and that she’s important to you.

Meet up with your Valentine in a quiet place that has some significance to both of you, such as a park or a quiet café/restaurant where you shared your first date.,
Watch your Valentine's smile light up as you present them with their bunch of roses.",How to Give Roses to a Valentine1," Get the roses from a quality flower shop and on the day that you will present your Valentine with them. This adds to the freshness and scent of your roses.;
, Make sure that the piece of paper is the same size as a post-it note.

, Tie up the bunch with some red, silk ribbon. Stick on the quote. Alternatively, you could tuck it behind the ribbon so that it is still visible, but you would have to pull it out to read it.

, Make it personalized so the person feels extra-special. Remember to bring your roses!

, The idea is that the middle (last) rose is fake so it will never wilt, indicating that you will love them forever. This method is for the more romantic type, so if your lover isn't really into that sort of thing, it is best to avoid this.

Determine what space means.,
Develop a plan together.,
Don’t always initiate contact.,
Call a friend when you want to call him.,
Delete his number.,
Take a social media break.,
Practice positive self-talk.,
Find enjoyable activities.",How to Give a Guy Space1," Once you have been asked to provide more space in the relationship, find out what that will mean for the two of you. Perhaps he is just looking to have a bit more alone time on the regular but doesn’t want to cut off communication. Or maybe he is feeling a bit trapped and wants to figure out if this relationship is working for him. Whatever the cause, make sure to clarify the reason as well as next steps.Keep in mind that “space” can mean many things.
It’s also healthy to have a personal life outside of your relationship. If a guy asks for space, it may suggest you need to find personal hobbies and interests apart from the relationship.;
, Your partner might need a break from you completely, and if he does, resist the urge to freak out. Instead, after asking why, develop a plan. You two will need to figure out how long of a break he needs as well as any boundaries that should exist during this time. For instance, perhaps he is asking for a two-week break to sort through some things, during which time he agrees to not initiate romantic contact with anyone else.Determine what you are comfortable with. If you cannot handle two full weeks, then tell him this. If you would like the opportunity to see other people, tell him this as well, but be prepared for him to potentially be upset or angry.

, If you are accustomed to talking to him all day nonstop, it can be difficult to go cold turkey with communication. However, it is necessary that you do not always reach out to him first while he needs space except for in emergencies. He is asking for space for a reason and you should honor his request. Feel free to answer his calls and texts, but don’t always be the first to initiate.


For instance, if he asks for a bit more alone time in the relationship, and you notice that you are the only one who ever calls or texts first, refrain from doing so. Try to establish a more equitable partnership.

, Though you may feel the urge to reach out constantly, you can put a plan in place to avoid this. During the time that he needs space, you don’t want to become needy or else you will push him farther away from you. When you feel that you want to call him, call a friend instead. Your need to be social might be more important than your need to talk to him specifically.


Create a list of friends that you can call so that if one doesn’t answer, you have a few backups. You might also talk with a family member or other loved one.

, If you feel that reaching out to friends is not enough, then delete his number. This will prevent you from calling or texting him, especially if you don’t know his number by heart. When he reaches back out to you, you can save his number in your phone again.

, Seeing your guy on social media might intensify your urge to talk to him, but stay strong. Deactivate your pages for a few days or unfollow him or his posts. You don’t need to go as far as to unfriend him during this time, but you can prevent yourself from seeing the things he posts.Consider unfollowing his friends, as well.

, In addition to switching up how you communicate with him, you should also alter how you communicate with yourself. Perhaps you have been down in the dumps since he asked for space and you aren’t feeling so positive lately. When you begin to feel down, repeat positive, affirming, or productive statements to yourself to override your negativity.You might repeat things to yourself like “I am strong,” “It will be okay,” or “I will not reach out to him today.”

, Try to do things you enjoy and find fun. This might be taking up an activity or exercising. It also might mean catching up with friends for coffee and conversation. This will not only make you feel better in general, but also take your mind off the situation.

Why not try an organized activity like an exercise class or yoga? Hobbies like biking or hiking could be helpful, too.

Introduce yourself with confidence.,
Read her body language.,
Smile at her.,
Learn her name.,
Use humor in your introduction.There’s a reason that people are drawn to comedians and funny people, as laughter can be comforting.,
Don’t overstay your welcome.",How to Greet a Girl2," Whether you’re meeting her for the first time or you don’t know her well, but you have mutual friends, just be friendly and sure of yourself.A simple “It’s very nice to meet you.” is a great opener in this situation.
Remember that in this situation she’s in the same place as you. So don’t feel like you need to one-up her (or anyone else there) or act like someone you aren’t. Just be yourself.

, Remember that you don’t know this girl very well or at all, so reading her body language can give you a good indication of her comfort level. Trying to embrace her with a hug may be too forward if you two aren't close.


You can offer to shake her hand if she seems open to it, or even just give a friendly wave.
Be polite. Like the saying goes, “You catch more flies with honey.” In this scenario you're probably making a first or second impression. Trying to show off or joking with her like you might a good friend could offend her.

, Don’t overdo it though by smiling too big or being too enthusiastic.


Acting too eager to meet her or greet her could make her uncomfortable and make you look like you’re coming on too strong.

, If you’re greeting her in a group of friends, hopefully your friends will properly introduce you, but if you're not introduced, politely ask her name and offer yours.When you learn her name repeat it back to her when you tell her yours.
Making eye contact and using her name can also help you to remember it better.

, When you greet a girl you may not know all that well, some humor will show her that you’re comfortable with yourself (even if you’re nervous) and not a rude person.


Using humor is a great approach when greeting a girl because it can ease any tension.
If you’re shy or nervous you can use a little bit of self-deprecating humor to break any tension and make her feel more comfortable around you. Joke about your appearance or the situation.

""I'm glad dragged me to this, I had a pretty crazy night of Netflix binging planned, but this seems better.""



, Sometimes the best impression is a quick one that leaves her wanting to know more about you.


If you have a hard time making small talk with people, especially when greeting a girl, keep it short and sweet. Don’t try to force any conversation.
If the conversation doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, politely excuse yourself.

"
"
Create a great first impression.,
Go the extra mile.,
Take cues from her.,
Tell her how excited you are to greet her.,
Give her a compliment.",How to Greet a Girl3," You can do this by showing up to where you are meeting a little early. Showing up on time will also give you a few minutes to compose yourself and relax.


Being punctual shows her that you’re mature and reliable.

, Chances are you already know some things about her so use what you know to help break the ice. For example: if she likes flowers, get her favorite one and bring it for her.


This can also be a good way for her to find you if you’ve never met before and are meeting somewhere public.

, Don’t come on too strong; instead wait to see how she acts. Is she being flirty or touchy? Or is she more reserved? You don't always have to wait for her to make a move (sometimes it's better to take the lead and be assertive), but acting too comfortable before you get to know each other can put her off.


Even if you’ve talked before and made a connection, assuming she’ll be comfortable with physical touching might be a bad idea and could make things awkward.
If she does go in for a hug or something like a handshake, meet her halfway.

, Like in the earlier methods, employ eye contact and smile.


""I'm excited to finally meet you, . I've been looking forward to this.""
Remember that she wants to be there too, and that she’s probably just as nervous as you are, so just breathe and act confident.

, There's a difference here in complimenting a girl and being rude or objectifying.You may be nervous and be tempted to try and act suave, but being a jerk won’t help you.


Be specific when you compliment her.Don't just say ""Your hair looks nice."" Instead, look for something that she's clearly taken time on. Maybe she has a specific style, like bangs. Don't just say ""Your hair looks nice."" Instead, look for something that she's clearly taken time on. Maybe she has a specific style, like bangs. Say ""I like your bangs, you really pull those off, they frame your face really well.""
Compliments don't have to be physical either. Show her that she has that special something that makes you attracted to her. Tell her that as soon as she walked in, the whole room brightened up. Tell her that she has a great sense of humor, or that her intelligence is sexy. You don't have to say that she's turning you on, that may be a bit forward, but you can say something like ""I was attracted to you as soon as I saw you, but talking with you has only made me more attracted to you.""

You can employ a bit of humor here as well and add something like ""I just hope I'll be able to keep up with you.""


Remember here that you're on a date, and while being friendly is always a great place to start, you want to show her that you're interested in her as more than just a friend. With a friend you want to keep compliments platonic, but here you can tell her how she makes you feel, that you are attracted to her.

Get a bundle of good quality roses.,
Buy a card to go along with it.,
Find out your Valentine's address if you don't know it already.,
Get a flower delivery company to deliver your flowers.,
Call them once you know the delivery has been made.",How to Give Roses to a Valentine2," Buy them fresh and without signs of wilting any time soon so that your Valentine can appreciate them more.

, Make sure you sign it with your name if you want your Valentine to know you sent it because otherwise they might think someone else sent it. To make that amazing person feel even more special, get a card that is personalized. You can get personalized cards on the Internet and in certain shops that sell them, but make sure you do this at least two days in advance. You don't want your Valentine to be getting a card a week later!

, You don't want the flowers being sent to their grumpy old neighbour! Try to do this in such a way that they don't suspect your plan. Act naturally as you ask them for it by saying that you could drop over at their house at the weekend or something along those lines.

, Alternatively, you could get a friend or family member to turn up at their house. Choose anyone so long as it isn't yourself. The appearance of you at their house is too obvious and clichéd. You could be watching the delivery from nearby but to add that romantic feel, don't let yourself be seen.

, They might call you first. Ask them if they liked your present and be prepared for their smile to be lit up as they thank you for your lovely gift.

Spend time with friends and family.,
Schedule your time.,
Focus on work.,
Take care of yourself.,
Enjoy your hobbies and explore new interests.",How to Give a Guy Space2," One of the easiest ways to give your guy some space is to create some healthy space for yourself. Don’t spend all of your time obsessing over the relationship and over what you did or didn’t do. Spend time with those who love you, value you, and don’t need a break from you. Visit your mom more often and hang out with your friends. Don’t say ‘no’ if your friends try to make plans with you., You likely were filling a considerable amount of time each week hanging out with your guy, and now that that may not be occurring as regularly, you might feel lonely. Combat this by creating a schedule for yourself to minimize your downtime. The less time you have that is unoccupied, the less time you will have to ruminate, obsess, or reach out before your guy has gotten enough space.

, Your guy needing space is a great time for you to devote yourself to work. Continue to arrive to work on time each day, complete all of your responsibilities on time, and even consider taking on some additional projects or assignments. See if you can be of service to anyone who needs help., During this time, don’t allow yourself to forget self-care. Continue to eat well, exercise, and care for your hygienic needs. Consider pampering yourself to a spa day, or if money is tight, pamper yourself at home.Consider taking care of your environment, too. Clean up and organize your space to declutter your surroundings.
Keeping your space clutter-free can help you feel better and more focused. Also think about rearranging things like furniture. The novelty itself can be a lift., Perhaps when you were speaking with your guy regularly, you didn’t have much time to explore your own interests that you had prior to the relationship. Take some time to reconnect with those now. Read more, join a book club, catch up on your television shows, go out dancing, or learn to cook a few new dishes. Spend time remembering that life away from your partner can be fun and fulfilling, as well."
"
Don’t be available immediately.,
Spend some time reconnecting.,
Negotiate a way to meet both your needs.,
Let it go, if necessary.",How to Give a Guy Space3," More often than not, your guy will want to reconnect or connect more often after a few days of space. He might even behave like there was no space at all. Though you might be eager to reconnect, exert a bit of caution. You do not want to teach your guy that he can ask for space from you whenever he wants and return like nothing happened.You should not ignore his attempts at communication, but maybe give it a few days before you see him again in person.
Don’t forget your own needs. Keep any reconnection on your terms, too, and make it clear that you’ll contact him when you’re ready.
If a guy asks for space very often, realize that perhaps this relationship is not right for either of you.

, If you still want the relationship, you will need to reconnect on a more consistent basis.. If he is a good guy in general, don’t punish him for needing some time to himself. Accept his offers to go out or come over if you want to and enjoy each other’s company. Being aloof, cold or mean will likely make him want even more space, so be kind to him., After you have spent some time chatting and hanging out, you should have a substantive conversation on your needs for space in the future. See if he had any moments of clarity or reflection during this time that he would like to share. Tell him any thoughts that you had, as well. Clarify to him that you respect his need for space, but that you can’t commit to giving him long breaks from you very often.Find a solution that works for the two of you. For instance, perhaps he wants to talk to you every day, but not all day long because it affects his productivity at work or school. Offer to connect a few times during the day and then have one phone call per night to talk for longer.

, After giving him whatever amount of space he needed or whatever amount you were able to handle, you might find that the relationship is best left alone. Perhaps you felt happier when you two were not longer communicating as frequently and maybe he wants this space to be a bit more permanent. No matter the source, know that it is okay to let the relationship go and move forward with your life."

Ask for support.",How to Get Your Partner to Diet with You," Be prepared to talk about why you want to diet and what kind of changes this diet will entail. If dieting is a sore topic for your partner, don’t bring it up in front of others; wait instead to discuss in private. Your partner may not have thought about dieting before this moment, so be sure to give them some time after the discussion to think.Say something like “Hey babe, I’ve been thinking a lot about being more healthy lately. I want to live a long life and I want you to, as well. Do you think you could diet with me so we can do this together?”;
, Your partner might agree immediately to dieting or might need a little more encouragement or reasoning to do so. Present to them all of the benefits of dieting and they will find it more difficult to resist. For instance, by maintaining a healthy diet, they might have more energy, have better skin, lose a few pounds, and be less at risk for certain health problems like heart disease and diabetes.They might also look and feel better when they diet.
Consider other pros that will be tailored directly to their own interests. For instance, if your partner is very concerned about or attentive to their hair, inform them that a change in diet often improves hair’s luster.

, Your partner will likely feel more willing to go on this journey with you if you are serious and have done your research. Don’t come to them with vague ideas or general notions of dieting. Instead, show them specific dieting plans that you have looked at that you think would work for the two of you. Perhaps you want to start a new vegetarian diet. On this diet, you can consume vegetables, beans, peas, grapes, seeds, and nuts. You can also incorporate dairy products.


Vegetarians often have lower cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass indexes (BMI).
Other beneficial diets include Mediterranean diets, which place a greater emphasis on vegetables, but also allows for the consumption of meat sparingly.

, You never know the self esteem or food issues that your partner has, so be kind to them. They might be overweight and using food as a crutch to cope with some problem in their life. Show compassion to them by affirming your love for them, not picking on them when they overeat, and by being understanding of their reluctance to diet.Remind them everyday of how much you care for them.
Do small, thoughtful gestures for them often.
Never try to force them to diet or to talk about dieting.

, Remember that your partner is not the same as you and therefore has both a different rationale process and control of their own actions and behaviors. Rather than focusing on their health so much, focus on your own. A person who feels looked down on or controlled is unlikely to change their behavior or give in to your desire to diet.Also, don’t judge yourself during this process either. Dieting is hard and you might slip up sometimes, which is okay. Forgive and love yourself so that you can show greater love and compassion to your partner.

, Film is a great way to educate your partner about the benefits of dieting and the health risks of junk food and a sedentary lifestyle. Watch documentaries together to show them these potential advantages and dangers.One example is “Super Size Me” about a man whose health suffered when he ate McDonald’s every day for a month.
Other examples are “Vegucated” or “Hungry for Change”, both which discuss the benefits of healthy dieting.

, After you have had a discussion, let the issue rest. Don’t continue to bring it up to them repeatedly; this will make them even less likely to want to diet. Continue to give your partner the autonomy and space to make their own decision about their diet. After they have told you their decision, don’t continue to press them about it. Though you don’t want to, you can still diet alone!Don’t nag them. Don’t continuously bring it up unless they want to discuss it.
When you feel like you want to talk to them about it again, take a five minute break to assess whether such a conversation will be fruitful. Take a walk and breathe deeply.

, If you are primarily responsible for doing the grocery shopping for your home, don’t purchase any more junk food. Buy fruits, vegetables, lean meat, and whole grains, instead. It will be difficult for your partner to eat unhealthy food if it is not available to them. If they would like to have junk food, they can go out and purchase their own.Don’t bring home unhealthy fast food, either.
Avoid buying sugary drinks, chocolate, chips and ice cream.

, One of the best ways to get your partner to diet is to do it yourself. Stay away from junk food and instead eat lean meats, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. It will be difficult for you at first, especially if your partner is still eating all of the unhealthy foods that you love, but your partner will admire your persistence. Once they see you feeling better and looking better, they will likely want in on your healthy lifestyle.Exercise daily or every other day.
Join a gym and find a workout buddy if your partner is unwilling.

, One way to get your partner to diet with you is to make small changes at a time. Your partner will likely notice if you make big changes but will not notice if the changes are gradual. When you cook, you can switch from butter to light butter and from whole milk to 2%. You can purchase meat that is leaner and substitute vegetables instead of having fries.Also, substitute fruits for cake when having dessert.
Try eating healthy once a week, then twice, and so on and so forth until your entire diet has changed over time.

, Another way to begin including healthier foods is by seasoning the new foods that you are cooking well. If you are switching from frying your chicken to now baking or grilling it, be sure to season it well so that it still tastes good. Your partner may not want to diet because they believe that healthy foods do not taste good, but you can show them that they can with proper preparation.Use lemon pepper, garlic, oregano, thyme or any other seasonings that you enjoy.

, Your partner may be coming around to the whole idea of dieting, but may still want to keep a few junk food favorites in the house. Go grocery shopping together so that you both can make decisions about what foods to have in the house. For instance, perhaps your partner wants to keep sodas but can agree on not having any more chips. This will help ensure that they are making healthier choices gradually and at a pace that feels comfortable and collaborative to them.Remember that you still don’t have to eat any of the junk food that they wanted to purchase.
You can also suggest that you try out diet sodas together instead of purchasing regularly sodas.
You can buy low-fat or sugar free versions of your favorite cookies or snacks.

, If cooking is something the both of you enjoy doing, but you have been dieting and therefore having meals separately from them, try to make something together. Find a healthy yet tasty recipe that you can both agree to try and then make it. Or pick a favorite of theirs and look for a healthier way to cook it.For instance, if you both loved pasta, you can purchase whole wheat or gluten free pasta. You can also substitute turkey for ground beef.

, Ask your partner to workout with you. Perhaps they are unwilling to eat better, but if you can get them active, then they will be healthier. Hit the gym or do some workouts from home. You can start small by walking around the neighborhood for 30 minutes a day, as well.Offer to play their favorite sport with them.
If there is a lake nearby, rent some kayaks for a few hours or walk the trails in a nearby park.

, If your partner is competitive, one way to help them begin dieting is by making a bet or wager. Agree that whoever loses the most weight in a week or keeps the diet up without cheating get a prize. The prize can be something small like the winner picking your Friday night movie or something larger like dinner at their restaurant of choice.

, Ask them to commit to the diet for one week and if they hate it, then they can resume eating as they like. Your partner will probably feel so good after dieting that they will at least incorporate some of the changes into their long term eating habits.Say to them “I know you don’t really want to diet with me, but could you just give it a week and see how you feel? It would mean a lot to me.”

, At the end of the day, your partner should do things with you because they love you and want you to be healthy. Simply tell your partner what this means to you and ask them if they can support you. Maybe support doesn’t mean them dieting with you, but it can mean that they might agree to not eat certain foods around you.


You might say “Even if you don’t want to diet with me, I want to feel that I have your support. Can you just help to encourage me through this? I really want to make a change to my health.”

Know when the damage is done.",How to Get Your Girlfriend to Forgive You," If you want to get your girlfriend to forgive you, then the first thing you have to do is to give her the most sincere apology you’re capable of giving. This means you have to suck it up and see her in person instead of sending her a lame text. Make sure you pick a place where you can get some privacy and a time when she is ready to hear you out; if she’s too angry to talk to you, then respect her and give her some space until she wants to talk.When you talk to her, make eye contact, put your phone away, and don’t look around. Let her see that you’ve gotten rid of all of your distractions and that her happiness is a priority for you.
Keep it short and simple. You don’t need to go into a huge, elaborate explanation of why you did what you did unless you feel that it’s really necessary. What’s most important is that you make it clear how sorry you are.
Say something like, “I am so sorry about what I did to you. I can’t tell you how much I regret it and how much I wish I hadn’t hurt you. You mean so much to me and I feel like such an idiot for putting all of that in jeopardy.”;
, Don’t say something like, “I’m sorry that you feel that I did something wrong…” or, “I’m sorry you got so mad when I…” This kind of talk puts the blame on your girlfriend instead of you and makes it seem like the whole situation is all her fault even though you’re the one who did something wrong. If you really want her forgiveness, you should avoid this kind of talk at all costs.


Make it clear that you’re the one who did something wrong and that her reaction was completely normal and understandable. If you’ve messed up and make it sound like she did something wrong, you won’t win your girlfriend over very fast.

, If you want your girlfriend to really forgive you, then you should be honest with her about what happened. You don’t want to tell her a partial truth and have her find out the rest later, unless you want her to be even more angry with you. If you cheated on her, you don’t have to give her every little detail, but you shouldn’t try to downplay what you did too much, either. If you ever want your girlfriend to really trust you again, then honesty is the best policy.


She won’t forgive you if you’re holding back or clearly lying to her still. She’ll only get more angry and will feel even more hurt and upset with you.
If you’re worried about your honesty not coming off the right way, practice what you’re going to say in advance so you don’t end up hurting her even more.

, If you really want to make her see that you’re sorry and that you mean it, then you should make it clear that whatever happened absolutely will not happen again. Whether you were cheating, fell off the grid for a while, or called her names, you can show her that you’ve really put time into thinking about not doing it again and even give her a plan of attack. This will help her see that you’re serious about improving your behavior and holding on to her.


If you cheated on her, then you can say something like, “I am so sorry that I cheated on you. I’m definitely not going to flirt with other girls or even look at them. I know how important you are to me and I’m never going to do anything stupid like that again. I won’t go off the grid, and you can always call or text me to know what I’m doing so you don’t have to worry.”
Just remember that actions speak louder than words. Giving her your plan not to hurt her again will go a long way, but making sure to stick to your word is even more important.

, If there are specific steps you need to take to not do what you did again, then you should tell her exactly what you have planned so she knows you’re serious about not being a repeat offender. Look her in the eyes and tell her what you plan on doing to be a better boyfriend and better person. She’ll be touched that you tried as hard as you did if you show her that you really do want to improve and won’t go back to your old ways.


You can say something like, “I’m so sorry I called you names. The next time I get so worked up, I’m going to step outside and take a breather or give myself a few minutes to speak. I’ll make sure I’ll think before I speak next time so I don’t end up saying something I don’t mean again. I’m even thinking about taking anger management classes if I can’t solve this on my own.”
If you tell her about your plan, make sure you’re willing to put it into action so she actually trusts you.

, It’s likely that your girlfriend will have something to say to you about what you’ve done, and it’s important for you to take the time to really listen to her. Make eye contact, don’t interrupt or contradict her, and don’t say anything until she’s really done speaking. Make her see that you really value her opinion and that she matters so much to you; when she’s done, let her know that you’ve heard everything she said by carefully reflecting on her words as you speak.You can practice reflective listening. After she has spoken, you can say something like, “What I’m hearing is that…” or, “I see that you feel like…” to show her that you’ve really thought about it.
Though you may be tempted to argue with her or to contradict her when she’s done talking, remember that you’re supposed to be apologizing here. You can certainly give her your perspective, but you don’t want to come off as aggressive or she’ll be even more angry.

, When you apologize to your girlfriend, it’s important for her to see how much of an impact she’s had on your life. Tell her how amazing she is and how you’re a fool for putting your relationship into question; remind her of some of the best things you love about her, and let her see that you’re really upset that you hurt her. While you don’t want to sound too much like you’re sucking up, you should make it clear that you really care for her and don’t want to lose her.


Be specific. Don’t just tell her she’s the most amazing girl ever; refer to specific qualities that show you’re really paying attention to her.
You don’t have to put on an act. If you really do care for her, then it should be pretty obvious to her as soon as you start apologizing.

, Even if you’ve said your part and have done a convincing job of showing her how much you wish you hadn’t messed up, it doesn’t mean that she’s going to jump back into your arms. She may not be ready to accept your apology or even to spend another minute with you. If this is the case, then you need to be patient and not put pressure on her to accept your apology before she’s ready to. You’re the one who made a mistake and now the ball is in her court.Be patient with her. If she doesn’t want to hang out or even to talk for a while, you have to be respectful of that. While you may want to check in to see how she is from time to time, you don’t want to overwhelm her, or she’ll be even more upset.
Tell her that you’ll be waiting and ready and that you hope to see each her again soon. Let her see how hurt you are and how much you want to see her again and to make it up to her.

, If she doesn’t want to spend 24/7 with you right now, then you have to be respectful of that. She may be slowly coming around to spending time with you again, and you have to be understanding that she needs some time to try to ease into the relationship. Spend time doing casual things, like watching TV or eating lunch together, and don’t try to whisk her away on a romantic dinner date or weekend vacation if she can barely look at you. Start slow, doing the simple things you used to love to do together, and take it from there.


This goes for being affectionate and intimate, too. Don’t try to smother her with hugs, touches, kisses, or attempt to hold her hand or put your arm around her every chance you get before she’s ready, or this will actually slow down the process further.
Let her make the calls. If she’s up for going to a party together, then you can do it, but you shouldn’t make her go out in public with you if she’s not ready for it.

, You have to be as dependable as possible if you want to rebuild your relationship. You have to be there for your girlfriend and make her see that you’re going to help her out if she needs a ride or a favor, show up for a date at the time you say you’ll be there, and be there for her if she’s upset and needs to talk something out. Dependability is one of the most important qualities of a good boyfriend, and if you want her to trust you again and to feel safe with you.


Don’t flake on her. If you weren’t able to do something you said you’d do, you better have a really good excuse.
Be there whenever she wants to talk or needs some advice. Let her see that you want to go out of your way to hear her out and make her feel happy.
Being dependable is important, but you have to make sure she doesn’t feel like she can walk all over you just because you messed up. You want to maintain your dignity.

, To earn her trust back, you have to be available when she tries to reach you. This doesn’t mean you have to drop everything to do what she wants you to do, but it does mean that you should try to pick up your phone as quickly as you can when she calls or texts you. Let her see that you’ve got nothing to hide, and if you’re going to have your phone off for a while, like if you’re going to be watching a long movie in the theatre or at your baseball game, then give her a head’s up so she doesn’t wonder why you’ve gone off the grid.


If you’re out with your friends, let her know where you’ll be and what you’ll be up to.
Though she doesn’t have to track your every move, you should generally try to be open about your plans so she doesn’t worry that you’ll hurt her again.
If you’re apart for a few days, then give her a call and check in with her to show that she’s still on your mind.

, While it’s important to go out of your way to get her to trust you again, you don’t want to be trying so hard that it seems like you’re putting on an act or not being yourself at all. If every word you say or every thing you do makes it obvious that you’re just trying to get in her good graces again, then she’ll feel like you’re not being real with her. You can make a big effort to win her over again, but you shouldn’t forget to be yourself; after all, that’s who she started dating, isn’t it?


You can be more helpful, kind, and loving than you normally are, but you shouldn’t completely forget yourself in the process. Make sure you still make time to pursue your own interests and don’t make your life all about making your girlfriend happy.
You can get her flowers or chocolate if things are going really well, but if you give her too many gifts when she’s just not feeling it, then she’ll think you’re trying to buy her love back.

, If your girlfriend needs to forgive you because you were unfaithful to her, then you have to make sure she doesn’t have any reason to be afraid that you’ll do it again. When other girls are around, you can talk to them, but don’t openly flirt with them or stare at them, if you can help it. When you get a phone call or a text, don’t go to the other room or look shady when you answer it, and let her know that it’s just your mom or buddy calling. Do what you can to make her see that you only have eyes for her.


Okay, so it may be impossible to fully stop checking out other beautiful women, but you can try to minimize it as much as you can around your girlfriend, thinking about how much it will upset her.
If you were out with your buddies and some girls you knew came out, you can let her know about it so she doesn’t find out from someone else.

, As you work to make her forgive you, you and your girlfriend can begin to do the same things you used to love together, whether it’s hiking, cooking, watching all of the year’s Oscar-nominated films, or going to trivia night with your friends. You shouldn’t force it, but once you both feel ready to return to some of your old routines, you should let her see how happy and grateful you are that you can start to go back to how things were again.


Take the time to really enjoy your girlfriend’s company and to make her feel special. Focus less and less about making it up to her and more and more on enjoying your relationship again.
If she had any unrelated complaints when you upset her, such as the fact that you’re always late to dates, make sure you acknowledge those as well.

, As your relationship gets more and more stable again, you can make sure that your girlfriend knows how much you care about her. If you’re already saying “I love you,” then you shouldn’t forget to say it at least once a day; if you’re not, make sure you compliment her and make her feel good about herself when you’re together. Let her know and see how happy you are to be with her and how much you love dating her.


You don’t have to smother her with affection, but you should never take her for granted. Don’t assume that she knows how much you care for her just because you’re hanging out together; let her see how much you care through your words and your affection.
Write her sweet love notes or even hand her a full letter saying how much you care for her.
Be thoughtful. If she’s mentioned a new book she wants to read, let her know that you listen to her by giving it to her.

, Though returning to your old routine can make your relationship feel more stable, you can also work to discover new things together to keep your relationship fresh and to do things that don’t remind her of the time you hurt her. You can discover a new sport, take a class together, or even take a mini vacation to a campsite or beach over the weekend. Don’t just do whatever she wants to do to please her; try to find something new and exciting that you both will love.


It doesn’t have to be too elaborate. You can just learn to make pasta together, join a bowling league together, or discover a new director together. The most important thing is that you both keep your relationship feeling fresh.
You don’t have to do too many new things at once. Making an effort to do at least one new thing every week or two while continuing to do some of the old things you love together will keep your relationship going strong.

, In order to maintain a healthy relationship, you have to be committed to communicating openly and listening to her as often as possible. Don’t keep your feelings bottled up inside or become passive aggressive when you’re mad; instead, make time to talk to her about any problems in your relationship so that you both feel that you’re on the same page. Make sure to really listen to her and to address her concerns while making her aware of how you’re feeling. Strong communication is key for any strong relationship.


An important part of communication is learning to compromise. Make sure you can both find a way to make each other happy when making a decision and that one person doesn’t always get his or her way all of the time.
Work on reading your girlfriend’s expressions and body language. She may be upset without telling you, and there will be times when you have to ask her what’s wrong. She’ll appreciate the fact that you’re paying such close attention to her.

, Once you’ve apologized and have worked on rebuilding a healthy relationship, you have to be able to move past what happened. While your girlfriend may not be able to completely forget what happened even if she has forgiven you, you both have to be able to accept what happened and to focus on the present and the future instead of the past. If you both keep bringing up what happened all the time, then you won’t ever be able to fully move forward.


You should work on enjoying the relationship on its own terms instead of being fully focused on making it up to your girlfriend.
Of course, if your girlfriend wants to talk about what happened, you shouldn’t avoid it, but you should also make an effort to have other things to talk about as well.

, Unfortunately, there may be times when your girlfriend won’t be able to forgive you, no matter how hard you’ve tried to change for her. If you’ve done too much damage to repair the relationship, then it’s important to be aware of this so you both know when to cut your losses. If you’ve been trying to make things feel “normal” for months and just keep going back to what happened, keep fighting about the past, and still can’t open up to each other, then you both may have to accept that you can’t fix the relationship anymore.


If you’re getting the sense that your girlfriend won’t ever be able to fully forgive you, then you should have an honest conversation with her about it. If this is the case, then the sooner you know, the better.
If you have to end the relationship because of what you did, then the best thing you can do is view it as a learning experience and make sure not to make the same mistake again.

Stand by your values and beliefs.,
Be open and honest.,
Develop respect for yourself.,
Maintain good hygiene.,
Search for common interests.,
Express yourself.",How to Get Someone to Like You1," One thing that's distinctive about you is your particular combination of principles and convictions that you hold dear. Those things are at the core of who you are, so it's important to stay true to yourself even in moments of conflict or uncertainty.


Conflict is a part of any relationship. You don't have to change who you are to resolve a disagreement. Simply ask that your beliefs be treated with respect and offer that same respect to others.
Sticking to your beliefs takes courage. It's not easy to be the one who stands up to a bully or refuses to go along with a harmful or dangerous prank. Being true to yourself might make you unpopular with some people but could also attract those with whom you share common values.
Make a list of truths about yourself or create a list of all the people/things that shaped you (your upbringing, your likes/dislikes, your temperament, etc.) and let them remind you of who you are. Use them, too, as jumping off points for conversation or connecting with others.;
, It's easier for someone to approach you and, in turn, come to like you, if you're welcoming and genuine. Sending out a friendly, open vibe will help to draw people to you.









A ""what you see is what you get"" approach to making friends can cut through any artificialities and help you connect with people who are drawn to you for who you are. But be careful of appearing inflexible; people are less inclined to try to connect to someone who seems too rigid.
Part of being genuine means showing emotion. You may put on a brave face when you're feeling down or try to hide a stressful day from others, but having emotions is something we all share. Let others see you as a real human being.
If you're shy and find it difficult to talk to other people, be upfront about that. The good news is that you don't necessarily have to say a lot to have someone enjoy your company. Being a great listener and asking questions that convey a real interest in the other person is one of the best ways to connect.

Don't be hard on yourself if you feel you have weak social skills. You may have been busy developing other areas of your life. Remember, a skill is something that can be developed, so you can absolutely improve in this area.



, Having healthy self-respect means you like yourself no matter what. Successes and failures can't change it, and it doesn't depend on how you measure up to others--in fact, you never even compare yourself to others. That's particularly helpful in forming friendships that aren't based on competition or one-up-manship.









Self-respect is key to earning respect from others. It's difficult for people to treat you with real regard if you don't treat yourself well or don't think much of yourself.

, When you look good, you feel better, and when you're feeling good you're more likely to put your best self forward.









Shower or bathe regularly. Keeping yourself clean conveys that you care about your health and respect your body. If your hair tends to be oily, consider washing it every day (this will also cut down on the chances of acne developing on your forehead); otherwise, every-other day is fine.
Use deodorant. While it may be perfectly natural, strong body odor can be a turn-off to others. Using a deodorant or antiperspirant, especially in hot weather or before and after exercising, shows that you care not only about yourself but about the comfort-level of others.
Change clothes. Even if it's your favorite t-shirt or pair of jeans, it's important to change out it with some regularity. Clothes absorb and can hold on to body odor, so even if you're taking pains to take care of your hygiene, wearing the same clothes several days in a row will work against you.
Maintain good oral hygiene. Brushing and flossing are important for two big reasons: they help prevent cavities and gum disease and they reduce bad breath. It's difficult for people to get close if your breath is less-than-fresh. Mints and gum can all help but brushing and flossing are the best way to combat smelly mouth germs.

, One thing that brings people together are shared interests. Put yourself in situations where you can pursue things you enjoy and meet others who enjoy them, too.









Join a club or attend an event. If you like to read, search online or look for signs in coffee shops for a book club in your area. Big fan of cars? Attend local car shows or be part of online discussion groups that focus on automobiles. Shared interests help you to immediately establish common ground with someone.
Check Meetup and Craigslist for groups and activities. You might be surprised at the volume and variety of groups out there that focus on a wide range of interests.
When you talk to someone, ask open-ended questions to uncover common ground. Instead of saying,""Do you like music?"" ask ""What are your three favorite bands?"" Instead of, ""How was your day?"" ask ""What was the best part of your day today?"" Open-ended questions open the door for discovering more about your conversation partner.
Volunteer. Find a cause you care about and spend some time supporting it. You'll meet others who share your interest in the same organization and perhaps more.

, Whether it means speaking up in a class, sketching wildlife, refinishing a piece of thrift store furniture, expressing yourself by sharing your ideas or your creativity can draw other to you.









When you express yourself, you're sharing a part of who you are with others. It provides a great opportunity for others to get to know you through your actions, and they might approach you because of something you've said or done.
Not expressing yourself--verbally or non-verbally--can lead to isolation. If you build walls around yourself and refuse to let anything out, people will assume you want to be left alone, and that's what they'll do.

"
"
Show respect for the other person.,
Listen.,
Spend time with the other person.,
Give the other person space.",How to Get Someone to Like You2," Being respectful means valuing others and their points of view. You must accept them for who they are and avoid doing anything that would hurt or hinder them. Let's face it: it means treating others the way you want to be treated.









Keep your promises. One way to show respect is to do what you say you're going to do. This shows people that you value their time and the fact that they've put their faith in you.
Use your manners. Don't interrupt others, say ""please"" and ""thank you,"" refrain from using profanity if you know it will be upsetting. Having manners show others that you value them and that they deserve your best behavior.
Be on time. Everyone is so busy these days, so every minute counts. Be on time for get-togethers or other planned activities to show that you appreciate the time someone is spending with you.

, Conversation is a two-way street; if you spend the whole time talking about yourself, you won't get to know someone better, and the other person will feel as though you don't have an interest in them.









People enjoy talking about themselves, so let them. Ask questions to draw people out and let them share things about themselves. You'll get to know them, and they'll like you all the more for having given them your time and attention.
Check for understanding. Paraphrase what someone has said back to them to be sure you're clear on what they're sharing. This lets them know that you're truly listening and provides the chance for them to clear up any misunderstandings so that you fully get their message.
Avoid interrupting or competing. While it may be tempting to jump in with a comment or to try to top someone's story about a trip they took or a bad day they had, resist the temptation. Keep your focus on the speaker and save your remarks for another time.
Listen with your whole body. Make eye contact with the other person, lean forward a bit, nod in agreement or understanding. Most of our communication actually takes place non-verbally, so let your body do some of the listening and the talking for you.

, Some people say that ""quality"" is more important than ""quantity,"" but when it comes to time spent with a friend, they both matter. Set aside time to connect with people you like and want to get to know better.









When you give someone your time, it's a clear indication that they're important to you and that you like them. People are drawn to people who like them, so making yourself available in this way increases your likeability.
Connections happen over time. The more time you spend with someone the more comfortable you two feel around each other. Getting someone to like you means investing the time that it takes to create that feeling of comfort and familiarity.

, People need time to themselves and space to pursue all of their interests. Rather than overwhelm someone with your friendship, give them the opportunity to seek you out and stay engaged in your own life.









Some people are not comfortable with letting new people into their life too quickly. Every friendship moves at its own pace. Let a slower-moving friend set a speed that's comfortable for them.
Life circumstances change--someone's mother gets ill, schoolwork or work assignments increase, schedules get readjusted, projects need doing--there are lots of reasons someone needs to back away from spending time together. Respect their needs and don't take it personally.
Read the signals. If you're coming on too strong, the other person will let you know--you just have to read the signals. If they seem reluctant to commit to making plans, don't answer or return your phone calls or text messages or even physically back away when you're together--dial down your enthusiasm and back off a bit. You don't want to be perceived as needy, scary or over-eager.
It's not just emotional space that people need--they need physical space as well. If you come closer to someone than 18"", you've invaded their intimate space, and they may not be comfortable with that. We generally reserve that zone for those closest to us, so be careful of standing too closely to someone.

Show the other person that he or she is special.,
Give a small gift occasionally.,
Take an interest in the other person's hobbies.,
Leave reminders that you care.",How to Get Someone to Like You3," People want know that they matter and that they're worth a little extra effort from time to time.


Give a compliment. Express admiration for something about the person. Make your comments genuine and specific. Go one step further and focus on things that are central to their personality ""I really admire your courage in that situation"" rather that things that are situational ""You did a great job of stopping that argument.""
Lend a hand. There are some dread tasks that we all must face--moving, meeting an impossible deadline, reviving a dead car battery. Making yourself available to help out--even when it's not convenient--can earn you someone's gratitude and affection.
Offer support. Freely give you emotional and moral support to someone when they need it. Make them feel valued by always be on their team

, It's not about ""buying"" someone's affections; instead, giving a token present can express your interest in someone's well-being or let them know that you're in tune with what's happening in their lives.


It really is the thought that counts. When you give someone a little gift, it lets them know that you're thinking of them and that they're important to you.
Let your gift reflect life events. A key-chain says, ""Congratulations on your new car,"" a bouquet of flowers can brighten someone's difficult day. Staying focused on what's going on the lives of people you care about can give you ideas for gifts that are meaningful.
Make something yourself. You don't have to be a master artist to make a card, decorate a picture frame or bake some cookies. Taking the time to make a gift really expresses your friendship or affection for someone.

, While you may have connected with a common interest, chances are you won't share every like, hobby or activity. That's fine....it's good actually because you can get to know a whole other side of a person if you're willing to make a little effort.


Attend an event or learn about your friend's hobby. You don't have to become an aficionado yourself, but being able to talk about it intelligently and with some degree of interest shows your friend that they're important to you.
Be willing to learn. If you're open to learning something new, go ahead and be the student. Allowing someone to teach you something makes them feel good about themselves and helps to create a bond between the two of you.
Even if someone's passions leave you absolutely bored, refrain from putting them down or making fun of the activity. It clearly means something to your friend; therefore, it deserves your respect.

, Unexpected notes, text messages and photo shares can help you stay in touch and create mini-opportunities to connect.


Send a text wishing someone luck before a big exam, important meeting or job interview. They'll appreciate the thought and the support.
Snap a photo of something funny and send it on. That little lift can make a difference in someone's day and remind them that you share a similar sense of humor.
Don't forget birthdays. Put a note in your calendar to remind you to send a card or give a call on the special day.

Don't make your friendship the final stage of your relationship.",How to Get to Know a Guy," Often you can tell a lot about a guy by how others act around him, who his friends are, what grades he gets, etc.


Listen in on his conversations. If you see him talking to someone before or after class, sit nearby and listen or walk by and try to catch a few of the words.
try to get in a group project with him and make sure you start a pleasant conversation.
Find out his hobbies, like sports or music, and go to some of his games and performances. How he performs in competition will show how he approaches the world, whether he is aggressive and a leader, or whether he is more laid back.
Watch how he treats others. Someone may ask a stupid question and he may laugh, showing him to be something of a cad. Or, someone might need help and he will lend a hand. People reveal their true characters in how they treat others, especially if they don't think they are being watched.;
, If you trust your friends, you should be able to ask them and they will give you an honest opinion of what they think about your crush.


Beware of incorrect information, though. Maybe your friends like this guy too, and as everyone knows, all is fair in love and war. They may give you misleading or outright false information.
Even if they don't lie or mislead you, they might be afraid of hurting your feelings and so not give you the whole truth.

, If there are girls who gossip about boys, and you sit near them in class, they may tell you a lot, without you even having to ask.


Your friends might tell you what you want to hear, but people you don't know very well or who you don't know at all will probably be a lot freer with information.

, This is the easiest and most direct way to get to know a person, boy, girl, man, or woman. It's also disarmingly honest and a clear indication to him that you are interested.


Usually, boys have to muster up the courage to talk to girls. If you talk to him first, prepare for him to be a bit confused.
If he isn't very responsive, that's not the end of the world. He might be very shy and not know how to talk to girls.

, You don't have to go right up and start a conversation with him to make this work. If you happen to see him in the hall, think about something small and insignificant to say.


Ask him about his classes, his friends, what sort of fun things there are to do around, the weather, the time etc.
Just try not to talk about really serious stuff, like his hopes or dreams, his fears, or anything personal. That would be off-putting, and you want to hook his attention first before you really get to know who he is and what he's about.

, Maybe you don't want to approach him directly, so make eye contact with him, smile, then look away.


Repeat if necessary, because he may not get it the first time. One look and smile may be a fluke, but two or three are totally intentional.
If you don't smile as well as make eye contact, you may just come across as creepy, so smile!

, Maybe you need a pen or a pencil, and you could ask the person next to you for one. But, why would you do that when you're in class with your crush? Go up to him and ask him for what you need.


Most people won't refuse to let you borrow something small like a pen or pencil, so he probably won't deny your request.
This also gives you an excuse to go back and talk to him again, when you have to return whatever you borrowed. Take the opportunity to be a little flirty, and say something like ""You're my hero! I never could have finished Ms. Pepper's test without your pen."" Be creative, and don't waste the opportunity.

, Maybe you're at the library and ""need"" help finding a book. Maybe you've ""lost"" your backpack. Whatever it is, find your strapping young man and try to get him to help you.


Make sure the request is at least a bit legitimate. If you put your backpack under your library table and you ask for help finding it, he might just think you're ditzy.
Enlist your friend's help. If you ""lost"" your phone, just give it to your friend while you spend a good ten or twenty minutes looking for it with your guy. try to make some conversation while you're searching, and when you can't find it, thank him a lot and then go. When you've ""found"" your phone, go up to him again and thank him for all his help. This is the perfect opportunity to start a second conversation.

, Once you're in close proximity, introduce yourself and start making good conversation.


If he is sitting at a small table, in an empty classroom, or is the only one in the dining hall or at the cafe, then it will be awkward if you sit next to him. try to play it cool.

, ""Hello"" is just a start, and you won't get very far if that is all you say to him. Now you've broken the ice and are having an okay conversation, but don't know how to take it to the next level. Think of some good questions to ask, like:


What makes you smile?
What's your favorite film/video game/book?
If you could travel anywhere in the world right now, where would you go and why?
What sports do you like?
What was your proudest moment?
What do you look for in a girl?
What is the most insane thing you have ever done?
What do you like eating?Remember, this isn't an audition. If you have only an okay conversation, you can always start another conversation later. The more you talk to him, the more comfortable you will be around each other.

, If you've had a decent conversation, ask him for his phone number. You will probably see him around a lot, but it's always good, because then you can call and text each other.


If he picks up that you're interested in him, he may save you the time and ask for your number.
If you are unsure on how to get his number, there are guides that show you all the necessary steps.

, This is how to really know a guy, .


Building off your first conversation, dig deeper and try to find out what really makes him tick. Small talk is great for first meeting someone, but it's called small for a reason: there's so little of it you soon exhaust its potential. You don't have to think about what to say in advance, but think about how you are going to move from discussion about your interests and friend groups and into more substantial things.
If you don't know exactly how to proceed, start by asking your guy friends or your brother(s), if you have any. They are guys too, so they may be able to tell you something that you could say or do. However, remember that all people are unique, and their advice may not be the best for the specific person you desire.

, You became friends with him to get to know him, but you want to be more than just friends. If you get to know him pretty well and you feel like you want to proceed further, try to make that clear to him.


Drop hints about your intentions. Flirt, pay him compliments, or ask him to go do things with you. If he doesn't pick up on your subtle hints, you can be sure his friends will when he tells them about what you two are doing.
Remember, he may like you too, but people are shy. Don't be afraid of making the first move if he is someone you want to be with.

, Start a conversation with him the same way you would with another friend. Say hello. Introduce yourself, if he doesn't already know who you are. Ask him how his day is going. Talk, talk, talk.

, If you just throw yourself at him and drag him into a conversation he doesn't really want to be a part of, he'll get creeped out and most likely leave. Be calm. Stay relaxed, and don't be loud. Anyone who is shy most likely enjoys things being quiet.

, If the conversation is still going well, dig deeper. Ask him what kind of music he listens to. Ask him who his friends are. Letting him know that you're interested in knowing the real him and not just to find out if he's single or not will definitely help him open up.

, Make small jokes to show him that you're comfortable around him, so he should be comfortable around you, too. Talk about annoying teachers or classmates. Point out something funny that's happening on the other side of the room. If he laughs, you've succeeded.

, If you leaving him hanging by saying, ""Well gotta go bye"", he'll feel used and probably suspicious. Chances are he won't talk to you again. Instead, slowly build up to an end to the conversation. Say something like, ""My friend looks tired. They're supposed to be studying. I'd better go wake them up before the test so they won't fail."" When leaving, smile and let him know that you want to talk to him again. Giving him your number is a drastic move, especially for a first conversation, but if you feel it went well, go for it!

Try not to be intimidating. Randomly striking up a conversation with an introvert might confuse or worry them. Ease into socialization with them. Also, try not to be too loud or excitable around them, as this could be annoying or intimidating to them.

, Spending too much time around this person may make him or her feel uncomfortable. Aim to keep the conversation going for as long as it's going. Look for social cues and if the other person seems bored with the conversation, politely end it and come back to that person later. Try a line such as ""It was nice to talk to you, but I have to go meet my friends. Talk to you later!""

, If the introvert looks uncomfortable, depressed, angry, in the middle of something, or just does not feel like talking to anyone, take the hint; it's best to leave him or her alone and come back at a later time.

, Introverts can take a while to get acclimated to a person. If he or she hesitates when speaking, do not become impatient with him or her or start finishing his or her sentences. Showing that you are patient and a good listener will make the person feel more comfortable talking with you.

, Introverts become tired when they have too much social interaction, and they need some time to recharge by being alone for awhile. If you are with this person too often, he or she will probably need some decompression time alone, so it's important to give him or her some space now and then.

, Just because you are an extrovert does not mean you have the right to put down and insult introverts. Being an introvert or being shy do not make the person ""less"" or ""worse"" than you, so avoid treating it as such. Calling out the person with labels or insults is not appreciated and will make the person feel insulted and uncomfortable. Avoid these phrases, for example:


""You must be antisocial"".
""You're not talking that much. Are you going through depression?""
""I don't bite, so why are you so shy?""
""Why are you so shy around me? Do you dislike me or something?""
""Come on...talk more!""

, If the introvert seems comfortable and is opening up to you, you should increase the amount of time that you spend talking to each other.

, Maybe inviting them over to hang out would be better than inviting them to a party. This varies between introverts, too. Some might feel uncomfortable in a one-on-one setting; having your full attention makes them feel like they're under a spotlight.

, Some people like to push their introverted friends to try new things or hang out with new people when they seriously don't want to. Don't pressure them into attending your party or anything like that. Coaxing them is okay. Pushing is not.

, Some people are perfectly happy being introverts. Even if they're not, it could take years for them to open up. They might always be a little distant. That's okay. It doesn't mean they don't like you.

Understand that the only reason other people make fun of you is because they are not living with the issues you are and don't understand.,
Realize that even though other students are focusing on socializing and popularity, academics are the entire reason why you're here.,
If you lack the social skills needed to make friends or are uninterested in socializing, keep yourself entertained.,
If you have issues with the noise level, bullying, or anything else during lunch hour, talk to any adult who will be able to help.,
If you don't attend a school with recess, skip this step.,
If you don't walk in hallways without your class (applies to elementary and some middle schools) skip this step.,
Now that the majority of social situations are covered, all that's left are academics.,
Don't allow yourself to get depressed or upset over your social differences.,
Remember to make an effort to improve.",How to Survive School with Social Issues," If you can learn to ignore ignorant comments from others, you will have a much better day.;
, In the long run, your academic abilities over the school years will be much more important than your social abilities.

, During lunch hour, read a book or study for your next class. If you can stay entertained and happy simply by sitting and letting your mind wander, so be it. Don't let other peoples' hurtful words get to you.

, Some good examples are therapists, special education teachers, or even ""regular"" teachers. They will provide you with advice or an alternative option for lunch if necessary. If you are too shy to talk to an adult, have your parent email the school or even leave a note on your teacher's desk.

, During recess, you may feel awkward, uncomfortable, or even have panic attacks due to sensory situations. If you absolutely can't bring yourself to use play equipment or join in on team sports, try to keep busy. This could mean sitting against a wall (or on a bench if you can) and reading, studying, doing homework, drawing, or anything else you enjoy. If you are allowed, listen to music. Even if there is a rule against the use of electronics, you will likely be able to get a special exception. If you feel too uncomfortable to do anything but stand or sit, there is a serious problem. Talk to your therapist, teacher, or parent as soon as possible. They will work with you to solve this problem or make adjustments as necessary.

, When you are walking in a hallway, you may feel like everyone is looking at you or that you look weird. This is not the case. Most people will not even give you a second look. Even if they do, they will forget about it within a minute or two. People are more concerned about themselves than they are about others. Once you understand this, you should feel much more comfortable. If you have an anxiety disorder or similar issues, you may feel unable to get rid of your negative thoughts. If so, be sure that your therapist and any other helpers you have are aware of this and are working with you to improve.

, Remember, these are the entire reason why you're here. Instead of upsetting yourself thinking about your social difficulties, pride yourself on your hard work and effort academically. Pay close attention in class, study, and take notes. As long as you do all of this and make an effort, you will pass your classes. If you are trying your hardest and still failing the class, speak to the teacher. It may be helpful to have your therapist and parent(s) present.

, Remember, as much as other people put stress on social performance, IT DOESN'T MATTER. In the long run, your grades matter entirely and how popular you were and how many friends you made don't matter at all and have no effect on your adult life. As long as you remember to stay positive and ignore ignorant comments, you will do well. If you do get to the point where you are depressed or contemplating suicide, talk to a trusted adult or call 1-800-273-8255 immediately.

If you see someone doing something you enjoy, talk with them about what they're doing. Connect with others about things that make you happy.


Join a club or group. For example, if you're into art and drawing, see if there are art groups or classes. If you like speaking French, find if there's a club for that. Or if you enjoy martial arts, see if there are after-school classes.Notice what others are doing and find a connection. If you see someone doodling in their notebook, ask to see what they're drawing or tell them about what you're into. Consider saying, ""I noticed your drawings. They're really cool. Are there other kinds of stuff you like to draw?"";
, Take a genuine interest in what others say and do. Being a good friend is about focusing on what others are doing and responding to what they say. Avoid distracting yourself with other things. Learn to focus on the person you're with.Keep good eye contact. This means making eye contact for about five seconds at a time. Any longer may seem like staring, which can make people uncomfortable.
Show that you're listening by nodding (and smiling if appropriate).
Validate what they're saying. Consider saying things like, ""That's cool,"" or ""That's really interesting.""

, Asking questions about someone's interests, work, or life will help you to get to know them, and to find out if you'll hit it off as friends. While you may want to tell them all about what's going on with you, focus on listening and asking questions. Use their responses as a way to find things that are similar in your life, work, or interests.


If you tend to get nervous and draw a blank, make a mental list (or a physical list you keep hidden, like on your phone) with some go-to questions. Questions might be: ""What kind of music do you like?""; ""Are you into any shows right now? I'm looking for something new to watch;"" ""Do you have any pets?""; ""Do you have any restaurant recommendations?""; ""What are you getting up to this weekend?""; and so on.
For example, you might ask about what movie they saw lately. They respond by saying that they say the latest superhero movie. Whether you've seen it or not, you can ask them things like: ""Did you like it?""; ""Are you into superhero movies?""; ""What was the best part of the movie?""; ""Are there other movies you've liked recently?""
Once someone has started talking, avoid interrupting. This way you can focus on what they are saying and are giving them time to speak.
When someone is telling a story or a concern they're having, be present and focus on what they're saying. Consider asking open-ended questions like, ""And what else happened?"" or ""Can you tell me more about that?""

, One of the simplest ways to become friends with someone is offering something to them. Learning to share can help you to develop a rapport and talk with others. It can be as simple as sharing your gum or a snack with a classmate or co-worker. If you're trying to get more attention, consider bringing a bunch of goodies like cookies or other snacks for a group to share.Use this act of sharing as an ice-breaker. After someone accepts your offer, ask about how they're doing or what their day has been like.
Use this opportunity to get to know about them better. Ask about what they've been doing this week or what they like to do.

, When you're shy, talking in groups may feel overwhelming. If you're in a social setting with lots of different people, find one person at a time to develop a connection with. Find someone else who is by themselves or not interacting as much with others. Engage them in conversation.


Be willing to talk first. If you're sitting or standing next to someone who's not talking, open up the conversation. Consider giving them a compliment or mentioning something that's going on as a way to start a conversation.Find spaces that allow for more one-on-one conversation. If you're at a party and it feels overwhelming, see if someone is willing to talk with you in a different location at the party where there are less people. Ask them, ""I'm going to step outside for a minute. Want to come with?"" or ""I think I'm going to get another snack in the kitchen. Want to join?""
If someone says no to your one-on-one time, it's okay. They may not be ready to hang out one-on-one just yet or may have some awkwardness themselves. Keep trying this with other people, and don't give up.

, When first developing a friendship, it's important to make others feel comfortable with you. Try to find topics that are less negative. While it's important to be genuine, focusing on positive things can help others feel at ease.Consider positive topics. Get the person to talk about themselves. Talk about what's in your surroundings. Talk about a funny thing that happened. Discuss a recent movie or TV show.
Avoid negative topics. Don't fixate on your poor health or illnesses in the family. Don't use this time to vent about your awful schoolwork or job with someone you just met. Avoid topics about death or destruction. Don't get caught up in technical jargon or small details that may not make sense to someone new.

, Don't be afraid to join in and tag along. While sometimes joining in may feel awkward at first, over time you may feel more comfortable and less awkward with the group. Being open and willing to try something new and different can help you get out of your shyness.Learn to say ""yes"" when asked if you'd like to come along. By saying yes sometimes, people are more likely to think that you enjoy being with them.
Be okay when others don't ask you to join. If you're more shy, you may feel uncomfortable with doing the asking and instead you're waiting for someone to ask you. Don't assume that just because they didn't ask you that they don't like you.
Asking to join others in an activity will help you learn to speak up for yourself and show that you're taking some initiative.

, Group settings of more than four people can be overwhelming for someone who is shy or anxious. Find ways to overcome this shyness by practicing to speak in groups or in front of other people.


Consider taking a public speaking class. By practicing how to be comfortable in front of others you'll be less shy or intimidated around others.
Try taking an acting or improv class. This will give you practice speaking in front of others and improv can help you sharpen your wit and be quick on your toes with conversation.
Consider joining a Toastmasters meeting. This can help you learn skills for public speaking with practice. Find a location through their website: https://www.toastmasters.org/

Practice talking more in smaller group settings first where you feel welcomed to speak. Use these opportunities to feel more comfortable in larger groups or among people you don't know.

, The harshest critic is often yourself. You might feel like you're not good enough, not smart enough, or not welcome. Avoid making assumptions that other people have a negative opinion of you.Instead of walking into a room and feeling judged, redirect your thoughts to something positive. Feel confident that you can make friends and be social.
Another way to take the focus off yourself is to tune in to your empathy and focus on the other person. If you practice becoming interested in the other person and use empathy to deepen that focus, you will become less aware of yourself and less worried about being noticed or judged.
Believe in yourself. Friendships don't happen overnight, but you will find others who you can relate to and enjoy being with.
You don't have to be perfect for others to like you. It's okay if you make mistakes at times. We're all human. Mistakes may help you to relate to others who are having a difficult time.

, If you're shy, you may feel uneasy about speaking up or talking first with someone new. Remember that when you speak up and take initiative, the easier it will be the next time. Be clear and concise when you take initiative. Avoid vague or passive behavior.


Learn to ask others out to do things. Don't always be a follower when you're trying to make new friends.
Consider saying, ""Want to hang out this weekend?"" or ""Want to eat lunch together?""
When you ask people to do things, you'll find out which people are interested in being friends. Focus your time on people who are interested in hanging out with you, rather than getting hung up on those who don't.

, By being helpful through your talents, skills, or kindness, you're more likely to develop friendships with others. Just make sure that those friends aren't only looking to you for something you can give. A friendship is both give and take. Make sure that your friends also give back and are there when you need them.Be willing to give yourself. Avoid being selfish or focusing only on your needs.
Show others that you care. Be kind and generous with your time. If a friend is having a tough time, don't be afraid to console them with kind words or a hug.
Showing empathy can help you overcome shyness. Sometimes just being physically present with a warm smile can make people trust you more, without even saying a word.

, By accepting others, they are more likely to accept you. Be willing to see things from other people's perspectives. Shyness may make you feel isolated or alone. By opening yourself up to others, you are likely to find more friends.Avoid oversharing in the first few times you meet with someone new. But make sure that you say more than a few words. Sharing something about yourself will help others to be more open.
It's okay to not be open with everyone. But if you're feeling alone, it's important to find a few people that you can trust. Share with those few whom you trust about what matters you and what makes you happy.
Trust yourself. Follow your intuition. If you feel comfortable with someone, open up to them.

Try to have fun with your gangster.,
Try to wear cool clothes and designer styles to impress your mate.,
Never ever cheat on your gangster!,
Get into the music your gangster loves.,
Don't blame yourself if the gangster breaks it off.",How to Love a Gangster," Most gangsters will want respect. If you love your gangster enough you will understand this basic need of theirs...and listen to them when they talk. Gangsters secretly want to find that person they can speak their mind to.;
, Gangsters do not want to be arrested although it happens sometimes. Maybe they did something bad, or they were with a friend who did something bad or they were at the wrong place at the wrong time. True gangsters usually deal with the prison life at certain times in their life. If you love your gangster you have to forgive them because this is their basic lifestyle of crime, illegal deeds, or supporting that life.

, Most gangsters need a ""stable"" base to return to. If they truly love you they will either want you to do good in life, or they will start asking you to do things that they do themselves. Gangsters don't want to feel alone in the world. It is up to you to be strong and teach them that you are living the right way or you do what they ask...but you risk getting in trouble in the long run.

, Just accept their friends for who they are and don't ask a lot of questions about what they do. Most of them if they are true gangsters will be secretive and hate it when others pry. Instead focus on the fun times and drink and do what they want to do...(and if you are uncomfortable with them then maybe you should not date or love a gangster....because this is the lifestyle they chose and their friends are part of it).

, They will look to you to have a good sense of humor and bring some sunshine to their life.

, Most gangsters want the good life. Wearing fashionable clothes and designer clothes are a big part of the lifestyle. Things like necklaces, fashionable jeans and expensive sneakers are apart of the gangster look. Most of the time they want a mate that is ""gangster"" appropriate to show around.

, It is unforgivable and no matter what you do for them they will not forgive you for cheating. Gangsters need to be the only one in a love relationship.

, This is a big one. Most gangsters will love specific bands or groups for good reasons. Many gangsters listen to music because they admire the artists who sing about their lifestyle or because they aspire to live that lifestyle that the artists are singing or rapping about. Either way a gangster and their music are inseparable!

, Most gangsters are searching in the world for love and respect. The sad fact is that many of them don't believe that their partners are faithful or that they are really loved by anyone. Gangsters have deep emotional issues that they cannot safely express and this can make them feel alone and depressed sometimes. When they break it off, even if you haven't done anything wrong, it may be because they don't want to admit their deep fear of commitment or of truly loving and needing someone. This usually heals itself in time after the gangster becomes mature....but that can take years sometimes.

Make lip balm.,
Make chocolate truffles.,
Make tortilla pizzas.,
Make chai lattes.",How to Have Fun with Your Teenage Friends (Girls)1," Tell your friends to bring over an old pair of jeans so you can all make cute cutoffs. To do make cutoffs, put on the jeans. Use a pencil to mark the cutoff point on either leg. Take off the pants and use a ruler to measure the cutoff point so it's exactly the same on both legs, then make a horizontal line where you want to cut. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut off the legs on a slight diagonal, so that the crotch is just slightly longer than the outside of the shorts.If you want to cuff your shorts, cut them an inch longer than your measured cutoff point.
When you mark your cutoff point, sit down to make sure it's not too short before you start cutting.

Hem the shorts or wash them without hemming if you like the frayed look.;
, Tell your friends to bring an old maxi skirt or other piece of long material made out of pretty fabric. Lay out the fabric and use measuring tape and a pencil to draw a long rectangle in the shape of a scarf. Cut it out. Leave the edges raw for a pretty bohemian look, or hem the edges if you prefer a more finished appearance.

, Gather some pretty ribbon and beads. Have each friend thread beads onto a ribbon in a creative pattern. Tie knots on either side of the beads to hold them in place. Take turns tying the ribbons tightly around each other's wrists, and cut off the long ends. Swear to wear the bracelets until they naturally wear out and fall off. When someone's falls off, she can make a wish.

, Melt the ingredients below in a double boiler (or a small pot set inside a bigger pot of simmering water). When the ingredients are all melted together, pour the liquid into empty containers, like leftover tins from lip balm you've used up. Let the lip balm cool completely before you use it. Here's what you need to make enough for six small tins:


2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 tablespoon cocoa butter
1 tablespoon beeswax
Optional: a chunk of lipstick (for color)
Optional: 5 to 10 drops of peppermint extract

, Put a pound (16 ounces) of chocolate chips into a large, heatproof bowl. Heat a cup of heavy whipping cream until it's just about to boil (but don't let it start bubbling). pour it over the chocolate chips. Let it sit for a minute so the chocolate chips can melt, then stir until the mixture is smooth. Refrigerate for 45 minutes, until the mixture is firm. Use a spoon to scoop it into balls, then roll the balls in your favorite topping and store in the fridge until you want to eat them. Here are some yummy ideas for toppings:Cocoa powder
Crushed peanuts
Crushed M&Ms
Crushed peppermints

, Each friend gets her own large flour tortilla. Place them on a baking sheet. Top the tortillas with marinara sauce or pizza sauce. Add grated mozzarella and your favorite pizza toppings, like pepperoni, chopped onions, chopped mushrooms or chopped olives. Turn on the oven's broiler. Broil the pizzas for five minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and the toppings are golden brown. Remove from the oven, slice and enjoy.

, Boil enough water to make a cup of tea for each friend. Place a chai tea bag in a mug for each person. Pour boiling water into the mugs. In a microwave-safe container, pour in 1/2 cup half and half for each serving. Stir in 1 teaspoon of sugar for each serving. Microwave this mixture for 30 seconds on high. Take it out of the microwave, pour it into a container with a tight-fitting lid, and shake it up until frothy. Remove the tea bags from the mugs and portion out the milk among them. Sprinkle cinnamon on top to finish."

Play truth or dare.,
Play paper telephone.,
Play ""who am I?"".,
Play ""never have I ever"".,
Play two truths and a lie.",How to Have Fun with Your Teenage Friends (Girls)2," To start the game, the first person to take a turn picks someone and asks ""Truth or dare?"" The girl called on has to pick one or the other. If the she picks truth, she has to answer a question about anything at all, like who she has a crush on or who she thinks is hot. If she picks dare, she have to complete a dare. Dares commonly involve kissing or pranking someone, depending on the darer's sense of humor.

, For this game you need a large piece of paper, and everyone participating needs a pen or pencil. One person starts the game by writing a sentence at the top of the paper, then passing the paper to the next girl in the circle. That person reads the sentence, then draws a picture representing it right underneath. She then folds the top of the paper back so that the original sentence can't be seen and the picture is still visible before passing it to the next girl. The next girl writes a sentence describing the picture, folds the paper down to hide the picture, and passes it to someone else. The next person reads the sentence, draws a new picture, folds the paper down, and so on. It's like the game telephone, but with paper., Everyone sits around a table and gets a blank notecard. Each person writes down a random name, like Taylor Swift or Harry Potter, then turns her card face-down on the table so no one can see the name. The cards are passed to the left. Still without looking, each girl takes her new card and tapes it to her forehead with the name facing out. Each person gets to ask the group one ""yes"" or ""no"" question to get clues about what name is on the card. Keep taking turns asking one question a piece until someone is able to correctly guess the name on her card.

, Everyone sits in a circle and puts their hands out in front of them on the table or floor. One person starts by saying ""Never have I ever,"" followed by something she has never done. For example, ""Never have I ever flown in a helicopter."" Anyone who has flown in a helicopter has to drop a finger. Now it's the next person's turn to come up with something she has never done, and so on around the circle. A player is out when she drops all ten fingers. The winner is the person still left in the game when everyone else has dropped out.

, One person starts the game by saying three statements: two that are true and one that's a lie. Everyone gets to guess which one is the lie, and those who are right get a point. Go around the circle until everyone has had a turn telling two truths and a lie. The girl with the most correct guesses wins.

, If you like shopping but don't have a lot of money to spend, play the mall game with your friends. Go to the mall and have a contest to see who can collect the most free stuff, like free perfume samples and free makeup samples. Whoever collects the most after two hours wins.

, When you don't have extra cash to take yourself out to a nice dinner, but you want to get out of the house with your friends, diners are your answer. Find a place that's open 24/7 and has cheap menu items you can all afford. You and your friends can hang out, gossip and get free coke refills for hours on end. Just don't forget to leave a tip.

, Ready to try something mature and different? Get your friends to go to an art gallery opening. Look in your local alternative weekly newspaper for listings about upcoming openings. They're usually free, and you'll get a chance to see cutting edge art. If nothing else, it will give you and your friends something new to talk about at the diner later that night.

, This is easiest in the summer, when parks host to all kinds of free outdoor events. Pack a picnic with your friends and take advantage of all the fun stuff your town has to offer.

, Get your friends together and treat yourselves to a $10 manicure in a real salon. Home makeovers are fun, but it's a little more exciting to get a professional manicure and choose from hundreds of different colors. Most towns have nail salons with manicure specials for $10 or so.

, Cheer on your school's sports teams, or save up to go to a college or pro game. If you like baseball, look for summer deals; you can often find cheap seats for just a few dollars (especially if you're seeing a team that needs as many spectators as possible to fill up the seats).

, If you and your friends are outdoorsy types, explore the natural areas near where you live. Go to local beaches, state parks, waterfalls, and more. Some of the best conversations you'll have with friends might take place in nature, where you'll feel less inhibited and more carefree.

, Always be as honest as possible and don’t mislead your friends. You have to build a sense of trust in order to have a strong friendship. Your friend will probably reciprocate and share things with you in confidence.Rather than lie, let your friend know why you feel uncomfortable sharing something with her. She will appreciate that you have thought about your friendship and feel that this may be something you need to deal with on your own.

, If you can’t find the time to catch up over the phone or face-to-face, you can still send updates via social media. Many platforms allow you to simply Like someone’s status and include a small comment.

Even if your friend just posted something about the dinner he had, Like it and post a comment similar to “mmm, looks good, we’re overdue for dinner”. This will let him know that you’re thinking about him.

, Some friends find it difficult to keep up because it may seem like you haven't spoken in a long time and the thought of reconnecting becomes overwhelming. You may feel the need to send a lengthy message or chat for hours, but sending brief messages more frequently well help alleviate this.

Talk about short trivial things so that neither of you feel obligated to talk about heavy emotional topics that tend to take more time.

, Placing important appointments in your calendar ensures that you don’t forget and are prepared. Whether it’s a video chat, phone call, meeting, or email, make sure to schedule it into your calendar and follow through.Video calls are great, especially for friends that live far away.

, It’s understandable if life gets in the way of catching up. Don’t be mad if your friend has to reschedule because of work or family. People can get very busy when they have big life changes like having kids or building a career.Ask when a good time to reschedule would be or just leave it up to your friend if she is very busy.

, Rekindle a shared hobby or interest. You may also find something new to bond over. People grow up and learn about different things. You can take up something that interests you both or experiment trying to find something you both enjoy. It’s never too late to learn something new.

Doing something nostalgic that you use to do early on the friendship is always a good way to renew your bond.

, You can visit your old haunts or bring families together for a summer road trip. You can also schedule a vacation around a shared interest like sports or music. Taking time off together allows you to focus on the friendship.Don’t try to force a vacation on a friend who has a lot of commitments like family or a career. It puts too much pressure on the vacation. She may resent you if things don’t go as planned.

, Don’t assign blame but rather be accountable and put in the effort to maintain your friendship. There’s no sense to find reasons as to why your friendship is failing.Reach out whenever you feel like it so that you don’t feel like you have to take turns. Be comfortable saying things like, “it’d be great to spend time with you if you’re free.”, Make sure you always have good hygiene and are well-groomed. You don’t want to be an embarrassment. Your friend will want the best version of you and that includes taking care of yourself."

, Take up hobbies, anticipate spending time on your own, and generally embrace having time to yourself. If you constantly seek the company of your friends, it may seem needy and overwhelming. Being able to enjoy time to yourself can keep your friendship.Independence and self-reliance will serve you well when there is a prolonged scheduling conflict.

, Having only one friend can put a lot of burden on the relationship. You don’t want someone to feel smothered or like you’re a burden. Allow yourself to develop other friendships so that you have a full support system when you need it., If you remain guarded or keep your friendship at a superficial level, your friend may not think that the relationship is serious enough to keep. Share the important things in your life.

Don’t feel like there needs to be a reciprocity. Some people take longer to open up than others. Communicate as openly as you feel comfortable.

, Avoid having a one way friendship. Make sure that you actively listen to your friend and offer support when you can. A friendship should be mutually beneficial so offer what you can when your friend needs it. Don’t wait for him to ask.Being a good friend means being able to read the situation and anticipate what your friend needs even though she may not know herself. This means being attentive and listening without judgement.

, You don’t want your trust to be breached, and your friend wants to know that you can be trusted as well. Don’t try to force any information out that she doesn’t feel comfortable telling you. Trust needs to be earned., Friendship is meant to be enjoyed. It shouldn’t be taxing or feel like a burden. Do things that make both of you happy and make sure that both of you are getting something positive out of the relationship.

, Check in as often as your schedules will allow. Even if months or years pass, a friendship can continue where you left off if you make the first move. Visit your friend when you can because meeting face to face brings a sense of warmth messages and phone calls can’t.

, Stay warm and upbeat. Having a negative friend may become burdensome. Don’t be afraid to let a negative friend know that her attitude is difficult to deal with and something needs to change.Talk about everyone in a positive light. If you gossip or take down someone behind his back, your friend may think that you act that way when she’s not around.

, No one wants to have a flaky friend. Friendship means that you are there for each other when you need each other most. This doesn’t just mean physical presence but also honest opinions when it’s difficult for your friend to hear.Friends will appreciate that they can count on you to hear the truth and that you will be there for them when you say you will.

, Respect your friend’s feelings and generally respect her as a person. Never disparage her and support her in her endeavors. You want to be a positive addition to her life so have her best intentions in mind.

Accept each other for your individuality. Don’t be judgemental.

You may also want to establish a place to meet so one person doesn’t travel more than the other.Establish standards that are fair and acceptable to everyone involved. Make sure that you communicate openly and compromise when you can. You may also need to agree upon the frequency of when you catch up, the kind of catching up you want to do, and the type of activities you want to enjoy together.
You may need to be as detailed as establishing time limits for phone calls, what time is acceptable to be contacted, the frequency you can be contacted, and the length of contact. Some people need firm boundaries or they may overtake your time.

, Some friends may think that it’s okay to get overly involved in your life including your family decisions. They may actually think that they are part of the family and that their input matters as such. Make sure you agree upon what’s acceptable.In contrast, some friends don’t want anything to do with your family and may be disrespectful with your time. Make sure you agree with your friends about what your priorities are and what is most important to you.

, Some friends are overly physical or, in contrast, don’t want to be touched at all. Make sure you establish your personal space together so that you each know what’s appropriate.

Physical touch may also be applied to your family or other people in your social circle. Make sure friends know what is acceptable.

, Some people don’t have a filter or, in contrast, are very guarded. Make sure you each know what the appropriate topics of conversation are. You don’t want to be rude or offend your friend. You also want to speak up if you’ve been offended., Shift the focus onto yourself and describe what you are feeling about the situation.

Feel free to ask your friends what they think about certain tv shows, drinking, smoking, sex, classmates, and themselves. The more you know about someone, the easier it will be for you to decide whether she will make a good friend or not., You may find it difficult to become friends with popular kids and if you do, you may find it extremely difficult to keep the friendship because they may have many options and only be concerned with staying popular. They try to keep their status and may not be trustworthy or worth investing your time.

, It may be easiest to keep friends with similar schedules or who live close to you. Friends who play the same sports or who participate in the same clubs make it easier for you to see and interact with them frequently.

Keeping friends in different schools may be difficult but you can schedule hanging out with them during the weekends, share an interest, or meet them to do an activity.

, Grow your newly formed friendship by taking it slow, being available, and by not being needy.Friendship should develop at your own pace. Don’t rush into anything.
Allow your friendship to grow by making time for your friend.
Avoid being needy. Being needy can turn off any friend. Don’t be relentless with your attempts to become friends.

Talk respectfully about other women in the presence of a lady (and when women aren't there).
Take aside a male friend who says rude things about women, and explain to him that his behavior isn't cool.

, Holding doors, helping with a coat, and offering to carry heavy things are all ways to be polite. Do this not because you think women are weaker, but because you want to make her feel special and valued.


A good rule of thumb: if you wouldn't do it for a male loved one, don't do it for a lady you love.

, Don't gripe about her weight, the size of her chest, the color of her skin, her disability, whether and when she menstruates, or the way she likes to dress. A woman's body is the way it is, and it isn't your place to judge it.



Compliment her looks if you feel like it. Try giving a compliment about her insecurities (beautiful freckles, incredible wide hips, cute autistic stimming) to help her love herself.

, Women may be told that they are too emotional, or that their feelings are invalid (e.g. they must be on their period). Treat a lady's feelings as natural and valid.

, Just as you value her emotions, give her the opportunity to show how much she cares about yours. Be honest about how you feel, and let yourself be vulnerable or cry if you need to. You are equals, and both of you should feel free to express emotion.

Make a mental note and try to remember to continue making observations about when she seems different than she usually does.;
, Once you are aware that she seems off, start paying attention to when her behavior changes. Look for patterns that will give you an idea of what might be causing her to act differently.


Does her demeanor change when a particular subject is brought up?
Does the change occur when a certain person is around?
Does she seem to feel uncomfortable when she is in a specific location?
Is there an upcoming event that she does not want to discuss?

, Again, if you know her very well, then spotting differences in her behavior should be quite simple. As you narrow down the general cause for her sudden secrecy, observe her for any habits or tell-tale signs of lying or secrecy.


Seems to be thinking really hardEyes frequently flickering toward an exitFrequently pauses when giving responsesChanges the subject abruptly
Crosses her arms across her chest or protects other vulnerable areas, like her throatShares too many detailsLeans backward, as if trying to physically distance herselfStillness of her arms and legsLack of emphatic gesturingStops using “I” statements and refers to people by names instead of “him” or “her”Avoids answering questions completelyClears throat and swallows hard frequently, As you observe her behavior and what triggers it, think about what she might be hiding and how serious it is.


If you are in a relationship with her, then perhaps she is hiding that she is cheating or that she picked up a bad habit she promised she quit, like smoking. Or, if she is a friend, maybe she is hiding something that was said about you behind your back.
There is always the chance that she is hiding something positive, like a surprise gift or party. It is important to give her the benefit of the doubt., Creating a list of your suspicions, or detailing one big suspicion, will help you to both look and feel more prepared as you confront her. It also gives you the opportunity to refer to what behaviors, words, or actions made you come to these conclusions.


Include anything strange about her behavior, including things she has said, ways she has acted, and odd behaviors she has displayed.
Note your observations about what topics or people seem to trigger these changes in her demeanor.

, Choose someone who knows both of you and ask your friend if he/she has noticed the same odd behavior. This friend might know her side of the story and can help you realize if there is something you are missing that explains the behavior or if your observations are accurate.

, Depending on your relationship, you could plan to talk to her at home, if she is your significant other, or you could make plans to meet her for lunch, for example.


Avoid letting on that you want to talk to her about her secretive behavior, if you are making plans in advance. This will likely cause her to decline your invitation and make it harder for you to talk to her to find out what is going on.

, There is the possibility that she could become explosive when you bring up the topic, so do your best to diffuse the situation by remaining calm.


However, this does not mean that you should be evasive or vague about what you are getting at. You need to be clear and straightforward about her secrecy so that she fully understands the conversation.
“I get the feeling lately that you're keeping something from me. My relationship with you is important to me, so I'd like to talk about it.”
“You've had some interesting reactions to comments I've made lately. I don't want to offend you, but it seems like you might be keeping a secret. Can we talk about it?”
“I've noticed recently that you've been extremely nervous most of the time I've been around you. Is something going on that you would like to talk about?”

, You are having this conversation with her because you are concerned about what is going on, and you want to resolve it, so help her understand that with your words and gestures.


“I've noticed lately that when Bryan is around, you become distant and closed-off. I'm wondering what has happened to bring on this change in you toward him? I'm here to help you.”
“Recently, you've become a little secretive when we talk about our plans with other people. I'm concerned, and I want to know if there's something that you need to tell me.”
“The last time that we were in Mrs. Smith's class, you seemed really jumpy and fidgety. I'm here for you, if you want to talk about what happened to cause that.”
“You told me the other night that you stayed in and read a book until you fell asleep, but Stacy said that the two of you went out dancing. I'm hurt that you lied to me, and I'm wondering why you felt the need to do that.”

, Remember to stay calm, and give her the opportunity to respond to you without interrupting. If she continues to appear secretive, let her know that you are observing particular behaviors that indicate she might be lying, like an inability to maintain eye contact, making frequent pauses in her response, or giving too many details. Then, ask her again to be honest with you.


If she continues to withhold what is really going on, then you need to consider the value of this friendship or relationship. What does it say about your relationship with her if she will not tell you the truth?
“I heard you say that...”
“I understand that you feel...”
“I appreciate that you agreed to talk about this with me, but I get the sense that you're still not being completely honest. Can you share the whole truth with me?”
“I'm really glad that we're getting the opportunity to talk about this. However, it seems like you have more you want to say but haven't yet. Go ahead and share.”

, In the event that she does share with you what she has been hiding, give yourself time to process it, especially if it is something negative.


Consider her reasons for hiding it from you and the validity of those reasons. Should she have been honest with you from the beginning, or is her secrecy understandable?
Evaluate the relationship, whether it was right of her to hide information from you, and what can be done to repair any hurt that was caused.

Alligators have a wide, rounded, ""U""-shaped snouts with larger noses, whereas crocodiles have longer, thinner, pointed ""V""-shaped snouts and smaller noses. Alligator snouts are also shorter than crocodile snouts.


The broad snouts that alligators have give them more strength than crocodiles. They can crush hard shelled prey, such as turtles, much easier than crocodiles can.Crocodiles tend to eat more fish and mammals.;
, The crocodile's upper and lower jaws are nearly the same width, so the teeth are exposed all along the jaw line in an interlocking pattern, even when the mouth is closed. An alligator, on the other hand, has a wider upper jaw, so when its mouth is closed the teeth in the lower jaw fit into sockets of the upper jaw, hidden from view. Only the teeth of the upper jaw are exposed along the lower jaw line.


Alligators' upper jaws are wider than their lower jaws, so the upper jaw overlaps the lower jaw. Because of this, the teeth in the lower jaw are hidden when their mouth closes.
Crocodiles' upper and lower jaws are approximately the same width, so their upper and lower teeth interlock when their mouth shuts. This causes some of their teeth to show when their mouth closes. They'll almost look like they're smiling, as the fourth tooth on each side of the lower jaw sticks up over the upper lip., Alligators tend to have a darker skin than crocodiles do. Crocodiles normally have lighter skin, usually in the colours of olive green or brown. Alligators usually have darker, blackish-grey skin. Crocodiles are also longer than alligators. On average, full grown crocodiles are 5.8 meters, whereas full grown alligators are 3.4 meters.On average, full grown alligators weigh 800-1,000lbs. Crocodiles can grow to be a bit larger and weight between 1,000-2,000lbs.The average lifespan of alligators is 30-50 years, and the average lifespan of crocodiles is 70-100 years. , Most crocodiles have a fringe type appearance on their hind legs and feet that alligators do not. Also, alligators have webbed feet, and crocodiles do not., Due to their low tolerance for salt, alligators typically live in fresh water habitats. Alligators will sometimes live in brackish water (salt water and fresh water mixed together) as well. Alligators primarily inhabit swamps and marshes, but can also be found in rivers, lakes, and other small bodies of water. They generally prefer warmer temperatures, but can survive in freezing temperatures as well., As opposed to alligators, crocodiles have modified salivary glands on their tongues to help them tolerate salt water. Crocodiles usually live near lakes, rivers, wetlands and some saltwater regions. They live in tropical climates because they are cold-blooded and can't generate their own heat., Crocodiles are found in the tropical areas of Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. Alligators live in the southern United States and China. The United States is the only country that both alligators and crocodiles inhabit.


American alligators are most commonly found in Florida and Louisiana, and are less commonly found in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Texas.
American crocodiles are usually found in Florida., Crocodiles tend to be much more active and spend much more time in the water than alligators. Alligators spend most of their time laying in mud or the greenery surrounding marshals and lakes.Alligators tend to lay their eggs in mounds of vegetation surrounding freshwater.
Crocodiles lay their eggs in slightly drier places like mud or sand., Crocodiles tend to be much more aggressive than alligators. Crocodiles are more likely to attack at random when something comes near, whereas alligators are more likely to wait until hungry or threatened to attack.


In their natural habitat and in zoos, crocodiles have much more aggressive behavior towards humans than alligators.

, Crocodiles and alligators are both extremely fast swimmers, both swimming up to 20 mph. On land, they are a bit slower, typically running up to 11mph. Since they are smaller and do not get tired as easily, alligators can typically run for longer periods of time than crocodiles."

A No. 3 coil-spring trap with a jaw spread of about 6 inches (15 cm) should do the job. A number 1.5 size trap is probably too small to catch a coyote.Make sure the trap has a center swivel and a reinforced base plate. The central swivel will reduce the chances the coyote’s foot is harmed by allowing the trapped coyote to pull on a heavy chain that is attached to the bottom of the trap. Cage traps don’t work well with coyotes because they may shy away from them.You can find such traps at many manufacturers, although sometimes people modify existing traps, for example by making a narrow-jawed trap wider. You can do this by welding a metal strip along the trap’s jaw to make its width larger (this process is called laminating).;
, There might be many coyotes in the area, and you could end up catching family numbers not causing damage. So you might need to trap a few coyotes before getting the culprit.


Coyotes that kill livestock are usually male coyotes in the prime of their life (between the ages of 3 to 5-years-old). The dominant male is usually to blame, unless it’s just small pigs or poultry that are turned up dead.
There are myths that the most damaging coyotes are old females with pups, but this is often not true.

, This will help you determine whether you have caught the male of the likely age to be doing the damage.


You can best determine a coyote’s age by looking at the wear on its teeth. Look at the wear on the front incisor teeth. These teeth are located between the canine teeth. If the incisor teeth have rounded lobes, the coyote is probably young. Be very careful, though! Coyotes can be extremely dangerous. Have a wildlife expert do this.
Coyotes in the prime age to cause damage usually have wear on their incisors and don’t have rounded lobes. Their teeth are flat across the top.

, Conservation Departments of various states will usually have rules and regulations for trapping coyotes. Make sure you follow them.


Although they can vary by state, some examples are regulations that traps must be attended daily, must be made of metal with smooth or rubber jaws, and must be labeled with the user’s name and address.
Generally, you will not be able to set traps that are in pathways used by people or domestic animals, like dogs and cats. Some states have notification requirements. You need to get permission, for example, before setting a trap on other people’s property.

, You want to set the trap in a spot where the damage-causing coyote is likely to be caught. Coyotes are known to return to the same areas. So look for places where problems have already occurred.


Be on the lookout for coyote tracks (old and new) and droppings in the ground, especially near pastures or pens. This is a good place to set a trap for a coyote. Similarly, you could put the trap in the area where a coyote has left an animal carcass. Coyote droppings are small. They are usually a little bigger than a cigar and black when new.
Good places to set coyote traps include farm or livestock trails, at field’s edge, at the intersections of fences, where farm trails pass through gates, and on open ground. Don’t set coyote traps under trees or against high weeds or brush because coyotes don’t like to approach such places.

, These are good trap locations because they are areas that coyotes like to frequent, and you’re less likely to end up with raccoons and other small creatures in your trap.


Locate the trap on the upwind side of the coyote pathway you are targeting. This will make it more likely that the coyote will smell your lure. Or you could set multiple traps to capture all wind directions.Restrain dogs and cats before setting the trap. You don’t want to end up with a dog or cat in your trap, and they are likely to be drawn to the trap too. Thus, make sure that dogs and cats are not roaming loose before setting the trap.

, This is a common trap set used to snare coyotes. All you need are a few tools: a trowel, hammer or hatchet, sifter, 3-foot square kneeling cloth, and a bucket.Traps come with coil springs or powered cable or non-powered cable devices. All can work for catching coyotes.The dirt-hole trap works because coyotes will think it’s a hole where another animal buried food.
The set has bait or lure in the hole to attract the coyote. Make sure that there is pan tension in the trap. About 4 pounds is a good amount of pan tension. You could just fill empty plastic bottles with sand to put in the pan to create pan tension.

, The hole should be about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter and 8 inches deep at a 45-degree angle. It’s best to dig under grass so it can serve as backing.


Place the dirt from the hole on the kneeling cloth. Place the trap 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the hole so you can determine how large to dig the trap’s bed.
Dig another hole an inch or so above the ground that is wide enough for the trap and stakes.

, Level and smooth the trap bed. Secure the trap with a stake that you drive through the attachment on the swivel. Use a 5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) reinforcing rod stake.


Once the stake is in the ground, place loose soil from the kneeling cloth to bed the trap. Twist it into the dirt. The trap should be about an inch below the ground. Install a pan cover to keep dirt away from the trap’s springs. You want a porous pan cover. Denim or fiberglass screen could work.
Cut the cover to fit under the jaws and over the pan of the trap. Pack loose soil around the trap and over the pan cover’s ends. Bed the trap securely by packing soil firmly around it. Now sift ¼ to ½ inch of dry dirt over the trap.
Bedding a trap means you place the trap solidly in the hole with solid support beneath it so that it doesn’t shift if the coyote steps on other parts of the trap instead of the pan. You want the finished product to look like an animal dug the hole.

, These traps are also called scent-post sets, and they are used to trap coyotes along trails or paths.


Find a clump of grass in an area where the coyote has used droppings. You will want a large lure object so it attracts the attention of a passing coyote. You want to place the lure object perpendicular to the coyote’s path.
Bed and cover the flat set as you would the dirt hole set. Cover over the tarp with dried grass, leaves or dried cow or sheep manure that was grated through a sifter.

, Blind sets are sometimes used as a last resort. Place the set in an area where there are coyote tracks as if the coyote has jumped over something, such as a fence.


Conceal and cover the blind spot as you would a flat set. Place the trap where the coyote hits the ground when it jumps over a fence.
Carefully hide the trap, placing small sticks on either side of it to direct the coyote onto it. You generally don’t use bait or lure in a blind set because the goal is that the coyote will jump over the fence into the trap.

, It works better to put two or more lures in the hole instead of just one. You need something, though, that will draw the coyote to the trap.


Tainted meat bait is a popular choice (beaver, bobcat, cattle or skunk). But these choices might not work well in hot weather.
Commercial lures may be less messy than meat bait. Commercial lures contain odors that coyotes like, such as beaver castor or tonquin musk. Some also contain skunk essence because this is known to attract coyotes. Coyote trappers often have their own recipes. One homemade lure uses rotten eggs by breaking four dozen eggs into a gallon jar. Stir them, and let it set for a couple of months.
You could also put a ball of sheep wool in the hole, and pour lures on it. Coyote gland lure, red fox urine or coyote urine in addition to coyote droppings can also be used.

, Some traps are lethal traps. They work by putting a rope around the animal’s head. But in other cases the coyote may be trapped live. Seek a professional’s help in removing the coyote from the trap. Trapped coyotes are very dangerous.


Many jurisdictions will require that the coyote be euthanized after trapping. Others may offer places it can be taken to. Contact your local governmental wildlife or conservation department.
Wear thick clothing and protective gloves when dealing with a coyote. Be aware that coyotes can carry rabies and other diseases.To kill a trapped coyote, shoot the coyote in the head with a .22 long rifle or similar firearm. Alternatively, shoot the coyote behind the front leg into the chest region. Discard the carcass.

, You can clean a coyote trap with a high-pressure hose at a car wash. You will want to clean the trap before using it again after you catch a coyote (or any other animal).


Another possibility is to use hot soapy water. Soak the trap in it. Then scrub the trap with a stiff brush.
Rinse the trap in clean water. Hang it outside to let it dry. You don’t need to dye or wax the trap unless it’s used in the winter and gets salt on it.
Log wood crystals are commercial dyes used on traps to help prevent rusting. Put the dye in a large water container. Heat it until it boils. Add the traps to the boiling water until they turn brown or black.

, Some animal rights groups consider trapping coyotes to be inhumane. They have educational programs about how to resolve coyote conflicts.Keep food and water away from the coyote. Coyotes are often lured to a neighborhood because they are hungry or thirsty. Food can attract a coyote to your neighborhood. Things like unsecured garbage, compost piles and pet food may draw a coyote over. Get rid of such things, and the coyote might go elsewhere.
Water draws coyotes as much as food does. So artificial lakes, irrigation, and pet water dishes are all things that could draw the coyote to your neighborhood., Coyotes have become fairly accustomed to human beings. The goal is to make them afraid of coming around people again.


When you see a coyote, be very loud. For example, you could yell or use homemade noisemakers.
Make yourself appear as large as possible (stand tall, and wave your arms around.)

, If you want to keep a coyote away from livestock, you could use fencing that will deter the coyote.


For example, net fences in good repair will stop a lot of coyotes if the mesh spacing is less than 6 inches (15.2 cm) and the vertical spacing is less than 4 inches.
Electric fencing also can work, but it can require more labor to keep it maintained. , Sometimes people who are trying to protect livestock will employ a livestock guarding dog. This is a dog that is reared to repel predators.


The most common livestock guarding dogs are Great Pyrenees, Komondor, Anatolian Shepherd, and the Akbash Dog.
The dogs need to be trained. It would be very dangerous to the dog to use an untrained dog as a guarding animal.

Be in the right place.,
In some places you'll find road signs indicating echidnas.",How to Track Echidnas1," Obviously, echidnas aren't strolling down the streets of suburbia. They're shy and quiet animals, and their preferred habitat ranges from rainforest, alpine to semi-desert, away from built-up areas. In general, where there are ants and termites in abundance, echidnas may be present too. There are four known species of echidnas:


The short-beaked echidna (found in Australia and New Guinea); in Australia, they are very adaptable, living from the Simpson Desert through to the Alpine snow.
The Western long-beaked echidna, Sir David's long-beaked echidna and the Eastern long-beaked echidna (all in New Guinea). (No images at present.);
, These are usually posted on the roadside, to warn drivers to slow down and avoid hitting them when crossing the road. This is a good indicator that you're in an area where echidnas might be spotted.
