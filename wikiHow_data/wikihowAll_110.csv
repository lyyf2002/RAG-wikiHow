Xcode is available for free from Apple, but requires OS X 10.8 or later to be installed. There is no official way to run Xcode on a Windows or Linux PC. This means that if you want to develop an iPhone app but don't have a Mac, you'll need to invest in one first.


To develop iOS 8 apps, you will need Xcode 6.0.1 and the iOS 8 SDK, both of which are available from Apple. The iOS 8 SDK contains a significant number of new APIs that allow you to create all kinds of new app experiences, including iCloud integration and Touch ID.
To develop iOS 10 apps, you'll need Xcode 8 and the iOS 10 SDK, also available from Apple. There are significant changes to the Swift language and the SDK in this version of Xcode that you'll want to be aware of, but the good news is that there are to be no more ""code breaking"" changes to the Swift language after this version.;
, While you can code completely within Xcode, you'll find that working with large chunks of code is much easier if you have a dedicated text editor that specializes in programming syntax. TextMate and JEdit are two very popular choices.

, If you plan on creating custom art and designs for your app, you will want a program that can create vector graphics. Vector graphics scale without losing clarity, and are essential for a good-looking app. Popular vector programs include CorelDraw, Adobe Illustrator, Xara Designer and Inkscape. A nice, free, vector graphics drawing program is DrawBerry. It is not as powerful as the professional programs, but it is good for a first-time user, or if you just don't want to pay for something just for one use.

, It handles data and object manipulation. Objective-C is a derivative of the C family of languages, and is an object-oriented language. If you already have a basic understanding of C or Java, Objective-C should be, for the most part, pretty easy to grasp.


A newer option is to create your app using the Swift language, the follow-on to Objective-C. Swift has a much friendlier syntax and a more modern feel.
While it's possible to build a basic app without knowing Objective-C, you cannot perform any sort of advanced function without coding it yourself. Without Objective-C, all you can do is move back and forth between screens.
There are a variety of tutorials available online, as well as a wealth of information to be found in various books about Objective-C or Swift. If iPhone app development is something you want to take seriously, you'll be well-served by having some resources handy.
Some of the more popular online Objective-C and Swift communities include the Apple Developer Forums, the iPhoneSDK Google Group, and StackOverflow.

, If you simply don't have any interest in learning Objective-C or Swift or don't have an artistic bone in your body, there are a large number of freelancers and development teams out there that may be able to take on various aspects of your project for you. Outsourcing your development is a complicated process, but can save you lots of headaches if you're not the programming type. Make sure that everyone involved signs a Non-Disclosure Agreement, and that pay structures are in place before any work begins.ODesk and Elance are two of the most popular freelancing services on the Internet, and both have hundreds of developers and artists of all skill levels.

, In order to distribute your app on the App Store or give it to others to test, you will need to sign up for an Apple Developer account. The account costs $99 per year and will require you to enter in tax and bank account information.


You can create your account at the iOS Dev Center website.

, Once you've signed up for a Developer account, you will have access to Apple's development resources. These resources include a variety of sample projects which can give you a tremendous amount of insight into how app development works. Find an example that is related to the kind of app you want to create and mess around with it in Xcode.

, Before you even open Xcode for the first time, you should have a well-thought-out plan for your app and its features. This could include a design document which outlines all of the functionality of the app, sketches of the user interface and flow between screens, and a basic idea of the types of systems that will need to be implemented.


Try to stick to your design document as much as possible while you are developing your app. This will help keep you focused on the features you want.
Try to draw at least one thumbnail sketch for each screen in your app.

, The audience of your app will have a lot to do with the way it looks and the functionality of the application. For example, a to-do list app will have a much different audience than a gory shooting game. This will help you

, If your app is a utility of some kind, it should offer a solution to a problem that hasn't been solved before or a unique solution or method or one that does it better than previous attempts. If your app is a game, it should have a unique feature or features that help set it apart and attract specific gamers.

, Your user interface will be determined by the type of content you are showing the user of your app. For example, if the app deals with photos, you will want a user interface that makes looking at photos and navigating through them as easy as possible.

, The user interface should never get in the way of the user. This means that options should be clearly visible, and the user should never have to question what button does what. If you are using icons, they should accurately represent their function. Navigation through the app should be fluid and natural.


UI design is as much an art form as it is a science. You will likely be revising your design constantly as your project evolves.

, Open up Xcode, and start a new Project from the File menu. Select ""Application"" under the ""iOS"" heading on the left side of the window. In the template section, choose ""Empty Application"".


There are a variety of templates available, all designed for different tasks. Start with a blank template until you get more comfortable with the development process. You can try one of the more complicated templates once you're familiar with how everything works.
You will need to provide a Product Name, your company identifier, and the class prefix. If you don't have a company identifier from Apple yet, enter com.example. For the class prefix, enter XYZ.
Select ""iPhone"" from the Devices menu.

, The Storyboard is the visual representation of all of your app's screens. It shows the contents of each screen as well as the transitions between them. The Storyboard tool will help you develop the flow of your app.


Click File → New → File.
Under the iOS heading, click ""User Interface"".
Select Storyboard, and click Next.
Select iPhone from the Devices menu, and then name the file ""Main"". Make sure that it is saved in the same location as your project.

, Once you create the Storyboard, you will need to assign it as the main interface of your app. This will load the Storyboard when the app is launched. If you don't assign the storyboard, nothing will happen when you start the app up.


Click your project name in the left navigation tree.
Find the Targets heading in the main frame. Select your project from the Targets list.
Find the Deployment Info section in the General tab.
Enter Main.storyboard into the ""Main Interface"" text field.

, View controllers dictate how content is viewed by the user. There are a variety of preset view controllers available, including standard views and tables. You will add view controllers to your storyboard, which tells the app how to display the content to the user.


Select your ""Main.storyboard"" file in the project navigation menu. You will see a blank canvas appear in the Interface Builder window.
Find the Object Library. This is located at the bottom of the right frame, and can be selected by clicking the little cube button. This will load a list of objects that can be added to your canvas.
Click and drag the ""View Controller"" object onto the canvas. Your first screen will appear on the canvas.
Your first ""Scene"" is complete. When the app is started, the view controller will load your first screen.

, Once you have the view controller set, you can start populating the screen with the interface objects you need, such as labels, text input fields, and buttons. Interface objects can all be found in the Objects Library list that you found the View Controller object in.


Click and drag objects from the list to add them to your screen.
Most objects can be resized by clicking and dragging the boxes on the edge of the object. When resizing, guidelines will appear on the screen so that you can ensure everything lines up correctly.

, You can adjust the properties for each object, allowing you to create a custom and intuitive interface. For example, you can add placeholder text to a text input field that will help guide the user on what they should input.


Select the object you want to customize and click the ""Attributes Inspector"" button at the top of the right frame. The button looks kind of like a shield.
Customize the object to your liking. You can change font style, font size, text color, alignment, background images, placeholder text, border style, and much more.
The available options will change depending on the object you are customizing.

, As your project grows, you will probably need to add more screen to display all the content necessary for the app to be useful. For example, if you are making a to-do list app, you will need at least two screens: one for inputting a to-do list item, and one for viewing the entire list.


More screens are added by dragging and dropping view controller objects onto blanks parts of your canvas. If you can't find a blank spot to drop it, click the ""zoom out"" button until you find empty areas. Make sure to drop the view controller onto the canvas and not onto an existing screen.
You can change the initial screen by selecting the view controller you want to lead with from the project outline. Click the Attribute Inspector button and check the ""Is Initial View Controller"" box. For example, if you are making a to-do list, you'll want the actual list to be the first thing the user sees when the app is launched.

, Now that you have two screens in your app, it's time to make it so that the user can move back and forth between them. You can do this through the use of a Navigation Controller, which is a specialized View Controller. This controller adds a navigation bar to the top of your app that allows user to move back and forth between screens.Your navigation controller should be added to your initial view so that it can control all subsequent screens.
Select your initial view in the project outline.
Click Editor → Embed In → Navigation Controller.
You should see a gray navigation bar appear at the top of the screen you added the controller to.

, Now that you have inserted the navigation bar, you can start adding navigation tools to it. This will allow your user to move back and forth between screens.


Add a title to the navigation bar. Click the Navigation Item underneath the view controller you assigned it to. Open the Attribute Inspector and type the title of the current screen in the Title field.
Add a navigation button. Open the Objects library if its not already open and find the Bar Button Item. Click and drag it to the navigation bar. Typically, buttons that move you ""forward"" in the app are placed to the right, and buttons that move you ""back"" are placed to the left.
Give the button a property. Buttons can be configured to have specific properties that make them easy to adapt to the circumstance. For example, if you are creating a to-do list, you'll want an ""Add"" button to create a new entry. Select the button, and open the Attribute Inspector. Find the Identifier menu and choose ""Add"". The button will change to a ""+"" logo.

, In order for your button to function, you will need to connect it to another screen. In our to-do list example, the button is located on the overall list, and needs to be linked to the entry screen. To link the button, hold the Ctrl and drag the button onto the second screen.When you release the mouse button, the Action Segue menu will appear with a list of options. Choose ""Push"" to use the push transition when moving between screens. You can also choose ""Modal"", which will open the screen as a self-contained action as opposed to a sequence.
If you use Push, a navigation bar will be added automatically to your second screen and a ""back"" button will be automatically created. If you choose modal, you will need to manually insert a second navigation bar as well as add a ""Cancel"" and ""Done"" button (for a to-do list; the labels of your buttons will change depending on the needs of your app).
""Cancel"" and ""Done"" buttons can be created the same way that you created the ""Add"" button. Simply select ""Cancel"" or ""Done"" from the Identifier menu in the Attribute Inspector.

, Up to this point, you've been able to create a basic navigable interface without the need for any coding. If you want to add any deeper functionality, such as data storage and handling user input, you'll need to get your hands dirty in the code. Coding is outside of the scope of this guide, but there are a large number of Objective-C tutorials available online.You can use your navigable interface prototype to help you hire a developer. Having a working interface will make it much easier to explain what you need on the coding side of things.

, Xcode comes with a built-in iOS simulator that lets you test your app on a variety of simulated iOS devices. To start the Simulator, choose ""Simulator and Debug"" from the dropdown menu at the top of the Xcode window, and then choose the device you want to test on.

, Click the Build button, which looks like a traditional Play button, to compile the app and run it. Building the app may take a few minutes. you can watch the progress in the toolbar. Once the build process is complete, the iOS Simulator will open and you can begin testing your app.

, Before distributing your app for testing, you can test it on your own device (if you have one). First, plug your device into your computer via USB. Close iTunes if it opens. Select ""Device and Debug"" from the dropdown menu, and then click the Build button. After a few seconds the app should launch on the iPhone. test all of the functionality before closing the app.

, If your app crashed, you need to start figuring out what happened and why. This is a vast subject and there are countless reasons why your app may have crashed. Open the debug console and read the error messages. Most of the time they are rather cryptic. If you do not understand the error, try Googling the error message. Chances are, you will find a post on the Apple development forum where a friendly seasoned developer has answered their plea.


Debugging can be a very time consuming and tedious time for you. If you don't give up and persevere, in time you will get better at it. You will start to recognize the errors, track them down quickly, and even expect them on occasions. One common mistake is releasing an object from memory more than once. Another is forgetting to allocate memory and initialize an object before trying to add or assign to it. With each app your errors will become fewer and fewer.

, The iPhone has a very limited amount of memory. Each time you allocate an object some memory, you have to release it when you are done with it and give back the memory. Instruments is the iPhone SDK tool for viewing and analyzing your memory usage amongst other things.


With Device and Debug selected as before, choose Run → Run with Performance Tool → Leaks. This will launch Instruments and start the app on your device. Go ahead and use the app as normal. It will seem to freeze periodically as Instruments records and analyzes your memory usage. Any leaks will result in a red spike in the Leaks timeline. The source of the leaks will be displayed in the lower half of the screen.
Double clicking on the leaked objects will attempt to take you to the responsible code or clicking on the little arrow in the address column will show you the leak history. Sometimes where the leak is detected is not necessarily where it originated from.
If you get really stumped, try by process of elimination. Comment out and/or carefully bypass areas of your code and run it. Sometimes you can narrow down the general area and then eventually home in on the responsible line. When you know where it is, you can fix or rewrite it. Remember, using Google can often provide you with the quickest direct links to internal Apple forums or documentation that deal with your issue.

, While testing your app in a simulated setting is a good way to ensure that your app works and that the interface looks good, nothing beats testing from users other than yourself. Just make sure you've ironed out the most egregious bugs before sending it out for external testing. In order to distribute your app to your testers, you will need to create an Ad-Hoc certificate on the iOS Dev Center site.


External testers can provide a lot of feedback that you wouldn't expect. This can be especially useful if you have a complex app.
In order to authorize tester's devices, you will need each device's UDID number.
Choose Device from the drop down list and press the ""Build"" icon. In the Finder, navigate to your project's folder and look for the ""Ad-Hoc-iphoneos"" folder. Inside there will be an app. Copy your ""AdHoc.mobileprovision"" certificate you got from the iOS Dev Center into the same folder. Select the app and the certificate and zip them up. This archive can be given to your external tester. You will need to create a separate archive for each Ad-Hoc certificate., Select Device and Release from the drop-down menu. Press the ""Build"" icon. In the Finder, navigate to your project's build folder and look for the ""Release-iphoneos"" folder. Inside there will be an app. Zip it up into an archive.


In order for new apps to pass Apple certification, they will need to be optimized for iOS 8 and the Retina display.

, You can access this from the iOS Dev Center. If you have any unfinished steps to complete for setup, they will be listed at the top of the page. Make sure that all of your banking and tax information has been entered correctly.

, Click ""Manage Your Applications"" and then select ""Add new Application"". Fill out the App name, SKU number and select the bundle ID. Select your app bundle from the drop down menu.


Fill out the forms providing your app description, keywords, support site, category, contact email, copyright etc.
Fill out the Rights and Pricing forms.
Have your iTunes artwork ready. You will need a large 512x512 vector icon, as well as some screenshots of your app. Screenshots can be grabbed from the iPhone simulator using Command + Shift + 4 and dragging the cross-hair over the area. Make sure they are 320x480 for iPhone. Screenshots are a very important part of marketing your app, so make sure that they show the most important parts.

, Click ""Ready to Upload Binary"" and you will be taken to a screen that directs you to download the Application Uploader tool. Download it and press Done.


Install the Application Uploader tool and launch it. The first time you run the program, it will ask for your iTunes login information.
The Application Uploader tool will check your iTunes Connect account and find any apps you are ready to upload binaries for. They will be displayed in the drop-down menu. Select the one you want, choose the Distribution zip you created earlier and upload it. The uploader will check some internal stuff within the bundle and will return an error if it finds anything incorrect, such as an incorrect version number, missing icon etc. If everything is fine, it will upload the zip and finish.

, There is nothing to do now except wait for the review process. Apple will notify you in a few days or weeks via email if your application state changes to ""In review"". When it goes into review, the process is very quick. If it fails the initial barrage of tests, you will get a rejection email telling you why, and Apple will offer suggestions for fixing it. If your app passes inspection, Apple will send you an email informing you that your app is ready for sale. Your app will now appear on the iTunes app store

, Now that your brand-new app is available for purchase, it's time to start spreading the word. Utilize social media, send out press releases to App-focused sites, make some YouTube videos, and do everything you can to get people talking about your app.


You can send free copies to reviewers, who will then write about your app on their website or review it on their YouTube channel. If you are able to get it in the hands of popular reviewers, this can lead to a lot of sales.

, Download the free iTunes Connect Mobile app for your iPhone. Login each day and check your sales, markets, and countries of sale. This is the fun part! Apple will periodically send you emails with links to your latest sales data. You can download them for your records. Good luck!

, Choose the level of difficulty or if you wish to play a single-player game.

, You will have several seconds to click Solve as the letters are filled in on the board. If another player solves before you, they are rewarded the $1,000, or vice versa.

, Either you or the player who solved the previous Toss-Up will get to spin first.



On your turn, spin the wheel by dragging your finger across the on-screen arrow. After a few seconds, the wheel will stop on a monetary wedge, and you will be able to select a letter. If it stops on Bankrupt or Lose A Turn, you will not be able to call a letter. If the wheel stops on Free Spin, Wild Card or the Million Dollar Wedge, you will be able to ""pick up"" those wedges and use them for later in the game. Free Spin allows you to keep if your turn if you lose it, and the Wild Card allows you to call another consonant for the value you landed on after calling a correct consonant.







Call a consonant by selecting from the on-screen alphabet. Letters that have already been called will appear faded in the box. If you call a letter that the puzzle contains, you will receive the monetary value for it and it will appear on the board. If not, you will lose a turn. After calling a correct consonant, you can call a vowel if you have at least $250.

, There are several more rounds, including a Jackpot and Mystery Round.


In the Jackpot Round, there will be a Jackpot that starts at $5,000 and increases by the value of each spin. If you land on the Jackpot wedge and call a correct letter, you'll get the opportunity to solve the puzzle for the value of the Jackpot. Correctly solving the puzzle earns you the value of the Jackpot along with the amount you accumulated during the round.
In the Mystery Round, there will be two Mystery wedges on the wheel. If you land on one of them and call a correct letter, you'll have the choice of taking $1,000 per appearance of the letter you chose, or risking your current winnings to see what's behind the wedge you landed on. If you choose to flip the wedge, you'll either get a Bankrupt or a prize. If it's the prize, you'll claim it if you win the round with it in your possession.

, This is the last part of the gameplay, and you can win up to a million dollars (if you have the Million Dollar wedge) by correctly solving the final puzzle.

, As in the TV version, you will be able to select three consonants (four with the Wild Card) and one vowel.

, You will have approximately two minutes to do so, and as many guesses as you like. Good luck!

, If time runs out and you didn't solve, you won't receive the additional earnings, but will ""take home"" the amount you won in the previous rounds.

, As mentioned earlier, it will display your winnings, trophies, cash rewards, etc.

, You will be brought to the MY PEBBLE screen in the Pebble app by default. Swipe in from the left edge to see the left panel. Tap the GET APPS option in bottom of the panel to enter the Pebble Store. Tap the search icon in the upper right corner of the screen to bring up the search bar at the top of the screen. Tap the search bar, and type “Phone and Pebble Finder,” and results will come up., Phone and Pebble Finder should appear in the results. Tap the ADD button opposite the app name to add it into your MY PEBBLE screen. Despite the app’s name in the store being “Phone and Pebble Finder,” the name that will appear in the MY PEBBLE screen will be “Phone Finder.”

The Pebble watch can hold up to 8 apps in its internal memory. If you have more than 8 apps, including watch faces, the Phone and Pebble Finder will be added to the Locker. This is where you can swap between Pebble apps without having to enter the Pebble Store over and over.

, After you tap the ADD button, a pop-up should appear telling you that you require the companion app to get things working. So tap the “Go get it” button at the lower right corner of the pop-up, and you will be taken directly to the app’s description page in Google Play., In the app description page, the green INSTALL button should be visible opposite the app’s icon at the top portion of the page.

The up button will turn on the vibration motor on your phone and will not stop until you press the middle button or if you press the STOP button on the phone’s screen; this is ideal if you are in a quiet room and wish to find the phone without disturbing others. The down button will cause the phone to use its call ringtone at the highest volume setting.

A bluetooth connection between two devices usually has a 50-meter range and will be reduced if there are obstacles between device. As long as you keep both devices within range of each other (like in a room, for instance), the watch app will be able to ring the phone.

, Now that the alert is either blaring across the apartment or vibrating somewhere, you can begin hunting for the phone. Using the ringing alert makes sure you can easily find the phone because it rings at the highest volume. Simply look for the phone in the direction at which you can hear the alert coming. The vibrating alert is noticeable in quiet conditions and can be felt when it is directly under you. Listen for rapid rumbling; you might have left your phone on a table or on the floor.

If you cannot hear the phone vibrate, switch to using the ringing alert.
The phone may be out of range, so if you do not hear the phone ring, try moving around the area while pressing the alert button of your choosing.

, When using any of the two alert modes, the red STOP button should appear on the phone screen. As long as the phone and the pebble have not lost their Bluetooth connection, the app will keep ringing the phone. Once you have located the device, tap the STOP button to cease the alert."

Limit your browsing to areas with Wi-Fi.,

Use offline features in apps.",How to Reduce Data Usage on Your Android Smartphones1," Whenever wireless Internet is available as an option, you should prioritize it over using data--even if your phone's data is faster than the Wi-Fi.

Many public locations, such as coffee shops, have ""free"" Wi-Fi insofar as you must make a purchase in order to obtain the password.;
, Using data-rich sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram while on data will quickly add up, especially since most of these services will load videos as you scroll through your feed., If you must browse while using data, avoid using sites' apps (e.g., YouTube or Facebook), and instead use the mobile site. You can typically access the mobile version of a site by typing ""www.m..com"" into your Android's browser.

For example, you would access the mobile version of Facebook by typing ""www.m.facebook.com"" into your Android's browser.

, Storing media such as music, photos, and videos locally rather than streaming them will save you hundreds of megabytes' (if not several gigabytes') worth of data., While texting over data generally constitutes a negligible amount of data use, sending large photos or videos will make a dent in your monthly data limit.

The same goes for uploading photos or videos to Facebook, Instagram, and other social media.

, In Google Maps, for example, you can download a map of an area while connected to Wi-Fi and then use the offline map to navigate without using data.

Offline use also applies to some cloud storage apps (e.g., OneDrive), YouTube Red subscribers, and Spotify Premium users.

Communicate internally in the office.,
Use WhatsApp for talking to customers.,
Provide customer support with WhatsApp.,
Let customers provide feedback with WhatsApp.",How to Use WhatsApp for Work1," If you need to communicate within your office, WhatsApp can be used for this. WhatsApp can be a quick way to send messages throughout the day that are easy to read from multiple platforms, such as phones, computers, and tablets. Simply have your employees download WhatsApp and make a habit of using it for quick communication.One of the main advantages of WhatsApp is that it requires very little training. Once downloaded, most users find the app largely self-explanatory.;
, Customers actually respond quicker to messages on WhatsApp than they do to standard forms of communication such as phone calls. Instead of reaching out to customers via e-mails and phone calls, see if they are on WhatsApp and message them through the app.One of the big advantages of using WhatsApp to talk to customers is that it allows for informality. If you're trying to make a sale, customers may feel pressured by formal e-mails and phone calls. An informal message may put customers at ease, increasing their likelihood of responding.

, Customers often get frustrated when calling a help line due to long waiting times and automated systems. Let customers know your company has a WhatsApp account and encourage them to message it instead. Have employees respond via WhatsApp whenever possible to cut down on waiting times.However, WhatsApp may not work well for larger businesses. If your company is getting hundreds of requests each day, it may be hard to respond to every one of them via WhatsApp. Stick to using WhatsApp for customer support if you have a smaller business.

, If you routinely ask customers to provide feedback, Whatsapp may lead to a greater response. Customers often hang up or screen calls asking for feedback. If you use WhatsApp instead, customers may be more likely to respond to things like surveys and questions. If you're struggling to get customers to respond to phone requests for feedback, switch over to WhatsApp."
"
Reach out to your target groups.,
Send messages to your customers using WhatsApp.,
Share codes and sales.,
Advertise giveaways.",How to Use WhatsApp for Work2," You can create groups in WhatsApp based around your company and encourage customers to join. These target groups can be used for marketing as you can post exciting content, like videos and ads displaying new products. If you provide videos and other support via WhatsApp, this may get shared by your group members with those outside the group. This can lead to you reaching a larger number of potential customers.For example, post a funny video of a customer using a new phone application your company created. If the video is amusing, people may share it with friends. This can lead to new downloads and then new customers.

, Make a habit of messaging customers directly via WhatsApp when you have news to share about your company. WhatsApp has less restrictions on things like delivery and format than e-mail. With e-mail, there is a chance of such messages being sent to customers' spam folders. You can use WhatsApp to send your customers photos, short videos, and audio files advertising new products.For example, send a group message to customers letting them know you're launching a new line of products in a few weeks.
It's a good idea to stick to texting loyal customers using WhatsApp. If you're spamming people who aren't familiar with your company, people may get annoyed. Most cell phone users are suspicious of messages from unknown numbers.

, WhatsApp can be a great way to directly reach out to users in the event of a sale or special event. As customers are more likely to open messages via WhatsApp, they're more likely to make purchases if they see a sale is happening.For example, say you're doing a promotion where customers who use the code ""1234"" get 20% off on online purchases. Let people know via WhatsApp.

, Monthly giveaways can really help boost traffic to your website. As messages are often easier to compose and deliver on WhatsApp, use WhatsApp to let customers when giveaways are occurring.For example, if you're giving out free samples of a new product with purchases over $20, alert customers using WhatsApp.

Review privacy policies carefully.,
Back up your data when using WhatsApp.,
Avoid WhatsApp for internal communications in larger companies.",How to Use WhatsApp for Work3," The one major downside of WhatsApp is privacy issues. Things like addresses of customers and employees and other data is not completely protected. Be careful what information you share via WhatsApp and avoid sharing any extremely sensitive information about your company or employees when using the app., WhatsApp does not provide any kind of iCloud service. Data stored in WhatsApp can therefore be easily lost. Any data you store in WhatsApp should be backed up elsewhere. In the event something goes wrong with the app, data may be completely lost., Group chat features in WhatsApp tend to work best for a small number of people. The groups are limited to only 100 people. Very large companies may not benefit from using WhatsApp for internal communication.However, you can still use WhatsApp for marketing and customer communication if you're a larger company.

Spots are color coded based on how “fresh” they are. Spots are marked for twenty minutes and after that time, they disappear off the map.;
,, Even if a spot is marked as “fresh” (within five minutes), that might not mean the spot is available. If there was a way for users to confirm that they have “taken” a spot in the system, the process might be better.

Open the app and press the record button.,
Point your phone's mic towards the sound.,
Beware of minor sound issues in your environment.,
Press the stop button when you're done recording.,
Save your recording.,
Use the app options to share and modify your files.",How to Use Your Phone As a Mic1," If you don't have an audio-recording app, click here to skip to our recommendations. Most modern smart phones, however, come with a basic audio-recording app. On the main app screen, there should be a fairly well-marked ""record"" button. This will often (but not always) look like a red circle.


In this section, we'll use the Smart Voice Recorder app running on Android for example purposes. Most mic apps should be quite similar.
On Smart Voice Recorder, the large red circle in the middle of the main app screen starts recording.;
, On most smartphones, the mic is at the bottom of the phone on the same side as the screen so it's near your mouth. For the best results, put the mic as near as you can to the source of the noise (up to an inch or two away). If you can't get very near to it, just point the microphone towards the noise.


If volume isn't an issue (like if you're in a silent room), you can usually place your phone face up on a table next to you.

, Try to avoid the following common recording mistakes as you use your mic app:


Don't record in a large, empty room full of hard surfaces. These can give your recording a distracting echo. Rugs, carpets, soft furniture, and blankets all work to dampen an echo.
Don't record with ambient noise in the background. Things like construction work, lawnmowers, and airplanes can be loud on the final recording.
Don't record outdoors. It may seem completely silent, but even minor breezes can sound like windstorms on the mic.

, Don't forget to end your recording. Often, the ""record"" button you pressed to start the recording turns into a stop button after you press it. If not, look for a red square, the word ""stop"", or something similar.


On Smart Voice Recorder, the red circle will pause, but not stop the recording. To stop, press ""Finish"" at the bottom of the screen.

, Usually, once you finish a recording, you'll be prompted to save the new audio file. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the process.


On Smart Voice Recorder, as soon as you hit ""Finish,"" you'll be asked to name your new file. Type in a name or use the default one and tap ""OK"" to save it. Pressing ""Cancel"" automatically uses the default file name — it doesn't delete the recording.

, Even basic mic apps usually have some options for using your recordings after you've made them. Often, you can browse your files, play them, and even send them to other people. The exact way to do this depends on the app, but it's usually straightforward.


On Smart Voice Recorder, when you finish a recording, you'll be brought to a screen where you can see it along with your past recordings. Tap the recording, then tap the arrow in the bottom right to see the additional options, which are:

Share...: Share and send the file via email, text messenger, cloud drive, and more. Tap the sharing option you wish and continue by following the on-screen prompts.

Set as...: Set the audio file as a ringtone, notification tone, or alarm tone.

Rename...: Change the name of your file.

Delete: Delete the recording.

Pick an app and install it. You may have to try a few different ones before you find the one that best suits you.
Please note that not all apps are universal apps. Some work only with specific brands. Make sure to read the description of the app before installing.

Ask your carrier to install the SIM card you purchased earlier.,
Enter the code your carrier gives to you when prompted.",How to Unlock a ZTE Phone1," Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile have different criteria--though in most cases, you must own the phone. Specific carrier criteria include the following:


Verizon doesn't place a lock on most of their devices. If for some reason there is a lock, you can usually request an unlock as early as six months into the contract.Sprint will unlock your device for you if it has both been on the Sprint network for at least 50 days and been purchased in full.AT&T requires you to submit your device's information for review. If your device is eligible for an unlock, AT&T will let you know within five business days.

T-Mobile will unlock your phone for you if you've paid the phone off and the phone has been on a T-Mobile network for at least 40 days.;
, Even if your contract looks like it specifies that they must unlock your phone, calling ahead will ensure that you don't waste a trip.

Your carrier has a legal obligation to unlock your phone for you if you have entirely paid off your phone.
Some carrier branches won't have the means to unlock your phone, in which case you'll have to visit a corporate branch.

, You can do so from online or from the network's carrier store. Having the SIM card on hand will allow you to install it directly after unlocking your phone.

Skip this step if you aren't planning on switching to a new network immediately after unlocking.
You'll need to make sure that your selected network is compatible with your phone's data network (CDMA, GSM, or LTE) before purchasing the SIM card. Your carrier can verify this information for you.

, In order to make your carrier's job easier, make sure that you know the following information before going into the store:


IMEI number - Your Android's ID number. You can find this by dialing *#06#.

Account holder information - This includes the account holder's first and last name and the last four digits of their social security number.

Device phone number - Your phone's official phone number and area code.

, While it's possible to perform the unlocking process over the phone, the process will be much less frustrating if performed in-person.

If you must call your carrier, make sure you write down any information with which they provide you.

, If they refuse or you don't want to install your SIM card right now, you can install it later by opening the SIM tray with a paperclip, removing the old SIM card (if there was one) and sliding the new one in.

If you're simply unlocking the phone for now, proceed to the next step.

, You'll do this after installing a different SIM card and rebooting your device. Your carrier may also just enter this for you if they've agreed to install the SIM.

Asking your carrier to install your SIM card and complete the unlock process for you may result in extra fees.
Until you replace the SIM card, you won't be able to enter the unlock code.

, Research the company as thoroughly as possible by looking for user reviews, forum posts, and any other indication that the company is reputable and not a scam

Never enter your phone or payment information on a website that doesn't start with ""HTTPS"", sites without the ""HTTPS"" prefix are not secure.

, Enter your phone's IMEI code into the ""IMEI"" field when prompted.

Some unlock services will require you to enter your phone's model (e.g., ""ZTE Axon"") as well.

, Enter your payment information when prompted. Using services like PayPal are a good idea when available because they provide a degree of separation between the IMEI unlocking service and your bank information., This must be a supported card; if needed, you can call your carrier to confirm that the selected card will work in your phone., You'll see the code field pop up when you reboot your phone after installing your SIM card. Doing so will unlock the SIM slot and allow you to use the SIM carrier's network."

Dig deeper in your research to help you with development.",How to Start Building an Android Application," JDK or the Java Development Kit is the first step to Android app development. The recent JRE ( or the Java Runtime Development ) must be downloaded as the older versions might cause serious technical issues with the latest JDK that the developer would want to use for his app. Install the JDK and keep in mind that “Development Tools”, “Source Code” and “Public JRE” occur in the custom install window. Click “Next”, read the licence agreement and there you go.;
, When using Windows system, navigate to System through Control Panel. Furthermore select the advanced settings and move on to “Environmental Variables”. Find out the variable known as “Path” and add the file path of the ‘bin’ directory of the newly installed Java. After doing this bit, carry out the commands “java -version” or “javac -version” to see successful execution of Java built.

, There are various IDE available that can be used but most frequently used is Eclipse. IDE aids the developer to debug, compile and add several functionalities to the code. The Eclipse usually comes bundled in a zip file which runs without getting installed. Some versions need to be installed, then default steps must be followed to proceed with the configuration of the setup. After getting Eclipse installed and configured, few basic tips to proceed working with the IDE must be known through the Help option and navigating onto the Workbench User Guide option.

, The Android Software Development Kit must be downloaded, installed and then all the packages that might be required must be installed.

, Google provides Android SDK plugin for Eclipse. Go to ‘Help’ and click on ‘Select New Software’. Click ‘Add’ button and then you will be directed to ‘Add Repository’ window that asks for the repository holding the ADT plugin. Fill in the name and the link to the repository. Click ‘OK’ and select the ‘Developer Tools’ option. Go ‘Next’ and install the plugin files. Move on to ‘Windows’ and ‘Preferences’ and select ‘Android’ section. The SDL location must be same as the SDK directory that was used before. Having successfully executed all the prerequisite steps, you are now the proud owner of Android Developer Tools plugin.

, No device is required to test your apps. Google offers an emulator for mobile OS along with ADT. Hence before developers start coding they must set up the “Android Virtual Device” for testing apps. Go on the ADT toolbar, select the phone icon and AVD manager window is opened. Select ‘New’, create a new virtual device and fill in required details.


Name : Put in a descriptive name if using for multiple device configurations.
Target : This is the Android version used by emulator.
SD Card : By default, there is 194 megabytes internal storage in the virtual device. But for additional storage, the space must be indicated here.
Skin : Use this option to control appearance and configuration of a specific device you want.
Hardware : Mention the specific virtual hardware you want for your app.
The virtual device is now ready. ‘Start’ it to commence booting.

, Having done all the setup and configurations, its time to begin with the project. Go to ‘File’, ‘New’, ‘Project’ and select ‘Android Application Project’. The most important options are the “Application Name” and “Minimum Required SDK”. Click ‘Next’ after having filled all options and mention a launcher that triggers the app. An ‘Activity’ will have to be created for the app in the next step. An activity is the view or action through which the user will interact with the logical divisions of the app functionality. Once the activities are decided, click “Finish”. Eclipse will further assemble all files and resources that the developer might need while developing the app.

, Many informative tutorials are available for helping the newbies learn about the programming part of Android App Development. The above mentioned steps are essential, rest depends on what the client requires from the app. Henceforth, with a certain mind map the development is carried out. Android development has increased by leaps and bounds over the years and with seamless integration of skills and expertise, the future holds too bright for Android Applications.

It details the instructions for saving your settings and tells you that every time you make a change in the configuration, you must tap the “Apply” button at the bottom of the particular settings tab you are configuring. Tap “OK” at the bottom right of the pop-up to continue.

, By default, you will be taken to the PIE tab in the app. Here you will be able to set the activation locations of the PIE control menu by tapping on the icons at the topmost of the screen.

, In the PIE tab, you will find the Options menu located below the activation location icons. Tap it to access the various options you can configure. The customization options are described in order from top to bottom.


By default, Pie Control will display a notification control icon in the notification panel. If you want to disable notifications, tap “Remove Notification” and hit “GO TO SET” on the lower right corner of the pop-up. This will take you to the App Info screen in Android settings for Pie Control. Uncheck the “Show Notifications” box below the “Force Stop” button to disable the notification.

Tap “GO TO SET” and you will be taken to the Accessibility menu of Android, where you can tap the checkbox for Pie and then tap the toggle button on the upper right corner of the screen to turn it on.

Toggle the animation by tapping the check box opposite the “Animation” option. This will turn the Pie opening animation on or off, depending on whether you checked the box or not.
Uncheck the “Show Longclick Icon” if you wish to disable icon changes in the buttons of the Pie when you drag your finger on the button for a long period.
Longclick delay will set the time at which the function will execute when you perform a long click (long tap) on the Pie. Tap “1,000” at the right of the option to change the delay in milliseconds.

, Tap the “Activation Area” section below the “Options” section to expand it. Here you will be able to change the width, height, and position of the activation area by dragging the sliders for the particular parameter you wish to change.

, The Pie Size section below “Activation area” gives you access to options for changing the dimensions of the Pie menu itself. Tap “Pie size” and it will give you configuration options, such as the Pie size, Icon size, and Long icon size. Drag the sliders for each parameter to change them.

, Tap the “Color” section to customize the color palette of your Pie. Normal is the base color of the Pie, while Focus is the color that the Pie sections will change to when you drag your finger over them. The Outline is the color of the lines that surround each of the Pie sections. Tap the color block under each of the three options to change them, then drag the dot on the color palette to select a shade. Drag the slider on the right to change the base color, and then tap an area in the Alpha slider at the bottom to change transparency. Tap the “OK” button to set the color.

, Tap the “Vibration” section to expand the menu. Drag the slider for “Select Vibrate” to set the vibration duration for when you release your finger to execute the function in Pie. “Focus Vibrate” is the vibration duration for when you drag your finger over a Pie section.

Drag the slider on the right to change the base color, and then tap an area in the Alpha slider at the bottom to change transparency. Tap the “OK” button to set the color.


The same goes for changing the battery bar color, which is right below the Text Color header.

, From the CLOCK tab, you can swipe from right to left to bring you to the LEVEL1 customization tab.

, Each button has a Shortclick that you can map a function to. You perform a Shortclick by simply dragging your finger over a button on the Pie and releasing it. Tap on the Shortclick function in Button1 to begin. A panel will slide out from the right, with three collapsed sections: Apps, Tools, and Settings. Selecting one of these sections will expand them and show you the complete list of functions you can map to the Shortclick on Button1.


The process is the same for Shortclick and Longclick mapping on each button in any level.
Tapping the X icon at the right of the Shortclick or Longclick mapping will disable the function, essentially removing the section from the whole Pie.

, Each button also has a Longclick mapping that appears when you hold the button with a finger, depending on the Longclick delay you have set in the “Options” menu, under the PIE tab. Tap the Longclick function in Button1 to begin, and a panel will slide out from the right, with three collapsed sections: Apps, Tools, and Settings. Selecting one of these sections will expand them and show you the complete list of functions you can map to the Longclick on Button1.

, Once you have finished your customization, tap the “Apply” button at the bottom of the screen. You can use the “Apply” button at any time, and is especially useful for when you want to test out changes and see if you like them."

Simply address the needs of your various contacts individually or send out a broadcast message to reach them all at once.Use the app’s file sharing features to send out promotional graphics, videos and other assorted media.
Start a mailing list that’s only available to a specific set of your WhatsApp contacts.;
, Rather than simply mentioning that you run a lawn care business or offer personal training, let your contacts see what you have to offer for themselves. Displaying a simple link can help you get the word out about your professional enterprises, helping you generate attention and interest.Create a custom signature for your messages that includes a link to your website or social media profiles.

, Express your ideas on a larger stage using WhatsApp's group video call feature. When users tune in, they’ll be able to see and hear you in real time. You can use PayPal to charge a small admission fee for viewing privileges, or only make the broadcast accessible to those who have paid dues to join a specific group.Ideally, you should be able to present some kind of specialized knowledge or information.Conducting seminars in multiple installments can increase the amount of profit you stand to make and give a wider audience a chance to join in.

, WhatsApp person-to-person format makes it well-suited for handling questions and concerns discreetly. Customers can text, send images of faulty products or even video chat with a live representative to come up with solutions.Respond to questions yourself or have a colleague or employee manage your business’s support correspondence duties.
Communication through WhatsApp is more fluid than programs like Facebook and Twitter, where comments might only be addressed a couple times a day.

, Some companies make it a policy to give out modest cash rewards to individuals who refer new customers. On the internet, this type of word-of-mouth marketing involves providing testimonials through direct messaging, getting users to click sponsored ads and sending links to special offers and events.You may be able to find opportunities to collaborate with prominent companies like restaurants, retail superstores and hotel chains by messaging them and offering to share sponsored promotional content in posts on WhatsApp.Try not to be pushy. Forceful advertising efforts won’t be met with appreciation, and may even get you reported.

, Though the app itself doesn’t allow ads, there’s nothing stopping you from sharing links via direct messaging. If your website or another that you’re in partnership with is supported by paid advertisements, drop a URL and encourage your contacts to check it out. Every time they someone opens the page, you’ll earn a small amount of money.Keep link-spamming to a minimum. If all you ever do is send out URLs with no description or introduction, there’s a chance you may be mistaken for a spambot.

, Pay attention to open calls from news networks and other publications for unique multimedia content to go on their WhatsApp feed. More often than not, these outlets will be willing to pay for high quality photos, sound bites and video footage of important breaking news stories. When you have something good, you can send it to the appropriate channels directly through the app.Be ready to capture exciting and unusual occurrences that you think might be newsworthy.Not all news outlets pay for outsider contributions. You may have to do a little research to learn which ones can net you a profit.

, A good place to start is by importing all the personal contacts from your phone. After that, you can start expanding your search to include business connections, friends of friends and casual acquaintances.In order to multiply your money-making opportunities, you’ll want to make sure that you’re able to hook as many eyes and ears as possible.
Encourage your close friends and associates to begin using the app so that you can expand your professional network.

, With your audience now in place, you can begin zeroing in on who has the most to gain from your services. Tailor the content of your story feed to captivate the attention of these people, or communicate with them personally to really wow them.Athletes, for example, will be more likely to want nutritional supplements, while new mothers may be interested in a seminar on how to manage time more effectively.Analyze prospective customers based on the activities and interests listed on their social media profiles.

, One of the most useful features of WhatsApp is the ability to create closed groups of users based on some common interest or classification. A well-structured group can serve as a pool of contacts who you can guarantee will be responsive to your branding and promotions.Your groups should have a definite purpose—for instance, they might give customers a place to offer suggestions about things they’d like to see in the future or provide feedback about a new product line.Become a part of as many different groups at one time as you want. This will give you the freedom to fine-tune your marketing strategies even further.

, WhatsApp still doesn’t have the visibility of apps like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Fortunately, clever users can work through these other programs to build a bigger following. Make regular posts to keep your contacts updated, then guide them toward your WhatsApp profile for more information.Let your friends on social media know about exclusive offers and other content that they’ll only be able to get by connecting with you on WhatsApp.
Use WhatsApp as an alternative to other person-to-person chat options like Facebook Messenger or Snapchat.

, StoryCorps recommends a few measures and precautions when it comes to where you record your interview. See below:Pick someplace quiet. The quieter, the better. Keep in mind that things like airplanes overhead and construction in the distance can be picked up quite easily. Basements can be good for avoiding these sorts of noises.
Pick someplace away from other people. This should be someplace indoors where you are unlikely to be disturbed for up to 45 minutes.
Pick someplace with no echo. Don't record in a large, open room with lots of hard surfaces. If you need to, you can add furniture, rugs, blankets and other ""soft"" objects to dampen an echo.
Silence your phone and remove any objects in the room that are creating noise (like ticking clocks).

As you start to record, you'll see cards with instructions at the top of the screen. The first will direct you to introduce yourself and get started. The rest of the cards will have the questions you chose earlier.

, Searching for the highlights in the middle of a 30 or 40 minute interview can be a slog. Luckily, the app lets you mark them while recording so that you can instantly find them later. See below:


The pushpin button marks the beginning of a question. Press it when you start asking your partner each new question. You should see a small dot appear over the progress bar at the bottom.
The star button marks especially good parts of the conversation. Press it whenever you hear something funny, poignant, revealing, interesting, etc.

For optimal performance, both devices should be within 30 feet (10 meters) of each other.;
, AirDrop allows for file transfers between iOS devices and OS X computers, but you'll need to meet some basic requirements in order to use it. AirDrop requires:iOS Devices - iPhone 5 or later, iPad mini, iPad 4th Generation or later, or iPod Touch 5th Generation or later. Must be running iOS 7 or later, iOS 8 if you intend to use AirDrop between your iPhone and Mac.
Mac Computers - OS X Yosemite (10.10) or later for transferring between iOS and OS X. MacBooks from mid-2012 or newer and iMacs from late 2012 should work., If your AirDrop visibility is turned off, other devices won't be able to find you.


iOS - Open the Control Center and tap the AirDrop button. Select ""Everyone"" for maximum compatibility. You'll still need to confirm transfers, so this isn't really a security issue.
OS X - Open a Finder window and select the AirDrop option in the left menu. Set ""Allow me to be discovered by"" to ""Everyone."" You'll have to manually confirm transfers, so this isn't a security risk. Leave the AirDrop window open while attempting to connect.

, A common fix for connection problems is toggling your device's Bluetooth adapter off and on again.


iOS - You can quickly do this by swiping up from the bottom of your screen to open the Control Center and then tapping the Bluetooth button.
OS X - Click the Bluetooth menu button and turn Bluetooth off and then back on.

, AirDrop uses a combination of these two connections to setup an AirDrop connection. Check the Control Center on your iOS device and the menu bar on your OS X computer to ensure that both of these services are turned on.

, AirDrop has always been a bit buggy, and sometimes software updates will fix the issue you're having. Updates for iOS and OS X are free, but they may take a little while to complete.


iOS - Open the Settings app and select ""General"". Tap ""Software Update"" and then follow the prompts to install any available updates. This will usually take about 30 minutes. See How to Upgrade iOS for detailed instructions.
OS X - Click the Apple menu and select ""App Store"". Find the latest OS X release, which is usually on the front page of the store. Download the update, which may be rather large, and then follow the prompts to install it. See How to Update to Mac OS X Mavericks for instructions on updating OS X.

, If you're having difficulties connecting to your Mac computer, try signing out of iCloud on the Mac and then signing back in.


Click the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences"". Select ""iCloud"" and then click ""Sign Out"". Sign back in with your Apple ID after the sign out process finishes.

, If you're running iOS 8.1, there's a potential bug with Apple IDs that can cause connection problems. Open the ""iCloud"" section of the Settings app. If there are any uppercase characters in your Apple ID, it may be causing the connection problem. Log out and then log back in with the same ID, using all lowercase characters in the email address. This bug was reportedly fixed in iOS 8.2.

, You will need both turned on in order to use AirDrop.


You can quickly access these options by swiping up from the bottom of the screen to open the Control Center. Tap the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth buttons to turn them on.
If you're transferring between an iOS device and a Mac, the Mac's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi must be enabled as well.

, This panel will allow you to turn AirDrop on.

, There are three settings for AirDrop when you tap the button:


Off - This turns AirDrop back off.
Contacts Only - Only people that you've added to your contacts can see your device for AirDrop. You will need an Apple ID account in order for this to work.
Everyone - Any nearby iOS device can find your device for AirDrop.

, If you're transferring a file to your Mac computer, open a Finder window and select the AirDrop option in the left menu. This will allow you to receive files on the Mac.

, Find the item that you want to share using its regular app. For example, to share a photo with AirDrop, open it in the Photos app first.

, This looks like a square with an arrow coming out the top.

, All nearby users who are using AirDrop will appear at the top of the Share panel. Tap a person's photo to send the file to them.

, The other person will need to accept the file before it download to their device."

Find Hipster Whale.,
Jump on him when you find him, then jump off him.

,
Hipster Whale should unlock when you die.

,
Find Gifty.,
Use Festive Chicken.,
If you have already unlocked the Festive chicken, go to the character select screen and play as the Festive Chicken.

,
Note that instead of grass, the ground will be white and covered in snow, like it is when you play the Penguin.,
Go up to the tree and jump on it, getting right next to it, there should be a lot of coins falling from the tree when you touch it (and while you are at it, collect all of the coins that pop up around it, too).

,
Unlock Gifty.,
Get Crab.,
Play as any one of the Australian characters and when you are standing on sand, scoot from side to side as fast as you can, like a crab.,
Note that this won’t always get you the crab, but you will get it eventually if you keep trying.,
Look for the drop bear.,
Jump toward the tree, and once you jump next to it, the Drop Bear will jump on you and kill you.

,
Afterwards, you will have unlocked the Drop Bear.

,
Find Ben Weatherall is one of the creators of Crossy Road.,
To unlock him, all that you have to do is to get a “great score” or beat your highscore with the Dark Lord.

,
Find Andy Sum.,
In order to unlock him, you have to get a Great Score or beat your highscore with the Mallard, which is his favorite character.,
Unlock Matt Hall.,
Like the other game developers, in order to unlock Matt Hall you need to beat your highscore or achieve a great score with his favourite character.",How to Unlock Secret Crossy Road Characters," He is hard to find but he will be in the river swimming like a log.;
,,, This is a present with feet who jumps when you tap it.

, This is free for the Christmas season and not available in the prize machine. So tough luck for those who have to wait until next Christmas!

,, Eventually you will come across a big, square clearing with a Christmas tree in the middle. You might not come across it at first, but keep trying. Most likely it will appear during the first 100 steps or so. It will look like a normal pine tree except a star coming off of it, and it flashes while playing music also.

,, When you die, just as with the Hipster Whale, you will end up unlocking Gifty. Just as with Hipster Whale, Gifty has no associated easter eggs.

, To get this crustacean character you need to have at least one of the new Australian animals. (You'll know you're using one when the ground is covered with sand rather than grass).

, Keep doing this every time you stand on sand, it is tricky at first but it will get easier.

,


If this method still doesn't unlock the crab, try to pass your high score while doing this, scoot side to side faster and more often, or pick a different Australian character.

, As with the crab, if you haven't unlocked any Australian characters, you will not be able to unlock this one. The Drop Bear is perched on top of a tree at a random point along the road so you'll just have to keep playing until you find him. You will eventually find him.

,,, His favourite character is the Dark Lord.

,, This is another Crossy Road developer.

, After that, you’ll unlock him and he will become one of your playable characters.

, He, just like Andy Sum and Ben Weatherall, is a developer of the game.

, In this case, his favorite character happens to be the Lucky Cat.

Choose a good display picture.,
Create an interesting status.,
Use text formatting in your profile and messages.",How to Impress a Girl on WhatsApp1," Choosing a great display picture (called DP in WhatsAPP slang) is the first step to impressing a girl on WhatsApp. Use your best selfie, such as a photo of yourself doing something exciting or one from an interesting place you visited.

For example, if you love to play the guitar, use a picture of yourself jamming for your DP. When in doubt, just show off your pearly whites and use a selfie head shot with your best smile.
If you don’t want to use a photo of yourself, you could set your DP to your favorite cartoon character, athlete, or a work of art.   ;
, WhatsApp offers a list of preset statuses, such as ""Battery about to die,"" but you should try to make your statuses unique. Take a minute to think about how you want to represent yourself with your status. It could be a favorite song lyric, movie, or television quote, or you could just make a quick observation about your day.

If you know you and a particular girl both love a song or movie, using a quote in your status could spur a conversation.

, A WhatsApp profile is pretty basic and, unlike Facebook's extensive options, only includes your DP, status, availability, and contact info. However, you can show off what a WhatsApp pro you are by using hacks, such as text formatting.

You can make text in your status or text messages bold, italic, or strikethrough by typing symbols around the word you want to modify. Type asterisks around words you want bold, like *this*. Use underscores around words you want to _italicize_, and tildes around words you want to ~strikethrough~.You can also go to privacy settings and hide your availability, but that might make it less likely that the girl you want to impress will contact you.

Check out her social media to learn about her interests.,
Try not to get stressed about messaging her.,
Start by asking her how she's doing.,
Make a comment about something you have in common.",How to Impress a Girl on WhatsApp2," Nowadays, part of getting to know someone often involves checking out their social media profiles. Browse the social media profiles of the girl you want to impress so you can learn a bit about her likes and dislikes. Getting to know her interests will help you start and maintain a conversation with her.For example, you could say, “I noticed you’re into origami - maybe you could teach me to fold a crane some time.”

, Breaking the ice can be stressful, but try to relax and don’t overthink it. The first time you message her, just say hello and ask a question to get things going.Remember that if she doesn't reply right away she might just be busy. Even if she doesn't respond at all, it's not the end of the world.

, The first time you message her, start by saying something like “Hey, how’s it going?” You could also ask what she’s up to or how her day has been.

Starting a conversation by asking her a question can make it more likely she'll say something in response.

, You could also start a conversation by saying something about your day. It's best if you make a comment about something she'll find relevant, like something you both experienced.

For example, if you go to school together, you could say something about class, like “I don’t know about you, but I thought that math class would never end!”

"
"
Try to be natural and confident.,
Compliment her.,
Ask her questions instead of talking about yourself.,
Bring the conversation to a deeper level.,
Don’t bombard her with tons of messages.",How to Impress a Girl on WhatsApp3," Usually, the best way to impress someone is by not trying too hard. Just be yourself - she’ll probably be able to tell if you’re trying to put on an act. While it’s normal to be nervous, just try to have fun when you talk to her., If you really want to impress her, give her a compliment that shows that you pay attention to her. Instead of dropping a stereotypical pick-up line, say something specific that shows you’ve noticed something unique about her.

For example, if you saw her earlier that day, you could say, “I really like how you wore your hair today,” or “You made such a great point in history class - you’re definitely one of the smartest people I know!”

, Who likes chatting with people who only talk about themselves? Impress her by showing that you’d like to get to know her better. It’s fine to tell her things about yourself, especially if they relate to something she’s told you, but just try not to dominate the conversation.You could ask about her hobbies, her favorite places to be, if she has siblings, or what songs and bands she couldn’t go without.
Try to respond to her answer instead of asking one question after another as if you were interrogating her. For instance, if she said she loves the beach, you could say, “Me too, but only the ocean. No lakes for me!”

, Starting a deeper conversation will show her that you really care about understanding who she is as a person. After some small talk, or after you’ve had a few superficial conversations, try to find a topic that’s close to her heart.You could ask questions about her goals, passions, and dreams, like “What are three things you want to accomplish in life?” Try asking about the qualities she looks for or admires in a person, about her favorite childhood memory, or what the most important thing in the world is to her.

, Have patience and give her time to respond before sending another message. In addition, most people prefer one longer message instead of a bunch of messages with just a couple words.Keep the memes to a minimum, too. It’s one thing to send a funny GIF that relates to your conversation, but don’t spam her with tons of random stuff."
"
Ask if it’s a good time to chat when you message her.,
Show genuine interest in getting to know her.,
Let her vent if she’s had a rough day.,
Avoid sending or asking for dirty photos or to video chat.",How to Impress a Girl on WhatsApp4," Show her that you care about her time and that, while you want to talk to her, you don’t want to bother her. Make sure that she’s not getting work done, hanging out with friends, or otherwise occupied.Before you message her, check her status to make sure it doesn’t say that she’s busy.

, If you really like her and want to impress her, you shouldn’t have to pretend to enjoy talking to her. Sincerity goes a long way, and you’ll have a much easier time maintaining a good conversation if you actually want to get to know her.Thoughtful questions, relevant responses to her answers, and specific compliments will help let her know you’re sincere.
For example, if she tells you that she's stressed about having a ton of studying to do, don't change the subject or talk about how much you have on your plate. Instead, say something like, ""Well that's no good! Should I let you get to work? Or maybe I could help you study?""

, If you ask her how she’s doing and she says “Not great,” ask her why. Tell her you’d be happy to chat about anything that’s bothering her.She’ll appreciate the fact that you’re willing to let her vent, and you might even be able to impress her by giving her great advice about her problem.

, Even if you think you’re paying her a compliment, you’ll just make her feel disrespected, and there’s nothing more unimpressive than that. Being courteous, polite, and genuine will help you stand out better than anything else.

If the two of you know each other outside of social media or are comfortable enough, you could ask her if she wants to video chat. Just keep it clean, and have a nice, face-to-face conversation.

Be careful with gems.,
Always try to ""max out"" your town hall before upgrading it.,
Rebuild your clan castle as soon as possible.,
Join a good clan.,
Balance upgrading offense and defense.,
Setup a good base design.,
Have fun!",How to Succeed in Clash of Clans," This is the most important and rare resource, so use them wisely. Use your gems to speed up barracks production, or use them on collectors. But be careful when deciding to use them, and make sure it'll be worth it. Don't spend them on hurrying troops' training unless it's absolutely necessary. Save up your gems, and avoid spending them all at once.


Try not to buy gems. Clash of Clans is hard to be good at without buying gems a few times, but try your best to limit purchases.
When cleaning up your village of trees, bushes, etc, clear them all at once, not broken up. This way you won't spend 5-6 gems on something like troop training, rather than 20-30 gems on boosting a few collectors.;
, Make sure most important upgrades (barracks, clan castle, army camps, air defense, mortars, and troop upgrades) are finished before you upgrade the town hall.

, This doesn't mean you upgrade gold storages as fast as possible, but put it as one of your top priorities.

, Look at the clan description before you join to figure out its key principles and rules, and evaluate a clan before you decide to join it. Good clans should have won many wars. This means they are active, and you will be able to contribute when you are at a high enough level. Good clans should also have people with lots of donations. The more donations, the more active and friendly the clan is.

, Do not upgrade all your offense first, as this will leave you with a dangerously weak defense. Balance it out and take it slowly if needed.

, This is important, whether you're farming or trophy-hunting. To create a good design, keep your clan castle, storages, mortars, and air defense in the center of the base as much as possible, as these are your most essential buildings. If you're not farming, keep your town hall in the center where it will be protected; if you are farming, put the town hall off in one corner and keep everything else in the center.


Do not put all buildings listed above in one wall square. Separate buildings with walls and traps.
Keep all cannons and archer towers inside walls. Collectors, army camps, barracks, builder huts, and spell factory do not need to be inside walls. You can put them outside as a distraction for troops.

, You may get frustrated at times with the game, but play on and you will succeed.

Set your phone to automatically turn off overnight (or your sleeping period) when you need it least.",How to Save Battery Power on a Blackberry," You'll not only save battery life doing this, but you'll save plan minutes, too.;
, Using the phone this way reduces the burden of powering the phone by the internal battery alone. Most phones require a minimum amount of battery power to work this way though - so if the battery is drained completely, it may not work.

, Locate the options or settings page to adjust the length of back lighting time, and/or reduce its brightness to a usable but low level.

, Locate the options or settings page to disable the Bluetooth radio if you do not use these devices (BT headset, external GPS, etc.) with the phone.

, When in a particular country, set the cell mode to only the local frequency bands. For example, many people in the United States can save power by switching to 1XEV mode.

, The GPS makes use of an additional dedicated radio and processor to calculate your location. These specialized hardware components consume additional power that is in excess of the cell phone's power requirements.

, Like the GPS function, the WiFi capability also relies on an additional dedicated radio and other hardware that must be powered when ""on"". If not actively browsing the Internet or updating your software, disable Wi-Fi mode.

, Using the phone for games, listening to audio, watching video, etc. consumes more battery power than if the phone were simply powered up in standby (waiting for a call).

, This includes web browsing, email and streaming of any audio or video content.

, The longer the phone is in an active state, the more quickly the battery will be depleted.

, Cell phones adjust output power up and down as needed to maintain contact with cell towers, even in standby. The greater the distance between the tower and the phone; the more power used by the cell phone to maintain contact. This translates to rapid battery discharge when in deep fringe areas.

, As stated above, the phone still uses power, even in standby. The standby state is one that allows the phone to be quickly located on the network when called. Shutting the phone off completely will stop draining battery power.

, This is very simple and will give you at least an additional eight hours of battery life, and is particularly important if unable to recharge overnight. To do this go to ""options,"" then ""auto on/off"" and choose the time when you know you will probably be in bed by. The other thing left to do is set the ""on"" time (when you usually wake up by.)

, If you want to see what the browser would look like on your screen, scroll up from the comments to just below the “Read More” button. You will be able to swipe to the right on the images below the button, which are screenshots of the browser app.

, If you want to see a complete list of the browser's features, you can tap the Read More button to expand the description. Read through it, and see if the browser has the features you want.

, If you like what you see, go ahead and tap the “Install” button right under the application name.


The permissions window will then pop up. Read its contents, and press the “Accept” button on the lower right corner of the window if you grant the app permissions. It will begin to download and install right after. Once it’s done, tap the “Open” button where the Install button used to be.

, Once you open the browser, it should show you a splash screen with the browser name on it and some introductory pages. Swipe through them, and take them all in. Then, tap the address bar at the top of the browser screen.

, Take note of the loading speed, smoothness and responsiveness of the browser. Also, see if the style and design of the app works for you. Some browsers are simple yet intuitive, while others are more feature-packed yet flamboyant.

, Tools, meaning bookmarking, sharing, saving, and the like. Check how the browser lets you switch between tabs, as well as the tab creation feature.


If you like what the browser has, go ahead and use it for a couple of days. If it holds up and impresses you, then you have pretty much found your new browser.

If you have a Google Voice number, you can use Hangouts to receive calls for free as well. You will need both Hangouts and the Hangouts Dialer app in order to make calls for free. You can download both apps for free from the Google Play Store.These apps will use the same Google account you already have associated with your Android device.
If you're using an iPhone, you'll need to log in with a free Google account. There is no Hangouts Dialer app on the iPhone. All calls are made through the Hangouts app.;
, A Google Voice number will allow you to display the number as your outbound caller ID. This isn't required, and ""Unknown"" will be displayed as your caller ID if you don't sign up for one. You can create a free Google Voice number at google.com/voice. It will automatically be associated with your Google account.You can also use your SIM card number as your caller ID if you don't have a Google Voice number. This number is verified by your installed SIM card.

, You can use the Hangouts Dialer app to make calls as long as you have a data connection. This can be Wi-Fi or it can be your cellular data connection. In order to ensure that the call is truly free, connect to a wireless network so that you aren't using your mobile data plan.

, The app will open a dialer very similar to your regular phone app. You can't start a Hangouts call from your contacts list; you'll need to start it in the Hangouts Dialer app.


If you're using an iPhone, tap the Phone tab at the bottom of the Hangouts app to place a call.

, The Hangouts Dialer will allow you to reach most numbers in US and Canada for free, as long as you are in a country that supports Hangouts calling.


If you are calling internationally, even if dialing a local number while visiting that location, you may need to add a ""+"" plus the country code of the number you are trying to reach.
If the call costs money, the rates will be displayed your Google Voice account will be charged if you accept. You can add money to your Google Voice account at google.com/voice#billing. You can use the same page to check rates for calling various countries.

, If you have a Google Voice number associated with your account as well as the Hangouts Dialer, you can receive calls at your Google Voice number. If you're on Wi-Fi most of the time, you can use this to make most or all of your calls for free without eating into your minutes.

, There are a variety of free messaging programs that can replace SMS and provide free texts between you and friends. The best way to take advantage of these apps is to have all of your friends on the same service. You'll then be able to easily send messages over Wi-Fi or mobile data without eating up your SMS allowance. Popular free messaging services include:Facebook Messenger
WhatsApp
Kik
Skype
Hangouts
Viber

, As long as you are connected to a Wi-Fi network, all of your messages will be sent and received for free. If you aren't connected to Wi-Fi, the messaging apps will use your mobile data plan to send and receive messages. Free messaging apps never count against your SMS allowance.

, You can use a free Google Voice number and the Google Voice app to send free SMS messages to any mobile device. Responses will be sent to your phone and to your email. You can sign up for Google Voice and get a free number at google.com/voice.


Sending and receiving SMS messages through Google Voice will use your mobile data connection if you aren't on a wireless network.
If you have Hangouts installed, you can use it to send and receive Google Voice text messages instead of the Google Voice app.

, If you just need to fire off a quick text message or two, you can visit a text messaging site like textem.net or txt2day.com. These sites allow you to send messages for free to any number. You can't use these services to receive messages, but they can be useful in a pinch.

, Streaming music takes a lot of data, and you may quickly find yourself exceeding your monthly limit if you're always streaming on the go. Try to limit listening to music to when you're connected to a wireless network to avoid going over your data limit.

, There are several apps that will allow you to listen to streaming music without paying. You may have to listen to commercials every few songs unless you pay for a monthly subscription. Streaming apps that support free accounts include:Spotify
Pandora
Google Play Music
TuneIn
Last.fm
NextRadio (Select carriers)

, YouTube has a massive music library, and you can usually find a video or stream of any music you're looking for. Many users have created playlists that you can listen to that feature a variety of artists. You can also create your own playlists to listen to whenever you'd like.

, If you have a lot of music on your computer, transferring your favorite songs to your phone will allow you to listen to them any time without using any mobile data. Most modern smartphones have at least a few GB of space that you can use for music files.


Android: Connect your phone to your computer. Your Android will appear as a removable drive. Copy your music files to the Music directory on the phone. See How to Add Music to Your Android Device for more information.
iPhone: Connect your iPhone to your computer and open iTunes. Select your iPhone and then open the Music tab. Select the iTunes music that you want to sync to your iPhone. See How to Put Music and Videos on Your iPhone for more information.

, Chances are you don't use as much mobile data as you think, especially if you connect to Wi-Fi on a regular basis. You may be able to save a significant amount of money if you switch to a limited data plan that still covers your average use.


You can monitor your data usage for a month to see what your average looks like. On Android, you can do this from the ""Data usage"" section of the Settings app. On iOS, you can find your cellular data use in the ""Cellular"" section of the Settings app.

, There are several websites that will gather all available cell phone plans and allow you to compare them. These can be very useful for determining which plan is best for you. Popular websites that compare plans include:


whistleout.com
wirefly.com
Consumer Reports

, Unlimited data often comes with caveats. The most common of these is limited speed. Some unlimited plans will always run slower than per GB plans, while others will throttle your speed once you use a certain amount of data. Unlimited data will quickly become worthless if it takes a minute to open any web page. Check the details of your ""Unlimited"" plan to see if you have anything to worry about.

, Make sure that the carrier you choose provides decent coverage in your area. An Unlimited plan won't be very useful if you can't get a signal while you're out an about.

Gain more followers!,
A good way to get more followers is to follow accounts with the same interests.",How to Start a Drawing Account on Instagram," All you need is an easy to remember username, password, and email. You can use your facebook to register if you'd like. You can also upload your profile picture if you'd like but you can do that later on.;
, Once you're registered, you can start uploading your drawings.

, I cannot stress this enough. It is vital that you add a watermark to each of your drawings so that no one can take it and claim it as theirs. You may use a font app like ""Phonto"" or you may hand-write it on your artwork. Make sure your instagram username is big enough that it can be easily read and so that it cannot be cropped off of the drawing.

, How can you spread your talent if you don't have any followers to see your posts?

, Remember, Instagram and most social media is about creating a community with people whom you share like interests. Don't be one of the people who spams, instead leave honest comments like 'great job!' and many people will check out your account without the spammy message of ""I'm a new account, please check out my drawings of (things that you drew)"" . You can even ask big accounts if they're willing to give you a shoutout if you make them a fansign: a drawing of their username in a creative way. You can also direct message them with a piece of your artwork and ask if they could debut it to a larger audience. Remember, even if you're turned down, keep trying!

Once you’ve got the app pulled up and you’ve logged into your account, you can make whatever changes you want all from one convenient hub.

It’s also possible to edit your account on a desktop computer by accessing the Instagram website.;
, This icon appears as a small silhouette. You’ll be able to find it in the lower righthand corner of the screen. Pressing the icon will take you to a user view of your profile.You can also access the profile editor by going through the “Settings” screen.
On your profile screen, you’ll be able to see how your bio appears to everyone else.

, Beside your profile picture (just under your follower stats) you should see the taskbar that allows you to make modify the details that are displayed publicly on your account. Tap the button, then look for the small “i” icon about halfway down the page at the bottom of the public information section. This is where you’ll input your actual bio.While you’re there, you can go ahead and make any other changes you want to your name, username, website link, email and phone number.

, Your bio can be up to 150 characters long, including letters, numbers, text symbols and alternate keyboard graphics like emojis. Write something interesting and engaging that you think will draw in visitors and make them want to follow you! When you’re finished, just tap the “Done” button in the upper righthand corner of the screen to return to your profile.Though hashtags aren’t clickable in Instagram bios, it can still be a good idea to include unique tags that are associated with you, your brand or your organization.Make sure you have your bio looking the way you want it to before saving it.

, Start with the basic details that define you. You can include things like your job title, interests, activities, field of study or personal passions. This will give the people viewing your page a quick snapshot that will tell them what they need to know. If you like to take pictures of nature, for example, you might write something like “I’m a 23 year old aspiring photographer who loves family, dogs and spontaneous camping trips. It’s my mission to seek out the beauty in the everyday.”If you’re running an Instagram account for a private business, don’t forget to include your name so that other users will know who to get in touch with if they have questions or requests.
Consider adding other details like your location to connect with more people around you., You might not feel the need to provide details on a personal profile. In these instances, you can use someone else’s words to fill in the blank. Choose a quote that resonates with you or represents your way of viewing the world. The right turn of phrase can make a bold statement about your values and personality.Find something original rather than going straight for cliché, overused quotes.
Draw inspiration from song lyrics, poems or bits of wisdom from influential figures.
A carefully selected quote can also be a good touch on a business profile, as long as it relates directly to the product or service you’re offering.

, End your bio by directing visitors to another page they can go to check out what you’re all about. For businesses, this might be a link to a webstore or special promotion. If you’re a blogger, you can make it more convenient for your followers to read your latest article. Linking to other websites can help you connect with people in a more comprehensive way.If you don’t have any other specialized content to show off, you can always stick in a link to your Facebook, Twitter or Snapchat.
Your bio is the only place on Instagram where URL links are populated, which means they won’t be clickable in your normal posts.

, Don’t be afraid to have a little fun with the format or wording of your bio. Your bio shouldn't be like anyone else's—the whole point is to produce something interesting and memorable that will attract people to your posts. Be your wacky, thoughtful, fascinating self.To space out the lines in your bio, simply hit “return” if you’re an Android user or copy and paste the text from a separate app if you’re using an iPhone.There are no rules for how to write an Instagram bio. Take your time and create something unique.

, Pick a good, clear picture to serve as a visual introduction to your profile. Headshots are good choice, especially if you’re a public figure or want to be more immediately recognizable. Like your bio, your profile picture should represent you and clue your followers in to type of content you tend to post.Displaying a photo lets other users know that there’s an actual person on the other end of the account.
Well-known companies can use a logo as their profile picture.

, This will be the first thing people will see when they open your profile. Go with the name you most often respond to, and use your first and last. You can also tack on any other defining titles or nicknames that you think will help other users have an easier time finding you.Many Instagram users make the mistake of using a name other than their real one, or omitting a name altogether. This can make it harder for other users to search for you, and may even make your account look less legitimate.
A title or nickname can help distinguish you from other users with the same name. For example, “Maria Roberts *Leadership Consultant*” or “Alex ‘Hambone’ DuPont” leaves no doubt as to which one you are.

, Instagram only gives you 150 characters to get your point across. Whatever you think up should therefore be short and sweet. Make room for important descriptive details, contact info and related links. Otherwise, let your profile speak for itself.Save longer rants and descriptions for the captions on your individual posts.
Long, rambling bios and captions tend to get passed over more often than short, punchy ones., Whether words are not your strong suit or you just want to keep things a little more playful, emojis can lend a little flair to an otherwise plain bio. Adding a simple smiley face or other symbol can break up the monotony of plain text with some much-needed color and character. It will also draw more eyes to your page, making your other content more likely to be seen.As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. A single symbol can tell users what they need to know about your interests and pursuits, freeing that space up for other purposes.Emojis are best used sparingly to highlight certain ideas. Too many of them can quickly become distracting.

Create an appealing profile.,

Ensure sufficient post appeal.,

Engage with other users.,
Reward your followers.,
Monitor posts.,
Use video.",How to Use Instagram to Boost Your Business," Instagram has allowed users to edit the display picture, account name, account description and the posted pictures. This is why it makes a great marketing tool to play with.


Picking the correct and most suitable pictures and words all play a crucial role since the first impression that users have when coming across any profile page is what makes them want to engage with the account or simply ignore it. (Steeves, n.d);
, This includes such platforms as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. This will allow your Instagram account to use the existing audience from other platforms to gain more followers. All platforms in some way enable a way in which they can link to Instagram accounts, whether it is by sharing the same image that is posted on Instagram into both Twitter and Facebook or by an icon in your YouTube profile page (Steeves, n.d) Linking and organizing contents across different platforms and optimizing them for searches can lead to high rankings in search engine optimization, which is what your company undoubtedly wants. (Frasco 2013)

, Since Instagram is all about visuals, here a few tips that will help your posts get more interaction than other posts:


Be unique and different rather then posting and doing the same as other companies. It is always interesting to be unique, different and to stand out from others. To present products or ideas in a different way and perspective definitely leaves an impact. (Huffposts, 2014)
Ensure high quality. People want to see good posts. One easy way to provide that is to post the pictures in high quality. This will not only make the account look professional and attractive, but it will also increase credibility. (Huffposts, 2014)  
Prefer pictures of people. These are more popular in Instagram. According to a study undertaken by the Georgia Institute of Technology and Yahoo labs, posts that have faces get 38% more likes than those that do not. (Kazi, n.d)
Use bright colors. Based on a study done by the University of Wisconsin and Olapic, bright colors increase sales and get more engagement. (Kazi, n.d)
Having longer captions is best since they give the reader more information about the photo. Posts with longer captions are more likely to garner greater engagement and increase sales. (Kazi, n.d)

, Hashtags are a great way to be found. If used correctly, they can be of a great impact to increasing followers. (Instagram, 2014) Instagram’s own blog has mentioned that it is best to be specific, so if there is a picture of an iPhone, it is better to use #iPhone6 rather than #Apple. It is also important to use relevant hashtags. For example, if it is a post of some college friends, it is better to use #BPstudents rather than #photos.

, Like any other social media network, Instagram is made to connect people. The only way to connect is by engaging with them. Like other people's photos and comment on them. When users see that the company is active and there is a human behind the account, they will certainly engage back, which is what the account needs; people to engage with it. (Hemley, 2013)

, One good way to keep followers loving your brand is to reward them. Some examples of rewards include offering giveaways, special discounts, promo codes or even showing your followers “behind the scenes” of the company. (Hemley, 2013) This will excite your followers and lets them engage more with the account and the brand.

, A lot of apps are designed to go along with Instagram. They are designed to analyze how the account is going to give feedback and detailed insights that will help improve the account. The apps can tell you what is the most liked picture in the account, the most used hashtag, the growth rate of followers, and more. (Lepore, 2014)

, Videos are a big hit for marketing. Sales and statistics show that 100 million users watch online videos daily. Eighty percent of Internet users remember video ads that they have seen in the past month. Moreover, 90 percent of online shoppers find videos useful when deciding to buy a product. Fifteen second videos are up to 37 percent more shared than other time-frames, which is what makes Instagram videos a great hit. (Video Brewery, n.d)

Choose backgrounds carefully.",How to Take Tumblr Inspired Photos," One important part of Tumblr photos is the quality of the image. Different camera phones and cameras have their own capabilities. You can use a search engine to find out the quality of camera you have. If you have a DSLR camera, great going! If not? Don't worry! These days even phones are breaking the next level of photography. If you're planning to buy a new phone, you can check out these phones for best cameras as follows:


iPhone
Moto e 3rd generation
Micromax Yureka

, If you want your photos to have that ""Flattering material"" in it, you can use VSCO Cam. Or if you have some different apps in your mind, you can try them out, too! Be sure to research whether or not the app you're using lowers the quality of the image. Some apps lower the image quality through all the effects they offer. If you're interested in effects that 'liquify' your photo, the best way to do this is to upload it onto the computer, as apps do not have the capability to do this without significantly lowering quality.

, See, if this means you've got to go & click pictures of anything in this world, I'm not instructing you to go click a picture of your dustbin. It should be something which can put on impact on people who view them. For example, you can click pictures of your boots you wore last night, or your favourite book, or your art piece. If you're not so artsy, You can click pictures of your hobby-related things, too.

, For example, it's autumn & you click a picture of a red-autumn leaf, Give it a filter that really makes someone think, ""Ooh, I think I gotta put on my jacket."" Don't give it a filter or that contrast that gives it too much amount of brightness or it would ruin the effect. Often times auto-level filters increase the brightness more than you need.

, The big problem with Instagram is that it does not let you upload full sized photos. So, use apps which prevent cropping of the photos. If you want some more artsy effect, you can make the photo go a little bit small- more like 'Limited-sized photo'. For example, you could use this:

, You should use some appropriate backgrounds for clicking photos. For example, if you're clicking a photo of your favorite Calvin Harris Album, you can click it being kept on a plain white bed sheet, Or if you want yourself being clicked with your favorite back pack, click it in a light coloured background, which has nothing else but you with your bag.


If needed, you can always go to your park or under a tree. But always remember one thing, if you're clicking something which is meant to be indoors, you should always prefer light, or mostly really white backgrounds.

For example, if you type #puppy in the caption of a photo, someone searching Instagram for ""puppy"" will find it, along with other pictures that use the same hashtag.
Username tags (e.g. “@username”) identify a person or company that appears in the photo. They are different from hashtags.

, It’s the app on your home screen or apps list with a multicolored camera icon.

, You can add hashtags to any of your new or existing Instagram posts by typing them into the caption field. Here’s how to get there:


If you’ve already posted the photo or video: Go to post and tap the ⋯ (iPhone) or ⁝ (Android) at its top right corner, then select Edit.
When posting a new photo or video: Tap + at the bottom center area of screen, then select a photo or video to upload. Add effects, if desired, then tap Next at the top right corner of the screen.

, Simply type the hash symbol (#) before any keyword relevant to your photo. Your hashtags can appear as a list beneath your photo, or you can blend them in to sentences. Here are some ideas for incorporating hashtags into your caption:Subject of the photo: You could caption a picture of your kitten lying in the garden with “#Drake the #kitten sunbathing in the #garden.""

Location: Some of the most popular Instagram searches involve specific places. Try something, e.g. “#mybed,” “Pic of my #holidays in #Phuket #Thailand #Asia” or “Nothing beats my favorite latte from #Stumptown #PDX""

Photo techniques: Hashtags for apps, filters, or styles used to create the photo, e.g. #iPhone7, #hipstamatic, #blackandwhite, #nofilter, will appeal to photographers.

Events: If you and your friends want to share photos from the same event, create a hashtag to use on all of your photos. For example, if everyone going to a party tags their photos with #sarah30thbirthday, it will be easy to find the images.
Identity: Make yourself easy to find by people with whom you share common traits, e.g. #redheads, #latinas, #lgbt, #borninthe80s, #teambeyonce.
Find out what’s trending: Do an online search for “most popular Instagram hashtags” or try a site like http://www.tagblender.com to view popular hashtags.

Look for moments worth photographing.",How to Take Better Instagram Photos," Instead of taking photos through Instagram itself, pull up your device’s dedicated photo app. Your internal camera doesn’t have the same size constraints, so you’ll be able to take large, high-quality photos and edit them to suit your exact specifications later on. This will enable you to shoot more fluidly on the go without stopping to open another app.Photos will look better if they’re shot uncompressed and then loaded through the Instagram app.Shooting with your internal camera will also ensure that you’ll be able to save and store photos, even if you decide not to post them right away.;
, An otherwise extraordinary picture can be ruined if it’s out of focus. Keep a steady hand just before you hit the shutter to prevent annoying motion blur and last second automatic adjustments. Use both hands to take the shot, or put yourself in a better position to stabilize if you’re shooting one-handed. Tapping the screen will allow you to customize the exact focal point of the shot., It’s not enough to simply point and shoot if you really want to create something remarkable. Not only do you need an eye-catching subject, you also need to be able to frame it in a way that maximizes its allure. Rather than photographing an object or scene head on, confine it to one edge of the frame to establish a sense of continuity with your background.Follow the “rule of thirds.” In the language of photography, this refers to compositional guidelines of dividing the image into three distinct sections to highlight your subject while also drawing attention to the other elements in the scene.Select Instagram’s new portrait mode to fit more of a vertical photo into the post., If you’re positioned too far away, your viewpoint will seem remote and disconnected. Closeups are more engaging because they suggest a greater intimacy between you and your subject. They’ll also emphasize the rich detail of your photos, making them feel more real.The human eye is drawn to complex textures, which will make people more likely to take notice of your photos.Closeups cut down on the amount of uninteresting dead space around the edges of the frame., When searching for the perfect light source, head outside. Even the most sophisticated lenses can’t replicate the subtle diffusion that’s ever-present in world around us. Natural lighting will help you avoid harsh contrasts and grainy, underexposed blunders.Stay away from the camera’s flash as much as possible. Too much sudden light can cause a picture to come out looking overexposed. If you need a little extra illumination for night shoots, use another external source, like a floodlight or reflector.Natural lighting makes colors come across more faithfully, preventing the need for extensive touchups in editing.

, One of the benefits of using Instagram is that it allows you to fine-tune the look of your pictures, meaning they don’t have to be perfect the moment you take them. Slide your photos around in the edit window until you find the perfect way to frame them.Pinching and spreading the image with your fingertips will enlarge it so that you can take advantage of the space you have and pull your focal point closer to the viewer.Be sure to edit out goofs and imperfections, like a stray piece of litter in the bottom of the frame or the edge of your thumb overlapping the lens.

, As much as possible, let your images speak for themselves. There may be times when a subtle overlay can serve to balance the colors and contrast of a particular shot, but piling on too many effects will just end up looking tacky. If you need to make adjustments, do it individually using the separate options in the toolbar.It’s a good idea to limit the bulk of your adjustments to the three most basic editing tools: brightness, contrast and color saturation.You can change the intensity of a given filter by double-tapping the filter’s name and adjusting it achieve just the right amount of flair., You may find yourself feeling limited with Instagram’s selection of editing options. In these situations, it can help to have another app like VSCO or Diptic on standby. These programs offer more specialized features, like more sophisticated light-manipulation techniques or the ability to piece together dazzling collages.Download companion apps separately and do your editing in them before importing the image to Instagram.

, Your latest Instagram masterpiece isn’t ready to post until it’s accompanied by a short description of the experience. A solid caption will your viewer’s attention and say something about the image that places it in a broader context. Your captions will have the best effect when they’re concise, humorous or make people think.Draw inspiration from compelling quotes, song lyrics or snippets of literature.
Keep your captions short and sweet. Some people may be off put by the idea of reading through a lengthy blurb., The camera technology on smartphones is better than it’s ever been, but it still can’t match the optical power of a quality standalone camera. Use one of these to take the picture, then open it via Instagram to add the finishing touches.Companies like Nikon, Canon and Leica manufacture affordable professional-grade cameras that can allow any aspiring photographer to realize their artistic visions.You may need to limit the file size of the pictures in your camera before you export them to make sure they show up crisp and clear on Instagram., Tailor your Instagram portfolio to express a certain theme, like fine cuisine or the great outdoors, or show off your creative sensibilities by honing a unique style that’s evident in all of your posts. Don’t just analyze each picture on its own but as a part of a larger collection that says something about you as a photographer.Avoid snapping the same types of photos over and over again, as this can become repetitive over time.

, Get out there and experiment with bold and daring setups. Shoot photos from a variety of different angles and incorporate natural shapes and patterns from the surrounding environment. Recognizing that there are aesthetic opportunities everywhere can elevate your photography to a higher level.Use clean lines, like the corners of buildings or a gridwork of windows, to bring your subject into sharp relief.
Don’t be afraid to break the rules from time to time. Just because something didn’t quite work for one photo doesn’t mean it won’t work for another., Keep an eye out for exciting, strange or heartfelt things going on around you and be ready to capture them. These events can offer a glimpse into a scene that may never happen again. Some of the most emotionally resonant photos are simply the result of being in the right place at the right time. Be careful about invading other’s privacy or personal space in your quest for the perfect picture.
Anyone can take a selfie or post a pic of what they’re eating. It takes a well-trained eye to seek out special occurrences.

Well documented sites for Instagram backup include Instaport and FrostBox.While some of the language or features may change, the following general instructions will work for any backup website.

Decide on a character.,
Create a character.,
Get the wardrobe for this character.,
Consider your goals.,
Create a persona for your character.",How to Roleplay on Instagram1," Find the character you want to roleplay as, whether it be from a video game, a comic book, or a movie or show. If you're going to be using a ready made character, do a lot of research before you begin.


The character does not need to be human. The beauty of roleplaying is that you can choose anything you want. It is all about releasing a yearning inside yourself.
If you want to roleplay as the dog from Air Bud, go ahead!;
, Many people use a character they’ve been trying out for years. For example, if you like to imagine a knight named Sebastian, use this as your character. Consider your character’s background. What do you want them to be like? What will their name be?


Use a pen and paper to write out specific details about your character. Include everything you can think of, even if you choose not to divulge this information to the public.
You have a lot of chances to be creative. Don't be afraid to let your imagination run wild!

, Some people choose not to dress up as the character they are roleplaying. Others enjoy the process and feeling of dressing up. While you’re in the planning stage, think about possible outfits you could wear for this character.


Once you have an idea of the clothes your character will wear, go out to find them. Thrift stores and second hand clothing stores have a variety of clothes that might fit your needs.
Instead of dressing up as a dragon, for example, you could use a series of illustrations you’ve made of the dragon.

, Be realistic with what you wish to accomplish in the planning stage. Many people don’t have an agenda while roleplaying, but instead do it for the fun of it. Some people have goals for roleplaying, for example, you could make a phony politician account and campaign for stricter gun control.


Here is a small list of potential goals you could have for yourself: calling attention to a social or political cause, amassing followers, promoting or reviewing products, or earning an income.You will approach roleplaying differently based on what your goals are.

, If you are choosing a pre-made character, you should just commit time researching everything you can about them. This way you can easily embody this character. If you are creating a character from scratch, practice being this character before going online.You can benefit from dressing up in your room to practice being this character. It might feel silly, but you might learn something by actually trying to live in your character’s persona.

Download the app onto your phone.,
Sign up for a new account.,
Think of a clever username.,
Upload a photo of your character.",How to Roleplay on Instagram2," It will be easiest for you to roleplay if you have a smartphone. This way you can create posts any time from any location. Go to your phone’s app store or play store, and search for Instagram. Connect your phone to WiFi to download the app quickly.


If you haven’t updated your phone’s operating system in a while, you might need to update your device before downloading Instagram., You can either sign up for Instagram using an email account or by using your Facebook account. If you are already registered with your Facebook or email, you won’t be able to create a new account. If you want to keep your roleplaying account secret, do not register using your personal Facebook account.


Register with a new email address for the most privacy. Create a simple email using Gmail or Yahoo with a name that’s representative of your character.

, Your username should signify the name of your character. Due to the popularity of Instagram, it may be difficult to choose the exact name of your character. It’s important to attempt to create a catchy name that represents your character.


For example, say you want to be the dog from Air Bud, but “Buddy” or “Buddythedog” is taken. Instead you could try, “Air_Buddy,” “AirDog97,” “BuddyPlaysBasketball.”You can always change your name after setting up your account.

, Your profile picture should be a clear picture of your character. The profile picture in Instagram is a small icon that can be small and unclear to some followers. Keep this in mind and attempt to use a close up photo of your character.


You can use a picture of yourself dressed up as the character, a ready made picture of the character, or an illustration you made of the character.

"

Follow other people who roleplay.,
Post photos.,
Create memes with your account.,
Add interesting content.,
Regram related content.",How to Roleplay on Instagram3," The best way of getting yourself out there is by following other people who roleplay. There is a large community of people who roleplay on Instagram. You might even be able to get some popularity by following other users who roleplay as the same character as you.


Use the search function and enter variations of your character's name.
If you have friends in the real world who are involved with Instagram roleplaying, follow them., The best way to build a network of followers is to post pictures. Instagram is mainly focused on pictures. Use photos of your character in the form that you are comfortable with. Post photos regularly to get the most out of your profile. The more pictures you have, the more likely you are to get noticed.


Some people feel comfortable dressing up as the character. Others may feel more comfortable editing photos of their character in the form of a meme.

, Memes are photos or posts that are centered around a photo and relatable text. They are typically used for comedic purposes and are currently a trending fad on the internet. You can create a meme by editing a photo to include white text. Use a simple photo editing software to add the text to an image.


A popular start to a meme is ""When ...."" For example, ""When your dog is living better than you"" or ""When you see a comma in your bank account.""
Decide if memes are a good fit for your Instagram account. Check out similar Instagram users to see if other roleplaying accounts utilize memes.

, Another way to gain followers is by using hashtags. Hashtags, or the pound sign, are used to reach a larger network of internet users. The hashtag gets stored with all relatable content that also uses this hashtag. You could also include a description that gives your followers more information.

, Follow other users who have a similar roleplaying account. Once you see a post that you like, you can upload the same post onto your own account. Add your own description and then credit the user who originally posted the image.


You can credit other users by adding the at symbol (@) before their username."

You can also log into Instagram on a computer.
Instagram only deactivates your account for a week if you choose to temporarily disable it.;
, If these credentials successfully reinstate your disabled account, you're all set! Unfortunately, you may need to reset your password if this login fails.

, If you're currently experiencing trouble whilst trying to log in on a computer, switch to your phone (or vice versa).


If your phone's Instagram app isn't up to date, it may cause you to experience technical problems (e.g., not being able to log into your Instagram account).

, If Instagram won't log you in, tapping this option will begin the password reset process, which--if your account was disabled voluntarily--will likely fix your problem.


On a computer, this option is entitled ""Forgot?""

, You can choose ""Username"", which will send an email with your password reset link to your Instagram's default email, or you can choose ""Phone"" to receive a text.


For desktop users, enter your email or username, fill out the captcha code, and then click ""Reset Password"" at the bottom of the screen.

, Depending on which service you selected, you'll need to follow one of these processes:


For email - Tap the ""Reset Password"" link in the email Instagram sent you. In the subsequent screen, enter your new password twice and tap ""Reset Password"". You'll need to log in again from here.
For message - Tap the Instagram link in your message, then tap ""Open in app"" at the bottom of the subsequent screen. This will take you to your Instagram page!
If you use email, be sure to check your email's spam folder for Instagram's message. You may also need to redo the reset process if you don't receive an email within a few minutes.

, If you used the message reset, you should be all set; however, if you reset your password or you're using a computer, you'll need to log in again.

, As long as your account hasn't been purposefully banned by Instagram, you should now be logged in!

, If you've tried resetting your password and you still can't access your Instagram account, Instagram probably suspended your account due to a terms of service infraction; depending on the severity of your infraction, you may not be able to get your account back.


If you believe your account has been wrongly suspended, you can contact Instagram to try to appeal the process.

, You can avoid Instagram deactivation if you do not post material that offends or violates the website's Community Guidelines. The guidelines include the following:Post photos and videos you own. If the content is something you captured and can claim copyright ownership on, you can post it to Instagram. If the photo or video belongs to someone else, though, you should not post it.

Keep your clothes on. Any photo or video you post should be safe for all ages. Do not post nudity, sexual content, violent content, or otherwise mature content. Additionally, you should avoid content that promotes self-harm, including eating disorders, cutting, and suicidal tendencies.

Be respectful. If you disagree with another user, be polite about it. If your differences cannot be resolved, you might also consider blocking that user to prevent problems from stirring in the future.

Do not spam others. Commercial solicitation and self-promotion is strongly discouraged. Possible violations include repetitive comments, service manipulation for commercial purposes, discount codes, and website URLs.

, If you do violate these rules, your Instagram account can be deactivated without any warning. The terms include the following criteria:You must be 13 years of age or older.
You must not post violent, nude, partially nude, discriminatory, unlawful, infringing, hateful, pornographic, or sexually suggestive content.
You must not sell, transfer, license, or assign your account or account rights to another person.
You must not solicit, collect, or use login information for other Instagram accounts.
You must accept all responsibility for keeping your account secure.
You must not defame, stalk, bully, abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate, or intimidate others.
You must not use Instagram for illegal or unauthorized purposes.
You must take all responsibility for your own conduct.
You must not access Instagram's private API.
You must not submit unwanted email, comments, or likes that qualify as spam.
You must not use domain names or URLs in your username.
You must not transmit any worms, viruses, spyware, malware, or other disruptive code.
You must not create bot accounts or other unauthorized accounts.
You must not attempt to limit the usage or enjoyment of another user.

, If you worry about accidental deletion or deactivation, you should consider backing up your photos to your computer so that you do not lose any of them.


The easiest way to back up your content is by ensuring that your photos' duplicate files and original images stay on your mobile device after your post them. If your device is running out of memory, upload the duplicates/originals to a cloud service, such as Google Drive or iCloud.

Instead of just liking posts, make it a point to leave a meaningful comment. This will encourage other users to comment on your content and could entice people to visit you. Following people will also result in other people following you back, so make sure to follow profiles you think are interesting., Tell your friends that you have an Instagram account and tell them to follow you.

The more that people can recognize your handle and see that you have an account, the more likely they are to visit it., Make sure to include your Instagram handle on different social media accounts like Twitter, Facebook, or even dating apps like Tinder. This will get your Instagram account instant exposure. Those that aren't currently following you have a greater chance of finding your Instagram., One good way to engage users is to hold a photo contest. Think of photos that relate to your profile, then encourage contestants to put a specific hashtag on the post.

This will get your followers more invested in your content and will get more people to interact and view your profile.Good prizes for the contest include recognition, free merchandise, or tickets to a show.

Bright images get 24% more likes than dark pictures, on average.

, Posts that include at least one hashtag will typically gain 12.6% more engagement. Try to understand your audience and write down hashtags that are included in the most popular posts that you see. You'll want to add more targeted hashtags, so that people looking for something specific can find your content. You'll also want to post more general hashtags to increase the number of likes and exposure you get.Popular hashtags include #fashiongoals, #instafashion, #instagood, #photooftheday, as well as more general hashtags like #love, #happy, and #dog.

, Geotagging is a cool feature that Instagram has that can help you promote a specific location or event. When you upload a photograph, make sure that the slider to ""Add to Photo Map"" is turned on. This will show your followers that you were actually there, and could help promote a restaurant or business location.If you don't want people to know where you live, make sure that you turn geotagging off when you are taking photos at your house.

Upload something funny.,
Join a group of iFunny fans.,
“Glitch” your way to the top.",How to Get Featured on iFunny," This is what the iFunny people recommend on their FAQ page as how to get your image on the Featured section.Of course, to do this, you first need to access the website or install the app on your mobile device and create a profile so that everyone else knows who the funny person who posted that image on the Featured page is. There’s no universally accepted standard of what is funny, but here are some guidelines to consider:


The target of your humor should be someone or something your audience considers worth making fun of. The foibles of politicians or celebrities are often considered suitable targets, while ethnic groups are not, at least from outside that group.
The best jokes have a truth that underlies them, while often exaggerating certain points to the level of absurdity. For example, coyotes are predators and scavengers, but only Wile E. Coyote goes to the length of ordering expensive, defective gear from Acme to catch the Road Runner.
Many of the best jokes build up an expected response, then go in a different direction. For example, a picture of a high-definition television with the caption at the top saying, “I bought this TV on Black Friday to see the big game,” but at the bottom, “I tell you, ‘’Jeopardy!’’ has never looked better.”These guidelines may prove important, as users can vote your images as “funny” or “unfunny.” The total of your “funny” votes minus the total of your “unfunny” votes is the overall score your image receives. The higher your score, the more likely your image is to earn Popular or Featured status.;
, If you can’t beat ‘em by yourself, join a group of other people who want to see ‘’their’’ images make the Featured section, too. Apps such as Palringooffer mobile users the chance to join up with groups such as the I Funny Feature Squad, who agree to share, comment, and like one another’s images in the hope that one or more of their submissions will get featured., If actually being funny or trying to get others to believe you’re funny doesn’t appeal to you, you can always try transferring the like count from an uploaded image of yours with a lot of likes to one with only a few likes.


Select one of your images with a high like count.
Tap the image count to refresh it.
While the image count is refreshing, switch the display to an image you know has a lower count. When the refresh is complete, the higher number count will display for both the first and the second image. You may have to repeat the refresh trick several times, however.Be aware that at some point, iFunny will fix this glitch, if it hasn’t already been fixed by the time you read this. At that point, you’ll be stuck with getting other people to think you’re funny.

Filter by price.,
Filter by type, then price.,
Browse blindly.,
Download your app.",How to Get Free Apps1," Before you get any free apps, it is essential that you have iTunes on your computer, or the App Store app on your phone. iTunes can be downloaded for free at http://www.apple.com/itunes.


Be sure to get the correct version of iTunes for your operating system.
Once you've downloaded iTunes, find the download and double click on it to open and run the installation program.
The App Store app should come preloaded on your device. Tap to open it.;
, Open iTunes and look at the sidebar on the left to find the “iTunes Store” link. Click the link to load the store inside iTunes.


Once the store is loaded, look at the dark bar along the top of the window and click the “App Store” button.
You don't need to do this if you're browsing from the App Store app on your device.

, The most basic method is to filter all apps by price. Click or touch the search bar and type “free” into it. Hit enter and wait for the screen to load.


You will see two groupings: one for iPhone apps, and one for iPad apps. Next to each group header there's a link that reads “see all.” Click it to display every free app for the device of your choice.
This method displays huge pages of free apps, but there's no way to search within those results except by manually browsing. There's no way to organize or reorder the apps, either.

, You can choose to filter to a certain app category before looking at free apps in that category, but only the most popular free apps can be easily found using this method.


From the App Store page, click the drop-down menu at the upper right and select a category. Alternatively, you can click the triangle next to the App Store button on the black bar at the top of the screen.
Scroll partway down the splash screen that appears. You will see a sidebar on the right labeled “Top free apps.” Click the link next to the header that says “see all.”
Browse the most popular free apps on the next page. You can organize your results by name, popularity, or age. Only the top 200 most popular apps in each category are displayed. On the plus side, it's likely that these apps are all well-designed, reliable, and useful.

, This method allows you to find any app you want, but there's no way to filter free apps from paid apps.


Choose a category or start from the main page. Click any featured category to browse it. Click on any app to check its price (the price will appear on a gray button to the left of the screen that loads next).
If you haven't found what you want yet, type the category name into the search bar and hit enter. This will yield a mix of apps that contain the search term, including apps from other categories that have the search term in their names. However, the results will skew towards the appropriate category.

If you want to find a specific app, type its name into the search bar from the App Store and hit enter. If the app is available, it will appear in the search results.



, Once you've found a free app you want, be sure your device is linked to your computer and click the gray button on the description page to download the app. Sync your device to complete the process.


If you're browsing from your device, simply tap the gray button to download it directly.
You can check the apps you've downloaded by clicking the Apps category in the left sidebar of iTunes, below the Music category.
If syncing doesn't seem to work, try dragging icons from the Apps category directly onto the name of your device, displayed in the left sidebar.

Launch Cydia once the jailbreak is complete.,
Enable ""Find My iPhone"" and turn on your passcode.",How to Get Cydia Without Jailbreaking," Cydia is a package manager for jailbroken iPhones. It relies on access granted to your iPhone's system by the jailbreak process. Without a jailbreak, Cydia is completely useless. There is no way to actually install Cydia on your iPhone without jailbreaking. Any site or guide that claims to allows Cydia to be installed is a scam or will result in a fake Cydia icon. This guide will walk you through the basic jailbreaking process for iOS 8 and 9 if you absolutely need Cydia., Jailbreaking is usually only recommended for advanced users. It allows you to install apps and tweaks that aren't available from the App Store. Jailbreak apps and tweaks don't go through Apple's review process, and can cause your iPhone to stop functioning. A jailbroken iPhone is also more susceptible to malware, but your risk of infection has a lot to do with your personal internet browsing habits. The jailbreak process may render your phone inoperable if you don't follow the instructions exactly. Jailbreaking will void your warranty, but you can easily remove the jailbreak before sending it in for warranty service.

, The jailbreaking tool you'll need will depend on what version of iOS you have. You can find your version by opening the Settings app and tapping ""General"". Tap ""About"" and then find the ""Version"" entry.

, Different iOS versions require different utilities to jailbreak. These utilities will work on both Windows and Mac. You'll also need iTunes installed.


iOS 8.0 - 8.1: Pangu 8 (en.8.pangu.io/)
iOS 8.1.3 - 8.4: TaiG (taig.com/en/)
iOS 8.4.1: There is currently no jailbreak available for this version.
iOS 9 - 9.1: Pangu 9 (en.pangu.io/)
iOS 9.1.1: There is currently no jailbreak available for this version.

, Connect your iPhone to your computer via USB to jailbreak it.

, This backup will allow you to restore your iPhone to its current state in case something goes wrong.


Open iTunes and select your iPhone from the row of buttons along the top.
Click the ""Back Up Now"" button and wait for your backup to be created.

, These two features will need to be disabled before you begin the jailbreak.


Open the Settings app, select ""iCloud,"" and then toggle ""Find My iPhone"" off.
You can disable your passcode in the ""Passcode"" section of the Settings app.

, This is an essential step before you start jailbreaking. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen and tap the Airplane Mode icon. You can also turn it on from your Settings app.

, The jailbreak utility should display your device in the main window. Click the ""Jailbreak"" button to begin jailbreaking.


If you're using TaiG, uncheck ""3K Assistant"". Make sure that you keep ""Cydia"" checked.
If the jailbreak utility is not recognizing your device, you may have to downgrade your version of iTunes. Uninstall the version that you currently have, then download the version that works here. See How to Uninstall a Program for a guide on uninstalling a program like iTunes.

, This can take 20-30 minutes. Your iPhone will reboot several times during the process. The jailbreak utility window will display the progress. Don't worry if it hangs on a percentage for a while. Do not disconnect the iPhone during the jailbreak process, or it may become unbootable.

, After the jailbreak is finished, you'll need to launch Cydia to build the jailbreak file system. You'll find Cydia on one of your Home screens. Cydia will reboot your device after it finishes setting things up., You'll want to turn on Find My iPhone again in case you lose your iPhone. You'll also want to turn your passcode back on for security.

, The golden pineapple is secluded inside the big crate with a sticker on it, under the yellow bird.

, This one is a difficult one. The golden pineapple in 1-7 is inside the crate with the sticker on the very bottom right. Try to aim your bird so that it flies high, then drops down on the crates above it.

, Another tricky one, this one is in a small package on the top right of the level. Try to aim your blue bird at the stone blocks to the left of it, so they fall onto it. If that doesn't work, simply touch the screen so your blue bird turns into three, and shoot it high.

, This one is in plain sight. On the top right, there is a bunch of pineapples on a wooden plank. Amongst them is the golden pineapple.

, This one is in the stickered crate on the bottom right. Try to wipe out the birds in that area before trying to reach it.

, This one is fairly easy, yet requires some skill. This golden pineapple is hidden in a lamp in the top left, behind your bird. You must launch it backwards so it hits the lamp.

, This one is in the stickered crate on the bottom right, amongst the other dark crates. Use the first few birds to clear out blocks, then shoot the last bird at a high angle to get it from above.

, This one is in the stickered crate on the top of the second suspended bird area. You must slingshot the yellow bird high up, then speed it up once you get closer to it.

, This one is quite tricky. The golden pineapple is suspended in the top left. Since your bird can't reach it from shooting backwards, you have to slingshot your bird into the lamp, so it flies backwards into the pineapple. It takes some practice, but it is possible.

, This one is in the stickered crate on the bottom right. Try to clear out as much as you can with the first few birds, then use the last bird to hit the crate.

, This one is in the far right labeled crate. To retrieve this, you have to wipe out a majority of the birds and blocks so you can find a navigable path to get to this one.

, This pineapple is fairly easy. It's hanging on the ceiling, suspended by chains. Just launch a yellow bird very high, speed it up, and you should break the chain and retrieve it.

, This one is in plain sight at the far right. Try to hit one of the triangular blocks at the edge so it tumbles over and collides with it.

, This final golden pineapple is behind your birds, in a stickered crate. Try shooting a yellow bird backwards so it bounces off the birds. Then, time yourself so you speed him up; making an arc onto the crate.

, MSQRD effect options vary often. Search through available effects by swiping from left to right and select one with two people in the picture or two empty faces on your screen. The face swap is often near the end of the list., You'll see two head outlines when you select the face swap effect. Line up your face and someone else's face in the two outlines. You'll need to either be standing next to each other or be otherwise very close.


You can only swap faces with someone else in the same room; you can't load a picture from your device. Still, there are ways to swap faces with pictures and other things. See the next section for details.

, Once you have both faces lined up, MSQRD will swap your faces. This may take a moment on older devices. Make sure to keep both of your heads within the outlines on the screen.

, Continue tapping until the picture is as bright or as dark as you want it.

, Once your faces are swapped, you can tap the shutter button at the bottom to take a picture or begin recording a video, depending on which is selected. You can switch between pictures and videos by tapping the button next to the shutter button.


Keep both of your faces in the outlines the entire time you're recording to keep your faces swapped for the video.
Tap the shutter button a second time to stop recording.

, As soon as you take a picture or finish recording, the picture or video will be saved to your device's camera roll, allowing you to find it in your Photos or Gallery app. MSQRD will also provide several quick sharing options, including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. You'll be prompted to authorize access to these accounts if you select to share to one in MSQRD.You can tap the Share button to open your device's standard Sharing menu.
If you don't want to share your picture or video right away, you can find it anytime in your Photos or Gallery app on your device. You can then edit it or share it from there like any other picture or video.

, While you can't load images from your device to swap with, MSQRD will detect faces in images that you hold up to the camera. You can load an image on your computer screen or use a photo. Line the face up in one of the outlines to swap it with someone else.


For fun, put two pictures of two different people side-by-side on your computer monitor. Switch to the rear camera and line both up in the outlines. As long as the pictures are large enough, the faces should swap!

, MSQRD can detect faces that are close to real, so you can swap with a detailed statue. Your face will take on the statue's color and shape. This will only work if the statue is detailed enough to be detected by MSQRD as a face.

, Because you can switch to the forward facing camera, you can swap two people's faces without them realizing it. Have them stand next to each other for a picture, then use MSQRD to swap their faces.
