The SIM card must be activated by your iPhone's carrier. If you're attempting to use a SIM card from a carrier other than your own on a carrier-locked phone, you won't be able to activate your phone.

Look for the Camera Application on Your iPhone.,
Launch the camera application.,
Choose the photo option.,
Take aim at the subject of your shots.,
Take Burst Mode pictures using the shutter button.,
Take Burst Mode pictures using the volume button.,
Open the Photo application.,
Browse through the Burst Mode photos.,
Select photos to keep or discard.",How to Activate Burst Mode on an iPhone," The camera application icon shows a black picture of a camera on a gray background with the word “camera” underneath. There are two ways to find this icon:


One way is to look for it on your home screen by swiping left or right on the screen.
The second, and faster way, is to slide your finger from the bottom of the screen upwards. When a gray panel appears, you will find the camera icon on the bottom right part of the panel.;
, To launch the Camera application, just tap the camera icon once and the application will be opened.

, Before trying to take any picture, make sure that the camera mode is on “Photo,” otherwise, you might take a video shot instead.


To make sure that you are on the right mode, look for the shutter button on the bottom part of the screen. The shutter button is the big white circle on the middle part of the bottom of your iPhone screen.
Above that shutter button, you will find the words “Video,” “Photo,” “Square,” and “Pano.” These words are in white except for one, which will be in yellow. The highlighted yellow word is the camera mode that you are in. If the mode “Photo” is not in yellow, swipe your finger from side to side until you have highlighted the Photo mode.

, After selecting the Photo mode, you can now select the subject, or subjects, that you are going to take pictures of. With your iPhone, there are two ways to capture pictures: with the front camera and the back camera.


The back camera is the commonly preferred camera because it has a higher resolution (8 megapixels) than the front camera (VGA resolution). The back camera can be found in the upper left corner of the back of the iPhone. To take pictures, just point the back camera towards the direction of your subject until you see your subject in your iPhone camera screen.
The front camera, although lower in resolution, is still preferred when taking selfies, or shots with you as the subject, since you will see yourself in real-time before you take your pictures. The front camera is located in the upper part of the iPhone in the form of a small round camera lens. This is where you must direct your eyes, not on the screen, when you are taking your pictures so that your eyes and face will not be facing somewhere else in your shots.

, Now that you are ready to take Burst Mode photos, all you need to do is to press the shutter button. Pressing the shutter button once will take a single photo of your subject. Holding down the shutter button will make your iPhone take multiple pictures using the Burst Mode.


For older models of iPhones, such as the iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s, you can take 2–3 pictures per second only, but for newer models like the iPhone 5, you can take up to 10 shots per second.
If your iPhone audio setting is in General mode, you will actually hear the shutter sounds just like what you’ll hear from a DSLR camera.

, If you are finding it difficult, or frustrating, to take pictures using the shutter button on the iPhone screen, not a problem! Use the volume buttons instead.


The volume buttons are the two protruding buttons on the left side of your iPhone with the positive (+) and negative (-) signs.
To take your Burst Mode photos, just choose your subject and aim your camera lens towards it. Then press and hold either of the two volume buttons and the Burst Mode will be activated.
Again, if your audio setup is in General mode, you will still hear the rapid shooting sounds while taking your multiple pictures.

, If you are using the newer models of the iPhone, such as the iPhone 5, there is an easy way to manage pictures that you have taken using the Burst Mode. First, you will need to go to the Photo application so that you can choose and discard the pictures that you have taken.


If you’re still inside the Camera application, you will see a thumbnail of the last picture that you have taken on the lower left corner of the screen. Tap on that thumbnail once and you will be directed to the Photo application.
If you have already closed the Camera application, just look for the Photo application on your iPhone screen. The Photo application’s icon is a multi-colored flower and has the word “Photos” underneath it. Tap on the Photo icon and you will launch the application.

, Inside the Photo application, you will see that the photos you took using Burst Mode appear as stacks. Tap on the option “Select” at the bottom and you can now browse through the pictures.

, Tap the blue check marks on the photos you’d like to keep and tap on “Done” in the upper right hand corner of the screen when you’re finished. Those pictures with no check marks will be discarded after you tap on “Done.”


For older iPhone models, however, you will have to find the Photos application, launch it by tapping on it, and then manually select and delete the pictures that you’d like to discard.

Your phone must be running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich or higher to be able to use the app.The URL of the app in the Play Store is https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.vodafone.dreamlabapp.;
, Garvan is currently researching four projects; you can contribute to however many projects you want.


Breast cancer: Researching the mechanism behind chemotherapy-resistant tumours
Ovarian cancer: Searching for genetic mutations that causes ovarian cancer tumours to grow and become resistant to medications
Pancreatic cancer: Finding the right therapy that's suitable for an individual patient's cancer diagnosis and stage
Prostate cancer: Looking for an explanation as to why some patients respond well to medication and why some don't
After this screen, you'll be invited to join a mailing list for periodic updates on Garvan's research projects. This is optional and not required to use the app.

, In order to connect with Garvan, DreamLab must use either a Wi-Fi or mobile data connection. There are limits in place to prevent overage charges. At the initial first-time setup, you choose a data limit, but you can adjust this limit as well as configure Wi-Fi in the app's settings.


When using mobile data, you can choose to use up to 50 MB, 250 MB, or 500 MB per month. If you are a Vodafone Australia customer, you will not be charged to use data. For everyone else, including those living outside of Australia, you will be charged as per your data plan.
When using Wi-Fi, you are free to use an unlimited amount, but can also have a limit of 250 MB, 500 MB, or 1 GB if you wish.
Using the app while roaming will incur international rates as per your carrier's policies.

, Here, you can configure the data connection settings (including disabling mobile data and using Wi-Fi instead), learn more about the app, as well as sign up for research updates.

, Navigate to your device settings and turn on data or connect to a stable Wi-Fi network. Remember that the app will respect the data limits you set to avoid overage fees.

, The app will automatically start when your battery level reaches 95%, but you can manually start the process by pressing the play/pause button.

, Of course, you don't always have to be asleep in order to donate processing power! As long as you're plugged in and online, you can help with research. For those curious, here's a breakdown of how DreamLab works.


Cancer research is hindered by the limited availability of supercomputers needed to process complex data. DreamLab harnesses the combined processing power of thousands of smartphones to help Garvan researchers solve problems through a dedicated supercomputer.
When your phone is plugged into power and connected to the Internet, DreamLab will download a tiny piece of the research problem (we're talking several hundreds of KB) and use an algorithm to solve the problem using your phone's unused processing power generated by the CPU. The results are then uploaded to Garvan's cloud servers to be analyzed by researchers who will attempt to identify patterns in the mutated genes of cancer patients to find more effective treatment options.
You shouldn't experience any drawbacks while using this app. Since your phone is plugged into a power source, your battery won't excessively drain. You also have full control over how much data the app uses, and DreamLab will stop once you hit a monthly limit. Depending on how your mobile data and Wi-Fi plans are set up, you shouldn't expect to run into overage problems.

, You can see how long DreamLab has been running and how many research problems your phone helped to solve. Unplug your phone to stop the processing. It'll take you to the home screen where you can see the cumulative time that DreamLab has been running, the total number of problems you've solved, and the overall completion progress of the research project.

, On the upper righthand edge of the user’s profile you’ll see an icon consisting of three dots. Once you click this, several options will appear that give you a choice of how to interact with the user. You should see the “send message” option second from the bottom, just above “turn on/off post notifications.”


An ellipsis icon will appear beside each user whose posts appear on your feed, giving you the option of messaging them while scrolling.

, Hit “send message.” Like with posting comments, you’ll be redirected to a blank text bar where you can input the message you want to send. The same character limit will apply to direct messages.You also have the option of sending photos and videos directly to a user’s messaging inbox. This can be done through your inbox or after you take a photo or video.

, Type out your message. When you’re done, hit the “send” button to the right of the text bar. The message will be relayed to the user’s private inbox, where only they will be able to read it. Instagram will also send them a notification saying they’ve received a new direct message.Direct messages are totally private. No other user will be able to see the message you’ve sent.
If the user messages you back, you will see a message show up in your own direct message inbox. This appears on your homepage as a mail sorting tray icon in the upper right portion of the screen."

Use hashtags to sort and organize content.,
Tag your friends in posts.,
Share content directly with friends.",How to Post a Message on Instagram3," Hashtags (‘#’ attached to a word or phrase) are a basic symbol code that groups together posts with the same tag so they can be archived and accessed conveniently later. You can add hashtags to a post or comment by simply typing the ampersand symbol with an identifying term after. For instance, you might hashtag a photo of your noon meal “#chickensalad,” “#bistro” or “#cleaneating.”Pressing or clicking on a hashtag will take you to a separate page where all posts that use that hashtag are grouped together.People sometimes use hashtags ironically or humorously, but that is not their intended purpose. Hashtags are for keeping track of the subject matter of various content.

, Use the “@” symbol followed by a username (i.e. @oprahwinfrey) to tag that user in a post or comment you want them to see. Instagram will automatically link their profile to the post in question and send them a notification that they’ve been tagged. This feature is useful if you wish to address a specific person or bring something to someone’s attention that they might not have otherwise seen.Be certain that you spell the username of the person you’re trying to tag correctly. If you make a mistake, the app won’t register the user and they won’t be sent a notification.

, One of Instagram’s newer features allows you to share posts with other users directly and privately. Locate the arrow icon below the post you want to share, then choose who to send it to on the scrolling bar that appears at the bottom of the screen. The user will be able to access the post from their direct message inbox so that you don’t have to tag them publicly.Direct sharing is more expedient way of sending content to friends than tagging them in posts.

To begin, visit the Instagram home page on your mobile device. At the bottom of the screen, you should see links for the various versions of Instagram. To begin, download and install the appropriate version to your device.


It's also possible to get Instagram directly from the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Windows Phone Store.;
, Once you've downloaded and installed the Instagram app, open it. On the first screen, you should see three options: Register with Facebook, Register with Email, and Log In. Unless you already have an Instagram account, you'll want to choose one of the first two. The decision is yours, though, if you already have the Facebook app installed on your phone, registering with Facebook is probably the quickest and simplest option.


Another thing to think about is the possibility of cross-promotion. If you want your fanpage to take off, linking your Instagram to your Facebook account can allow you to make sure that your Facebook friends stay up-to-speed on your Instagram activity.

, On the next screen, you'll be asked to choose a username and password. If you chose to register with your email, you'll also be asked to supply a valid email address. In addition, you can list your name and phone number, though you aren't required to. Compared to many social networking sites, the amount of information you need to provide to make an Instagram is minimal.


Since you're making a fanpage, you may want to opt for a username that reflects the celebrity, hobby, or interest your page is devoted to. This can be simple and direct, like ""Belieber2020"" for a Justin Bieber fanpage, or a little more subtle, like ""SurfBoard247"" (referencing the lyrics to ""Drunk in Love"") for a Beyonce fanpage.

, On the next screen, you'll be asked whether you'd like to add Facebook friends who are also members of Instagram to your new network. After this, you'll be asked whether you'd like to add members of your phone's internal contact list. If you're interested in having the most successful fanpage possible, you will probably want to consent to both of these so that you can follow as many people as possible and boost your profile. After accepting (or declining) Instagram's friend-search service, you'll see a list of ""Suggest Users"" you may want to check out. After browsing through these users and following which ever you please, you'll be brought to the main screen of your new Instagram profile.


Congratulations! You're ready to start building your fanpage. In the next section, we'll learn how to use our Instagram so that we can make a truly awesome page.

, You're now ready to start building your fanpage. First, however, it's wise to familiarize yourself with the app. Use the five buttons at the bottom of the screen to navigate the various parts of Instagram. From left to right, these buttons are:


House: Takes you to your home screen. Here, you can see activity associated with your account — both the things you have recently posted and the things the people you're following have recently posted.
Compass: Takes you to the ""Explore"" page. Here, you can see quality content from a selection of random Instagrammers.
Circle in square: Takes you to the camera screen. You'll use this to take and upload photos and videos.
Heart in speech bubble: Takes you to your ""News"" page. Here, you can see the activity on your posts. Whenever someone comments on or likes your post, you'll see it here.
Silhouette: Takes you to your profile page. Allows you to view and edit your posts and personal settings. Additionally, from here, it's possible to search for and view other users' profiles.

, If this is your very first account and you'd like to get started right away, use the steps below to walk yourself through the process. It's simple and easy — you'll be a natural in no time.


To begin, click the button at the bottom of the screen that looks like a circle inside a square. This will bring up a camera app that allows you to take pictures with your cell phone and apply dazzling filters to make them look gorgeous. You can also take short videos — simply bring up the video recorder with the movie camera icon in the bottom right of the camera screen.
Once you've taken a photo, pick a filter from the list that appears at the bottom of the screen. There's no right or wrong filter to pick for any given photo, so choose one that you like! From this screen, you can also adjust the brightness of the photo and tamper with a variety of advanced options by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the image. When you're done, click the arrow in the top right to proceed.
Finally, on the next screen, you may add a short caption or description to your photo if you want to. You can also tag people in the photo, specify where the photo was taken, and, if desired, share the photo on other social networks. When you're done, click the check mark in the top right to finalize your post.

, It's important to know that, with Instagram, you don't have to take all of the pictures you post right before you post them. On the camera screen, if you click the button in the bottom left that looks like a square made out of smaller squares, you can access your phone's gallery. This allows you to post pictures or videos that you've taken in the past and even ones that you've downloaded from the internet.


You may find this option useful, especially if you're making a celebrity fanpage. Unless you plan on stalking your favorite celebrity, you may find that it's easiest to get good photos of him/her from the internet. A good first photo for your fanpage might, for instance, be a glamour shot you've downloaded from the internet into your phone's gallery. Or, it might be a candid, charming snapshot taken backstage. It's up to you!

, When you're following someone, any posts s/he makes will appear on your main Instagram ""feed"". If you follow enough people, you'll have something new to see almost every time you log in. To follow someone, go to your profile page by clicking the silhouette icon in the bottom right. Click the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen and type in a name or term you want to search for. For instance, if you're looking for accounts related to Jennifer Lawrence, you'd simply type in ""Jennifer Lawrence"". Click the magnifying glass icon again to bring up a list of profiles that match your search terms. Click on a profile, then, on the next screen, if you like what you see, click ""+ Follow"".


If you're running a celebrity fanpage, following your favorite celebrity's official Instagram account is a must. However, you may also want to want to follow other fan pages, especially ones that are already popular. Since the people who view these fan pages can see you in the list of the page's followers, doing this is a way to promote your own page in addition to getting a steady stream of content to view for yourself.

, Like Twitter and other social networks, Instagram uses a system of keywords marked with hashtags to make certain types of content easier to find. If a user searches for a certain keyword, posts containing this keyword as a hashtag will come up in the search results. When you want to help a post get noticed, label it with a very popular hashtag to ensure it's included in as many users' search results as possible. However, make sure the hashtag is a relevant one — using a hashtag that makes no sense just because it's popular can seem shamelessly attention-seeking.


For more information on how to use hashtags, see How to Hashtag on Instagram

As of June 2014, the 10 most popular hashtags on Instagram were: #love, #instagood, #me, #tbt, #follow, #cute, #photooftheday, #followme, #like, and #tagsforlikes., Having a username that is somehow connected to the subject of your fanpage can help others find your profile when using search terms related to the subject. If you didn't choose a fanpage-appropriate username when you created your profile, you may want to change your username to something more fitting. This is easy — simply go to your profile page by clicking the silhouette icon in the bottom right of the Instagram app. Click ""Edit Your Profile"" in the top right. From here, you can change your username, as well as all of the other information associated with your profile.

, The very first part of your profile people will see is your profile picture, which displays next to your username in search results. If this picture is left blank, people may assume that your profile isn't frequently updated, leading them to investigate others. Turn more random Instagrammers into followers by inviting them to your page with a memorable profile picture.


Since you're running a fanpage, you'll probably want your profile pic to be related in some way to the subject of your page so it's extra-obvious to users viewing search results what your page is about. For instance, if your fanpage is dedicated to the Harry Potter films, you might want a picture of the iconic lightning-bolt logo or a close-up of your favorite actor in costume.

, Instagramming is a give-and-take experience. By posting content, you give your followers something to view and and enjoy, fulfilling one side of the bargain. However, the most successful Instagrams also get their followers to contribute by liking, commenting, and sharing your posts. Use your ability to give your pictures captions to encourage your followers to participate in a dialog or share their thoughts on relevant topics. The bigger the conversation, the more you'll get noticed.


One popular way Instagram users get their followers to participate and interact with each other is to invite their leaders to comment or respond to questions in their posts. For instance, try posting an image and giving the caption ""QOTD (Question of the Day)"", followed by a relevant question, like ""What's your all-time favorite scene from this show?""

, If you're already a member of popular social media communities like Facebook, one great way to boost your Instagram followers is to share your Instagram posts on these other sites. When you're about to make a post, use the ""Share"" options at the bottom of the screen to allow Instagram to post your new content on both Instagram and the social media site you chose. Doing this lets you maximize your audience with a minimum of work.


You may have to provide login details for your social media profile and give Instagram permission to post on your behalf if you haven't already done so.

, If you want to win the love of other Instagram users, you'll need to give some love as well. Don't be a ""ghost follower"" — someone who follows another user, but never comments or likes any of his or her posts. Be an active member of the fan community by regularly interacting with the people you follow. Commenting on their posts, responding to their conversation prompts, and mentioning them specifically in your own posts can help you become a full-fledged member of the fan community and gain more followers of your own.

, While the details of your fanpage are up to you, you may find that you're more successful if you give your fanpage a theme that's a little more focused than ""posting general pictures and videos of your favorite celebrity, hobby, or interest"". These types of general fanpages can become quite successful, but they're less likely to be memorable — to really stick out from the pack — than if they have a great specific concept.


For example, let's say we're making a Jennifer Lawrence fanpage. We could update the page with pictures of Jennifer Lawrence as we come across them, but we might also want to give it a more narrow focus. Posting, for instance, only photos in which Jennifer Lawrence is in-character as one of her movie roles is one way to narrow our Instagram's focus. We could even take it one step further and limit it to photos from the Hunger Games series of movies, though having a focus that is too tight can eventually make it hard to find things to post.

, Successful fan pages are ones that are updated frequently. The more often you post pictures and videos to your Instagram, the more often your followers will see your posts, the more often your posts will receive likes and comments, and the more visible you'll be. Keeping active is one of your best tickets to success, so don't be a slouch!


When posting photos and videos, don't forget to use a variety of flattering filters. Instagram's built-in filters allow you to lend an artistic flair to even fairly plain images.

, Instagram is all about the visuals — beautiful, stunning images are the app's bread and butter. Still, it's important to remember that you always have the option to include a line or two of text with your visuals. Giving your images and videos snappy captions and taglines is a great way to catch your audience's attention. If the text is particularly witty or enjoyable, you'll see your likes and comments for the post soar!


For example, if we're making a Game of Thrones fanpage, we might post our images and photos accompanied with little winks and references to the books and show in the accompanying text. For a picture of Daenerys (Emilia Clark) handling her pet dragons, we could go with the relatively straightforward caption ""Mother of Dragons"", though it'd probably be a little better to go with an amusing pun like ""Smokin'"".

, Making a fanpage isn't super hard, but keeping it relevant can be. The world of social media moves quickly, so keep informed about the latest developments related to your fanpage's subject for the best chance at remaining popular.


You'll probably want to subscribe to fan resources to receive the most recent news about the subject of your fanpage. Being a member of an official fan club or email list is a great place to start. You'll also probably want to follow lots of other similar fanpages.

, While any good fanpage should be actively updated, it's not smart to constantly pump out content if it's not any good. If you don't have anything new to post, don't rush out a hasty snapshot simply to have something new posted. It's OK to take days off from Instagram to rest, get inspiration, and wait for new developments in the subject of your fanpage.


Try especially to avoid repeating yourself. Re-posting the same images or videos can quickly bore your followers, leading them to unfollow you.

, When all else fails, learn from the best!! Browsing Instagram's wide range of fanpages by searching for your preferred interest, celebrity, etc. in the profile screen's search bar can help you find pages that can guide the development of your own. You should also be following many of these sites to get a steady stream of content to view and to stay abreast of the latest trends having to do with your fanpage's subject.

Try again!",How to Get a High Score on Flappy Bird," The original Flappy Bird game has unfortunately been revoked by its creator after he received a large amount of harassment about the game. While it is no longer available for new players, you can download any one of a number of clones. This can be done through the app store, Android market or Google play.


Some notable clones include: Silly Bird, Flappy Fish, Flappy Hipster,Fly bird ,Tappy Nyan, and Flappy Bert (from Sesame Street)!
You can also download the original game, but you will have to find it on the internet and install it manually. Just be sure to use a reputable website!
The creator has recently stated that he will someday bring the game back to official channels, but that that will not happen any time soon.;
, This game will require immense concentration if you wish to achieve a high score. This can entail the removal of pets from the room, lowering of music volumes or not sitting on an aisle seat whilst playing on a bus, for example.


However, everybody has their own methods to increase levels of focus. Try experimenting with various external factors to find what suits you best.

, Play several games and try to score as high as possible, getting used to the game's speed and techniques.

, The flappy bird will move down quite quickly. It's crucial to get used to the way the game moves in order to play well. After a while, you'll discover that the game seems more predictable.

, For example, if you keep flying too high, try to fly lower next time. In other words, learn from your mistakes and make corrections each time.

, Try to tap just before you reach the top part of the bottom pipe. Your best bet for survival is to get as far into the width of the pipe so that when you tap again, it reduces the odds of you hitting the bottom of the top pipe.

, However, be attentive. Be sure to wait until the first possible second to tap, as you will then be less likely to hit the top of pipes or fly too high. However, not paying close attention and waiting too long will likely cause you to hit the pipe.

, Once you start getting at least a score of 10, get into a rhythm. Begin to memorize how the flappy bird flies at each tap; having or developing good spatial awareness is of great benefit here.

, Once you have a high score, don't stop. Try to beat your high score. Play against others––competing with your friends is a great motivation to do better.

Backup your iPhone!,
Gather all of the tools you will need.,
Look at the bottom of your iPhone (the side with the home button) and locate the 2 screws on either side of the USB connector.,
Remove the screen using one of these methods:


Use a wedging or scraping tool.,
Look for flaps in the top right holding the screen and phone together.,
Look for a third sticker under the #2 flap.,
Remove 6 more screws.,
Separate the LCD screen from the glass.,
Clean the metal frame from the broken glass.,
Prepare your new screen.,
Start reassembling your iPhone.,
Put the 6 screws back that we took out before.

,
Slide the #3 cable back into the clamp, making sure the clamp is open.,
Put the #2 and #1 cables back on by simply pressing them onto the connector.,
Put the screen back onto the phone.",How to Fix an iPhone 3G Screen," Connect it to your computer, browse to your iPhone in iTunes, and click ""Sync."";
, All these materials can be bought online in packages. A simple Google search, ""iPhone screen repair kit"", will produce you many results to choose from. Also, stores such as Zellers and Walmart carry all the materials except for the screen. Ordering the materials offline will ensure that you get the correct size and type if you are uncertain. Here is what you need:


A replacement glass.
A #00 Phillips screwdriver
A razor blade, or other wedging and scraping tool
Rubbing alcohol and Q-tips, and/or a hair dryer or heat gun
Double-sided tape and scissors, or superglue
Optional: A small suction cup
Optional: Tweezers

, Use a #00 Phillips screwdriver to unscrew both of these. (Note that you don't need to remove the SIM card in order to open the phone, as mentioned elsewhere on the web.)

, A razor blade works well. Put the razor blade between the rubber and metal and lift the screen. The screen will still be attached to the iPhone so be sure to read the next step to be prepared.






Use a suction cup. Instead of using a scraper tool or a screwdriver which can damage the rubber surround, use a small suction cup. Place the suction cup right above the home button and gently pull up. The glass will pull right out with no damage to the surrounding rubber gasket (assuming the glass is not broken too badly to get a seal).

, You will see labels 1 and 2 on bright orange stickers on these flaps. Lift these flaps with your wedging tool. (Note: The #2 sticker on the phone used in this tutorial fell off.)

, This one is a little different from the other two. You will need to lift the black ""clamp"" to release the #3 connection. Once the clamp is lifted, the screen will be free from the rest of the iPhone, simply pull it out.

, There are 5 screws on the side rails: 3 on the side with the flaps and 2 on the other side. The 6th screw is in the top right. All 6 of these screws are the same, so you don't need to worry about keeping track of which went where. There is black tape over some of the screws in this step. The black tape is not needed, so you can use your razor blade to cut off the tape covering each screw head.

, Put your wedger in between the rails and wedge the inner piece out. The LCD will need to slide down towards the Home button to clear the top flanges. Don’t be afraid to apply a little pressure as the metal will not get deformed. This step will free the LCD screen from the metal frame.

, This step is the hardest part and will take a while, but make sure it is done well so the new screen fits snug. The specific approach to take will depend on how the glass broke, but don’t be scared to use force as long as you are not greatly bending the metal/plastic frame because you will reuse it. Use your razor blade or other wedging device to scrap away stuck pieces of glass and leftover residue of the former adhesive. Some people recommend using a heat gun or hair dryer, but be careful as this can deform the frame if it is torqued while applying heat. In that case you will have to heat it again to reform it. The adhesive does dissolve with rubbing alcohol, so try swabbing that on with a Q-tip and then working at it with the razor blade.


Be careful not to cut yourself! And if you get any tiny glass shards in your fingers or skin, read How to Remove a Splinter.

, If you have double sided tape, make sure it is cut out correctly. If you have super glue, make sure when applying it that you do not apply too close to the home button. Only apply adhesive, whichever one it may be, to the wide black plastic on the bottom or top, staying away from the middle. You don’t want to glue the home button or the listening piece on the top. Let adhesive set for a few minutes to make sure it is set. If you use double-sided tape, consider using tweezers to manipulate it so that you don't get your finger oils all over it, diminishing its stickiness. Be sure to remove the protective plastic on the new glass where it will touch the tape.

, Put the LCD and glass back together. There are two ways the screen can go and only one is correct. On one side, the rail is longer than the other, so that's a quick way to match it. You may find it easier to slide the LCD in from the bottom so the little clamp slides on nicely.

,, This step is easier if you push the #3 down to straighten it out a bit, then hold the #2 and #1 cable with your thumb. Once you have the #3 cable reinserted, press down the black clamp.

, Don’t worry about using a little bit of force or missing the connector a few times as it is bound to happen.

, Start by inserting the top, the side with the connectors, then place the bottom in. It should fit in nicely, avoid using force. After the screen and LCD are nice and snug, put the last 2 screws into their places on either side of the USB.

Continue using your BlackBerry.",How to Block a Number on Blackberry," The ability to block calls on a BlackBerry requires your device running OS 10.3 or later. This release allows apps to run in the background (""headless""), which is required for a call blocking app to work.You can check your version, tap the ""Category"" menu and select ""OS."" You can update to the latest available version by swiping down from the top of the screen, selecting ""Settings,"" and then ""Software Updates.""
BlackBerry devices running BlackBerry 10 include the Z and Q lines, the Passport, the Classic, and the Leap. The Bold, Curve, Pearl, Storm, and Torch models do not support BlackBerry 10, and thus do not support individual call blocking apps.;
, Your BlackBerry does not have a built-in call blocking feature, but there are several apps available that can run in the background and block numbers you specify, as long as you're running OS 10.3.

, There are a few different apps available that can block calls. Some are free and some require payment. A few of the more popular call blocking apps include:


BlockIt
Call Block
Power Tools
Phone Warrior

, Once you've installed your app, you'll need to configure it so that it blocks the numbers you want. This guide will assume you're using BlockIt, though the process is similar for other apps.

, By default, BlockIt will block all numbers on your black list. You can add as many numbers as you'd like to this list. Tap the ""+"" button to add a new number to the list. You'll be able to select a number from your recent calls, add a contact, or type the number in manually.


You can change your settings to only allow numbers on your white list instead.

, When adding a number, you can choose the action that is taken when the call is blocked. By default, the call will be ended automatically, but you can have calls sent directly to voicemail instead. You can also reply with an automated text message informing the caller that they have been blocked.

, If you consistently receive calls from 800 numbers or specific area codes, you can block all numbers that originate from those locations.


Tap the ⋮ button and select ""Wildcards block."" You can then tap the ""+"" button and enter wildcards like ""1800"" to block all numbers that start with that wildcard.

, This feature of BlockIt allows you to automatically block Private and Unknown phone numbers, which you can't normally add to your black list. Be aware that some legitimate calls may originate from private numbers.


You can enable this from the same ⋮ menu. Select ""Private/Unknown Block"" and then enable the feature.

, Blocking apps in OS 10.3 and later are headless, and will keep running in the background. This means you can set your blocking options and then continue to use your BlackBerry like normal. The app will automatically block unwanted calls in the background.


You'll need to start the blocking app whenever you power your BlackBerry on.

You can use the Instagram app to link your Instagram and Twitter, Facebook, and other social media outlets., Research shows content posted during these times get the most likes and attention.To maximize how many people see your posts, use popular hashtags during these times.

, You can include hashtags in your bio. This way, your profile will show up more often while people search hashtags. Hashtags should speak to how you're trying to market yourself. For example, if you're a comedian based in New York City, write something like, ""Living in #NYC and working the #standup scene."", Instagram will only verify your account if they trust the account is legitimately operated by you and not an impersonator. To increase your likelihood of verification, post things that can prove the account is actually you.Link to your other social media accounts, especially if they are verified. If you frequently post your Instagram photos on a verified Twitter account, for example, this helps prove your identity.
Post pictures that are likely to come from you. Generic photographs of landscape could come from anyone, so upload some personal content to help with the verification process.

, Facebook verification for your company or yourself can increase the likelihood of Instagram verification. If you have a fan page for yourself or a general page for your company, go to the ""settings"" tab on Facebook. Click ""general"" followed by ""page verification"" and then ""get started."" You need to give Facebook your number so they can send a verification code you will then type into the site. After this, Facebook will begin processing your request for verification.As with Instagram, post legitimate, personal content to show your account is legitimate.

, Instagram does not verify just anyone. Usually, someone has to have some status as a celebrity or Internet personality to be verified on Instagram. For companies, your company must be relatively well-known to get verified. Try building a following outside Instagram. The more recognizable you or your brand are, the more likely verification is.Sites like YouTube allow you to upload your own video content. Try posting shareable video content, like lists and product reviews. If you're working with a company, start a YouTube channel to help bolster name recognition.
If you're a performer, like a singer or comedian, upload videos of you performing to YouTube and promote your shows on sites like Twitter. This can increase your following on these sites, leading to more recognition.

, Instagram is unlikely to verify your account unless you're a public figure in some respects. Individuals and businesses are less likely to be verified. If you find Instagram will not verify your account, take other measures to show your audience your account is authentic.Link your Instagram account to your personal website or your company website.
Cross-post Instagram posts with other social media sites like Twitter and Facebook.

, There are sites that allow you to buy fake followers to instantly increase your following. Instagram is careful with its verification process and can easily recognize bought followers. While you may see buying followers as a shortcut to verification, Instagram is unlikely to verify your account if your followers are not legitimate., Fake accounts sometimes randomly follow real accounts and may post spammy, computer generated comments on your pictures. These comments may reflect poorly on your account, as they can make it look like you bought followers even if you did not. If you notice any spammy comments from obviously fake accounts, delete them right away.Spammy comments are often generic. You may notice comments like, ""Sweet pic!"" or ""Nice!"" showing up repetitively from the same accounts. These are likely spam accounts, so it's a good idea to delete such comments.

, Instagram is unlikely to verify accounts that do not follow community guidelines.Read the guidelines carefully and make sure not to post any content that could potentially violate guidelines and land you in trouble.Only post and share videos you have the right to share. Do not post information that's subject to copyright.
Avoid sexually explicit content or things like nudity.
Do not post anything illegal.
Leave respectful, meaningful comments on other people's posts.

Before you put anything on your page, stop a minute and think about what you want to get out of your page. Good, popular, Instagram pages usually have a common unifying theme that attracts a lot of followers. If you want to have a good page, think about what you want that theme to be before you start loading pictures onto it. What do you like to take pictures of? What do you enjoy? What do others enjoy?Popular theme pages for Instagram include yoga, cooking, inspirational quotes, restaurants or bars, humor, fashion and pet pictures.
Unless you're Kim Kardashian, who is already super-famous, you're not going to attract thousands of followers by posting selfies.
Consider making a tribute page. If you love comic books, pro wrestling, or a particular fictional figure or athlete, it's sometimes common to start a tribute page to you favorites. Instead of posting your own pictures, post pictures of your particular tribute subject from around the web instead.;
,


The first and easiest way to start designing your Instagram page is to pick a catchy username and profile pic for yourself. A lot of this will depend on what you've chosen as your theme for your page, so you want to pick something that will reflect the theme and a picture that will match.
Fill in the bio as well with something short and sweet. If you're taking pictures of your food and your cat Mortimer, make your handle MortimerBakes, include a picture of him peering over a pile of muffins, and have your bio read: ""My tabby and our gluten-free adventures.""

,


Instagram allows you a variety of editing options, depending on what version you have and what kind of camera you have. It's always important to spend a little bit of time tweaking your pictures to make sure they're visually appealing and the best representation of your page.Crop pictures to emphasize their symmetry and the most important parts of the picture. Leave out the borders and the other silly stuff.
Sample the different pre-set filters to find out which makes your picture look best. If it looks best untouched, leave it alone.
Shift the levels manually, adjusting brightness, tint, and other features. You can always switch it back if you liked the way it looked originally.
Use other photo editors along with Instagram. Snapped, Camera+, VSCO Cam, Photoshop Touch, and other filter apps are all great ways to crop, filter, and touch-up your pictures before putting them in Instagram.

,


Good photos on Instagram should be uncluttered and simple, instead of complicated, blurry, and vague. If you want to take a picture of your hamburger, take a picture of your hamburger, not yourself holding your hamburger up to your face while you're making a duck-face with your friends.

,


Even though you're taking pictures based on a theme, it's unlikely that someone's going to be compelled by 30 straight pictures of hamburgers. Think of creative ways to vary your theme so you don't have to take the same picture over and over and over again.
If you take cooking pictures, you don't always have to take the picture of the food on the plate after you've made it. Consider taking a picture of all the ingredients laid out before you get started, or take a picture of your boyfriend's face after he sees what you're making. Take a picture of the empty plates when your'e done with the meal.Spend time digging around on Instagram to see how popular accounts post pictures to get ideas if you're feeling stuck. Research is always a good idea.

,


It's good to wait a while between posts, so you don't have all your pictures in a big clump in the feed. If you upload a bunch at once, it might turn people off, or they'll miss a bunch of your content entirely and you'll have wasted it.
When you're on vacation, don't wait until you get back to post vacation pics. Post them in real time so people can stay up to date on what you're doing.
If you just took seven pictures of your cat, don't just dump them all onto Instagram unless they help to tell a story of some sort. Wait until you need some pictures later, if you've got too many good ones to use right now.

,


Newer phones have better cameras. If your pictures don't look as good as some of the pictures you notice on your feed, it might be time to update your phone so you can take pictures in higher definition. If you can afford it, it's always a good idea to update if you want a good Instagram page.
You don't have to take pictures on your phone to upload them to Instagram. You can access Instagram from your computer as well, and upload pictures taken from a more professional digital camera, if you have one.

,


Some studies show that the most people are checking Instagram between 6 and 8am, and between 5 and 8pm.If you want to get more likes, it's important to post when the most people will be looking. If you've got pictures to post, wait until those times to post them.

,


Hashtags are used on Twitter, Instagram, and other social media, making it possible to search for posts with a given tag. Anything you post in the caption following a ""#"" can be searched via Instagram. You can use as many different hashtags as are appropriate for the picture to get your photos to as large an audience as possible. There are lots of trendy hashtags that you can latch your pictures onto, including the following:

love
instagood
follow
tbt
cute
happy
girl
fun
summer
instadaily
food
picoftheday



, It's good to use hashtags, but you don't want to take it to ridiculous heights, or just pick hashtags because they're popular. Make sure that you're using appropriate descriptions that match the pictures that you're taking.


Do a little research to make sure that you find the most popular hashtag for a given subject. The difference between the number of photos that use #dog and #dogs and #collie is huge, for example.

,


Before you post a picture to Instagram, you'll have the option of tagging it to a particular location, which your phone can read based on your GPS. Often, you can do this at a particular restaurant or other specific location to give some love to the business that you're patronizing, or you can just connect your picture to a particular city. This makes it easy for other people who look for that business or that city to find your pictures and like them. It's a great way to connect.

,


Some hashtags make it easy to find users who will like your photos back if you like their pics. If you're just looking to pad your stats with some quick likes, try posting pictures with #like4like or #l4l. Scroll through the pictures and like lots of them very quickly, then post your own pictures with the same hashtags. You should attract a number of likes fairly quickly.

,


If you want to get people to like your pictures, it's a good idea to stay current on what's popular in your Instagram feed. See all your friends posting under a similar hashtag? Figure out what it's all about and post your own pictures under that hashtag. Here are a few popular Insta-trends:
Throwback Thursday (#tbt)
Woman-crush Wednesday (#wcw)
Pictures without filters (#nofilter)
Selfies (#selfie)
Old pictures (#latergram)

,


Want followers? Follow lots of accounts. Even though it might seem ""cool"" to follow fewer people than follow you, it's almost impossible unless you're already famous or put some serious work into it. The way to start? Follow lots of people. You can always unfollow them later.
Link your Instagram to your other social networking accounts and follow all your friends who are on Instagram. Then search popular hashtags and hashtags for subjects you're interested in. Follow a couple dozen accounts there as well.
Follow very popular accounts, like One Direction, Justin Bieber, and Kim Kardashian. This often gains a fair number of followers immediately.

,


Just like you can use hashtags to attract likes, you can use hashtags to attract followers. Scroll through the pictures tagged #follow4follow or #f4f and follow a bunch of people with that posted. Then, post a couple of pictures with the same hashtags. Several people should follow you back, based on the use of that hashtag. It's an easy way to gain followers quickly.
Always follow back the people who follow you. Lots of people want to gain followers and will just unfollow people who don't follow them back. If you want to keep people subscribed to your channel, follow them as well.

,


Look through hashtags that you like and like pictures that you find, randomly. Then comment with positive little messages like, ""Great shot!"" or ""Love this!"" Like the pictures and follow the accounts. If you do, people will be much more likely to follow you back.
Always be positive and real. Don't just copy and paste the same message onto a couple hundred pictures. Try to tailor it to the specific pictures that you find. You'll be more likely to gain followers if people think you're not a robot.

,


If you want people to follow you, you need to interact with them to prove that you're worth following. If someone comments on your picture, comment back. If someone likes your picture, like one of their pictures and follow them back. Be a good friend on Instagram and keep things positive.
Don't spam. It's common for people to scroll through and bomb popular pictures with things like, ""Hey follow me!"" This is extremely unpopular and will lose you followers.
Do shoutouts. If you like someone's picture, post a picture and shout out their account in the comments and encourage your followers to follow them. This is a good way to spread goodwill.

,


Ideally, you should post 1-3 times per day to attract and maintain the most number of followers. If you post sporadically, some people will stop following you because you seem inactive. Aim to post at least every day.Save a few photos back to post tomorrow, if you have them. Spread it out instead of wasting them all today.
At the same time, you want to avoid posting too often. If you regularly bomb someone's feed with fifty pictures from your vacation, you may lose some followers over it.

, Find a stunning photo on the explore page that compliments your account. Post it and shoutout the individual you got the photo from.

, Hashtags are very effective if used properly. Use hashtags that will attract your niche. For example: if you want to attract people from your city! use the hashtags that are used most in the city.

Try out some get-follower apps or websites.",How to Get Popular on Instagram1," It's difficult to get popular if you have to approve every person who follows your account. People also tend to want to see what kind of photos you are sharing before they decide to follow you. If you want to gain as many followers as possible, you need to have a public account.


Link your Instagram profile to your other social networking as well. You might as well get all your existing friends connected to your Instagram account, after all they are more likely to interact with your posts. You can also link Instagram to simultaneously update with Facebook and Twitter.
If you're concerned about your privacy, take control of it by not posting anything you'd regret. Don't put anything personal or embarrassing on your Instagram page. Make sure you don't geo tag your home address and stay safe online.
;
, One of the easiest ways to start reaching out and gain followers is to follow lots of accounts. You can't expect people to find yours if you don't reach out and interact with the Instagram community. Follow lots of accounts, even if you plan on unfollowing them later. Instagram will allow you to follow about 160 people per hour.


Follow your friends. Link your profile to your other social networking pages and invite everyone to like your page.
Follow accounts that are related to interests you have. Into sports? Cooking? Knitting? Find pages devoted to these hobbies and follow lots of them. Look up the follow lists on these pages and start following people.
Follow celebs. Look up your favorite athletes, musicians, actresses, and other celebs to follow on Instagram. Comment regularly on their popular posts to get your page some exposure.
Always follow your followers. If someone is following you, you'll gain a long-term follower if you follow them back.

, Pick out some celebrities and other popular Instagram accounts to follow and engage. Comment regularly on their posts to get other followers to check out your page and follow it.


While Instagram frowns on this practice, following and unfollowing some very popular accounts (Bieber, One Direction, Kim Kardashian) repeatedly can gain you several followers very quickly. However this can also get your account suspended.
Don't spam popular pages. Lots of people like to comment, ""Hey follow me!"" on really popular pages, but this will earn you negative comments and it will rarely work. It also looks tacky.

, There are a variety of apps and sites designed to make the follower-chasing a little easier. They all essentially allow you to build capital or ""coins"" by liking pictures and doing other tasks, which will earn you followers in return. All these apps work slightly differently, and some require that you pay for them.

Have a clear and specific bio filled out.,
Take a good profile pic.,
Comment positively on lots of pictures.,
Post regularly.,
Do shoutouts, sometimes.,
Engage with your followers.",How to Get Popular on Instagram2," People are more likely to follow a page with a specific and clear theme. When you're crafting yours, try to think about what you're likely to include in your photo feed. What are you passionate about? What are your interests?


Eating, cooking, or drinking
Animals
Nature photography
Memes or humor
Partying
Yoga or exercise
Home decorating and lifestyle
Fashion or style
Sports

, When someone looks at your page, they need to be able to tell what you're about immediately. Connect your bio to your theme in a short and clear way. Most bios should be no more than a few sentences.


You mostly take pictures of your food at your dog? Make that obvious in your bio: ""Kitchen creations and the hijinks of Moofus, the wonder-dog.""
Don't share private information. Your bio doesn't need to list where you live and your full name, if you want to attract strangers to follow your page. Only include private info if your page is private.
You can use multiple lines and emojis in your bio to make it stand out and attract followers. Be creative!

, Pick a profile picture that matches the theme of your Instagram feed. If you're taking pictures of your own life, include a selfie profile pic. If you're taking pictures of your animals, you better include a picture of your animals in the profile. Craft beer enthusiast? Show us the suds.


Pictures show up pretty small on Instagram. Pick a very focused and close-up picture, not something with a lot of clutter.

, If you want to attract followers, you need to create a positive presence on Instagram. People are always thankful of positive comments and many will visit your profile to learn more about the person who just flattered them.


A community posts with the hashtag #jj, which includes a series of rules that get people more involved. For every picture tagged #jj, you have to comment on two pictures and like three more., Following lots of people and being friendly on Instagram may get you a fair number of followers, but you also need to have the content there to back it up. Keeping your followers is just as important as gaining new ones. If you want to keep followers, you have to post every day at least.Recent studies show that 2-3 posts a day are optimal.The life of Tweets is typically pretty short, so Twitter operators will Tweet a lot more often than you should for Instagram.
Thursdays are the most popular day to post on Instagram, and Sunday is the least popular day. That means you should post on both days, so you catch people when they're using on Thursday, and so your posts stand out on Sunday.Post no more than one or two pictures at a time. Don't flood the feed. If you've got a bunch of good ones, that's great! But space them out over the course of the day or a week.

, Shoutouts involve posting the names of some of your followers in the comment stream or tagged in your photos. This promotes their pages to get your followers to follow them, and will give people a reason to do it in return. It's a good way to spread the followers around.


Some accounts like @shoutzz or @Pretty.GirlShoutz exist, which will exchange shoutouts for money. This practice is discouraged from Instagram and these typically don't last very long, usually paid shoutouts last for an hour but permanent shoutouts can also be purchased at a higher price.
As with anything on Instagram, if you overdo it, you'll lose followers. Shoutouts can look a little tacky or crass, and a lot of people don't like them.

, People like to be entertained. If you want to be popular on Instagram, you need to provide entertainment for people. Don't just put up pictures and expect that people will like your page. Engage with people who express interest and stay social on Instagram.Hold contests. Give away something fun to the ""best comment"" or to a particular follower for doing something. Make your prize somehow related to the theme of your page.
Ask questions of your followers and respond to questions from your followers. Have actual conversations and express an interest in their lives and their pictures. Be there for your followers.
Make a funny comment that people will want to share. If they share your post that will make your account visible to many more users.

Post at the right time of day.,
Always include captions.,
Use popular hashtags.,
Follow people who like your pictures.,
Dig around on the app and see what's trending.,
Use some get-likes apps.",How to Get Popular on Instagram3," Research studies show that the optimal time to post on Instagram is on Wednesday at about 5 pm.If you want to get more likes, you need to post when people are looking at their phones. That means you usually need to avoid working hours, between 8 and 5 pm, and post who people are still awake and looking at their phones. So, evenings and early mornings are the best times to post to Instagram.


Don't clump up too many pictures at once. If you've got three or four great ones, don't put them all up in a series, or you'll get fewer likes. Unless they specifically go together, wait and space out your posts.
Make sure you are posting at the right time for your target audience. If a big part of your audience come from overseas then they could be living in a different timezone.

, Pictures need to have context. Captions are an opportunity to add a little joke to your post, or give people some other way of reading into it. Use captions ironically so you can give people multiple ways to appreciate your picture.


Most people use captions for their hashtags. This is important, but it's also good to include regular captions as well. Throw some emojis and some text in there as well.
Use a caption ironically. If you take a really pretty picture of a sunset in your neighborhood, that's ok, but if it's captioned with, ""Too bad my neighborhood smells like dead fish tonight.""

, Hashtags give you a great opportunity to get your pictures out to people who aren't your followers. When people search hashtags for particular themes, your picture will come up. Use a variety of accurate hashtags and trending hashtags to hook your pictures to as many different search terms as possible.Some of the most popular hashtags include: cute, love, smile, swag, popular, instagood, photooftheday, instamood, picoftheday, and nofilter.
Use accurate hashtags. If you take a selfie, hashtag it #selfie. If you take a picture of your bff, hashtag it #bff. Don't overthink it.
Geotag your pictures as well. If your picture is tied to a particular place, set your Instagram so that it can tag your location. This lets other people in your area find local pictures to like.
Studies show that using 11 hashtags is the optimum number. You can use too many, which can turn off a lot of users and make your page look desperate, but it's good to use enough that a variety of people will be able to see it.
Find relevant and popular hashtags using sites and apps like TagsForLikes.

, When you use hashtags, you'll get some strangers liking your pictures. When you do, follow them back. If someone expresses an interest in your pictures and your profile, it's good to reach out and connect. Comment on one of their pictures or like a few in return.

Take a variety of pictures.,
Use the filter function smartly.,
Tell stories with your pictures.,
Use other photo editing apps.,
Keep it relatively clean.",How to Get Popular on Instagram4," Diversity is key. If you want to be popular on Instagram, you need to find a variety of things to post about. Look at the pictures that you've taken and find ways to vary those themes, and repackage the same content. Learn what kind of photos are getting the most likes and evolve on them


If you like taking food pics, that's great. A theme is good, but if you like hamburgers, nobody wants to look at three pictures of hamburgers a day. You'll lose followers if your feed is repetitive.
Instead, take pictures of empty plates, food in process, the outside of restaurants you like, menus that you like. Shake it up.
Never re-post the same picture that you've already posted, especially not the same day. If you didn't get as many likes as you wanted the first time, don't put the same picture back up.

, Instagram is notable for its filter-options that you can use on your pictures. Using them to complement the pictures that you take can help you get more followers and likes. It's good taste.


""#nofilter"" is a popular tag for a reason. If you can find beauty that's real and not artificial, people like that. Think sunsets, or very colorful, high-contrast night scenes.
Filters can't make a bad or boring picture good. Experiment with different ones, but make sure the picture is interesting to begin with.
Try to upgrade your camera if you can. HD pictures always look a lot better.
Willow is said to be the filter that gets the most amount of likes, but experiment for yourself and find out which filters are most effective for your followers.

, It's possible to combine pictures together to make interesting combinations or even collages that can tell an entertaining story. Take before and after pictures and post them spaced out a little, according to what kinds of photos were included.


Take a picture of the burger you're about to eat, with some kind of comment about how you're hungry enough to eat a horse. Half an hour later, take another picture of your empty plate with the caption, ""#winning.""

, There are a tons of other photo editing apps made specifically to work along with Instagram. You can add additional filters and frames for your pictures, you can add funny visual tricks, and you can split pictures or combine them with other pictures. It gives you a bit more creativity to share on Instagram with your followers.Here are some popular editing apps:


Snapseed
Camera+
VSCO Cam
Photoshop Express and Photoshop Touch
Noir Photo
ColorSplash
Afterlight

, Keep it classy, or you risk getting your Instagram account cancelled. When you're trying to get popular on Instagram, keep it hovering around PG-13 at the most. In some cases, it's true that sex sells, but no nudity or crudity on your Instagram feed.

A link to your website (or a separate social media account on which you are active).
A description of the content you're trying to provide.
A memorable name that adequately sums up your content.;
, You can do this from the Linked Accounts section of the Settings menu in the Instagram app. Linking your existing accounts will spread your content across other platforms, thereby increasing the amount of views that your profile gets.

, If you don't have a general purpose to your content, both you and your followers will quickly become confused and/or distracted. While you should feel free to come up with your own theme, some easy themes include:


Cooking
Outdoor pursuits
Urban exploration
Fitness

, Ideally, you'll post at least once a day, every day of the week. You can keep your audience engaged by doing the following:Varying your content (but not your theme)
Posting dynamic content (e.g., Boomerang media or videos)
Posting at around 5:00 PM (or 2:00 AM) EST

, Following other users and liking/commenting on their posts is an easy way to garner a few followers here and there, and you'll likely build relationships in the process.

, After you gain a fair amount of followers, some of them will likely have requests. If you listen to their feedback and deem it appropriate for your account, consider incorporating their suggestions into your content production--the happier your followers are, the more they'll want to stay with your account.

, Tags make your content searchable by people who are looking for those specific tags.


Tagging is also a great way to extend your outreach to the Instagram community.

, Ideally, you'll want to add 10 to 20 of these tags to your photos. Doing so will increase your content's visibility, thereby garnering you followers.


Instagram tends to look down on misleading tagging, so you can't simply add irrelevant popular tags to your content.

, Since you can't add false tags to your content, curate content that matches those tags.


For example, if ""#love"" is currently trending, you might take a picture that matches your content theme and add ""#love"" to the description.

, You can do this from the upload screen after taking a photo, or you can choose to edit your existing photos after uploading them.


Tags should pertain to your photos, but they should also work with your theme. Keep your tags focused.

On the other hand, consistently posting gorgeous, interesting content that stands out from the other contributions users see every day is a great way to start getting noticed.Try to do something new with each photo — if your followers don't know what will come next, they'll be more likely to stick around and keep liking your photos!


In the rest of the steps in this section, we'll explore some posting strategies that can help you gain a reputation as a quality Instagram poster. However, it's important to remember that there's no ""right"" way to use Instagram — the most popular users of all are often people who use Instagram in new, exciting ways that others haven't thought of before.;
, No matter what the subject of your picture is, people on Instagram tend to have positive reactions to content that contains bright colors and interesting contrasts — in other words, pictures that are pretty! There are chances to capture beauty with your phone's camera almost everywhere, so be on the lookout for eye-catching subjects in the world around you. Below are just a few ideas for visually-appealing photos that often do well on Instagram (there are many, many more.)


Exotic locales (a vacation or trip is a great opportunity to take some high-scoring Instagram shots)
Wilderness shots
Beaches
Sunsets
Interesting reflections
Cityscapes
Close-ups of colorful things (like flowers, paintings, etc.)
Well-crafted objects or possessions (like cars, musical instruments, etc.)
Delicious-looking food

, Humor works on almost everyone — a truly hilarious Instagram post can become a magnet for likes (or even a viral sensation) if it has enough visibility. If users can consistently find something new on your Instagram profile that makes them laugh, you should quickly start racking up likes. Below are just a few ideas for things you may want to post to get you started:


Prank videos (an old online staple)
Pictures of funny/garish costumes or outfits
Pictures of amusing/embarrassing social media interactions
Silly visual puns
Parodies of Instagram culture (i.e., intentionally vain selfies, pretentiously ""artsy"" shots, etc.)

, Another way to get likes out of your audience is to tug at its heartstrings. Pictures that feature cute, loveable, or nostalgic content can sometimes be immensely popular, so try adding some of the following ideas to your normal rotation:


Family photos
Pictures of cute animals
Pictures of babies
Inspirational photos
Precious moments with an S.O. (be careful not to come across as sappy or attention-seeking)
Old/new comparison photos (i.e., a picture of you and your friends at age fourteen split with a picture of the same people ten years later)

, It isn't all about what you shoot — it's also about how you shoot it! If you can, try to give each Instagram shot the same amount of time and focus that you'd give a piece of professional photography. For some shots, like pictures of objects in motion or live events, this may be impossible, but for stationary subjects, there's no reason not to take your time and arrange an interesting shot. Below are just a few very basic tips you may want to consider when taking pictures.


Keep the main subject in focus. Other objects in the frame can sometimes be left out of focus for an interesting contrast — it's up to you.
Make sure your subject is well-lit, but not harshly lit. Bright light from fluorescent lights or the sun can give the subject an unpleasant sheen. In addition, it can be difficult to capture partially-lit objects in dark environments (though if you can, the effect can be quite powerful.)
Play around with closeups and wide-angle shots. Does your subject look most impressive from a few feet away or from a few inches away?
Try varying the position of the main subject in the frame. Does it look best in the center of the shot or at the edge of the frame?

, Instagram is famous for its filters. While many photos look great without filters, adding a filter is often an easy way to give your photos a more dramatic, interesting feel without having to re-take your shot. Best of all, there are dozens of filters available for free with Instagram — simply select one that you think will improve the feel of your photo the best before you post it.Note, however, that using the same filters over and over again can give your post history an unappealing ""samey"" feel, so try to vary them over time.
Don’t just choose a filter and post. Take your time, think about the kind of effect you want to achieve, and experiment. Specific filters will suit some images better than others.

, Downloadable third-party photo collage apps do exactly what their name implies — allow you to post exciting collages to Instagram. Many photo collage apps are completely free and allow you to choose from a large variety of frames. If you haven't already, try downloading and using one of these apps to add some spice to your Instagram profile — you may end up loving it!


One general tip for posting high-quality collages is to pick photos for the collage that are all thematically connected in some way. For instance, you might want to use a collage to show off a handful of pictures you took while baking a cake, with one picture showing the ingredients, one showing you mixing them, one showing you putting the batter into the oven, and so on.

, Sometimes Instagram's default filters and editing options just don’t cut it. Third-party apps can give you more options and make your photos stand out, so if you're a frequent Instagram user, they can be a good use of your device's storage space.


Some of the most popular editing apps available include Photo Editor by Aviary, Afterlight, Bokehful, and Overgram.

Limit your overall number of ""selfies"".,
Lean towards ""cooler"", earthier colors.,
Reduce your reliance on filters.,
Use imaginative composition for your selfie shots.",How to Get More Likes on Instagram without Hashtags2," ""Selfies"" (pictures you take of your self) are popular on Instagram — simply scroll through the ""Explore"" tab and odds are that you'll see plenty. However, unless you're a gorgeous celebrity, followers will often get annoyed if all they see on your profile is your face, so try to avoid posting too many pictures of yourself. A selfie or two is OK every once in a while, but doing it all the time can make you come across as vain or narcissistic, which can have a negative effect on your likes.


In this section, we'll give you a few tips for getting lots of likes with the selfies you do take. However, keep this first step in mind — no matter how good your selfies are, taking too many can be a very bad idea.

, Research has shown that certain color combinations make selfies statistically more popular on average. In particular, cool tones like blue and purple and earthy tones like tan, beige, burnt orange, and so on seem to do especially well. On the other hand, bright, ""warm"" colors like red, yellow, pink, and so on seem to be less popular on average. , Sometimes, the best selfies are ones that show you as you actually are. Posting a selfie without an obnoxious, overpowering filter can be a boost to your popularity if it helps convince others that you're not especially vain about your appearance. In fact, besides those with the ""Willow"" black-and-white filter, selfies with no filter at all have been found to be the most popular on average., You can sometimes get away with posting lots of selfies if the selfies themselves are shot in interesting ways. Playing around with the composition can help here — for instance, you might try to show off your amazing eyes by posting a close-up of your iris, or you might advertise the new lip gloss you're crazy about by posting a selfie that only captures your face from the nose down. It's up to you — there's no ""right"" way to take a creative selfie, so use your imagination!

Like other people's photos.,
Follow more users.,
Make the most of your current online connections.,
Be active in the Instagram community.,
If all else fails, beg for likes.",How to Get More Likes on Instagram without Hashtags3," Becoming successful on Instagram is a give and take process: if you like others' photos, then these users are more likely to notice you and like yours. Think about what you do when you get a notification that someone has liked one of your photos — odds are that at least some of the time you'll head to that user's page and check out their photos. Making an effort to like others' photos increases the chances they'll do this to you in return.


You can start by going to your followers' pages and liking your favorite photos among the most recent posts. However, you may not want to stop there — liking content from new users outside your list of followers is a great way to expand your Instagram visibility (plus, it can help you get new followers.)

, On Instagram, following someone else means getting more followers for yourself! The more people you follow (and interact with) on Instagram, the more people will have the chance to see and like your pictures. In addition, for profiles with restrictive privacy settings, you'll need to become a follower before you can start viewing photos, giving out likes, and making your presence known to the profile's other followers.


You don't just have to follow people you already know — following random users whose content you like can help you expand your reach (and keep your personal feed fresh and interesting at the same time.) Try browsing through the top photos in the ""Explore"" tab (which you can get to by pressing the button at the bottom of the screen that looks a little like a compass) and start following people who take photos you are interested in.

, If you're just starting out on Instagram, one of the quickest ways to boost your follower count (and start getting likes) is to find people on Instagram you already know from your other social media sites (like, for instance, Facebook.) To do this, head to your profile tab (tap the button in the bottom right of the screen that looks like the outline of a person) and head to your settings menu by tapping the button in the top right. Here, tap the ""Find Friends"" option to see your options for locating Instagram users from other social media sites you have associated with your mobile device.


Note that, if you're on a smart phone, you should also have the option to search for Instagram users in your phone's contact list.

, Maintaining a strong social media presence requires a time commitment. The more time you spend on Instagram liking photos and interacting with other users, the more likes you will receive yourself. As a general rule, spending about an hour total active on Instagram each day (spread evenly throughout the day) should help you start building your Instagram presence and earning more likes.


Recent data shows that the average Instagram user spends about 13-14 minutes on Instagram per day.Remember that, for the best chance of putting yourself ahead of the pack in terms of Instagram likes, it will help to have a greater level of engagement than this.

, It's not pretty, but sometimes outright asking for likes is a good short-term strategy for boosting the amount of Instagram love you get. Unfortunately, this sort of approach can be somewhat effective — research shown that Instagram content with hashtags like ""#follow"" and ""#likeforlike"" receive slightly more attention than content that doesn't.You can achieve the same effect without using hashtags by using the photo's caption or comments section to ask for likes.


Note, however, that it can be a bad idea to rely heavily on this strategy in the long run. Begging for likes is often seen as obnoxious or needy by Instagram users, so using this sort of poor Instagram etiquette can actually damage your reputation once you get a significant number of followers.

Post often, but not constantly.,
Post photos at high-traffic times.,
Consider giving your account a theme.,
Cross-promote yourself on other social networks.",How to Get More Likes on Instagram without Hashtags4," Ideally, to gain the most possible likes, you should try to post a steady stream of content most days (if not every day.) Posting about two or three photos a day (with at least a few hours between each photo) should ensure that most followers see something new from you every time they log in.


However, you won't want to post too frequently, especially if this forces you to post uninteresting content. Doing this can ""flood"" your followers' feeds with a high volume of mediocre photos, which may persuade them to unfollow you or

, You should try to avoid posting photos at a time when your target audience is fast asleep. A good policy is to try to post in the morning, during lunchtime, and/or around the end of dinner, as many people like to browse their social networks before their daily activities or during their downtime. This will usually ensure that you get the most exposure possible.


It's also a good idea to avoid posting on Friday or Saturday evenings, as most people are usually busy with their friends or family at these times.
If you're popular internationally, keep in mind that your followers abroad will usually have very different schedules than you due to time differences.

, Having a good theme or ""schtick"" can make it much easier for your Instagram to get popular and start racking in likes. Ideally, this theme should be something you're interested in — for instance, if you're involved in the world of muscle cars, car photography might be your thing, whereas if you're a dog trainer, you might make a name for yourself by posting cute pet videos. Your theme is not necessarily something you need to stick to 100% of the time, but having a theme is a good way to immediately create a potential audience for yourself.

, Why rely only on your Instagram presence to get likes for yourself? Posting your Instagram content to other social media sites you're active on is a great way to get it noticed fast and capitalize on the online presence you've already built up elsewhere.


Best of all, this is quite easy to do — just take a picture or video as you normally would, then, when you get to the page where you can write a caption for your content, simply click the buttons under the ""Share"" header to cross-post your Instagram content to other networks. If it's your first time doing this, you may need to supply your login credentials for these other sites.

Consider purchasing more likes.,
Consider paying for followers.,
Be aware of the professional/ethical hazards of buying popularity.",How to Get More Likes on Instagram without Hashtags5," If you're absolutely desperate to get likes fast, there's a market on the internet to meet your need. Try doing a search engine query for ""buy Instagram likes"" or similar terms — it shouldn't be hard to find relevant results. There are a variety of services that offer instant likes for a fee. Many offer different packages that you can choose from, depending on how many likes you want.


Note that, typically, in order for this set-up to work, you’ll need to make sure that your Instagram account is not private.
In general, buying likes in bulk gets you the best value per like, just like buying goods in the real world.

, It's also possible to buy large numbers of followers at once to instantly boost your Instagram visibility. Typically, the followers you buy will be ""bots"" (profiles created and run automatically by computer programs), but depending on the service you use, these ""fake"" followers may still be able to like your posts.

, It should go without saying that paying for likes or followers is usually seen as a shallow, borderline-unethical thing to do by most Instagram users. It's sometimes described as ""cheating"" one's way to visibility by using one's wealth (and not one's creativity) to achieve popularity. In addition, it can sometimes be a professional liability — some companies may be hesitant to endorse or partner with Instagrammers who became popular by paying for it.Be aware that it's not always hard for followers to figure out that you are buying likes or followers, especially if you buy a lot. If you're looking for it, it's easy to notice a sudden enormous upsurge in someone’s likes. If you're caught in the act, you may lose the favor of some of your ""real"" fans.

Make sure your account is public.,

Use Geotags.,
Space out your uploads.,
Filter wisely.,
Combine images to tell a story.,
Post your photos during peak times.,
Share only your best photos and videos.,
Follow others.",How to Get Followers on Instagram Fast1," Private accounts barely ever gain followers because only people you are friends with can find you. People will be unable to view your photos before becoming your follower, making your profile look dull and empty. To make an account public:


Click on the Profile button in the bottom right corner of the Instagram App.
Click ""Edit My Profile.""
Uncheck ""Posts are Private."" If you see the green button, then your post is private. Click this to set your account to public.;
, Hashtags allow you to search particular themes and view all the photos that have used a common hashtag. If you use the popular ones, other hashtag fans will end up seeing your photo linked to that hashtag and check out what you posted, especially if your photo is good. This will garner quick attention and help you gain followers quickly. Some of the most popular hashtags are:

, Geotag the uploaded photo with a location. Others in your location might be browsing for photos of nearby places, and as a result, your photo is more likely to be seen by those people.


On Instagram, every defined location has its own page. All photos taken at that location are accessible from that page, so anyone taking a photo of that same location will see yours on the location page as well as their own.Make sure to geotag the correct locations to maximize the chances of your photo being liked. Incorrectly geotagged photos can result in negative comments.
Do not geotag photos taken at your own home as the location will be visible to everyone.

, You might be tempted to think that rapidly filling your Instagram page with a bunch of photos will attract more followers, but quite the opposite is true. If you post too many photos at once, you will end up flooding the home pages of your followers. Non-followers will not want to follow you, and people who do currently follow you may change their mind and stop.


On average, post no more than one to three photos each day.

, Instagram offers a variety of filters, and as a general rule, you should apply them as they fit. There are a few popular filters in particular that may draw new followers to your page quickly. Make sure that the filter actually improves the photo before using it, and use popular filters. The ten most popular filters are:Normal
Earlybird
X-Proll
Hefe
Rise
Valencia
Amaro
Brannan
Lomo-fi
Hudson

, Create a better story by combining several photos into one. There are special programs that allow you to do this, and when done right, the end result produces a more engaging photo that can help you gain more followers.


You can use a photo-editing app to do this, or you can use an app (like Apple's Pic Stitch) that is specifically designed to stitch your photos together: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch/id454768104?mt=8

It's not merely enough to stitch a few photos together. You need to use photos that are all connected to each other so that they tell a short, intriguing story.

, An Instagram photo has a lifespan of three to four hours before it disappears into the Instagram community. If you post while the largest number of people are on, you are more likely to get random viewers and potential followers than you would at other times of the day.


The two most popular times of the day are in the morning and after work lets out.
The most popular time of the week is Wednesday between 5 PM and 6 PM.2:00pm-3:00pm, central time, is another active rush period on Instagram.
Every Instagram account has a different audience. Work out what times get you the most amount of interactions and post regularly at those times.

, The key to Instagram success is both quality and quantity. The photos you post should only be of the best quality, and they should come often enough to be entertaining, but not too often, so you're an annoying presence. If you post low-quality photos, people are less likely to be impressed and may not take you seriously.


If someone stumbles upon your profile, he or she will likely make a first impression on the first photo that appears, which will be your most recently added one. If that most recent photo is impressive, it can entice your new viewer to stay and maybe even follow your Instagram account. If the most recent photo is shaky and blurry, and of a bootleg sandwich you ate, the rest of your profile will probably be ignored.

, Follow random users in the ""suggestions for you"" section.

Approximately one-third of those you randomly follow (give or take) will likely follow you back.
Due to the maximum of 7,500 followers, it is recommended that you continue to follow those who follow you as a courtesy, then unfollow those who don't follow you. Don't follow too many random users at once because you will lose track.
Give others a fair chance to follow you. No one is online all the time.
To make more room to follow others, unfollow those who have posted nothing in a long time who seem to have stopped posting altogether. They won't miss you as a follower.

"
"
Follow as many users as possible.,
Update your account once a day to avoid losing followers.,
Join a micro-community or two.,
Follow like-for-like and follow-for-follow accounts.,
Use the Tag for Likes app.,
Follow and unfollow celebrities repeatedly.,
Use Instagram bots to find people likely to follow you.",How to Get Followers on Instagram Fast2," One of the quickest ways to attract the attention of other Instagram users is to begin following them first. Some may return the favor, while others will not. In general, though, following more users will often get more users following you back.


Look for popular users, as well as users who follow many more people than they have followers. These people may want to bulk up their number of followers, and will follow you back. Just dont expect many interactions to come from these accounts.

, Followers are lost because of one of two mistakes: posting too much, or not posting enough. People regularly cycle through their list and unfollow boring accounts or inactive accounts, so a good rule of thumb is to make sure that you update your account with entertaining content at least once a day.


It's also common for people to unfollow users who post too much. If you're following thousands of people, your feed might refresh constantly, but people who only follow a few hundred people get a flood of your pictures, which quickly gets annoying.

, Micro-communities are accounts on Instagram that involve a wide range of users by sponsoring daily challenges and offering forums. By becoming actively involved in a micro community, you can quickly introduce yourself to other Instagram users. Best of all, these users are eager to be active on Instagram, so they can be more likely to follow new users.


For instance, the @joshjohnson #JJ community offers daily challenges and forums. If you tag your photos with the #JJ hashtag and follow the 1-2-3 rule of the community, you can easily gain new followers. The basic rule is:

For every photo you post, comment on two others and like three more.



, You're not the only one on Instagram who wants more followers. There are lots of users who'll advertise their desire for gaining followers by putting ""like for like"" or ""follow for follow"" in their bio or in their pictures. There are a variety of hashtags associated with follower-gathering accounts, and they're often changing, so keep an eye out for new ones. To find users who are actively seeking followers, browse hashtags like:


likeforlike
like4like
l4l
followforfollow
follow4follow
f4f
ifollowback
teamfollowback

, This is an app geared towards getting you more likes and followers. It generates hashtags that you can copy and paste into the caption bar, then all you have to do is wait for people that are searching for those hashtags to follow you. ""Tag for Likes is an increasingly popular way for people to gain lots of followers quickly.


New follower-gaining apps and techniques are always coming out. Keep an eye out for new ways to connect and for updates to the older, established apps.

, People often look for followers on the follower lists of big celebrities, just following a few hundred of the most recent followers on a given account. One little trick commonly used is in following and unfollowing very popular celebrities repeatedly, thereby keeping your name at the top of the ""Recent Followers"" list. You can gain lots of followers fairly quickly using this ploy.


Kim Kardashian, One Direction, Justin Bieber, and Instagram itself have some of the most popular accounts.
Technically, doing this is against policy and can result in your account being suspended, so use the technique judiciously.

, These programs, though they violate Instagram user agreements, are fantastic ways to find followers. They let you search for similar users, and the bot likes their pictures. As a result, a certain percentage of viewers will click on your page and follow you as a result. Search for ""Instagram Follower Macros"" to get started.


The website ""Blackhat"" has a collection of frequently-updated macro scripts.

Find a niche to fit into.,
Like and comment on others' photos.,
Caption with a call to action.,
Connect to your other social media accounts.,
Start a fan page, then link it to your personal account to get followers.,
Ask for shoutouts from popular friends.",How to Get Followers on Instagram Fast3," It is much harder to get followers if people don't know what they are following. Celebrities can get away with posting stuff from their day-to-day life, most people don't care what you are eating for breakfast. If you can tap into a specific market, from food to pets to outdoor photography, you can attract a tonne of followers who love the same thing.

, Your chances of attracting attention from other Instagram users increase even further if you are actively and meaningfully engaged with their photos. Liking a photo is better than nothing, but comments generate the most return feedback.


Sometimes you'll snag a person after leaving a comment on that individual's photo. Even if this does not happen, though, there is also a chance that someone else might see the comment you left on that photo and check out your Instagram as a result.
It's estimated that every second, Instagram users create 575 new likes and only 81 new comments. A comment is viewed as more special or more precious, so it tends to be valued over a like.
Start conversations with strangers in the comment stream of other people's photos. If you engage someone by tagging them and complimenting them and then follow them, it's likely they'll follow you back.
Keep your comments positive and take your time to write a longer comment. This will make them more interested in checking out your account.

, When you add a caption to a photo, provide a clear “call to action” to engage viewers and prompt them to comment. Once a viewer comments, the lines of communication have been opened, and you can nurture the new Instagram relationship until it produces a follower. Good examples include:


""Double tap if this made you laugh!""
""Comment with a witty caption.""
""If you're happy and you know it, double tap!""
""Which should win? Choice A or Choice B? Comment to vote!""

, In particular, you should connect your Instagram account to your Facebook account. That way, you can quickly connect to Facebook friends who also have Instagram and rapidly gain followers that way.


After you connect your Instagram to Facebook, you can ""auto-follow"" all your Facebook friends. This, in turn, encourages your Facebook friends to follow you back, ensuring a rapid rise in your followers on Instagram.
You can also advertise your Instagram account on other social media platforms, like Twitter, Pinterest, or your personal blog. You cannot directly link the two, but the advertisement will help you reach out to people you are already connected to.

, If you're a big fan of a particular movie, show, comic, book, or entertainer, try making a fan account. With so many people posting selfies and personal stuff, Instagram can get a little crowded. Tribute pages tend to stand out a bit more, and they have the potential to gain lots of followers quickly. Popular fandoms for Instagram:


Pop stars like Bieber, Katy Perry, Beyonce, or One Direction
Any anime series
Webcomics like Homestuck, Paradox Space, Paranatural
TV Shows like Sherlock, Supernatural, Doctor Who, Once Upon A Time, Arrow, Merlin, or Torchwood
Popular books like Game of Thrones, Maze Runner, Harry Potter, The Fault In Our Stars

, Try asking your friends for ""shoutouts"", which is when someone on another account asks their followers to follow you. Popular accounts set up shoutout competitions, and if you get a shoutout on a popular account, you often gain many followers quickly.


You can offer to trade a shoutout on your Instagram account in return for one on theirs. Use the hashtags #shoutout4shoutout and #s4s to find users willing to do the exchange.

Pick a couple of your favorite filters.",How to Get 1k Followers on Instagram," One of the best ways for you to gain followers is to start liking photos related to your posts - as many as you can. Scroll down through your home feed and like some of your friend's photos. Hopefully the ones who aren't following you back already will now start following you.


Go to the ""explore"" page and take a look at the most popular photos. Like some or all of them, as these accounts tend to have lots of followers and some of them might just follow you.
Next, search for photos of people, things or places you're interested in, using hash tags. For example, if you want to see pictures of the Eiffel Tower, type in #paris, #loveparis or just #eiffeltower.Pick a hashtag that has a lot of posts. Like as many of the photos that don't have many likes. This will possibly gain you followers.
A third option, and one reserved for people who want a lot of followers fast is to search for some of the most popular tags, such as #followme #like4like or #instadaily. Now just scroll through all of the pictures in that feed, double tapping to like as you go.
Do this with multiple tags, until you've liked about a thousand pictures. It may seem kind of extreme, but if you do this everyday you are guaranteed to see your number of followers rise rapidly - - setting you firmly on your path to 1K followers.;
, Not only should you start liking people's pictures, you should also start commenting on them.


This provides more of a personal touch, and people will be so flattered with your nice comments that they'll be more inclined to follow you!
You won't be able to comment on all the pictures you like, but try doing it for as many as possible. It doesn't have to be an essay - something as simple as ""nice pic!"" or ""love this"" can work just fine.
However, an even more personal comment is more effective - something like ""I really love the lighting in this picture - good work!"" or ""I love your hair - wish I could get mine to look like that!"". Remember, people - flattery will get you everywhere.

, Although Instagram is 90% pictures, it's important not to forget about the power of words. Captioning your photos with funny, clever or unique comments or questions can be a great way to engage with your followers and also gain new ones.


Give a little explanation of what the picture is about, or what inspired it. Or else you can simply state where the picture was taken. Keep it to a couple of sentences though - people are lazy and will probably skim over it if it's too long.
Ask questions, as these will encourage other people to comment on your posts, which looks good to potential followers. It could be something simple like a picture of a new coffee shop in town with the question ""Anyone been here yet?"" Or you could post a picture of two different pairs of shoes and ask your followers which you should wear today.
Include CTAs (Calls To Action) in your posts. For example, if you posted a picture of your cat in an awkward pose you could say something like ""I want to see all of your crazy cats - use the tag #awkwardcats"". This will encourage your followers to take their own pictures and use your hashtag.

, You can't expect people to follow you if you never post any photos, so it's important to be really active on Instagram and to stay in tune with current trends.


Post between 1 and 3 photos a day, this should keep your audience engaged and make sure there is always something of yours in their feed.
However, you shouldn't post pictures just for the sake of posting pictures - they should all be beautiful and unique in their own right. See tips for for taking good pictures in Part 4 below.
Don't post too many pictures per day and avoid posting more than one picture at a time. This can clog up your followers' news feeds, which many people don't like.
And if they get sick of your constant posting, they might decide to unfollow you - which is the last thing you need when you're trying to hit 1K followers!

, You might take the coolest, funniest or most beautiful picture ever - but if you post it at a time of day when no one's online, you limit the number of people who get see it and significantly reduce your chances of gaining new followers.


Think about your followers and their patterns - most people check their Instagram in the morning, before school or work and in the evening on their commute home, when they're stuck on a train or in a traffic jam.
Therefore, if you post at these times (in the relevant timezone) you are much more likely to get attention for your pictures.
According to a survey conducted by Simply Measure, the peak time to post on Instagram is on Wednesday evenings between 5pm and 6pm, as this is when most users are active.You can also use apps like Statigram to find out the peak hours of Instagram usage among your followers, which can help you figure out when to post content.
Bear in mind that any post has a window of about four hours to pick up likes, comments and followers, before the post gets buried in people's news feed.

, Another technique for gaining followers is to get shoutouts, and the best way to do this is to give shoutouts yourself. However, a shoutout will also cause a lot of people to unfollow.


A shoutout is essentially drawing attention to another person's account by mentioning them in a post and asking your own followers to follow them. This exposes that person to a whole new group of potential followers that they would never have reached otherwise. The idea is that once you do this for someone, they will return the favor.
The ideal situation would be for a celebrity, a major brand, or someone with thousands of followers to give you a shoutout as this can majorly increase your Instagram cred and your number of followers. Unfortunately, it's pretty rare for this to happen, however, through using websites such as QuickShouts and Klout you can pay IG celebrities to promote your page. However, don't spam or beg larger accounts for shoutouts. This is very annoying and would lower your chances of getting a shoutout.
To give someone a shoutout, all you need to do is mention them in a comment. For example, if someone's username is ""catlover"" you just need to write something like ""this picture is for @catlover - follow her!"" in a comment.
But if you want to give a really great shoutout, you can take a screenshot of the person's user profile and post that screenshot on your own Instagram, telling your followers why they should follow them. This is great advertisement for that user's account.
If you want to receive shoutouts, the best thing to do is to find a user (preferably one who posts content related to your own) and comment underneath their photos. Ask for a #shoutout and say something like ""follow me and I'll follow back"".

, Follow random users in the ""suggestions for you"" section.

Approximately one-third of those you randomly follow (give or take) will likely follow you back.
Due to the limit on the ability to follow 7500 users, it is recommended that you continue to follow those who follow you as a courtesy, then unfollow those who don't follow you.
Don't follow too many random users at once because you will lose track.
Give others a fair chance to follow you. No one is online all the time.
To make more room to follow others, unfollow those who have posted nothing in a long time who seem to have stopped posting altogether. They won't miss you as a follower.

, The accounts which tend to get the most followers are generally those which stick with a particular theme. Accounts posting just about your life (a ""personal"") won't gain much unless you have a particularly interesting account. Consider finding a theme more people could relate to.


This is because the people who follow your account know that they are guaranteed to see pictures of things they are genuinely interested in, rather than a bunch of weird or random pictures.
So if there's something you have a passion for, consider using it as a theme for your Instagram account. Some popular themes include food, fitness, animals, photography, fashion and inspiring quotes.
Of course, you don't have to pick a theme. Some accounts are popular precisely because they post cool pictures of weird and random things. So if you have an eye for a good shot, you can take cool pictures that people will appreciate, regardless of the subject matter.
You should also be aware that it's possible to have more than one Instagram account - so if you want, you could use one account for your personal pictures and one for exclusively posting pictures of your dog, or whatever.

, Your username and profile pic are the second thing you need to decide on when creating an account.


Make sure that your username and profile pic are relevant to the theme of your account, as this will give your followers a good idea of what to expect from your account before they even visit your page.
For example, if your account is about fitness you could use a picture of yourself in your workout gear, or if it's about architecture you could use an artsy picture of your favorite building.
If your account is just about you and your life, take a good selfie which perfectly sums up your personality - maybe you're wearing Mickey Mouse ears or crossing your eyes. No matter what, you should make sure to use a photo that you're audience will connect with.
The same goes for your username - make it relevant to the content of your account. Also try to avoid having too many underscores or x's in there , as it can make your account look spammy.

, Don't leave your bio empty - it's another important tool your potential followers will use when deciding whether to follow you or not.


Again, make it relevant to your account by telling users what they can expect. For example: ""Beauty Junkie. Expect pictures of fun fashion, hair, nails and makeup"".
Or you can just make it a quick snapshot of your personality, for example ""Chronic Giggler"", ""Coffee Fiend"" or ""Fitness Fanatic"".
You can also use your bio to advertise some of your favorite tags such as #Follow4Follow (more on that later) or shout out for shout out or your own personal hashtag - like a nickname or phrase that sums you up, and which you tend to include on all your pictures.
For example, if your name is Steve and you like to post party pictures, you might start using #partyboysteve as your own personal hashtag. If you're lucky, it might just catch on with your friends and followers!

, Now that your account is set up, you'll need to find some friends and other users to follow!


Go to the settings section of your user page and tap on the ""Find People to Follow"" option. Here you can import friends from your Facebook page and phone contacts.
This is a good idea as it will connect you with people you already know, who are more likely to follow you back. If you have lots of Facebook friends, this could help you to get your first hundred followers with almost no effort at all!
Next, tap on the ""Instagram Suggested"" option. This will give you suggestions on who to follow, based on the popularity of the featured accounts. Choose a few with content you like. You can also go to the ""Explore"" section and find people to follow using hashtags and usernames - this is the best way to find celebrity accounts to follow!
Remember that your want to have a lot more people in the ""Followers"" tally than you do in ""Following"" one. If you are following too many people it can clog your news feed and you might miss the pictures you're really interested in.
In addition, people like to follow people who have lots of followers already - so if they see you are following tons of people but are followed by hardly any yourself, they may be discouraged from following you.

, If you are an avid user of multiple social networks, then it's a good idea to sync your Instagram account with as many of them as possible.


This means that every time you post a picture on Instagram, it will also appear on your other accounts. This will provide a wider audience for your pictures and increase your potential for gaining new followers.
Go to the settings page on your Instagram account and tap on ""Sharing Settings"". This will bring up a list of the social networks you can link up with - including Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Tumblr and Flickr.
Tick the box beside each of the social networks you wish to sync with your Instagram account. You will be prompted to enter your username and password for each of them. Congratulations - your accounts are now synced!
Note that you can undo this at any time - all you need to do is uncheck the boxes.

, There are two schools of thought when it comes to using tags - some people believe that you should attach as many tags as possible in order to maximize the amount of people who see their photo, while others believe you should stick to just 2 or 3 relevant tags.


The people who advocate the ""less is more"" option believe that too many tags can look cluttered, spammy or even desperate. Plus, they believe that using just a couple of the most relevant tags is enough to get all the follows you need.
Which option you decide to go for is completely up to you, as it's just a matter of personal preference. If you do decide to go for just 2 or 3 tags, make sure they're spot-on and relate directly to the picture.
For example, if you post a picture of a sunset, you could say something like ""#beautiful #sunset and #sky""
Add the hashtags to the end of your description. That way people will be able to read your description when scrolling though your photos and won't just see a bunch of tags. This will make your account look less spammy.

, Another important way to get your pictures noticed is to use some of the most popular tags - these are the tags that are constantly trending and which will help to increase your account's visibility.


For example, if you're posting a picture of an animal or baby your photo will probably get a lot more likes if you use #cute (one of the all-time most popular Instagram tags) instead of tags like #adorable or #sweet - although, if you want you could just use all three!
Some other top tags include #love, #eyes, #nice, #tbt (Throwback Thursday), #beautiful, #girl, #happy, #me, #picoftheday, #instadaily and #follow.
Another trick people use is to post tags that aren't related to their pictures at all, but which are guaranteed to get them a lot of likes. For instance, #justinbieber, #katyperry and #onedirection are all extremely popular tags which people add to their posts in order to get likes and followers - even if their post has absolutely nothing to do with these musicians. This can be very effective - but is also frowned upon by a lot of people.

, TagsForLikes is an extremely popular app which speeds up the tagging process and maximizes the number of likes your posts get. It works by allowing you to copy and paste a list of 20 to 30 tags which are popular and trending that day.


To use the TagsForLikes app, download the app, start it up and select ""Popular"" from the home menu, then choose ""Most Popular"". You will be presented with a list of tags which are popular that day and geared specifically towards gaining likes and followers.
Copy the list of tags, then open up your Instagram and paste them into the comment box when you're posting a picture. Within minutes, you should see tons of likes and new followers rolling in!
After a couple of hours, you can go back to the TagsForLikes app and select the ""2nd Popular"" option from the list. This will give you a list of the next most popular list of tags.
Copy these and paste them in a comment beneath the original tags on your picture. You probably won't get as many likes or new followers this time, but you should at least get a few.
You should also consider going back and adding these tags to older photos, giving them a new lease of life!
Try to find popular tags that are relevant to your Instagram account. This will get more likes to your photos from people who may actually be interested in your account.

, If you like, you can create your own hashtag, or take one that's not used all that much and make it your own.


For example, if the theme of your account is baking and you love to post pictures of cute cupcakes and other delicious treats, you could make your personal tag #cupcakechick or something similar.
Then you should use this tag on every single one of your photos, in addition to including it in your bio.
If you're lucky, your tag will become popular with others and soon they'll start using it to tag pictures of their own baked goodies!
When this happens, you're bound to get lots of new follows from like-minded people who love baking (or whatever your theme is!).

, Geotagging your photos means including the location where the picture was taken in the post. Instagram can do this automatically when you enable GPS.


This is a great idea if you're taking pictures in a location that's perceived to be popular or cool, such as a hip new coffee shop, a well-known museum or a fancy restaurant. Other people who have posted pictures from these locations will then be able to see your post and maybe even follow you!
You can also geotag pictures in more general locations, such as New York, Paris or Rome. Thousands of people search for pictures of these locations everyday, so your post will be viewable by people from across the world!
Geotagging also helps to add authenticity to your account, making it more human by emphasizing the fact that you were really there.

, Try to make your photos as unique, yet relatable as possible.


This is easier said than done, but as a general rule, you should try to avoid taking photos of overdone subjects such as latte art or inundating your followers with #selfies - people are more likely to scroll over these types of photos than stop for a second look.
Instead, aim to take beautiful pictures that contain lots of emotion and/or potential for human connection, whether it's a picture of a blazing sunset over the sea or an old lady sitting on the bus.

, Natural light is the best light for showing off your pictures to the best advantage.


Even though most phones have flashes, taking pictures indoors or at night should be avoided as much as possible.
Try to shoot pictures outdoors (or at least beside a window) early in the morning, or in the evening before the sun sets. This is when the light is softest and prettiest.

, The human eye loves symmetry - whether you're shooting a face, a building or a landscape - so aim to make you shots as symmetrical as possible.


Imagine a vertical line dividing the screen of your phone in two - now try to center the subject of your photo on this line.
You may need to squat down or stand on something to get your perfect shot.

, If you're taking a picture of an object - like a teacup or an old record - make sure it is set against a plain background. If the background is too busy it will take focus away from the subject of your shot.

, Try to take photographs from a new or unusual perspective - maybe one that forces your followers to really study the photo in order to appreciate it.


Play around with angles - try pointing your camera up to look at treetops, roofs, birds or just the sky.
Or place your camera so close to a surface - the bark of a tree, the inside of a pomegranate - that it's hard to figure out exactly what you're looking at.

, Photo collage apps - such as InstaCollage or PicStitch - allow you to combine multiple photographs into a single post.


This is great if you want to post several related shots together - such as the appetizer, entrée and dessert from the same meal, or multiple shots from a single scenic drive.

, And last but not least, filters. One of the best things about Instagram is the option to add different filters to your photos to make them look more colorful, old-fashioned, exotic, beautiful or polished.


If your blog has a certain theme or style, it may be best to pick a selection of just 2 or 3 of your favorite filters and stick to using only them.
This helps to give a uniform style to your account, making it look more professional. This can influence a potential follower's decision to follow you if they come to look at your user page.

Follow a lot of official accounts.",How to Get 500 Followers on Instagram," If you want a “private account,” it’s going to be a lot harder to drive up followers because random people won’t be able to see it.


Take your account off private in the Instagram account settings in order to drive up your followers fast.
If you need a private account for some reason, you will have to use your contact lists from other social media and email in order to alert people that you have an Instagram and allow them access.;
, A lot of people are drawn to themed Instagram sites, which are basically Instagram sites that post mainly one type of photo.


Different themes include things like food, lifestyle, fashion, fitness, scenery, and architecture. Think about something everybody wants to know about or something that is irritating everyone or something that everybody wants to experience.
To find a theme that will drive up your popularity, you want to choose something that people relate to. Topics like losing weight, overcoming anxiety, being attractive, having nice skin, sports, playing guitar, and so on, can earn you a following.
Unless you’re a celebrity, people probably aren’t going to be very interested in a picture of your feet at the beach or pictures of the sky. Finding a theme that you have passion over and some expertise in, is a better approach. Make sure it's natural to you. People can tell when people fake an interest just because it's ""in."" Do what you love.

, First of all, your account has to be attractive for a certain audience. Spend some time defining that target audience in your own mind.


For example, a lot of soccer or sports accounts that follow and upload the latest news are followed by thousands or even millions of people because people want to know what is going on with their favorite team or sport while skipping through their everyday Instagram timeline.
If you determine your audience, you can consider the audience's interest when creating great content., Naming your page is quite easy, but you need to do it correctly. It’s a good idea if your name is reflective of your theme (or yourself if you are a personality).


Don't make the name difficult like a series of numbers or people will be less likely to type it or remember it. Have a short, simple, yet catchy username. People will find it easier to search you, and they will remember it.
Piggy backing on trends and choosing a name that people are already interested in can help drive up followers. However, never pretend to be someone you are not.

, The bio needs to be neat, catchy and short. Try to capture your theme in a way that will interest followers by making it clear exactly what they will get if they follow your page.


Put in a quote that is inspirational or just describe your account. The profile picture should be eye-catching and/or simple. To add a bio on your profile page, click ""edit your profile.""
Make sure the content relates to your account, as you do not want something that is totally irrelevant. Remember that language style on social media is a lot more conversational than you’d find in, say, the newspapers.
Include a call to action in your bio if you are a company or selling something. This is a sentence in which you urge the follower to actually do something (check something out, buy a product)., Editing your pictures is very important because you are trying to make them look the best that they can be. This can mean you shouldn’t over edit them, though. But do enhance them subtly. This will help draw followers.


You can use different photo-editing apps that are widely available for free online. Some things you could do to make your photos look better is to boost the brightness, use filters, and crop them.
Don't edit photos so much that they look doctored or obviously phony. Enhance what's already there very subtly. Be aware that some research has found that doctored photos don't do as well. So make any changes so subtly it's hard to tell they are there.

, Inactivity can make you lose followers. However, posting constantly every day can bore people too. So find the right balance.


Once a day is recommended by some people. Others post several times a week. You don't want to fill your site with new content on a daily basis.
Strive for thematic impact versus endless posts. Focus on content versus sheer quantity, but don't let your site go dormant for long periods of time (say over a week).

, Captions with your photos help explain them and showcase your personality. They’re really important, so work on keeping a consistent voice.


Put some hashtags relating to your picture in your captions. Hashtags are extremely important on Instagram. Hashtags are the way many people interested in similar topics will find your page.
For example, if you've posted a picture of a cat, you could use hashtags like #KittyCat #Paws #Cat. If somebody searches for that hashtag, finds your picture and likes it, they could become interested in your account and follow you.
You want to use hashtags that relate to the content you’re posting. To create a hashtag, use the ""#"" sign and then the word after it that relates to your photo. If you're a public user, look for popular hashtags such as the ones listed under the Trending Topics bar. Instagram allows as many as 30 hashtags per photo.
However, your hashtags need to be genuinely related to the post otherwise they falsely promote your page and clutters a user's search with irrelevant posts.

, Have unique pictures. Instagram is usually about pictures. The more unique your pictures are, the more people will like your account. Take them yourself. Start by building a portfolio that contains about 20 pictures that match your theme and are very high-quality.Good photos only have a person in one-third of them. In photography, this is called the rule of thirds. Position the person on one of the lines of thirds, as if you had divided the photo into equal thirds. The best filter for Instagram photos is Mayfair.Post your passion. Keep your Instagram account consistent by posting images of a similar nature. This way, you can target a specific audience who are more likely to follow you because their niche interest is met and know what to expect from your blog.
Users are also more likely to follow accounts that use high-quality images. So get a decent camera.
Delete photos that are inappropriate, or seem bad quality. If you're taking bad quality photos, no one will follow you. Set up some good lighting, preferably natural, and snap away until you find the perfect photo!, Although some filters and subtle enhancement can be effective at times (you don't want poor quality photos on Instagram), research has shown that non-manipulated photos sometimes get the most attention on Instagram.


Furthermore, the same study found that photos with lower levels of color saturation were also more popular.Gray, blue, and green photos were the most attention-getting on Instagram. Photos with faces in them received more likes.

, You can get shout outs from people by asking them for one. Don't hesitate to do this. It's a common practice on Instagram.


By giving people shout outs, and having people give you shout outs, you are both helping each other by notifying your current followers about their Instagram and vice versa.
A shout out just means you alert your followers to the fact they should check out the other person's site. It’s a basic rule of social media. If you give people attention, they are likely to return the favor.

, A smart social networking plan involves integrating all aspects of your “Internet footprint.”


You can link your Instagram account to your Facebook and other social networking platforms, which can then notify your friends/followers that you have an Instagram.
You could also just put a status or Tweets on your other social media platforms asking your followers to check out your Instagram page and follow you. Try to share your picture in every social media site you are on, such as Facebook, Twitter, Email, Tumblr, Flickr, Four Square.

, There are even hashtags that mean you will follow someone if they follow you back. For this purpose, use hashtags like #F4F, #TBT and #FBF to seek follows from strangers.


Go to ""search"" and then ""tags"" and type in ""likeforfollow"" or ""followforfollow"" and then like or follow the person that tagged that on their photo.
People you follow are likely to return the favor. Don't forget that most people on Instagram are trying to boost their audience, too. Some others include #FF (Follow Friday), #instafollow, #l4l (Like for like), #tagforlikes and #followback., There are various apps that you can link to your Instagram in which you can gain followers in exchange for liking or following other users.


Just search in your app store under “Instagram followers” to find examples of these.
This is a quick and easy way to help get your Instagram noticed. Most of the apps work in this way: You follow a user or like a photo and earn coins or tokens for liking or following a user. Then, you use those coins to submit your account/photo for a set amount of likes/followers from other people.
There is usually an option in these apps to buy coins or tokens instead. The downside is you will be gaining followers who drive up your raw numbers but aren’t invested in your content. So driving up followers with great content is a better approach to increase engagement and loyalty.

, There’s a good reason it’s called social “networking.” Social media, including Instagram, is not about just passively sticking things online and waiting for people to find them.


It’s about having conversations with other users. So go on their page. Comment on their photos. Follow people in order to get them to follow you back. Many people will return the favor. Strike up conversations.
Respond back if someone asks you a question or compliments you on your own page. If you are perceived as rude, people might unfollow you.
Follow and interact with people who are more popular on Instagram than you are. If they take notice of you, they can drive a lot of their traffic your way. Go to the list of followers on a site you like, and click/ tap on the box that says ""followers"" above the ""following"" bar. Once you get the list of all of that account's followers, you can click the blue ""follow"" button on a bunch of the account’s followers and have them follow you back.

, Official accounts are the accounts of celebrities and famous people or organizations.


When you follow official accounts, many times the fans of that particular account follow you.

Try creating an open fan page. This is a great way to gain followers. You could have a fan page following a specific celebrity or you could follow a type of person, such as rappers.


Follow your friends. When you follow your friends, they get the notification. If your friends are nice enough, they'll follow you back.

Take a photo worth sharing.,
Edit your photo.,
Add a catchy caption.,
Use hashtags.,
Get more followers.,
Consider asking followers to like your photo.,
Consider tagging other people in the photos.,
Share your photos at optimal times.,
Consider using an app to get more likes.",How to Get 100 Likes on an Instagram Photo," Instagram is all about the pictures, so taking a superb photo will attract the attention of your followers. With practice, it will get easier to take excellent shots, edit them for the best possible effect, and earn more Likes. Make sure not to post a million photos at a time, and stick to just posting a few photos each day, if you want to get the most out of each one.


Consider experimenting with filters, in particular, for a more dramatic effect.
Make sure any effects you add make your photo look better, not worse.
Avoid uploading constant selfies, or any other repetitive subject such as pictures of your food. Your audience will grow tired and your Likes will diminish.
Post photos of important events, such as engagements, graduations, trips, or other milestones.
People like photos with people in them, especially if they recognize themselves. Photos with a personal touch are likely to get more attention.;
, Instagram offers some minimal editing options: you can add blur effects, rotate or brighten your photo, or add a filter. Spending a little time editing a photo can turn a ""Good"" picture ""Incredible""! You don't want to overdo it so the photo looks so artsy that it's unrecognizable, but a bit of editing can really help your photos get more attention.


There are a variety of Instagram editing apps that allow you to get much more creative than the built-in editing features allow. Some of the more popular apps include Photo Editor by Aviary, Afterlight, Bokehful, Camera+ and Overgram.
You can also add brightness to your photos using the ""lux"" effect.
You can also use apps like Diptic to post more than one photo in one shot. Many followers like these fun photos, as long as you don't overdo this type of photo.

, Once you're satisfied with how your photo looks, click the ""greater than"" icon inside the blue box on the top right of your screen. You'll be able to add a caption. Captions can add a lot of life to the image, and a catchy caption can significantly increase the number of Likes you receive.


Pay attention to your captions. When you create a caption for your photo, it gives your followers something to connect to. Along with taking quality pictures and using hashtags strategically, composing witty and subtle captions are a crucial tool in your quest for Instagram dominance.

, Hashtags let you mark your photo with commonly searched tags. Simply place a pound side (#) right before a tag that corresponds to your picture – you can have up to 30 hashtags! Hashtags can help your photos reach a larger audience and will make it more likely for you to get more followers and more Likes.


For example, if you uploaded a picture of your drawing, then you could add hashtags like ""#art"", ""#drawing"", ""#illustration"", and ""#sketch"".
If you're stumped, you can always search Instagram for the most popular tags and copy some of those. However, if you only use the most popular tags, your photos are likely to get lost among the masses.
You can also use additional tag apps, which are available from the App Store or Playstore. These apps will give you the active trending hashtags for a given topic so that you can copy and paste those hashtags onto your post and reach as many people as possible.
You can periodically delete your hashtags and replace them with new ones, bypassing Instagram's limit of 30 tags and reaching new people.
Make sure your profile is public! Otherwise, it will not appear on the ""Tags"" feed.
Just make sure not to overdo it: just a few relevant tags will be much more appealing than having such a large number of tags that people will get distracted.

, The more followers you have, the more Likes you'll receive. Like and comment on other people's pictures, and they'll be more likely to like and comment on yours. This is a great way to increase the number of followers you have, which in turn will lead to more Likes in general.


The more people you follow, the more likely you are to have them follow you. Don't be shy about following people you don't know, though you should aim to follow many people that you do know as well.
One way to increase your following is to integrate your other social networks with Instagram. When you link to your Facebook and Twitter accounts, you get to duplicate your posts and cover all your bases. Friends on those accounts can then follow you on Instagram as well.
Of course, the more people you know, the more people you can follow. Put yourself out there socially and make new friends at work or school. This can help you have more people to follow—as well as more people who are actually invested in the photos that you post.

, In the comment box, you can mention the usernames of some of your followers and ask them to like your photo.


Use this tactic with care. It can come across as annoying. In general, it's better to mention the names of people you know personally.
Remember that you can delete these comments once you've received enough Likes.
Some people even comment ""like for like?"" on other people's photos to get even more likes.

, Post photos with a few of your friends in them so you can tag your friends and reach out to more people and get more likes. You can tag people with many followers in your photo, making it more likely that other Instagram users will see and like it.


Again, use caution. Tagging people can be annoying, and it can be reported as inappropriate.
Remember that you can untag people once you're satisfied with the number of Likes you have received.
Ideally, you should only tag people if they are actually in your photo; if you really want to get those likes, then you can tag a few people who aren't in the photo, especially if it is relevant to those people (for example, if you're visiting your old high school, you can tag a photo of it with the names of a few of your old classmates).

, You should upload your photos at times when the most people are likely to be looking at Instagram since your photos will be the most active during the first few hours. This is usually around lunchtime as people get bored at work, or after dinner. If you post your photos too early, most people won't see them because they'll be getting ready for work or just starting their days. However, if you post too late, then people will likely be winding down and getting ready for bed.


Avoid posting images late at night, as very few people will likely see them and they will quickly get bumped off feeds in the morning.
You should also try to post your photos during the week, not the weekend, when people are more likely to be out doing stuff.
Be active after you post your photos. If you're commenting on other photos and liking them, people are more likely to notice your photos.

, There are many apps out there that can help you get more likes, such as Wow Likes, Likestagram, Like Hero, Like Rush, and Tags for Likes. Though they don't all work the same way, the idea is that you can earn some likes for your photos by liking other people's photos. However, you don't want to resort to paying for likes and should work on getting them naturally if you want.


Remember that it's not the end of the world if you don't have 100 likes on one of your photos. That doesn't make it any less meaningful!

, You will notice a number of buttons on the main screen. If at any time you're having issues with the game, go to the main screen and tap Help, which is on the top row of buttons. The number of stamps and potions you have is visible in the top left corner, your XP points and level are in the top right corner, and your coins are in the bottom left corner.


Catalog: When you tap a frog, one of the options is to add it to your catalog. By adding it to your catalog, that kind of frog will always be available to you to buy. However, frogs in the catalog are more expensive, and you can only have 50 frogs in your catalog.
Awards: Throughout the game, you will have opportunities to earn various awards. Some of the awards are based on the number of frogs you own, how many you have, or the types of frogs you own. Awards are a quick way to earn XP and coins, as well as level up quickly.
Requests: Every now and then you will get a small pop up window, asking for a certain type of frog. If you have that kind of frog, tap ""send,"" and you will receive the written prize. If you don't, just press decline. A new request will come in soon. Although sometimes, at the beginning of the game, you don't have much space and it might be easier to just breed for that frog.
Supply Shop: This is where you buy backgrounds and scenery for your frog habitats. Avoid this! When you are in the Pond, you will often find backgrounds and scenery for free, so don't waste money in the shop.
Pro Shop: This uses real money. You can buy potions and stamps here.
FrogMart: You can buy different or rare frogs here. The frogs being sold change often, so check back daily. When you level up, new frogs are available.
Daily Gift: You can receive one gift every day! You might get coins, stamps, potions, or shippable gifts such as frogs, backgrounds, and decorations.
Mailbox: When you order items from the catalog, supply shop, FrogMart, or find things in the Pond, they go into your Mailbox. It can only hold 8 things, so empty it often!
Neighbors: If you're on a wireless network, this will show you who is playing Pocket Frogs near you. You can view their habitats and send them gifts, as well as challenge them to races.
Froggydex: There are thousands of breeds to be unlocked. The Froggydex shows you which ones you have encountered, and what percentage of all available frogs you have collected. You can ""clone"" frogs you have already owned from the Froggydex, but it is 10 times as expensive as the maximum value of the frog.
Sets: Every Wednesday at midnight, a new set of frogs is released. If you get this set of frogs and redeem them, you will get a prize! The prize is usually coins, or stamps and potions. It can be much easier to do precisely the same thing by frog requests rather than sets, since the sets are the same for everyone all over the place, however, the requests are different, so requests will always be possible, but sets can sometimes be out of your level range.

, They are in a habitat with a simple dirt background. Resist the urge to buy a new background and scenery! It's easy to find new stuff in the Pond. If you tap the green Menu button in the corner of the habitat, you will see the habitat you were just in as well as a Nursery. When you breed frogs, the eggs stay in the Nursery until they hatch. You can then move the frogs to another habitat.

, If you didn't tap the correct frog, use the arrow buttons on either side of the frog's picture to navigate through all your frogs. You will see some stats, some brown and green buttons, and a message that says, ""Tame in pond for more options."" Tap the Pond button.

, There will be a small red bar at the top of the screen that says ""Flies to Tame"" and then a number. You must catch that number of flies before you leave the Pond to unlock more options for that frog. The number you must catch varies depending on the level of the frog you're trying to tame.
To catch flies, just jump from lily pad to lily pad when there is a fly in your flight path. If the frog and the fly ""hit"" mid-jump, the frog has caught the fly.
To open a present, jump on the lily pad that has the present. It will open automatically. If it's coins, it will be added to what you have. If it's an object or a frog, you can choose if you want it. If your mailbox is full, you can't keep it! If the present contains a frog, take it even if you really don't want it. You can sell it later for extra coins.
The Pond is essentially never ending. Keep moving in one direction (i.e. keep tapping lily pads on the bottom of the screen) to explore as much of the Pond as possible.
Stay in the Pond for a while to maximize gift collecting. Awards #15 and #57 require you to collect two gifts and two rare gifts in one trip to the Pond, respectively.
Going to the Pond and catching flies will also help young frogs mature more quickly. Catching flies also increase the frog's happiness.
Before you go to the Pond, make sure you have room in your Nursery (in case you decide to breed with a frog you find in the Pond) and your Mailbox (in case you find shippable gifts.)

, Jump on the lily pad that has the other frog. This may take some patience,because the other frog sometimes runs away! When a window pops up, tap the yes button to breed. An egg will be placed in the Nursery and you'll get some XP. It should be the same amount of coins you spent to breed.
Breed with frogs you find in the pond as often as possible; you can often find rarer breeds that aren't available to you yet. Sometimes, the best thing to do is bring an Anura or some other low level to the pond to breed with a higher level, so that it doesn't cost as much, and if you get the higher level frog, you can get much more than you paid for to resell it. This can be a risk though, because if you get the lower level, you could lose as much as 1,500 coins.
To breed two frogs in the same habitat, they must also be tamed adults. Tap one of the frogs and press the Breed button. The screen will show you all available frogs to breed with. Select a frog and press Breed.
The Nursery is a lot like the mailbox in that you can only have 8 eggs or frogs in the Nursery before it's considered full.

, Rare frogs are worth a lot more. To maximise your profit, bring the frog's happiness bar up to 100% before you sell. Frogs can be made happy by catching flies in the Pond, or by playing the puzzle game. If you have decorations in the frog's habitat, these will make the frog happy as well.


Tame each frog before you sell it so you get some more XP points.
Making the frog happy before you sell it may seem like a waste of time, but not doing so causes you to lose money. Let's say you have 8 identical frogs that you bought in order to fulfill an award. Each frog is worth 200 coins. You decide to sell them all before they are completely happy, and you make 150 coins off of each frog. This results in a total profit of 1,200 coins. However, if you brought each frog to the Pond before you sold it, you could have made 1,600 coins.

,


The majority of the awards ask you to collect 8 mature frogs of the same species in one habitat. Pretend that right now, you only have one of that frog. There are two ways to do this.

First, add that frog to your catalog. Go to the catalog and buy another one. After it is delivered, place it in the habitat with the first frog.
This is where the choice comes in: would you rather spend time or coins?
If you want to spend the coins and get the award quickly, go back to the catalog and buy as many more frogs as you need.
If you want to spend the time, and get more XP points, breed those two frogs as many times as needed. You will have to move all of those frogs from the nursery into the new habitat, and you'll have to wait for them to mature before you can get the award. To make them mature quickly, you can take them to the pond, or you can also use potions if you have them.
Once you've achieved the award, sell those frogs.
If you're having an issue finding the correct frog, you can breed it. For example, if you need a Yellow Tingo Anura for award #4, you can breed any color Anura with any pattern Yellow Tingo frog. It may take a few tries, but eventually you will have the frog you are looking for.



, Racing frogs is another great way to earn coins fast. Tap a frog, make sure its happiness meter is up to 100% and press the race button. Select a frog that has higher numbers listed under Speed and Stamina. There is an entrance fee to race, but if you come in first or second place, your prize will be bigger than the entrance fee was. If you come in first place, you can either accept the coin reward, or you can take one of your opponents' frogs. You can also take more than one by tapping 2 or more frogs at once, but just make sure you roll your fingers off of them, to prevent possible corrupting. Now you just have to tap 'yes' when the box comes up, just make sure you have space for any of the ones you're getting in your mailbox.

, They help you to level up quickly by giving you XP points. The awards aren't complicated; it's just sometimes difficult to find the specific frog they need.

, Many of the scenery pieces help to keep your frogs happy and the backgrounds just make them look nice. However, if you're really broke, you can also sell a few of your decorations, but because they do help with happiness, only do this if you're actually stuck.

, This will make the Prion infection harder to cure, which will help immensely as it spreads later in the game., Aquacyte will help get Greenland infected, which is one of the most difficult places for the infection to reach., This will help your gene cross closed borders by quickly infecting major urban centers., Sympto-Stasis will lower the cost of symptoms, allowing you to quickly reach the symptoms that will help you the most. It makes the disease easier to cure, but you'll be making it lethal that the last second, which will kill everyone before a cure can be found. This strategy relies on building a large list of symptoms quickly., These are the most popular starting countries for Prion, and will result in the best spread for your infection., In this initial portion of the game, you'll want to focus on symptoms that will spread your disease, as they'll be cheaper than purchasing transmission upgrades. Focus on getting the following symptoms as soon as you can:

Rash
Nausea
Sweating
Vomiting
Cysts
Hyper Sensitivity
Abscesses
Coughing
Pneumonia
Sneezing

, Upgrade the following three transmissions to help get your infection spread to Greenland and Madagascar:

Water 1
Air 1
Water 2

, The following abilities will help ensure that you are able to get Greenland, which is the country that this plan hinges the most on, as well as some other wealthy countries like Monaco and Sweden:

Cold Resistance 1
Cold Resistance 2
Heat Resistance 1
Drug Resistance 1
Drug Resistance 2
Genetic Hardening 1
Genetic Hardening 2

, If any evolutions occur, devolve them to prevent your disease from become too deadly or too noticeable. You'll also get a small DNA bonus.

Make sure to devolve any symptoms immediately, or your disease may get noticed sooner than you're ready for., The symptoms below will help increase the infectivity of your disease, which will give you more DNA to work with:

Pulmonary Oedema
Skin Lesions

, The following symptoms will help slow down work on the cure:

Insomnia
Paranoia
Seizures
Paralysis
Coma

, Evolve the following three abilities to put a big hamper on the cure efforts:

Neural Atrophy 1
Neural Atrophy 2
Neural Atrophy 3

, This symptom will start killing off the hosts, but not too quickly as to end your game. it will also boost your infectivity., This will drop the progress of the cure back a few percentage points., The cure will move quickly towards the end, so you'll want to set it back if it reaches 25% or so before you move on to the final few steps.

If you are running low on DNA points, you can skip Genetic Reshuffle 2. You should never need Genetic Shuffle 3.

, If you haven't yet, you'll want to wait until every country is infected before you turn your disease into a killing machine.

When the last country is infected, wait until it has about 10,000-15,000 people infected before moving on.

, Make sure your last infected country already has 10,000-15,000 people infected before you evolve this symptom. This is going to start killing people off very quickly., This will help ensure that the disease continues to spread as it is killing people.

You'll need to have either Diarrhea or Insanity in order to get Dysentery.

, This symptom will increase the lethality of your disease as you rush towards the end., If you were successful, the entire world should be infected shortly, with death catching up soon after. You can speed things up by getting more symptoms, or evolve Genetic Reshuffle to slow the cure if necessary."

Continue engaging with your community.",How to Get 100 Followers on Instagram," Evidence suggests that for every 100 photos you like, you'll gain approximately six followers. Taking this engagement one step further by commenting, while time-consuming, will improve your chances of receiving a follow back.Following other accounts will also achieve a similar effect.;
, Doing so will keep users who follow you entertained.

, Especially when you're starting out, Instagram users may grow disinterested and unfollow your account in a day or less if you don't actively respond to their comments.


This level of engagement, similarly to the mass liking of other people's photos, is incredibly time-consuming. You may even need to set aside an hour or two each day dedicated to engaging your followers.

, You can do this from within Instagram's Settings menu. Adding a social media account (such as Facebook) to your Instagram's information will extend your posts' availability to social media users who don't use Instagram or don't know that you have an Instagram account.


For example, linking your Facebook account to your Instagram account will alert any Instagram-using Facebook friends that you're on Instagram. As a result, they may decide to follow you.
Once you've linked a social media account to your Instagram, you'll have the option of posting your Instagram photos to both Instagram and the linked account (e.g., Twitter) simultaneously. Doing this will increase the number of people who can see your photos.

, Winning a contest will boost your account's visibility, thereby resulting in an increase in followers. A couple of prominent community contests include the following accounts:



JJ Community - Every day, this account posts a new theme. You submit a photo in relation to the theme, and an account moderator selects the best one. Keep in mind that over 600 thousand people follow this account, so you'll need to compete with a large number of users.

Contestgram - After downloading the Contestgram app from your phone's respective app store, you'll be able to submit entries for daily contests. Contestgram, like JJ Community, is a community-driven project.
Participating in daily contests is a good way to ensure you upload a high-quality, well-thought out photo at least once a day, and the themed aspect will help focus your intent while taking photos.

, You can reference a list of the top 100 trending hashtags to get started, or you can simply experiment with different tags to see which ones generate the largest number of likes.


Some popular hashtags include ""photooftheday"", ""instaphoto"", ""nofilter"", and ""followforfollow"" (or ""f4f"").

, You can do this while adding the description to your photo during the upload process by selecting Add Location and following the steps. Adding a location to your photos will prompt your photo to show up when others search for that location.


This process is known as ""geotagging."" In order to avoid conflict, don't geotag your home's location or an area different than that in which the photo was taken.

, The most popular times for checking Instagram vary per day, but posting at 2 A.M. and 5 P.M. EST is, on average, the best way to ensure that a large number of people will see your post.9 A.M. and 6 P.M. EST are regarded as the worst times to post.

, Consistency is both the most important aspect of appealing to Instagram users and the most difficult process to maintain. To solve this problem, there are a variety of apps for both iOS and Android platforms that will allow you to schedule your Instagram posts in advance.


""Latergramme"", ""Schedugram"", and ""TakeOff"" are all well-reviewed choices for Instagram post managers., People like to feel included in your process, so make them a part of it by tagging followers in your posts, continuing to upload often, and responding to community feedback. As long as you practice these techniques consistently, you'll have 100 followers on Instagram in no time.

, When you've found the search bar on either the Explore tab or the Profile tab, click it and type in your search query. If you're looking for a specific person, this should be his or her username or real name.


If, on the other hand, you're looking for someone you don't already know, you can just type in a keyword of your choice and Instagram will attempt to find users with that word in their name or user information.
Finally, you can also select the ""Tags"" option at the top of the screen and type in a search query to find posts that have been hashtagged with the same terms. For example, a ""Tags"" search for ""hip hop"" will find thousands of posts that have been labeled with the tag ""#hiphop"" or something similar. This is a good way to find users with similar interests as you.

Log in at Instagram.com.,
Scroll through your feed looking for new names.,
Navigate directly to Instagram.com/.,
Use a third-party site.",How to Find People on Instagram5," While it's possible to access your Instagram account from any web browser, the online version of Instagram is actually surprisingly limited in its features. In fact, the only way to ""find"" people with the browser version of Instagram is to use workarounds that you wouldn't need to bother with on the mobile version. To get started, enter your Instagram login information at Instagram.com., One of the first things you'll notice about the browser version of Instagram is that there is no convenient search bar at the top of the page for finding new users. You have access to your personal feed, but not much else. You can, however, follow new users by finding comments or likes by them that appear in your feed, clicking on their username to view their profile, and finally clicking the ""Follow"" button under their profile picture.


For example, if you're scrolling through your feed and you see a post by a friend that has a comment from someone you aren't currently following, you can click this person's name to view his or her profile, then, if you'd like, you can follow them by clicking ""Follow"" on their profile page.

, If you know another Instagram user's username, you can also visit their profile page directly by typing its address into the navigation bar at the top of your browser. The format for Instagram profiles is ""instagram.com/"" — simply replace with the person's actual username. Remember not to include any spaces.


For instance, to get to the profile page of the Instagram user ""MikeyP98054,"" you'd type ""instagram.com/mikeyp98054"" into your address bar.

, Because the browser version of Instagram is so skimpy in terms of features, a few third-party sites have sprung up to make it easier to find other Instagram users online. Usually, these sites allow you to type the user's name into a simple search bar like you would on the mobile version. The site then displays a list of relevant users — once you find the person you're looking for, you can then either follow this person using the third-party site's interface, navigate to his or her page directly with the directions in the step above, or find them on your mobile device.


One good third-party site to start with is Websta.me (formerly Webstagram.) This site allows you to easily search Instagram users with a simple, no-frills search bar. Best of all, you can follow and unfollow users in the app if you supply your Instagram login details."

Choose an Instagram monitoring site to use.,
Create an account.,
Click ""Who Unfollowed Me."",
Optionally, check out the other features of your new account.,
Refresh your stats to stay up to date.",How to Find Out Who Unfollowed You on Instagram1," Believe it or not, there are many sites on the internet that allow you to easily to figure out when people unfollow you. They all work using the same basic principle: the sites load your list of followers into a database, then, when you request an update, they compare your current list with your old list. If a name disappears, the site automatically identifies that the missing name is someone who has unfollowed you. Below are just a few good sites to use for this purpose — there are several more:



Unfollowers.com: This easy-to-use site boasts a slick interface (and the ability to monitor your Twitter account as well.)Justunfollow.com: This site offers extra tools that can be handy for dealing with a large group of followers, including the ability to put followers onto a ""whitelist"" or ""blacklist.""Insta.friendorfollow.com: This stripped-down, beginner-friendly site also allows you to see which users you follow that haven't followed you back.The choices above are all great, but for the purposes of this article, we'll use Unfollowgram, a popular service for people who like to track their Instagram followers (available at unfollowgram.com.)Note that all of these sites work in the same basic way, so you should be able to follow the example instructions for Unfollowgram without difficulty even if you're using one of the other sites.;
, Start by visiting unfollowgram.com and clicking on ""Login with Instagram."" You'll be asked for your Instagram user name and password. The first time you log in, a dialog will appear asking for your permission to access your Instagram account. Click the green authorize button to continue.


Note that if you've already linked your Instagram account to your Facebook account and you're currently logged into Facebook, your login details may be supplied automatically.
Finally, when you are asked, supply your email address when you are asked to complete the account creation process.

, Once you've made your account, figuring out who unfollowed you is as simple as clicking the appropriately-labeled button at the top of the screen. This will take you to a screen that should list any user that has unfollowed you since you started your Unfollowgram account. However, since you just created your Unfollowgram account, this list will probably be empty at first.


To be clear, there isn't any way to figure out who has unfollowed you before you make your Unfollowgram account. Unfollowgram doesn't have access to your list of Instagram followers until you give it your login details and your express permission to access it, so it can't retroactively figure out who unfollowed you in the past. The same is true of the other Instagram monitoring services above.

, Unfollowgram isn't just useful for seeing who's unfollowed you — it's also handy for keeping track of lots of other stats. Below are the different options available on the Unfollowgram navigation bar:



Who Doesn't Follow Me Back: A listing of users on Instagram that you follow, but who have not returned the favor. You can choose to unfollow anybody on this list by clicking the ""Unfollow"" button.

Who I Don't Follow Back: Conversely, these are the users who follow you that you yourself are not currently following. If at any point you change your mind and want to start following some of these users, you can do so by clicking the ""Follow"" button next to their profile pictures.

Followers: This is the complete list of every user who follows you, which is exactly identical to the list on your Instagram app. Here, you can click on each user's profile pic to be taken to their Instagram home page.

Following: The complete list of everybody who you are following. Here, you can unfollow them if you wish or visit their Instagram home page by clicking their profile picture.

, Whenever you reload the Unfollowgram page, it will automatically update with your latest statistics. If anything has changed since you last refreshed — for instance, if someone has followed or unfollowed you — this will be reflected after you refresh. However, you don't have to use your browser's refresh button to do this. Instead, to refresh the database, simply click the ""Check"" button in the top right. Within a few seconds, you'll be able to see if anyone has unfollowed you!

Search for an Instagram follower app on your phone's app store.,
Download and install your app.,
Provide your Instagram account details.,
Tap ""Followers Lost"" to view users that have unfollowed you.",How to Find Out Who Unfollowed You on Instagram2," Since you're already presumably using your mobile device to browse Instagram in the first place, it can be convenient to a have a go-to resource for figuring out who's unfollowed you recently on the very same device. Unlike the sites above, this method requires you to download an app, but once you've downloaded the app, it'll be at your fingertips whenever you need it. Below are just a few app recommendations for common mobile platforms:


For Apple iOS devices, Followers on Instagram Free by Sepia Software LLC is a highly-rated app that (like its name suggests) is completely free.
For Android devices, Follower Tracker for Instagram by 2 Creative Monsters LLC is one great, accessible solution out of the several available on the Play Store.
For Windows Phone devices, UnfollowSpy by publisher Elliott Forde offers a wide range of options for both Instagram and Twitter.

, When you find a suitable app in your mobile devices app store, download it (note that the suggestions above are all free.) Wait for the app to install, then open it.


For example purposes, we'll use the Follower Tracker for Instagram Android app recommended above. Most Instagram monitoring apps will be very similar, so feel free to follow along if you're using a different app.

, As with the online methods in the section above, any mobile app that tracks your Instagram followers will need your login details to be able to access this information, so supply your username and password when asked after launching the app.


On the next screen, if you are prompted, give Instagram permission to access your account information. The app will not access your list of followers without your permission, so this is necessary to use this method.

, Once you've gotten the app to work, the rest is a piece of cake. Simply click the ""Followers Lost"" button to see which users have stopped following you since you first ran the app. Like with the online methods above, the app will only start keeping track of your Instagram followers once it's installed, so you will only be able to see who stops following you going forward.


Note the ""Clear"" button in the top corner of the screen — pressing this will reset the Followers Lost list.

Your username's style should reflect your content theme; if you're an artist, for example, you'll probably want to stick to some derivative of your real name (or your artist alias).;
, There are a variety of things you might have readily available for users here:

A rich but concise description of your content, motives, and/or intent.
A link to your website if you have one.
Your work email address. It's worth setting up a dedicated email address for your Instagram account.
Usernames for any pertinent social media accounts (e.g., Twitter and Facebook).
Usernames for any IM services you'd like to share.
Your PayPal or Venmo ID for donations.
A resume. Posting this on a static blog page and then linking the blog page in your bio is the best way to display your resume.

, Unlike your personal Instagram or Facebook page, anything you post here needs to fit a singular theme (e.g., fitness or food).

In a pinch, find something you believe society doesn't have (or something it would benefit from having more of) that correlates with your talents.
Make sure your content adheres to the Instagram Terms of Use.

, This process includes making the photos aesthetically pleasing through use of filters and other editing options as well as placing pertinent information in the photo's description.

If you're advertising, for example, a short sentence describing the product or service you're promoting in relation to how it betters your life followed by appropriate links should go in the photo's description.
Posts tend to be best-received at around 2:00 AM and at 5:00 PM. Make sure you're around these times for your target demographic's specific timezone., While it is important not to inundate your followers with content, providing quality posts a few times per day will keep them satisfied.Try to vary your content within its thematic scope; you don't want to deviate too much from the kind of stuff you normally post, but you shouldn't be posting the same thing every day.

, Users will generally give you feedback--whether explicitly or implicitly--that can help you tailor your future posts to the majority of your followers.

You won't be able to incorporate every user's suggestions; instead, focus on common themes from the bulk of your Instagram followers.

, This will both promote your account name and increase your overall likability:Respond to comments often. Once you reach a certain follower amount, you'll no longer be able to respond to all comments; still, try to respond to a couple of users per post.
Favorite posts from brands, users, or accounts with which you'd like to work. This is a way to practice Instagram altruism while simultaneously promoting your account name.

, Links to your pertinent social media accounts should already be in your bio, but it's important to keep these pages updated with relevant content:

Facebook - Create and maintain a dedicated Facebook page for your Instagram content. You can then promote this page on Facebook.
Twitter - Create a specific Twitter account for your Instagram content. You can cross-post Instagram content to Twitter, though you should endeavor to post unique content here too.
Other sites that will depend on your intended demographic include Tumblr, YouTube, and Pinterest.

, This should be contingent on your content's theme; if you plan on applying to collaborate with brands for advertising campaigns, for example, most brands will require you to have around 5000 followers before you can advertise for them., If you are attempting to reach a specific demographic--which you should be--use hashtags for which that demographic might search. For example, if you have several photos of landscapes from the Pacific Northwest, you might tag your photos as ""#pnw"" and #""pacific northwest"".Only use hashtags relevant to your post, since using clickbait or wayward keywords will both frustrate potential followers and get your account flagged as spam.

, This exposes your account name, making it easier for anyone who sees your likes and comments to check out your profile. Ideally, you'll do this for users whom you would like to have following you.

You can do this on many random accounts to attract followers. While this process may be time-consuming, it's a good way to earn a few followers here and there.

, Your other social media accounts should already be fairly present on Instagram thanks to your bio; make sure your Instagram account is equally present on these social media accounts.

Even just posting a link to your Instagram account on your Facebook or Twitter page is a good way to promote your content.

, Requesting feedback or action from your followers will get them involved; if your requests are interesting enough, they will draw in more followers as well. You can facilitate engagement in a few ways:

Hosting give-aways for products or services. Make sure you require your users to ""Like"" and/or share your post to qualify.
Asking questions. Doing this will encourage users to respond, which curates interest in your content.
Taking requests. Especially if you're using Instagram to showcase photos, taking requests from users will get them personally invested in your future content.

, Try hosting a giveaway on your page to generate customer interest. Ask giveaway entrants to follow your Instagram profile to enter, or ask them to tag friends to create a viral effect. Make sure to follow Instagram's promotion guidelines if you host a giveaway or contest., If you notice a common complaint or request, don't ignore it; instead, find a way to implement follower feedback in order to satisfy the bulk of your followers. Remember, your followers are your greatest support group!, You should have an interest in promoting brand names, at least 500 followers, and the ability to update/post content regularly.

A lot of affiliate marketing will involve you taking photos of yourself or others displaying or using products or services.

, If you want brands to notice your account, you'll need to be active on their pages. This is also a good way to educate yourself on their aspects of marketing such as their preferred tone, style of content, and products/services., If you do this often enough, you will capture your brands' attention; this can show them that your account is a potentially valuable asset.

Don't just spam brands with empty comments or questions; instead, post insights, feedback, or rich questions that have the potential to further the brands' marketing.

, There are several sites that will help you partner with businesses; keep in mind that you'll need to capture the attention of the brand you wish to promote first.

Shareasale - Create an account, then sign up to work for a specific merchant. Any users you direct to these merchants via link on your Instagram profile will earn you a commission.
Stylinity - Intended for fashion use; if users shop via your link to their site, you get paid via commission.

, This shows that your Instagram account has depth. You can also contact brands' marketing departments directly via email.

This is another reason to have your work email in your bio; when brands are ready to contact you, they can do so right from your Instagram page.

, If your account is active and constantly growing, a brand will want to work with you at some point, if only for minor marketing in exchange for free products. You're starting from the bottom and working your way up, so any marketing experience you can get--even for free--will help build your portfolio and contribute to greater opportunities later., While this option won't apply to every Instagram account, anyone with an HD photo-capable smartphone can try their hand at taking, editing, and uploading Instagram photos; sooner or later, you'll probably upload something that someone will be interested in., As users of your chosen app view and purchase your photos, they will also become interested in your account; you can use this interest to further your account's business.

Foap is a great app for iPhone and Android platforms. You start by creating an account with Foap, then you upload photos to their database. Users can browse and purchase your photos, and you take 50 percent of the photo price., Stock content--lower-quality photos that business and websites can use for advertising--should go directly to your chosen photo-selling app, but you should sell your premium photos--e.g., incredibly high-quality pieces that command a higher price--individually from your Instagram page. This is where having a large follower base becomes crucial.

Note that stock content shouldn't actually be low-quality; rather, it should be generic or otherwise applicable to a wide variety of situations. Premium content should be more geared toward individual consumption.

, You can do this by uploading a lower-resolution version of the photo, or you can place a graphic (e.g., your signature or an obtrusive piece of text) over the top of it. Be sure to retain original copies of the photo for distribution.

When a follower wants to purchase your photo, you can send them an invoice and the unwatermarked version of your photo.

, You'll want to place the following information in the post:

Desired price
Desired payment client (e.g., PayPal or Venmo)
Photo size
Photo resolution
Brief photo description

, As long as you have an active follower base and you've generated interest in your photography up to this point, you should have no problem selling some of your photos from Instagram!

You can also take photo content requests from individual followers; you'll be able to charge a premium price for these.

, This will give you a general idea of the most popular results (e.g., what other people are using).

The most popular results are not the one that labeled as advertising. Better to see the several options from organic search., Popular Instagram follower outlets vary, so you'll want to look for a couple of consistent factors and discard any outliers:


Follower packages that average less than $0.10/follower
PayPal as an accepted method of payment
A privacy guarantee

, Sometimes paid follower sites sneak items such as disappearing followers or the right to spam your existing followers into the fine print. If you see an item you disagree with, don't pay for the service.

, If the service has been around for long enough--as most reputable ones have been--you'll probably be able to find reviews for it.


If you find an overwhelmingly negative series of reviews for your selected service, look for a different service.

, Most sites offer various packages with different numbers of followers. Both the number of your posts and the length of time you've been on Instagram will factor into this decision.


For example, if you've only been on Instagram for a day and you have one post, it doesn't make much sense for you to have more than 50 or so followers.
You should also take your current number of followers into account when doing this. If you double your follower intake overnight without changing your content, people may get suspicious.

, Even though PayPal is a secure intermediary, you shouldn't risk paying for followers over an unsecure connection (or data).

, This will ensure the seller will never see your credit card details. If you're set on your service and you think it's reputable, you can now purchase your Instagram followers.

Having an Instagram name that reflects your personality is a great way to attract followers who share your interests.


If you are having problems picking an Instagram name, try the name generator at spinxo.com/instagram-names.
Don't be afraid to use underscores (_) or other symbols. They will often improve an Instagram name by making it easier to read. However, try to keep the symbols to 1 or 2, so someone can search for you by name.;
, If possible, make it a creative photo of yourself (instead of an object) so that people can put your face to the name. If you want to be famous, you should not mind putting a few personal things on Instagram.

, Consider a hobby, fascination, or desired aesthetic, and aim to keep your Instagram content within that theme. Add engaging information about your theme to your Profile page, and be sure to post relevant captions when uploading new photos and videos.


Are you a foodie? Then focus on food-related photos.
Are you a fashion junkie? Focus on colors, styles, and trends.
Do you like a certain game or book series? Take creative photos of it and post it on Instagram!
Are you into a celebrity at the moment? Make your Instagram profile all about that person! You can also find other fans of that celebrity and make a community of your own.
Do you love role playing? Instagram is a great place to do so. Role play as your favorite character and join other role play communities as well! For example, if you love Naruto, you can roleplay as him or other Naruto characters!

, What can you share with the world that nobody else is doing? Keeping your Instagram account unique ensures that your followers stick around---they won’t be able to find your content anywhere else!

, Become a pro by taking different types of photos and using the filters. Notice the different ways filters can enhance dim lighting or increase the depth of certain colors. You may need to preview your photo in all of the available filters before finding the right one.


Having uniform colors and effects on most of your photos is a great way to develop an aesthetic. Using too many different filters could make your profile look tacky. See the hashtag “#nofilter” for examples.
Some Instagram users choose never to use filters as a way to highlight the natural beauty of their photos.

, Instagram’s built-in filters are cool but somewhat limited. There are additional apps that can add even more depth to your content. Install a well-reviewed photo editor from the app store and breathe new life into your feed.Try Instagram’s Boomerang to make short, engaging stop-motion videos.
Also try Layout, which allows you to combine multiple photos in a single collage-style image.
Try VSCO Cam, Prisma, Aviary, or Snapseed for high-quality photo editing.

, You won’t always get a great shot the first time, so take several photos and choose the best one. Only post the best, most creative photos that will keep your followers interested and engaged.


As with traditional photography, Instagram photography has an element of ""practice makes perfect."" You can only improve by using the app regularly and trying new things.

, Experiment and get creative with your photos. Try new angles, color combinations, and subjects in a variety of interesting settings.

, Use your Instagram account to create a story that is creative, original, and honest. Add “cliffhangers” to your photos to keep fans coming back for more.


For example, document your travels to a new place, the countdown to a significant event, or your journey with a new pet.

, Spend more time making an individual photo exceptional instead of sharing several that are mediocre.

, Captions can be humorous or sincere. Be playful, but informative.

, Inspired by Snapchat, Instagram now allows users to post photos and videos that disappear in 24 hours. Stories will not be stored in your Instagram feed, so use this feature to share all of the things that don’t quite fit with the rest of your account. Your stories will appear at the top of your followers’ feeds., Pay attention to what is trending and use hashtags on all of your photos. Many Instagram users search for hashtags to find new users to follow—using the right hashtags ensures that people who are looking for your sort of content are able to find you.For example, someone who posts photos from hiking adventures in the Pacific Northwest may use tags like #hiking, #method, #exploregon, #camping, and #mtranier.
Someone who shares their illustrations may use the hashtags #illustrators, #artistsofinstagram, #penandink, and #womanartists.
Some popular hashtags are #nofilter (unfiltered photos), #flawless (when you’re looking your best), #nochill (when life gets crazy), and #tbt (Throwback Thursday, a day when Instagrammers post old photos).

, Find Instagram users whose photos you enjoy and add them to your Follow list. Try to comment and like photos every time you go onto Instagram. It is very hard to become popular on Instagram without interacting with and trading likes with others.

, You most likely have a set number of friends who would be willing to follow you. Follow your Facebook friends on Instagram and they will surely follow back., When posting a new photo, tap your preferred social media option under “Share” and enter your username and password. This will post your Instagram photo, giving your followers on other platforms the chance to follow you on Instagram.

, While sharing some Instagram photos on Facebook or your blog can attract new followers, keep some content exclusive to Instagram. Remind your Facebook or blog followers that they should follow your Instagram for different photos. Let your Instagram account be where people can get to know another side of you.

, If you post something funny, caption it with something like, “Tag three friends who would think this is funny.” When people tag their friends on your photos, their friends will view your photo and usually like it or start following you.

, Geotagging adds a location link to the top of your Instagram photos, allowing people to see where you were and view other photos taken at that location. This is an excellent way to attract new followers, but remember that geotags share your location with the entire world. Avoid geotagging when you are home or anywhere else that you don’t want to be found in person.

, According to the analytics firm Union Metrics, brands that decrease the frequency of their posts tend to lose followers quickly.Your followers followed you because they want to see your content. Be consistent with posting, but don’t overdo it.


If you post more than 2-3 photos or videos per day, use Instagram Stories so you don’t clutter your followers’ feeds.

, When posting photos, add a caption that contains a question for your followers. Make the question something thoughtful, or something funny. The more people that answer your question, the more popular your post will be.

, To respond to them directly, type the “@” symbol and type their Instagram name. This shows everyone that you’re down to earth and willing to interact with your fans.

, According to an Instagram study, posts that mentioned another Instagram account (e.g., @instagram) in the caption encouraged 56% more comments and likes than otherwise.For example, if you take a photo at a restaurant, mention the restaurant’s Instagram name (e.g., @olivegarden) in the caption.
If you see something that reminds you of another Instagram user, snap a photo and post it with a caption like, “I thought of you, @!”

, Unless you are already a celebrity, you need to put time and energy into becoming an Instagram sensation. Increase your responses to comments, respond to Direct Messages, and like tons of photos!

, If you have a creative idea and some fans, grow your community by giving away a prize in exchange for likes and follows. Choose a prize worth winning, share a photo of it on Instagram, and then encourage your followers to like the photo to enter. When the contest ends, choose a random follower to win the prize!


Encourage your followers to tag their friends so they can also enter your contest.

, Websites like Statigram, Websta.me, and Iconosquare provide statistics that help you track your Instagram success. If you find that you lost several followers over a particular period, look back at your feed and see what may have sent them running. If your views spiked when you shared a certain photo, share more like it.

However, Siri has many different responses to the question. You may have to ask the question a few times to get the upset version of the answer., Siri does not always seem overtly upset when you ask if she's ever been in love, but she provides a variety of fun responses.

, Siri will open in listen mode.

, As long as the name you say is a clear contact in your iPhone, Siri will promptly call the person in question.


If you have different contacts who share a name, Siri will ask you to choose one. You can tell Siri the name, or you can tap the contact in question to make the call.

, This process works the same as making a phone call; if you state a contact's name and Siri is confused, you'll be prompted to confirm the contact whom you wish to call.


If the contact whom you're attempting to reach doesn't have an iPhone, the FaceTime call will briefly begin and then cut itself off.

, When doing this, make sure you say exactly what you want to send as the message after you state the contact's name.


For example, to send well-wishes to a sick friend, you might say ""Tell Jeff I hope you're feeling better."" Siri would then formulate a message that says ""I hope you're feeling better.""

, Doing so will send the message.


You'll also have a chance to review the message and check for spelling issues before you say ""Yes"", or you can tap Send yourself.

, Siri will fill in your contact's name in the ""To"" section of a new email, and then ask you to answer the following questions:



What's the subject of your email? - Tell Siri what your email's subject should be.

What would you like it to say? - Tell Siri what the email should say.

Are you ready to send it? - Siri will say this after reading aloud your email to you. Say Yes to send the email, or No to pause Siri.

, Just say ""Search the web for gardening tips."" It will search this subject and list of relevant web sites will come up.

, Simply say, ""Set up meeting at noon tomorrow."" It will say, ""OK, I set up your meeting for tomorrow. Are you ready for me to schedule it?"" This will bring up your calendar with the correct date and time. If there is another meeting scheduled then, It will let you know.


Confirm with an affirmative answer or tap Confirm.

, Just say something like, ""Remind me to call Ashley."" It will then follow up by asking, ""When would you like me to remind you?"" Tell it the time you'd like the reminder, such as ""at ten a.m. tomorrow,"" then give an affirmative answer (or tap Confirm) when asked if you'd like to set the reminder.

, Just say, ""What's the weather like today?"" It will bring up the local forecast.

, Just say, ""Wake me up tomorrow at 6 a.m."" It will confirm the request by saying it set the alarm for the time you requested.

, Just say, ""Note that I worked for ten hours today."" The note with the message will pop up.

, Ask it something like, ""How many cups are in a gallon?"" It will look up the question and will report back with a result.

, Just say, ""Play "" and Siri will begin to play the song.


The song must be on your iPhone for Siri to play the song.

, If you say ""is my ,"" Siri will remember the person with that title.


For example, saying ""Teresa is my mom"" will allow you to call your mom by saying ""Call my mom"" to Siri the next time you wish to do so.
You can do the same to institutions (""is my favorite restaurant"") and organizations, as long as their phone number or other information is stored in your Contacts.

, If you say something into Siri and Siri misinterprets it, you can tap on the text box with your misspelled query and correct it with your keyboard. It takes a few extra keystrokes, but Siri learns from mistakes and will be able to understand you better next time.

, Siri connects with Safari to execute your search queries, from questions about anything in the world to mathematical operations when you're splitting the restaurant bill. To change your default search engine for Siri, open your iPhone's Settings, tap Safari, tap Search Engine, and tap an option here.

, For a quick laugh, ask Siri to sing you a song or say ""knock knock."" You can also ask Siri to call you anything, such as ""your highness,"" and ask it more about itself.


iPhone users have found all sorts of fun things to ask Siri.

, You'll need to enable Dictation in order to use it. Like Siri, Dictation recognizes your speech, allowing you to type by talking. Dictation will send your spoken text to Apple's servers to be recognized and processed.Open your iPhone's Settings.
Tap General.
Tap Keyboard.
Slide Enable Dictation right to ""On"".

, You can use Dictation anywhere that you use your keyboard. Open an app to write some text so that the keyboard appears., The button looks like a microphone. This will start the Dictation process.

, Speak clearly and don't rush through your words. You don't need to pause after each word, but try to avoid slurring words together.

, Dictation will run everything you say together as one sentence unless you include punctuation marks. To insert a punctuation mark, you'll need to say it. For example, to write ""Hi there!"" you would say ""Hi there exclamation"". Below are a few of the most common punctuation marks:. - ""period"" or ""full stop""

, - ""comma""

"""" - ""quote"" and ""end quote""

' - ""apostrophe""

? - ""question mark""

! - ""exclamation"" or ""exclamation point""

( and ) - ""left paren"" and ""right paren""

, Dictation will automatically space and capitalize the start of a new sentence after using punctuation, but you'll need to specify when you want to start a new line or create a new paragraph. Say ""new line"" to start a new line in your document, or say ""new paragraph"" to start a new paragraph.

, You can use dictation commands to change the capitalization of your typing:


Say ""cap"" to capitalize the first letter of the next word. For example, ""I love cap mom"" would type ""I love Mom.""
Say ""caps on"" and the ""caps off"" to capitalize the first letter of each word in a section. Articles will not be capitalized. For example, ""caps on can I get the recipe caps off"" would type ""Can I Get the Recipe.""
Say ""all caps"" to make every letter upper-case in the next word. For example, ""I all caps hate bugs"" would type ""I HATE bugs.""

You may have to enter a passcode and tap the Home button to unlock your iOS device first.

If you're using Siri on a Mac, click the multicolored icon in the top right corner of your screen.

Siri is available on iPhones 4S and up, iPod Touch 5 and up, iPad 3 and up, and MacOS Sierra and up.
;
, For example, if you want to solve 220 divided by 18, you would say ""Solve two hundred twenty divided by eighteen.""

If you want to include a decimal point in your equation (e.g., ""220.9""), you should say ""point"" (e.g., ""two hundred twenty point nine"").


, Depending on how complex your question is, this can take anywhere from a second to several seconds.
, For example, you can solve quadratic equations or factorials by telling Siri to solve for the base equation:

For ""x2+3x−4=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x-4=0}"", you would say ""Solve X squared plus three X minus four equals zero.""

For ""8!{\displaystyle 8!}"", you would say ""Solve eight factorial.""


, For example, you could say ""How many prime numbers are between 1 and 100?""

You could also ask Siri to calculate the tip for a meal by saying ""What is a 20 percent tip on a $350 meal?"", You might ask ""How do you find the circumference of a circle?"" to find out the equation used to measure circumference, for example.

Asking about complex equations may lead Siri to link you to an online article about the subject.

, Before starting the game, click or tap on the Coconut Wheel booster to equip it for use within the next game. The Coconut Wheel is a round pink candy with a licorice center.


A check mark will appear on the booster selected.

, Click or tap the “Play!” button to begin the next game.

, The Coconut Wheel you’ve equipped will be placed on a random location on the board.


Note that some levels may already start with Coconut Wheels in specific locations on the board. Take note of this before equipping it as a booster.

, If Coconut Wheels are already in play on a particular level, some may come frozen under jelly. Free the Coconut Wheel from the jelly before using it. This can be done by making a match or combo adjacent to the jelly.


If the Coconut Wheels are free, skip this step.

, The Coconut Wheel can be activated and used by switching it with a candy next to it. After the switch, the Coconut Wheel will start spinning and roll into the direction of the swapped candy.


If the switch was done horizontally, the Coconut Wheel will roll horizontally.
If the switch was done vertically, the Coconut Wheel will roll vertically.

, The Coconut Wheel will roll over the next three candies in one direction. All of the candies will then become Striped Candies, which will then explode in the same direction, wiping out the columns or rows.


If the Coconut Wheel rolled over an ingredient or a blocker, nothing will happen to it. It only works on free candies.

, With a Coconut Wheel being able to turn the next three candies to Striped Candies, it makes sense to use them for bringing down ingredients, which is just right since it can only be used on Ingredients levels. Just make sure the Coconut Wheel rolls in the right direction to wipe out the needed columns.

, If you can get a Coconut Wheel side by side with a Striped Candy, you can mix them. The move will activate the Striped Candy, clearing out a row or a column depending on the direction of its stripes, then the Coconut Wheel will roll over the next three candies, making all of them Striped Candies and activating them to clear out three more rows or columns.


The Coconut Wheel will then go back and roll over another three candies in the same row or column, making all of them Striped Candies and activating them again.
This can be useful in clearing out several rows or columns of candies or blockers, and in bringing down ingredients.

, If you can get a Coconut Wheel side by side with a Wrapped Candy, you can mix them. The move will have the Coconut Wheel roll over the entire row or column, turning all candies into Wrapped Candies, then having all of them explode at the same time.


This can be useful in breaking out blockers in full rows or columns, and in bringing down ingredients some rows.

, If you can get a Coconut Wheel side by side with a Color Bomb, you can mix them. The move will have the Coconut Wheel roll over the entire row or column, turning all the candies into Striped Candies and activating them to clear out all rows or all columns, then the Color Bomb will explode.


This can be useful in clearing out all the columns of candies or blockers, and in bringing down ingredients.

, If you can get two Coconut Wheels side by side, you can mix them. The move will have the first Coconut Wheel roll over the entire row or column, turning all the candies into Striped Candies and activating them to clear out all rows or all columns, then the second Coconut Wheel will do the same thing for the same row or column.


This can be useful in clearing out all rows or columns twice, and in bringing down ingredients.

The direction is dependent on what direction the stripes are on the candy. Vertical Striped candies are useful for Ingredient Levels since they can clear out a whole column of candies and allow the ingredient to fully drop to the bottom.
Striped candies are also useful in removing jellies and chocolate, when placed in the right position.;
, A Wrapped candy is a special candy that results from matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. This one is more challenging and difficult to get compared to a striped candy.


When you use a Wrapped candy as part of a match, it will first explode and knock out the nine candies surrounding it, and then it will drop and explode again, knocking out another nine candies the same way.
Wrapped candies can be useful in removing obstacles within their explosion area, which can otherwise be difficult to get to.

, A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place to swap with to form the five-in-a-row.


Color bombs do not need to be matched to be used. You can just swap it with another candy, and all similar candies would be removed from the board. By itself, it doesn’t sound like achieving much, but when combined with another special candy, it will give you more awesome results.

, A Jellyfish is a special candy that cannot be generated by any move. It either is provided within the game or equipped pre-game. It’s only available for Jelly levels.


When used, a Jellyfish summons three more Jellyfish and they eat three jelly squares at random.
Jellyfish can be useful in removing jellies from hard to reach areas, though they move in random.

, A Coconut Wheel is a special candy that cannot be generated within a game by any candy combination. It either is provided within the game or equipped pre-game. It’s only available for Ingredients levels.


When used, the Coconut Wheel will roll over the next three candies in one direction, converting them to Striped candies and then triggering them.
It can be useful in clearing out whole columns for ingredients to drop.

, A Striped and Wrapped booster can only be equipped pre-game. Once equipped, you will start your board with one Striped Candy and one Wrapped Candy at random positions.


This can be useful if you want special candies on the board when you start.

, A Lucky Candy is a booster that can be equipped pre-game or made available on certain levels. When used as part of a match or a combination, it will transform into another special candy.


The candy it will transform to cannot be determined as it happens in random. Since it’s a lucky candy, the special candy it will transform to is something you may need for that level.

, A Lollipop Hammer is a booster that can be equipped within a game. It’s not a candy that appears on the board. It’s a tool that you can equip for destroying one square of candy, jelly, or some other blocker.

, Extra Moves provide you with five extra moves when activated within a game.

, Free Switch enables you to switch two side-by-side items on the board, without using a move. The candies don’t need to match for you to switch them.

, Extra Time gives you 15 extra seconds of play time. It can be equipped pre-game, and it only works for Timed levels.

, Sweet Teeth can be activated within a game. Once called, it will eat several candies, licorice, chocolate, meringue, and marmalade.

, Bomb Cooler adds five moves to the timers of the bombs on the board. It can only be activated on levels with bombs.

, The Bubblegum Troll can be activated within a game. Once called, it will remove all chocolate and block all chocolate fountains for five moves.

, Candy Crush gives you a free booster daily through its Daily Booster Wheel. This can be accessed from the game’s main screen, right below the number of lives. Play the Daily Booster Wheel every day, and get your free boosters.


The prizes you can get from turning this wheel are: a Lucky Candy, a Coconut Wheel, a Free Switch, a Lollipop Hammer, a Candy Bomb, a Jellyfish, and a Striped and Wrapped.
If you’re very lucky, you can hit the Jackpot, which contains three of each of the rewards.

, If you’d like to use some boosters and equip them before the game, you can buy them.


On the pre-game screen, click or tap the boosters you’d like to use. The price will be displayed.
Click or tap the price button, and you will be directed to the in-app purchase function.
Be sure you have your credit card handy. Input your payment details when prompted.
Prices vary per booster.

, If you’d like to use some boosters within the game, you can buy them. On the game screen’s upper-left corner, all available boosters for the level is displayed.


Click or tap the boosters you’d like to use. The price will be displayed.
Click or tap the price button, and you will be directed to the in-app purchase function.
Be sure you have your credit card handy. Input your payment details when prompted.
Prices vary per booster.

, Different boosters work differently. Using single boosters independently is very straightforward.


Refer to Part 1 to know more about the different boosters and how they can be used in your game.

, To make the most out of your boosters, you can mix and match them to come up with awesome results. Boosters can be combined when they are side-by-side.


All pre-game boosters and generated special candies can be combined.
To learn more about combining basic boosters, see Part 4.

, The boosters mentioned in Step 2 are the more common boosters and special candies available. They can be used in almost all levels of the game. The Coconut Wheel and the Jellyfish are the other boosters, but they are only available in certain levels.


Coconut Wheels are only available on Ingredients levels, and Jellyfish are only available on Jelly levels.
When they are available, they can also be mixed and matched with any of the other boosters from Step 2. Put them side by side and see the awesome results you can achieve.

, When you get two Striped Candies, regardless of colors and stripe directions, side by side, you can clear out a column and a row in one move, originating from where the combination was made. Imagine multiplying the effects of a Striped Candy by two.

, When you get a Striped Candy and a Wrapped Candy side by side, you can achieve the same thing as combining two Striped Candies, but with damage thrice as big.


It will clear out three rows and three columns in one move, originating from where the combination was made.

, When you get a Striped Candy and a Color Bomb side by side, you can convert all candies similar in color to the striped candy to striped candies with random stripes. The Color Bomb would then explode, and all the striped candies generated would burst out clearing several columns and rows at once.


Depending on your level, this can be a game-changer. You can generate more candies that are striped by having some more candies of the same color drop before using the combo.

, When you get two Wrapped candies side by side, you can get massive explosions, much bigger than individual Wrapped Candies exploding. Similar to a single Wrapped candy, the explosions would happen twice.


Using this combo may not be as useful in achieving your level’s targets, but it is fun to do and generates bigger points.
It can also be used to significantly clear out some blockers like jellies, licorice, and chocolate.

, When you get a Wrapped candy and a Candy Bomb side by side, you can get an effect similar to two Candy Bombs, with the second explosion targeting a random color.


If a Candy Bomb by itself doesn’t do much good for your level, making this combo won’t do any good too. This is one of the least useful combos in the game. You’re better off using them separately or combining them with other special candies.

, When you get two Candy Bombs side by side, you can wipe your board clean of candies. It’s basically a refresh of your board with new candies.


This combo is very hard to get, but it’s extremely useful and fun to use.

Create a new account for your business.,
Choose the right objective.,
Target a relevant audience.,
Create a budget and schedule.,
Select your optimization settings.",How to Advertise on Instagram1," To advertise using Instagram, you will first need to create a company account for your business. To do so, go to the Instagram website using your mobile phone. Create an account by entering your e-mail and creating a password. Specify this is a business account rather than a personal account.You will have to select a username while creating your account, so be sure to select a name that reflects your business. For example, if you're advertising a bakery called Roy's Deli, your name could be something as simple as ""RoysDeli.""
Unfortunately, sometimes names are already taken. If the name of your business is unavailable, you will have to tweak the name slightly. For example, if ""RoysDeli"" is taken, try things like ""TheRoysDeli"" or ""RoysDeliOfficial."";
, After creating your Instagram business, you will be asked about your ad objectives. There are several options to select, so choose the one that matches your Instagram objectives most closely.If you're trying to get users onto your website, select the Clicks to Website objective. If you want users to take a specific action on your website, such as buying a product, select Website Conversions.
If your business involves mobile app sales, click Mobile App Installs to get more downloads. If you want more user engagement with an app you're selling, click Mobile App Engagement.
If you're promoting videos of your product, select Video Views.
If you're trying to promote a specific message with your app, select Reach and Frequency.
If you want more engagement with your Instagram account, select Page Post Engagement.

, After choosing your objective, Instagram will let you choose your target audience. You will be presented with a variety of filters such as location, age, language, gender, behaviors, interests, and so on. Try to use the filters to target as specific an audience as possible for your ad campaign.For example, if you're advertising for a local business that sells preteen clothing, target people who live in your town or city. Target a younger audience and look for people posting about fashion and clothing.

, After targeting your ad, Instagram will let you set a schedule. You will choose how much money you'll spend on the ad and when and how often it will appear.You can choose between a daily budget and a lifetime budget. A daily budget lets you decide how much money you spend per day. A lifetime budget lets you choose a total amount to spend for the full length of your ad campaign.
You can either run your ad continuously or run it for a specific set of time. If you're running an ad campaign based on something temporary, like a sale, it makes sense to only run the ad for a specific length and time.

, Optimization settings affect who sees your ad. Different factors influence when the ad shows up. Choose an objective fitting with the goals of your ad campaign.Link Clicks is what Instagram recommends. This will target your ad to specific users based on clicks to your website. This helps you identify Instagram users already interested in your company.
Impressions will simply deliver your ad as much as possible to a wide range of users. Your ad will remain on users news feeds all day long.
Daily Unique Reach delivers your ad to users up to once a day.

Use photo ads.,
Create video ads.,
Take advantage of Instagram stories.,
Make some carousel ads.",How to Advertise on Instagram2," Photo ads are the main type of ad used on Instagram. You can use pictures of your products accompanied by your company logo. In your text, you can direct people to your website. These ads can work well if you're trying to sell a new product, especially if you're targeting a product to a very specific audience.For example, if you're selling paint, have an ad showing different types of paint. Target it towards users who have posted about recently moving.

, Video ads involve brief videos showcasing your products or company. They can be up to 60 seconds long, but ads that are 30 seconds or less tend to get the most views. These work well if you have products best showcased via videos, such as phone apps. For example, if you're selling a phone app, you can show users brief videos of the app in action., Instagram stories are a relatively new feature that can be used in advertising. These are ads that become fullscreen videos. They usually focus on unique experiences customers have using products, telling a story about how your company can bring consumers satisfaction. These videos, like video ads, can last up to 60 seconds.For example, if you're running a hotel, a good story ad can show a guest's experience at your hotel from start to finish, with brief testimonials.

, Carousel ads are ads that users can scroll through. They show a series of related photos. These can be great if you're showcasing a series of new products, such as a new clothing line. Rather than seeing a small picture of products squashed together, users can see a full picture of each individual product."
"
Link to your website in your bio.,
Use attention-grabbing language in posts.,
Add a call to action button.",How to Advertise on Instagram3," Instagram does not allow you to post clickable links in actual ads. Therefore, make sure you include a link to your website in your company's bio. In the text of your ads, tell users to click on the link in your bio for more information.Update your links regularly as your website changes.

, Make you use language in posts that will entice users to stop and read your ads. Clearly and concisely describe what your product is and use words that draw attention. For example, something like, ""Incredibly savings - up to 50% off!"" can grab a users attention., If you're trying to get users to take a specific action, download a Call To Action button. This takes them to a website after it's clicked, where they can do things like purchase your products or download your apps. This can be a great way to make your ads effectively translate to sales.Use the right language in your button. For example, if you're advertising a hotel, have a Call to Action button that reads ""Book Now.""
Find the Call to Action button through your Instagram business account settings.

If you have already upgraded your device to 7.1 or newer, you will need to use the first method of this article to get Siri-like functionality, as jailbreaking your phone is not possible.


You can check your version number by opening the Settings app, tapping General, and then tapping About.

, If you have a passcode set for your iPhone's lock screen, you will need to temporarily disable it during the jailbreak process. If you don't disable it, the jailbreak will fail.


You can turn off the passcode lock by opening Settings, tapping General, and then tapping Passcode Lock. Make sure to toggle it OFF.

, The evasi0n 7 program will detect that your phone as been connected, and will display the current iOS version that it is using. Click the Jailbreak button to begin the jailbreaking process.

, You can watch the progress of the jailbreak in the evasi0n window. This may take a while, so be patient and don't open iTunes or Xcode while the jailbreak is processing.

, After the first phase is complete, your phone will reboot and the evasi0n program will inform you that your phone needs to be unlocked to continue. Make sure that you do not close the evasi0n program at this time, or the jailbreak will fail.

, Once you unlock your phone, you'll see a new app on your Home Screen called evasi0n 7. Tap it to start the next phase of the jailbreak process. Your screen will go white and your phone will reboot again. You can monitor the rest of the jailbreak process on your phone, but make sure you leave the program running on your computer.

, Once the jailbreak is complete, your phone will reboot one more time and the Cydia app will appear somewhere on your Home Screen. Tap it to open the Cydia store, and move down to the next section of this article to get the Siri tools.

This article will discuss using p0sixspwn, as these are the most common versions of iOS 6. For all other versions, see this article for details.


You can check your version number by opening the Settings app, tapping General, and then tapping About.

, You will need the latest version of iTunes in order to jailbreak your iPhone. See this guide for detailed instructions on updating your iTunes installation.

You can turn off the passcode lock by opening Settings, tapping General, and then tapping Passcode Lock. Make sure to toggle it OFF.

, The p0sixspwn program will detect that your phone as been connected, and will display the current iOS version that it is using. Click the Jailbreak button to begin the jailbreaking process.

, Your phone will enter a quick Restore mode, but don't worry about losing your data. Although a traditional restore will wipe the phone, the jailbreak is using the restore function to install the custom software.


You can watch your p0sixpwn window to see status updates on the jailbreaking process.
Do not unplug your iPhone during the jailbreak process. Your phone will reset several times during the process, but this is normal.

, After the initial jailbreak phase is complete, you will see Cydia on your Home Screen. Make sure to leave your iPhone connected to the computer and p0sixpwn open for the time being. Tap on the Cydia app to launch it and finish the jailbreak process.


When you first launch Cydia, you will see the ""Preparing Filesystem"" message. This process can take a significant amount of time, especially for older devices like the iPhone 4, so be patient.
When the ""Preparing Filesystem"" process is complete, your iPhone will reboot. You can launch Cydia again and move on to the next section to install the Siri tools.

, In order to download software through Cydia, you need to add the repository that contains the files you want. Think of repositories like channels that cater to specific needs. In order to get the Siri tools, you'll need to add a specific repository:


Open Cydia, then tap Manage → Sources → Edit → Add.
Enter in the following address: http://repo.siriport.ru

Tap ""Add Source"" to add the repository to your list.

, Once the repository has been added, you will be able to select it from your list of Sources. Opening the repository will display a list of available files. Loading may take a few moments, as the servers are located in Russia. Tap the appropriate package for your device:


iOS 7 - SiriPort (Original) for iOS 7
iOS 6 - SiriPort (Original) for iOS 6.1.x (Select the appropriate option for the version you are running. If you are running 6.1.4 or 6.1.5, select the 6.1.3 version)

, Once the package has been installed, go back to your Home Screen and open the Settings app. Scroll down until you find the ""SiriPort.ru (Original)"" option. Tap it.

, When you open the SiriPort option in the Settings app, you will see the ""Install Certificate"" option at the top of the menu. Tap it and you will be taken to a webpage in Safari that will prompt you to install a certificate. This is necessary in order to connect to the Siri servers for voice command processing. Tapping ""Install Certificate"" on the website will open the ""Install Profile"" window.

, You will see the SiriPort.ru name along with the message ""Not Trusted"". Tap ""Install"" and then ""Install"" again to confirm. The ""Not Trusted"" message will change to ""Trusted"" and a green checkmark will be displayed. The Siri installation process is now complete.

, Before you can start using Siri, however, you'll need to activate it. To do this, press and hold the Home button until the Siri interface appears. Say a simple command such as ""Hello"". Wait for Siri to respond. This step can be tricky, as there are often issues connecting to the server. You may have to retry multiple times.


Rebooting your iPhone 4 may make connecting to Siri easier.
Once Siri replies, a connection has been established and Siri is now usable whenever you'd like. Be aware that Siri is much slower than on legitimate versions due to the fact that voice commands need to be sent to overseas servers to be processed and then sent back to you."

Understand the basic levels.,
Learn the types of special candy and combinations.,
Follow the basic strategies.",How to Play Candy Crush," There are five types of levels scattered throughout the Candy Crush level map.



Target score - Target score levels require you to reach a minimum score to clear the level.

Jelly - The goal in Jelly levels is to clear all the jelly. Sometimes jelly is hidden under, or between, other obstructions like stones.

Ingredient Drop - In Ingredient Drop levels, you will be required to bring special ingredients from the top of the board to the bottom. As you set off combinations on the game board, the ingredients will start dropping from the top. Sometimes ingredients are trapped behind stones that you first need to clear.

Timed - Timed levels provide you with a set amount of time in which to reach a minimum score. Often, jelly with +5 written on them will drop down. When you set these off, you add 5 seconds to your remaining time.

Candy Order - In Candy Order levels you need to meet the required candy order by clearing the candy colors (or special candy combinations) mentioned at the top of the board. The simplest of these levels will ask you to clear X number of a certain coloured candy, whereas the harder ones require you to clear special candy combinations (like wrapped candy with striped candy).;
, You can create different kinds of special candy, as well as special candy combinations. As you get better at the game you will learn to recognize patterns that will help make special candy. Here are the different kinds of special candy and combinations you can make.



Striped Candy - This special candy has horizontal or vertical stripes on it. The stripes are the same color as the candy it was used to make (4 red candy in a row will make 1 red striped candy). This will clear an entire row or column when set off, depending on the direction of the stripes. The direction of the stripes is determined by the way the candy was created (in the screenshot below, the red striped special candy will have vertical stripes and clear all the candy above and below it when set off). These are very commonly made during chain reactions, and can be extremely useful in clearing ingredient levels since these can remove the entire column the ingredient is in.

Wrapped Candy - Wrapped candy looks like a normal candy with a square wrapper on it. When set off, it will clear the surrounding 8 candies, in a 3x3 formation, twice. It is created when 5 candies come together in a T, L or + shape. One example of its formation is below.

Color Bomb - The color bomb is a chocolate ball with sprinkles on it. Color bombs are very easy to set off, as you can switch them with any candy to do so. When switched with regular candy, it will remove all candies of that color from the board. When switched with wrapped candy, it will first remove all the candies the same color as the wrapped candy, and then set off all the candies in the most common color on the board. When switched with a striped candy it will turn all candies the same color into striped candy as well. Finally, when switched with another color bomb is will zap away all the candies on the entire board, removing any jelly under them once. It is created by moving 5 candies into one row (see screenshot below).

,


Create a gameplan as soon as you see the game board. Remove chocolate first as it takes over the game board unless you are constantly attacking it. Remove stones and other obstacles next, as these reduce gameplay area, and cover jelly.
Remove jelly that is in the corner, or along the sides any chance you get. These areas have the fewest possible combinations available and can be the hardest to get rid of.
Keep ingredients towards the center of the game board. This is the area where the most combinations are possible, and therefore this strategy makes it easier to remove the ingredients from the board.
The easiest way to remove an ingredient is through a vertically striped candy in the same column.
Avoid using the fish till the end. Fish will eat some of the remaining jellies. If you use them in the middle of the level they might randomly eat jelly you could have easily removed.

Pay attention to Odus.,

Beware of combos and special candies.",How to Play in the Dreamworld on Candy Crush," Dreamworld levels are similar and based on the levels found on Reality, which is what we call the main or basic game before Dreamworld came. You have to move forward in Reality in order to move forward in Dreamworld. You cannot get to a level in Dreamworld that you haven’t beaten in Reality.


If you try to get into a level in Dreamworld that you haven’t beaten in Reality, you will be blocked by a message, “Next dream is locked. Complete another episode in the Saga to unlock your next dream adventure.”;
, Odus’ presence in Dreamworld affects your game differently each time. Odus sleeps on a horizontal crescent moon, with two different candies on each side. The moon Odus sleeps on goes out of a balance if the number of candies matching the ones on the moon cleared out do not closely match.


When the imbalance of candies grows large, Odus will fall off the moon and you would lose the level.
It’s basically the same game play from Reality, with the added complexity of balancing two candies.

, After a predetermined number of moves, as long as the moon is still balanced with Odus safely on top, you will get a Moonstruck. It’s similar to Sugar Crush at the end of each success level from Reality, but Moonstruck doesn’t happen at the end of the game. Once Moonstruck is triggered, Odus will fly away and one or both of the candies on the moon scale will be crushed.


No candies of the same colors will come into play during this time. During the period that Odus is away, there will be no moon scale so you can do whatever you want on the board and create all sorts of combos and special candies.
Moonstruck can help you achieve high scores by removing all candies of the same colors, which can then lead to several cascades and combos.

, Every time you launch Candy Crush, the default game is in Reality.

, Depending on where you’re playing, Odus may be located differently.


On the mobile device’s Candy Crush app, a sleeping Odus can be found on the upper-right corner of the screen.
On Facebook’s Candy Crush, a sleeping Odus can be found on the upper-left part of the game.

, Clicking or tapping on Odus will wake him up and have him bring you to Dreamworld. He will fly off the screen, and bring down a new world.

, The levels and navigating through them are similar with Reality. Click or tap the level you’d like to play.

, If you’d like to go back to the main game, click or tap Odus again from the game map. He will bring down the Reality world.

, From the game map, scroll up or down to find your level. Click or tap the level you’d like to play.

, On the pre-game window, you can equip some boosters to help you in your level.

, Click or tap the “Play” button to start the game.


Refer to this article for more tips on how to play Candy Crush. Playing in Dreamworld is essentially the same.

, The main difference with Dreamworld is Odus. With every move you make, you have to note the balance of Odus’ moon scale. If the scale is already tipped to one end, you have to make sure you don’t crush any candy similar to the candy on the heavier end of the scale. If you do, Odus may fall and you will lose the level.

, Target the candies on the moon scale alternately. Don’t go for one kind of candy consecutively as this will tip the scale.


All the other candies are fair play.

, You can still make combos and special candies. In fact, these are needed to bring up your points and to complete some levels. However, you don’t have much control over the results of these combos and special candies. It will be wise to avoid them. Better yet, take advantage of them only during Moonstruck."

Start by clearing as many candies as possible from the middle of the board before working your way outward.,

Steal opportunities to clear jellies located in corners of the board whenever possible.,
Combine color bombs with striped candies whenever possible.,
Try to position horizontal striped candies in the bottom row of the playing board whenever possible.",How to Pass Level 91 on Candy Crush," This strategy will help open up moves on the board, since candies will continue to fall down onto the screen and improve your odds of creating special candies. On level 91, you must clear an average of 1.5 jelly squares with every move., Vertical striped candies will allow you to clear the jellies above at a faster rate, while also improving your odds for cascading matches, which are matches automatically made by candies falling down onto the screen.


Make striped candies by matching four candies of the same color in a row. A striped candy wipes out all candies in the same row either horizontally or vertically, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing. To make vertical striped candies, the last candy must be moved into the combination in an upward or downward direction. To make horizontal striped candies, the last candy must be moved left or right to make the combination.

, In many instances, you may be unable to pass level 91 as a result of struggling to clear candies in corners given your limited options for candy matches in this position.Save up as many lollipop hammers and “free switch” hands as possible to use in the event you have one or two jellies remaining in corners on level 91. Boosters such as these can help clear jellies that are difficult to reach if you only have one or two moves remaining.

, When combined with a striped candy, a color bomb will turn all candies of the same color into striped candies that will detonate and clear all other candies located in the same rows and columns.Make color bombs by matching five candies of the same color in a row. If you already have a color bomb on the playing board, try not to detonate it until you can match it with a striped candy, if possible.

, In level 91, the bottom row of the playing board consists solely of meringue blockers. When detonated, horizontal striped candies will wipe all candies from the same row, which will help you clear double jellies even sooner within 30 moves.

When you use a Striped candy as part of a match, it will clear out a whole row or column from the board. The direction is dependent on what direction the stripes are on the candy. Striped candies are useful in removing jellies and chocolate, when placed in the right position.

Wrapped candy — A Wrapped candy is a special candy that results from matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. This one’s more challenging and difficult to get as compared to a Striped candy. When you use a Wrapped candy as part of a match, it will first explode and knock out the nine candies surrounding it, and then it will drop and explode again, knocking out another nine candies the same way. Wrapped candies can be useful in removing obstacles within their explosion area, which can otherwise be difficult to get to.

Candy Bomb — A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place to swap with to form the five-in-a-row. Color bombs do not need to be matched in order to be used. You can just swap it with another candy, and all similar-colored candies will be removed from the board.

Jellyfish — A Jellyfish is a special candy that results from matching at least four candies in a box of 2 by 2. When used, a Jellyfish attacks an obstacle or a soda bottle, depending on the level. Jelly Fishes can be useful in removing obstacles or soda bottles from hard to reach areas, though they move in random.

, Aside from the main goal, every level requires you to meet a certain minimum score to in order to move to the next level. If you’ve successfully completed the goal, but didn’t meet the required score, you will still lose the game. Go for huge combos and cascading matches to get some bonus scores."

, This can help you pass level 265 in fewer than 30 moves, and eliminate your need to spend extra moves clearing any timed candy bombs, which will end gameplay upon detonation.

, When matched with a striped candy, a color bomb will turn all other candies of the same color into striped candies that will immediately detonate and clear all candies from the same rows and columns.Create color bombs by matching five of the same-colored candies in a row.

, All candy bombs in level 265 have 12-move timers, which means the candy bombs will explode and end gameplay if you fail to clear them in time.Try to clear any candy bombs resting atop jelly squares. Since all double jelly squares are located next to the cannons that dispense candy bombs, your odds for being able to clear a candy bomb and jelly square at the same time are in your favor.

Spend as much time as possible clearing the jelly squares at the bottom center region of the main playing board.",How to Pass Level 103 on Candy Crush," A candy bomb is located at the top right corner surrounded by chocolate squares, and will automatically detonate after nine moves if you fail to clear it in time, causing you to lose the level.;
, The single column on the left has a teleporter at the bottom of the column that will dump the licorice blockers and the other candy bomb onto the main playing board. Both candy bombs in level 103 must be detonated within nine moves or fewer in order for you to continue on with gameplay and clear the double jelly squares., If you fail to clear the chocolate from the upper half of the board, the chocolate will block the candy entrance and prevent you from being able to clear the double jellies located at the top right corner., These jelly squares are the most challenging to clear, since these squares only come into contact with one other candy, or jelly square.

, Level 103 doesn’t offer enough moves to allow you to clear the board making traditional three-candy matches.


Make striped candies by matching four same-colored candies in a row. Striped candies will detonate all other candies in the same row or column, depending on the direction in which the stripes are facing.

Make color bombs by matching five same-colored candies in a row. When detonated, color bombs will destroy all candies of the same color as the candy matched with.
Combine special candies to clear a higher number of candies and jelly squares in one move. For example, striped + wrapped candies will clear three rows and three columns of all surrounding candies and jellies, whereas color bomb + striped will turn all candies of the same color into striped candies that immediately detonate.

, This can improve your odds of making one or more special candies due to having larger board space, and can even result in unexpected matches from cascading candies that help you clear additional double jelly squares."

Level 117 features four different drop zones -- two of which will drop ingredients directly into “stuck zones,” or corners that don’t lead to the ingredient pathways.;
, For example, if you need to move the cherry to the left, and the cherry is centered between one green candy on the left, and two green candies on the right, swap the cherry with the candy on the left to match the three green candies, and to move the cherry left toward the pathway.

, Instagram is a community, and you will find yourself gaining followers if you participate in that community. This means interacting beyond simply uploading photos. Find people that are posting pictures that interest you, and follow their accounts. This will let you see their latest photos on your feed.


Do a quick search for relevant hashtags on Instagram to get a list of photos and accounts that are similar to what you post. For example if you post lots of travel pictures then search for something like #instatravel
Don't just follow everyone you see, or your feed will become too overloaded to process. Limit yourself to following only those accounts that you find most interesting.
Instagram limits you to following about 120 people per hour.

, Once you start following some people, take some time to like and leave positive comments on their photos. Not only will this make the other person feel good, but other people may see your name or comment and check out your profile. If you stay active, this can lead to a steady stream of new followers.


When commenting on photos take your time to write a longer message and use emojis when possible. It will be much more motivating for them to take the extra time to look over your profile.

, Interacting with your own followers is essential to maintaining your follower base and building your community. Respond to any interesting comments, and thank your followers for any compliments. If a follower asks an intriguing question, take the time to answer it properly.

, Use the photo caption to ask questions to your followers. This will get your comments section more active, which will attract more viewers to your photo.


Consider having a call-to-action, such as ""Double-tap if you found this funny"" or ""Share your story in the comments"". This will help drive community interaction with your photos.

, Instagram is now owned by Facebook, and you are losing out on a lot of potential followers if you don't connect your accounts. Once connected all of your Instagram posts will be pushed to Facebook as well, giving you double exposure.You can connect your accounts through the Instagram Settings menu.

, Your Instagram bio is an often-overlooked but very important part of your Instagram account. Let people know who you are and why they should follow you. Include a couple hashtags as well that relate to your content.


Your bio is another good place to place a call-to-action.
Use multiple lines and emojis to draw attention to your bio.

, Hashtags are words and short phrases that describe and categorize the image. Hashtags help people search for your image, and can add your image to current trends. Using hashtags is incredibly important to reaching a larger audience.Instagram is a great tool for finding what the most popular trending tags are.
The top hashtags on Instagram are usually #love #photooftheday #amazing #smile #look #picoftheday #food #instadaily #girl #iphoneonly #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #all_shots #webstagram #colorful #style #swag
You can find relevant tags using websites such as www.tagsforlikes.com or download apps on your phone by searching for ""tags for likes"" on the app store.

, Add a few of the most pertinent hashtags you can find to your image. Try to limit the number of hashtags to three at the most. If you have too many hashtags, your followers will feel like your images are too spammy. Hide away the hashtags by using them withing the caption sentence e.g. ""I really #love this #girl"" or place them right at the bottom of the caption.


Instagram will limit you to a maximum of 30 hashtags per post.

, If you have a decent amount of followers, you can try creating your own hashtags. This could be your company name or a slogan that applies to many of your photos. This will help brand your Instagram account, and lead to a more cohesive community presence. Use this tag in all your photos you post as well as in your Instagram accounts bio.


You can use capital letters to seperate words in a hashtag rather than spaces. Instead of ""Just do it"" you could use #JustDoIt

, Instagram users are interested in photos from locations that they know. On top of that, as you post geotagged photos, Instagram will bring up other photos from that location.


Other users posting photos from the same location may see your pictures and follow them to your account, giving you more exposure and potentially new local followers.
Avoid geotagging your photo in a location that the photo was not taken. Incorrect geotagging could lead to negative comments on your posts or other forms of backlash.
For your own safety avoid geotagging your home or work locations. Remember these geotags are visible to the public.

, If you want to try to bolster your likes, comments, or followers you can use some of the more popular like, comment, or follow trading hashtags, such as #follow4follow #like4like #comment4comment #f4f #l4l #c4c #followback #likeback #commentback #teamfollowback #alwaysfollowback etc. Just make sure that you actually hold up your part of the deal and like, comment, or follow the user back.


Some people consider this a ""dirty"" tactic, and you may lose some followers if you tag this too often.
While this tactic may lead to new followers, be aware that they may only follow you to gain more likes on their own photos rather than out of genuine interest.
Make sure you follow though with your side of the deal to avoid any nasty comments or unfollows.

, While this may seem obvious, one of the best ways to get followers on Instagram is to simply take good pictures. Instagram is swamped with pictures of people's meals and cats, so set yourself apart with well-shot photos.


Try to take pictures that will relate with your target audience. If your audience can connect with the images that you take, they are more likely to follow you.
A good photo doesn't have to be a ""perfect"" photo. Good photos seem human and imperfections can help add to that feeling.
Limit ""selfies"". Everyone likes to post a selfie every now and then, but you shouldn't let these pictures dominate your content. Most followers don't want to see you, they want to see your photos. Posting constant selfies can come across as narcissistic, and can drive followers away. The exception to this, sad as it may be, is if you are attractive. You can get a lot of followers by posting attractive pictures of yourself. Even then, don't let it dominate your content!

, Instagram got popular because of the filter options. These filters adjust the color of your photo, giving it a more ""real"" feel. Instagram has a variety of filters available, so don't be afraid to try multiple ones until you find one that works well with your photo.


Avoid using the same filters over and over, or your images will start to feel too same.
If the picture is striking enough without a filter, a popular hashtag on Instagram is #nofilter. Use it!
if you are struggling to find a good filter then try a third party photo editor like Google Photos which has many different filters that are not available on Instagram.

, A good caption can turn an okay photo into an amazing one. Captions help grab the viewers' attention, and if you can make them laugh or smile with your caption you'll retain more people as followers. Jokes or cute captions are especially popular.

, While you can do some minor editing in Instagram, there are a variety of apps for both iOS and Android that can give you way more tools. Use these apps to brighten, darken, crop, add text and effects, and much more.


Popular editing apps include Photo Editor by Aviary, Afterlight, Bokehful, and Overgram.

, A great way to show progression or a collection of images is to create a collage to post on Instagram. There are several apps that will allow you to do this, including PicStitch, InstaCollage, InstaPicFrame, and even Instagrams own collage app named Layout.

, Instagram is an incredibly popular service, and your followers' feeds are likely updating constantly. If you want the most people possible to see your photos, you need to post them at the right time. The best time to post photos is during the morning and after normal work hours end for your audience.Instagram photos typically last around 4 hours in a person's feed, so avoid posting in the middle of the night or your followers may never actually see the image.
You can find the best times to post pictures for your audience by using websites such as IconoSquare

, Don't dump all of your photos into your feed at once. If you have multiple photos that you want to share, spread them out over a couple days. If you post too many pictures at once, your followers are likely to start skipping over them. On the other hand, if you don't post often enough, you will have difficulty maintaining followers and drawing in new ones.

, There are lots of websites that offer followers for money. If you're desperate for more followers, purchasing some may help get your Instagram account off the ground.


Make sure to read reviews of the services before settling on one.
Find a seller that accepts PayPal.
Check for a money back guarantee.
Carefully read the Terms and Conditions as well as any Privacy Policy.

, Most services allow you to choose from a variety of packages, ranging from 100 to 1 million followers. Choose the package that best suits your needs and budget.

, You cannot purchase followers for a private account because private accounts hide the amount of followers they have, so ensure that you set your account to be publicly visible. You can change the settings from your Profile page by tapping ""Edit your Profile"".

, Buying followers can give you a quick boost, but there are some drawbacks. These followers will likely never interact with your photos and leave comments, which can leave your photos a little bare. People will also notice when you have lots of followers and no activity, which can turn them away. These followers may also unfollow you after some time.

, You’re impatient and constantly beg for lives and tickets. Once you run out of lives, you bug your friends to give you lives. You send them requests via the game, and text or call them to remind them to respond to your requests.


You don’t care that it may sound ridiculous that you’re impatient for a game. You may even bug them when it’s inappropriate, thinking that they may be up and playing Candy Crush too.

, You start building up a credit card debt when you’re addicted to the game. Candy Crush by itself is free to play. You can get far with the proper combination of strategy, patience, and lots of luck.


However, the developers of the game also built several aids to help you in the game for a price. For a few bucks, you can get some extra moves on a level you’re close to completing or equip some boosters to help you complete a level much easier.
Once you start paying for these things, it will be hard to stop. You’ll just be surprised when you see how much you owe your bank for all the Candy Crush bills you’ve accumulated.

, When you’re a Candy Crush addict, you live and breathe Candy Crush:


You dream of candies and combos. When you do get to sleep, you end up dreaming of crushing candies and making all those special combos. You dream of your strategies for the levels you’re currently on. You dream of catching up with your friends’ high scores and levels. You get nightmares composed of chocolate and tornadoes.
You see everything in candy shapes and colors. Even when you’re not playing the game, it would seem that you still do. Everything you see are candies. You may even be afraid to walk into a candy store or even the candy aisle in your supermarket.

, The most basic and simplest way to stop your addiction is to put down the game. You don’t have to delete it just yet. You just have to control when and how your play it.


Use your lives, and stop when you’re out. Wait for people to respond to your requests without bugging them. Play some other game to take your mind off it.

, If you find that you cannot control yourself, go ahead and delete the game permanently. Restrain yourself from re-installing it. Out of sight, out of mind. Forget about the game.

, It would be hard to keep your focus if others keep on sending your app invites and requests from Candy Crush. Have Facebook block these so you won’t see them anymore.


Refer to this article for details on how to do this.

, Call a friend to act as your sponsor. Every time you feel the urge to play Candy Crush, call him or her right away. Just make sure your sponsor isn’t a fellow Candy Crush addict.

, This may be a hard cure to follow, but this is the best one. If you’re a Candy Crush addict, most likely it has affected your job, family, and relationships. Not to mention financial situation. Go back to your life before you met Candy Crush.


Focus on your work or school. Rebuild your lost relationships with your family and friends. Get out and leave your mobile devices at home.

Click and type your item into the ""I'm looking for"" box and type the city name and state abbreviation (city, two-lettered state abbreviation) into these boxes and click the ""Search"" button to submit the search.

As you are typing the city and state, you can click the entry in the real-time populated search drop-down box or you can finish typing this listing and click the ""Search"" button. This is your choice! They will both provide you with the same information.



, These fields include the business' name, business' address(including clicking the location-placemark on the map), City and state/province. There will be other boxes on this page; they can be filled out if you have access to this information, but they aren't volatile to the process (these will be mentioned in an upcoming step.


The business' name should be a correctly formatted name, as you would have seen it on it's name on the business' sign.
If the company doesn't have an exact numbered address (or is at an intersection of two criss-crossing streets), you may type in the closest street name to the business. The first street must go into the Address field and the cross street into the Cross Street field.
Be careful of addressing the business if the business has it's location in one area (such as a corporate location of a smaller company) while it's real location is someplace else. List the corporate address in the address fields while placing the map pin in the location of the business.
Watch out for bigger named-national/international-known businesses (McDonalds, Walmart and similar). Take the address of that particular store and never the corporate address of the store unless the item you'd like to add is the corporate headquarters.
If the place is inside of another place, you can add the location. Some examples could include a separate Emergency room entrance to a hospital or a store inside of a mall or outlet mall. These can be entered singly and don't violate the duplicate rule of adding new businesses.

, Find and click the Category field from this page. Tab down to set the category from the ""Category"" drop-down box from below.

The phone number you give, must be the phone number of the main business' switchboard operator or the main business number (if business own an automated telephone system).
If you can't populate a field in it's entirety, rather leave that field blank for these optional fields. There are many ways Foursquare Elite members and others looking to edit the database can help you edit the listing, but if it's not well explained or you can't figure it out what's best, you'll need to leave it entirely blank.

Play by the rules.,
Understand the meaning of ""enough is enough"".,
Limit your social networking posts.,
Avoid duplicate venues.,
Take the time to write out location tips.,
Add new venues or places that do not have a Foursquare page.,
Tell your friends about any special events offered through Foursquare.",How to Practice Foursquare Etiquette," The terminology for ""checking in"" is subject to some debate due to its varied meanings. Etiquette and rules make it an easy choice though:


Check in when you are physically at a place. Don't check in at forgotten past destinations or random places on your list to get points and badges.
Check in when you have spent a good amount of time at the specified location. Spending quality time in a restaurant, stadium, or movie theater would all be acceptable to jot down. However, passing by the location or standing outside of it isn't the point of Foursquare.
You'll only need to check into a place once a day towards mayorship. Making a check-in at 8 am and 9:30 pm in the same day is counted as one check-in.;
, Sharing places with others may be cool, but the world doesn't need to know every single place you're at. Checking into a certain supermarket multiple times may give people the impression that the location is convenient or that there is a valid reason to go there a lot (for example, it has better produce, better weekly sales, etc). Unknown and obscure places such as homes and offices are allowed by Foursquare rules, however, some people wish to play the game more fairly and are against such check-ins. Creating private venues not only provides very fast mayorships, but also clogs up the searches people do around their neighborhood or GPS area. And keeping home and work places private is always a prudent choice., If the place is somewhere you go on a regular basis, like work or a favorite coffee shop, consider disabling your network sharing for the time being. The last thing you want to do is clog up other people's feeds with mundane and repetitive places, which eventually could result in people removing you from their Twitter or Facebook accounts.

, Similar to private places, creating your own venue for a popular place makes it harder to play Foursquare. While this might mean that a person can take advantage of quick mayorships, it can confuse other players and cause them inconvenience. If a person realizes that they have checked into a fake venue, then they would have lost the time, points, and possible mayorship achievement.

, Whether it's informing readers about what to eat or not to eat, the nearest transportation options, or when to avoid crowded hours, leaving tip information makes it easier for future customers to enjoy the venue utilizing the knowledge of things to check out, things to avoid, etc.


Take time to upload pictures of unique things about the venue. Show people why you have checked into the venue.







, By adding new information to the website, you're helping to create a better and bigger community as a whole. ""Superuser tools"" allows the page creator to update the venue page as necessary.

, These events can range from store discounts, manager specials, or exclusive discounts to the current venue mayor.

Simply tap the “Ask friends” button when faced with new locked levels to send your requests. Send the requests to as many friends as you can to get your tickets faster. You only need three tickets from three friends.

, A little quid pro quo can extend your playing time. Every now and then, you’d be shown a window to give some friends lives and extra moves. Take these opportunities to give lives and extra moves for free. They may remember you when it’s their turn to give away lives and extra moves. You’d be surprised how many do give back.

, Candy Crush gives away a free booster daily. All you have to do is turn the wheel. On the game’s main screen, right below the number of lives, is a bubble with part of a wheel. Tap on this to bring out the Daily Booster Wheel.

, If you haven’t played today, the wheel will be turning. Tap the “Stop” button underneath it to stop the wheel. The turning will slow down until it stops fully.

, Wherever the arrow points when the wheel stops represents the booster you’ve won for the day. Each day’s a winner, so you don’t have to worry. The free booster will just vary depending on what you get.


Tap the “Claim prize” button to collect the booster.

, Right before you start a game level, you have an option to equip some boosters applicable to the game. These boosters will be displayed on top of the “Play” button. Tap the ones you’d like to use within the level.


The number of available boosters per type is clearly displayed.
Some boosters can be equipped within the level itself. These types of boosters can be accessed by tapping the appropriate icons on the upper-left portion of the game screen.
These free boosters are limited, so use them wisely.

, The basic way to remove candies from the board is to match three candies. Do this as your last option for every move. To move ahead and gain more points, you have to focus on doing combos.

, Combos are achieved when you’re able to trigger a cascade of matches after moving a candy. The more cascades you trigger, the higher the points you get.


Another way of getting combos is by matching four or more candies together. This will result in special candies, depending on the type of match or pattern you did.

, A Striped Candy is a special candy that results from matching four candies in a row. When you use a Striped Candy as part of a match, it will clear out a whole row or column from the board. The direction of the wipeout is dependent on what direction the stripes are on the candy.


Vertical Striped Candies are useful for Ingredient Levels since they can clear out a whole column of candies and allow the ingredient to fully drop to the bottom.
Striped Candies are also useful in removing jellies and chocolate, when placed in the right position.

, A Wrapped Candy is a special candy that results from matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. This one’s more challenging and difficult to get compared to a Striped Candy.


When you use a Wrapped Candy as part of a match, it will first explode and knock out the nine candies surrounding it, and then it will drop and explode again, knocking out another nine candies the same way.
Wrapped Candies can be useful in removing obstacles within their explosion area, which can otherwise be difficult to get to.

, A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place to swap with to form the five-in-a-row.


Color Bombs do not need to be matched in order to be used. You can just swap it with another candy, and all similar candies would be removed from the board. By itself, it doesn’t sound like achieving much, but when combined with another special candy, it will give you more awesome results.

, When you get two Striped Candies, regardless of colors and stripe directions, side by side, you can clear out a column and a row in one move, originating from where the combination was made. Imagine multiplying the effects of a Striped Candy by two.

, When you get a Striped Candy and a Wrapped Candy side by side, you can achieve the same thing as combining two Striped Candies, but with a damage thrice as big. It will clear out three rows and three columns in one move, originating from where the combination was made.

, When you get a Striped Candy and a Color Bomb side by side, you can convert all candies similar in color to the Striped Candy to Striped Candies with random stripes. The Color Bomb would then explode, and all the Striped Candies generated would burst out, clearing several columns and rows at once.


Depending on your level, this can be a game-changer. You can generate more Striped Candies by having some more candies of the same color drop before using the combo.

, When you get two Wrapped Candies side by side, you can get massive explosions, much bigger than individual Wrapped Candies exploding. Similar to a single Wrapped Candy, the explosions will happen twice.


Using this combo may not be as useful in achieving your level’s targets, but it is fun to do and generates bigger points. It can also be used to significantly clear out some blockers like jellies, licorice, and chocolate.

, When you get a Wrapped Candy and a Candy Bomb side by side, you can get an effect similar to two Candy Bombs, with the second explosion targeting a random color.


If a Candy Bomb by itself doesn’t do much good for your level, making this combo won’t do any good too.
This is one of the least useful combos in the game. You’re better off using them separately or combining them with other special candies.

, When you get two Candy Bombs side by side, you can wipe your board clean of candies. It’s basically a refresh of your board with new candies. This combo is very hard to get, but it’s extremely useful and fun to use.

, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Do you see a good move or two resulting to good combos or special candies? What obstacles are in play and can you do something quickly to remove them?

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead and exit. You won’t lose any life as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet. This is applicable to all types of levels, except for Timed levels.

, If your level has chocolate in it, aim to remove them first. Or at least, remove one square in every move. Otherwise, the chocolate will grow and multiply, and before you know it, your board’s full of them.


Remove the chocolate by making matches or combos beside them.
Some levels have chocolate fountains, which generate more chocolate. These can’t be removed, but you should attack the chocolate the same way.

, If your level has bombs in it, aim to remove them before the timers run out. When the timer runs out, the bombs will explode and you’ll fail the level.


Time bombs can be removed by matching them, just like any other candy. The timers represent the number of moves you have before they explode.

, Licorice swirls take spaces where candies can be. Unlike other blockers, these can be moved just like any candy. They can be removed by making matches or combos beside them.

, Licorice candies prevent the candies inside to be moved. They can only be removed by making matches with the locked candies or by executing special candies that can blow them out.

, Meringues are just like licorice swirls in that they take spaces where candies can be. The only difference is that they cannot be moved. They can be removed the same way, by making matches or combos beside them.

, Multi-layered meringues are more complex than the plain meringues. These require multiple hits to be cleared out. Hits can be achieved the same way, by making matches or combos beside them.

, Marmalades, like licorice candies, prevent the candies inside them to be moved. They can only be removed by making matches with the locked candies beside them or by executing special candies that can blow them out.

, Toffee tornadoes can be irritating as they run all over the board at random, destroying the candies in place. Each move will trigger them to relocate, creating damage to the squares on the board. With these running, they can disrupt whatever pattern you’re trying to build, though sometimes they can also help achieve what you want by eliminating some other blockers.


Toffee tornadoes cannot be removed by the normal matches and combos. They can only be cleared for five moves if hit by a special candy.

, Target Score levels are levels with a target minimum score to pass. You can beat this type of level by doing a lot of combos and executing those special candies.


Go for the combination of special candies to get bigger points.

, Jelly levels are levels that require you to remove all jellies on the board. Some levels will be harder as the jellies will come in multiple layers.


You can beat this type of level by focusing your matches and combos on the areas with jellies. Executing those special candies, like the Striped and the Wrapped Candies, will also help a lot.
Go for the combination of special candies, like the Striped and Wrapped Candies combo, the Striped Candy and Candy Bomb combo, or the two Wrapped candies combo, to wipe them out faster.

, Ingredient levels are levels that ask you to drop all the ingredients in play. There are two kinds of ingredients that can be used: cherries and hazelnuts. You can beat this type of level by focusing on removing the candies on the path of the ingredients to the bottom.


Horizontal Striped Candies on the same column as the ingredients will help a lot by clearing the whole column of candies.
Getting special candies in combo plays, like the Striped and the Wrapped Candies combo or the Striped Candy and Candy Bomb combo, can also result in getting the ingredients to fall faster.

, Timed levels are levels with a target minimum score that needs to be reached within the time limit. These levels have unlimited moves, so you need to work as fast as you can.


You can beat this type of level the same way as Target score levels, just faster.

, Candy Order levels are levels with certain candy objectives. Each level will ask for a certain number of candies cleared out. Some will ask for certain special candies or combos to be executed.


You can beat this type of level by focusing on the objectives, and not care too much about the points. Unless the objectives call for combos, going for them won’t do much good.
If you can complete your objectives before your moves run out, you can get additional bonus points from Sugar Crush, which executes multiple special candies by the factor of your remaining moves.

Look for opportunities to create as many striped horizontal candies as possible.,
Match candies in the isolated side columns at all times when moves are available.,
Wipe out licorice swirl blockers only when they’ll help you make matches that will clear jellies in the side columns.,
Try to make striped candies in the bottom rows before trying to create striped candies in the top rows.,
Detonate any color bombs you create using striped candies, if possible.",How to Beat Level 88 on Candy Crush," Striped horizontal candies can be used to help clear the double jelly squares located in both side columns, but only after the licorice swirls have cascaded onto the main playing board.Make striped horizontal candies by matching four candies of the same color in a row. The last candy must be moved left or right into the combination to result in horizontal stripes on the special candy.
Try not to detonate any striped horizontal candies until the licorice swirl blockers in their paths have cascaded onto the main playing board. Striped candies will not detonate licorice swirl blockers, and will not help you clear any jelly squares located underneath the licorice swirls.;
, If you cannot match candies in the side columns, you will be required to create horizontal striped candies or color bombs on the main playing board in order to clear the jelly squares located in the side columns.

, Level 88 only requires you to clear the double jelly squares; all licorice swirl blockers do not have to be cleared for you to pass the level., In many cases, making candy combinations in the bottom rows will result in extra matches, since cascading candies can make unexpected matches throughout the main playing board.

, Combining a color bomb with a striped candy with turn all candies on the board of the same color into striped candies, which will detonate and clear out all candies and jellies in the same rows and columns.Make color bombs by matching five colors of the same candy in a row.
Save any color bombs you make, and try to pair them with striped candies later on, if possible. Combining color bombs with striped candies and other color bombs can improve your odds of beating level 88.

Don't worry about the timers.,
Use bombs to your advantage.,
Focus on making special candy.,
Avoid simple moves.,
Focus on the bottom of the board.,
Don't worry about leftover candy.,
Keep trying.",How to Beat Level 97 on Candy Crush," Unless you have one that's about to go off in a few moves, you can generally ignore the timers and focus on making high-scoring moves. The bombs will often take care of themselves as more candies drop.Don’t worry about the bombs once you are on your last 7 moves. Since bombs go off after 8 moves, any new bombs that appear after this point will not go off before the level ends.;
, When you create a match using a bomb, you'll receive a 3000 point bonus. This bonus is absolutely crucial to completing this level, as you need to make an average of 4000 points per move to win., Creating special candy in this level is one of the best ways to ensure that your score reaches the minimum. Specials can clear out a lot of candies at once, netting you major points. You also get a bonus score for each bomb cleared in a special candy explosion.


If you create special candy combinations using bombs, or use a bomb to set off a special candy, you get even more bonus points. You can surf through this level on just these points alone if you can make enough special candy and bomb combinations.
Try to set off striped candy in rows and columns that have the most bombs. This is because clearing bombs is worth more points as compared to simple candy.

, You don't have a lot of moves available to reach your target score, so you'll want to avoid making simple combos as much as possible. These don't earn many points and are an inefficient use of your moves., If there is no bomb to take care of immediately, focus on making special candy or simple combinations at the bottom of the board. This can result in chain reactions as the higher up layers of candy move downwards.

, Set off as many special candy as you can during the level, but any leftover candy will be set off automatically at the end during the Sugar Crush. This can help push your score above the minimum score required.

, Like many of the difficult Candy Crush levels, a lot of your results will be based off pure luck. If you don't get a good board, there may be nothing you can do to meet the minimum. Keep at it!


Newer versions of Candy Crush Saga have made the level significantly easier, so make sure you update your app if you haven't in a while!

Focus on breaking several locked candies to reach the inside of the pyramid.,
Make as many combination moves as possible to create color bombs, striped candies, and wrapped candies.,
Break the locked candies only when you need better access to the jellies inside the pyramid.,
Focus on making as many candy matches as you can inside the pyramid after you've broken through the locked candy barriers.,
Match as many candies at the bottom of the pyramid before matching candies at the top, whenever possible.",How to Beat Level 86 in Candy Crush," The jellies you need cleared are inside the black licorice pyramid, and cannot be reached until you break several locked candies. Locked candies are marked with a black licorice X.;
, This will help you clear blockers and all 25 double jellies as quickly and efficiently as possible given you only have 40 moves to beat level 86.


Match five candies of the same color in a row to create color bombs. A color bomb will detonate all candies on the board of the same color you match it with.
Match four candies of the same color in a row to create striped candies. A striped candy will wipe all candies in the same row either horizontally or vertically, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing.
Match five candies of the same color in an L shape, T shape, or + shape to create wrapped candies. Wrapped candies will clear the surrounding eight candies in an explosion.

, The locked candies are not jellies, and do not necessarily need to be cleared to help you beat the level., The jellies that need clearing are inside the licorice pyramid.

, Matching candies at the bottom of the pyramid can sometimes help realign the candies above and result in extra unexpected matches within the same move."

, Find level 350 on the game map that appears, and hit the level button to continue into the board.

, Once you’re in, study how your board is laid out. Do you have any good moves that can get you some special candies early on? How about good matches that can break the meringues at the bottom?

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead an exit. You won’t lose a life as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet.

, The two candy cannons at both far-end columns will drop candy time bombs once the candies underneath them are freed up. Having candy time bombs in the mix will add some challenge as you need to diffuse them before they run out. This will take your focus and moves away from clearing the jellies, which is your main goal. Avoid the candy cannons, at least during the early moves, so you can focus on the jellies. ,, When detonated, wrapped candies will clear all surrounding eight candies, and help you break the icing and jellies at the bottom of the playing board. If possible, try to match wrapped + wrapped to clear double the amount of jellies.


Create wrapped candies by matching five same-colored candies in a T shape, L shape, or + shape.

, When matched with another candy, a color bomb will clear all other candies on the board of the same color, and improve your odds for making matches.


Create color bombs by matching five same-colored candies in a row.

, When detonated, striped candies will clear all candies from the same rows or columns, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing.


Create striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row. To create vertical striped candies that wipe out columns, move the fourth candy into the match in an upward or downward vertical direction; to create horizontal striped candies that wipe out rows, move the fourth candy into the match in a left or right horizontal direction.

, Whether you intentionally or accidentally unblock the candy cannons, you can use special candies to clear candy bombs and jellies simultaneously.Combine wrapped + stripped to clear all candy bombs and jellies from the surrounding three rows and three columns.
Combine color bomb + wrapped to turn all candies the same color as the wrapped candy into more wrapped candies that immediately detonate.
Combine color bomb + striped to turn all candies the same color as the striped candy into more striped candies that immediately detonate.
Combine color bomb + color bomb to wipe all existing candies and candy bombs from the playing board.

, Clearing the jellies at the bottom will result in candies cascading down from the top of the playing board, and can improve your odds for the creation of unexpected, automatic candy matches that can help clear additional jellies.

Prioritize vertical striped candies.,
Use wrapped/striped combos to hit the middle section.,
If you can, focus on the chocolate first.,
Don't forget to look for combinations in the middle section.,
Use color bombs if many jelly squares are the same color.,
If you have no other moves, clear candy near the bottom of the board.",How to Beat Level 77 in Candy Crush Saga1," The major difficulty in this level is that the spaces you have the most control over — the ones at the top and bottom — aren't the ones that you have jelly in them. Since the middle section isn't connected to the rest of the board, use the top and bottom of the board to your advantage by making vertical striped candies whenever you get the chance.


Keep in mind that vertical striped candies are made by making horizontal rows of four. Making vertical rows of four will give you horizontal striped candies, which aren't very useful on this board because they can't hit the middle section.Note that there are nine spaces in the center section, each containing two-layer jelly. That's 18 squares of jelly total that you need to clear — since you only have 25 turns to work with, if you were to only use vertical striped candy, you'd need to use one on all but seven turns (on the correct spaces, no less!) This isn't realistic — it's much easier to win if you also work on getting some super combos.;
, Combinations of wrapped and striped candies are your most useful assets on this stage. These combos clear three rows and three columns in a large ""cross"" pattern, which means that they can hit three jelly spaces in the middle at a time. Unfortunately, it can take several moves to set up a wrapped/striped combo, so don't waste moves going for these if you're running short on time.


One of the best possible moves you can make on this level is to trigger a wrapped/striped combo on the right side of the board near the beginning of the game. If you align it correctly, you can clear the chocolate and the locked square in a single turn. Not bad!
Keep in mind that wrapped/striped combos fire on the square that you swap to, not the first square you touch.

, The chocolate that starts at the right side of the middle section is your number one enemy in this level. If you don't deal with it as soon as it starts spreading, it can quickly devour the whole middle section, making it very difficult to beat the level. For this reason, it's best to clear the chocolate with a few vertical striped candies or a wrapped/striped combo as soon as you can.


Try to clear the chocolate before you even break the locked block. While it's possible to clear the chocolate once it's started to spread, this is almost always more difficult and time-consuming.
Keep in mind that you don't necessarily have to hit the chocolate itself: clearing a candy (but not a locked space, etc.) next to a chocolate square will clear the chocolate.

, While it's good to look for vertical striped candies and wrapped/striped combos on the top and bottom of the board, don't forget that you'll sometimes get combos in the middle section of the board as well. In fact, in terms of moving you towards your goal, getting a single horizontal three-in-a-row in the middle is just as valuable as a wrapped/striped combo (and uses less moves to execute!) Thus, you'll always want to give the middle a quick glance at the start of your turn to see if there are any good moves before moving on to the outer sections.


In fact, if you can form two three-in-a-rows in a single turn (somewhat rare but perfectly possible), you can clear six jelly spaces at once. That's twice as many as you'd clear with a wrapped/striped combo in a fraction of the number of moves you'd use, so don't pass these opportunities up!

, Color bombs — formed by getting five candies of the same color in a row — can be useful in certain situations, but aren't essential, so think before making them. If you see that you can form a color bomb in one turn and use it to clear a color that appears in the middle row often on the next turn, it's probably worth it.


On the other hand, if it would take many turns to make a color bomb and use it effectively, it may be a better use of your time to search for alternative moves.

, If you don't have any productive moves to make on your turn at all, it's almost always better for you to clear candy at the bottom of the board than it is to clear candy at the top. This is because when you clear candy at the bottom, there are more candies above it that shift, increasing the chance that a cascade will occur. This in turn increases the chance that you'll get a special candy (and, even if you don't, you'll still get more points from the cascade effect.)

"
"
Don't waste time trying to get new blocks in the center section.,
Don't use wrapped candies except for striped/wrapped combos.,
Don't let the chocolate get out of control.,
Don't forget about the point limit.",How to Beat Level 77 in Candy Crush Saga2," It's important to note that there are no teleportation panels at the top or bottom of any of the squares in the middle section. This means that clearing candies anywhere outside of the middle section won't effect the candies in the middle. The only way to get new candies in the middle is by clearing candies there either directly or with a striped candy, wrapped/striped combo, or striped/striped combo.

, On their own, wrapped candies are useless in this level — their explosion range isn't big enough to affect the middle section where the jelly and chocolate are. Thus, you won't want to waste moves making them unless you plan to use them in a wrapped/striped combo or use them to trigger a vertical striped candy.



However, in the rare even that you can get a wrapped/wrapped combo, use it! The massive explosion radius should be able to hit a large area of the middle section at least once (unless you trigger it at the bottom of the board.)

, Once the chocolate spreads throughout the middle section, it can be very hard to finish the level, since this essentially adds another layer that you need to ""break"" through before you can start clearing jelly. Your best bet is to keep the chocolate from spreading until you have a vertical stripe or two ready to deal with it.


This means that you shouldn't break the locked square before you're ready to clear the chocolate. You can clear jelly on the left and you should clear the chocolate on the right before you hit the lock, but once the lock is broken, you need to be ready to clear the chocolate right away or you may find yourself in a very difficult situation.

, Nothing is more crushing than clearing all of the jelly in this level only to fail because you haven't gotten enough points. Though the one-star marker is positioned fairly low on the point meter, it's still possible to finish the level without the 50,000 points needed to reach it, so pay attention to the points you're accumulating throughout the level.


Keep in mind that, since you get a point bonus for each unused turn at the end of the level, it's almost always best to finish early, rather than waste turns trying to set up massive combos.

Reset the stage until you get a good layout.,
Consider starting with a booster you've previously earned.,
Watch gameplay videos of level 77.",How to Beat Level 77 in Candy Crush Saga3," This trick works for the mobile version of the game, not the browser version. If you start the level and you don't see any good moves, stop. Before you make any moves, hit the ""back"" button on your phone, and, if prompted about whether you truly want to exit, tap ""yes."" You should be back on the map screen. Re-enter the level and you'll have a different random assortment of blocks, but you'll still have the same number of lives! Use this to your advantage by resetting until you get a favorable selection of blocks at the start of the level (like, for instance, an easy setup for a vertical striped candy on the right side of the board.)


To be clear: you can reset the board by backing out of the level without making any moves and entering it again. This costs no lives. However, once you make a move, it will cost you a life to reset the level.


, If you've been using the Daily Booster Wheel, you will probably have at least a few boosters saved up. On level 77, you can use three: striped and wrapped candies, jellyfish, and color bomb. Each will give you an advantage — see below for more information.


Striped and wrapped candies: if you get a vertical striped candy, you'll be able to use it to hit the middle section. If your striped and wrapped candies drop near to each other, you can even combine them to get a valuable wrapped/striped combo.
jellyfish: arguably the best choice for this level. jellyfish automatically clear three jelly squares at random. Since some of the jelly squares in this level can be hard to hit, this can be very valuable. A smart strategy is to save your fish until the end of the level so that they'll have a better chance of hitting the squares you want them to.Color bomb: See the information on color bombs above. These can be valuable if there are lots of candies in the middle that are the same color.

, It's one thing to read about ways to beat level 77 — seeing these tips and tricks in action can make them much easier to grasp. Luckily, there are dozens of helpful videos out there full of tips for beating level 77 (and virtually every other difficult Candy Crush Saga level.)

Take out the chocolate.,
Take out the frosting.,
Shoot for cascading combos.,
Finished.

",How to Beat Level 79 on Candy Crush Saga,"


The chocolate is going to have to go first, as it can quickly get out of hand if you aren't careful.
If you're playing on Android or iOS, you can reshuffle the board (without losing a life) by existing and reentering before you make your first move on the board.
Do this as many times as possible until you have the two matches necessary to remove the chocolate.;
,


Watch out for the teleporter, as it's going to make that center row with the frosting really tricky.
Try to make horizontal combos to take out these squares. Or better yet, a vertical combo. Just make sure to get it within the teleporter lines.
Wrapped candies can also do the trick.

,


After the middle of the board is dealt with, or if you have very few options, you should try to work the bottom of the board, mostly in vertical matches, to try to force cascading combos. This is your best bet.
Take advantage of special candies. If you get special candies, try to maneuver them into useful positions.
Candy bombs are obviously going to be your friend here.

Shoot for a color bomb/striped combo.,
Be careful of setting off combinations above your ingredients.,
Don't waste moves chasing horizontal striped candies.,
If you're struggling to clear the level, don't worry about points.,
Don't give up in the face of bad luck.",How to Beat Level 76 on Candy Crush Saga," Notice that there are three different gameplay areas — two small ones on the left and a larger one on the right — divided by teleportation lines. The candy follows a predictable path as it moves through the level:



First, candy appears in the bottom left area.

Next, as pieces are cleared, candy moves through the bottom left area and falls into the board on the right.

Finally, the candy moves through the the top left board before exiting.
Thus, the ""bottom"" of the board is actually the bottom of the top left area — somewhat confusing!;
, Since you have a limited number of turns at your disposal, it's important to make every move count. This means making the most of the teleports to move your ingredients towards the exits in the top left.


Clearing candies in the bottom left area will make only the candies above them in the bottom left area move.
Clearing candies in the right area will make the candies above them in the right area and the candies in the bottom left area move.
Clearing candies in the top left area will make the candies above them in the top left area, the candies in the top right area, and the candies in the bottom left area move.
Thus, making matches in the top left area is often the most effective way to get your ingredients closer to the exit.

, If you haven't dealt with special candies and teleports before, you may have a few factors to consider in this level. See below:


Striped candies and wrapped/striped combos won't work through a teleport. In other words, if you set off a vertical striped candy in the bottom left area, it will hit candies in the two left areas, but not any on the right.
Wrapped candies won't fall through teleports unless the candies ""underneath"" them on the other side get cleared for some other reason. In other words, if you set off a wrapped candy in the bottom row of the right area, it will clear the candies around it, but it won't fall into the top left area.
Color bombs work normally.

, You only have 33 turns on this level. That may seem like a lot, but if you're not careful, you can easily find yourself left with just a few turns left and multiple ingredients left on the board. Luckily, the areas on the right side of the stage and (especially) the top left side of the stage will move a lot more candy than clearing in the bottom left area, helping you to make the most of your moves.


For example, if you have one cherry on the board in the far right column of the bottom left area and you don't have any great combinations on the board to make specials, try clearing candies in the far right row of either the area on the right or the area in the top left so that your cherry will at least make progress towards the exit.
There are, however, exceptions to this rule. For instance, it's often worth it to get a special candy even if this doesn't clear candy underneath your ingredients (especially if this special can knock one or more ingredients off the board.)

, On most ingredients levels, new ingredients usually enter the level when the ones that are on the board are cleared (though they will sometimes drop seemingly at random — the Candy Crush community has not determined exactly what will consistently trigger the release of a new ingredient.)Level 76 is no exception. This means that it's in your interest to clear each cherry as quickly as possible — the next one won't show up until you deal with the one you already have.

, Used correctly, vertical striped candies can help get your cherries those crucial last few spaces to the exit. Try to set off vertical striped candies on either of the areas on the left side of the screen so that they're lined up with your cherries — since they'll hit all of the candies in one of the top left columns, they can move your cherries up to four spaces towards the exit.


For instance, let's say that you have a cherry in the second row of the right area. If you can fire a vertical stripe candy in the second row of either of the areas on the left, your cherry will move four spaces towards the exit — not bad.

, Wrapped candies can be a huge help in this level if you're able to maneuver them into the top left area. Since they clear a 3 x 3 square twice, setting one off in the right place can move your candy up to six squares towards the exit, which is quite good.


Though rare, a wrapped/wrapped combo in the top left area is even better. Since the 5 x 5 explosion will clear most of the entire top left area twice, any cherries on the board can potentially move up to eight spaces towards the exit.This will often be enough to clear them off the board entirely.

, Though this isn't a hard and fast rule, opportunities for moving the ingredients into the two center columns and away from the edges are things you should keep an eye out for. This provides you with the most possible combinations for keeping the ingredients moving downwards and off the board since the middle two columns have candies on both side to make moves with rather than just one side.


It's also a good to get into the habit of moving ingredients away from the edges of the level. Though it isn't absolutely essential here, on future ingredients levels it can be easy to accidentally drop ingredients into corners that they are very tough to get out of, so make a point early to keep them moving towards the center.

, When you mix a striped candy and a wrapped candy, you'll create a combo which clears three rows and three columns in a cross pattern. This can be very useful on this particular game board, especially if you're luck enough to hit the candies in the top left area with it. However, this needs to be done as quickly as possible, so as not to use up moves.

, Perhaps the single most useful combo you can get in this level (besides the extra-rare color bomb/color bomb combo) is to combine a color bomb and a striped candy. This will create random striped candies all over the board on the candies that are the same color as the striped candy you used. Generally, this will clear most if not all of the board very quickly, which often means you'll clear one or more cherries off the board in a single move.

, On this level, it's more important than normal to pay attention to the placement of your moves. Try to avoid making matches that don't move your cherries towards the exit (or, in other words, matches that lie above your cherries.) There may be times when you have to do this (especially when your ingredients have almost reached the end), but these moves shouldn't be your priority since they don't get you closer to beating the level.


For this reason, you'll almost always want to avoid making matches in the bottom left section entirely. An exception to this is if you can make a valuable special candy, especially one like a vertical striped piece that can hit the pieces in the top left.

, In general, vertical striped candies are more highly prized in this level than horizontal striped candies because, with their ability to clear an entire vertical column, they can get an ingredient many spaces closer to the exit. By contrast, horizontal striped candies will usually only get an ingredient a single space closer to the exit. Often, this isn't worth the extra moves needed to get the horizontal striped candy in the first place.


As always, however, there are exceptions. For instance, if you can line up a horizontal striped candy with the last row of candy above the exit, you can use it to get your ingredients past that crucial last space.

, With 30,000 points required for one star, level 76 doesn't have particularly demanding point requirements. If you're having a hard time balancing your efforts to create point-winning combos and clear all of the ingredients, try forgetting about points and focusing only on clearing the cherries. Odds are that you'll probably get enough points from this alone to clear the 30,000 mark.


Note that when you clear an ingredients level, a random striped candy appears on the board for each turn you have in reserve. These special striped candies score 3,000 points apiece when they fire (not counting any additional points from cascades that are triggered as a result), so clearing the board as quickly as possible is a great way to rack up major points., Unfortunately, unless you're willing to shell out cash for bonuses, a good amount of your success in Candy Crush Saga will be determined by luck. The candies that fall onto the board are completely random — it's possible to simply ""be dealt a bad hand"" and to get stuck in a situation where beating the level it difficult if not impossible. Don't give up! Stick with the strategies above and you'll beat level 76 in no time.

",How to Beat Level 65 on Candy Crush," As with any challenging Candy Crush stage, your first few moves can make a huge difference in your prospects for victory. Because this is the case, you may want to experiment with exiting, then re-entering the stage until you see a good first move. For instance, if you see that you can't make any special candy or eliminate any chocolate on your first move, you may want to restart until you can. Doing this won't cost you any lives.


Note, however, that this trick only works on the mobile version of Candy Crush, not on the browser-based version. It also won't work if you've made any moves at all - you have to do it before your very first move, or you'll lose a life.;
, The chocolate squares in this level will spread by one space each turn that you don't eliminate at least one of them. Left unchecked, the chocolate will impede your jelly-clearing progress and restrict the moves you can make, so you'll want to completely eliminate it as soon as you can. Try to clear every square of chocolate from the board within your first few moves. Start with the chocolate on the bottom of the board, as moves at the bottom are more likely to form chain reactions than moves at the top. With luck, your chain reactions may form special candy pieces or clear other chocolate squares.


Try to make moves that clear multiple squares of chocolate at once. For instance, it's possible to clear two squares at the bottom of the board at once with a basic three-in-a-row move.






It's worth noting that, if you see a particularly good move, such as one that nets you multiple special candies, it can be worth it to ignore the chocolate for a turn or two. Your main objective should simply to clear it as quickly as possible.







, When you remove all the chocolate or if you cannot remove chocolate in your current move, try to free up the “caged” candy. Because these candies are somewhat difficult to reach, it's wise to jump at the chance to free them whenever you get it early on. Again, it is best to focus on the lower half of the board first as you can potentially create useful chain reactions by doing this.


As above, it can be worth it to skip freeing a caged candy if it means making another move that's particularly useful.

, Clearing the jelly in the center of the stage isn't an issue here - the sixteen jelly spaces along the board's ""toothed"" outside edge are what make this level so hard. You'll generally want to prioritize striped candies over wrapped ones because striped candies can hit the edges of the board with less need for careful positioning. However, as you'll see, there are exceptions to this strategy.

, Vertically striped candy can help remove the rightmost and leftmost columns of chocolate, cages, and jelly (depending on what’s left there). This is by far the easiest way to clear these columns. However, placing a vertically striped candy in the right or left-most column is quite difficult and requires tricky maneuvering.

, Vertically striped candy in the middle of the board can clear the tough-to-reach top row. Since these squares are where new candy entering the gameplay area first appears, you cannot predict the next candies to fall, making it basically impossible to set up combinations. Thus, the best way to remove these squares is by using striped candy.

, Horizontally striped candy can hit any square along the sides of the board, but are most useful in the bottom row. Unlike the side columns, it's relatively simple to position a striped candy in the bottom row by forming a vertical row of four candies that reaches into the bottom row or by forming a striped candy nearby and shifting into one of the bottom squares.

, Though striped candies are your best friends in this level, wrapped candies can sometimes be useful as well. If you can form a wrapped candy along one of the edges of the board, for instance, detonating it will hit one of the hard-to-reach edge squares twice and another once - all in all, not bad. However, if you see the chance to make a wrapped candy in the center of the board, make a striped candy instead. Clearing the center of the board isn't that difficult in this stage, so you're better off with a long-range striped candy.


If you're lucky enough to get two wrapped candies next to each other near one of the stage's edges, combine them! The resulting combination clears a large block of squares and detonates twice, which means you'll clear lots of edge squares.

, Your best bet for success in level 65 is to make as many color bomb + striped candy combos as possible. This combination packs a huge punch and will turn all candy of the same color as the striped candy into striped candy, then set them off one by one. This can help clear many edge spots in one move.


Though almost any color bomb + striped candy combo will be a big help, if you have the chance, combine your color bomb with a striped candy that's the same color as the most common candy in the outer edge of the board. This will increase the number of striped candies that form in the outer edge, giving you a better chance of clearing the outside edge entirely.

,"
"
Clear the edges.,
Remember that there are four tough jelly covered squares.,
Focus on the tough spots mentioned.",How to Beat Level 35 on Candy Crush," The outside edges of the game board might only have one jelly layer each, but they are tough to get to as there are fewer combinations available on the edges. Before you make any move, look to these edges and see if you can clear jelly there first.;
, These squares are located in the center of the board, in a vertical column, but each square only touch two other squares, and that too only horizontally. This means at any given time, there are only two other squares next to each of these you can use to help clear jelly. The easiest way to remove this entire column of jelly is by making a vertically striped jelly in one of these squares. When it is set off, it will clear all 4 squares of jelly.

, You will find yourself clearing the remainder of the board through chain reactions. Before you make a move, check and see if you can clear a square on the edge or in the central column first. If you can’t, start making combinations at the bottom of the board to maximum chain reaction potential.

"
"
Remember that not every stone has jelly under it, and the goal is to clear the jelly.,
Focus on combinations that are adjacent to the stones.

,
Use wrapped candy to clear a 3x3 area.,
Use color bombs effectively.,
Use Striped jelly to clear rows where possible.",How to Beat Level 28 on Candy Crush," Only two of the stones have double-jelly under them, and these are both in the vertical column running through the middle of the board. This means that while you need to focus on clearing out the stones as well (since the jelly squares are sandwiched between them) that is not the main purpose of this level.;
,, Make sure to use these at the bottom of the board, near jelly. Don’t waste them on clearing out squares that have no jelly in them.

, Using one as soon as it's created is not the best idea, since down the line you might find a piece of jelly that you can't clear otherwise. Wait till you've run out of all other options and then strategically use it to clear jelly that cannot be cleared. In the screenshot below, a color bomb that was made when there were eleven moves yet was used in the last few moves to remove the blue candy to help clear out the gameboard.

, Since they can clear out an entire row or column, they can be very useful in a level with such few allowed moves.

You can equip boosters on the screen where you see the “Start” button. So before you press “Start,” check out the boosters available for you to use. They can be found on the area above the “Start” button.;
, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Do you see good moves to quickly get a Striped Candy or two? Do you see a Color Bomb in the making somewhere? Do you see some good combos that would unfreeze the Striped Candies from the jelly?


If you believe the board is good, you can proceed to Part 2.

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead and exit. You won’t lose any life as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet.

, There’s a T-shaped set of meringue in the middle of the board. This prevents candies from reaching the lower part. The candies are then just found on the upper half of the board. To get the most out of this level, you need to get rid of the meringues to get some space and additional candies in play.

, On the key parts of this T-shaped set of meringue are some Striped Candies frozen in jelly. These Striped Candies, when unfrozen, can aid you in removing the block made by the meringues. Unfreeze the jellies by making a combo with it included or just touching it.

, Once the Striped Candies have been unfrozen, use them to remove the meringues. With a little more moves, you can remove the meringues and open up the lower half of the board for more candies.

, Look for moves that will give you Striped Candies. You need ten of these to pass the level. Five of these are already available, and if you have unfrozen them already, then you’re halfway there.

, Look for ways to generate a Candy Bomb by matching five candies in a row. This is the special candy you need to beat this level and get high points.


If you want to be sure you have this special candy in play, you can opt to equip it before you even begin the level.

, If you’re able to get the Candy Bomb, place a Striped Candy beside it. Combine the two to make an incredible combo play. Doing so will most likely get you done with this level as you will definitely exceed the required number of Striped Candies.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move.

If you also didn’t get a Candy Bomb in play, there’s still hope. With the lower part of the board opened up, there will definitely be lots of moves to generate the needed Striped candies.

Begin by clearing multiple candies from the main playing board in the center.,
Look for opportunities to create as many striped horizontal candies as possible.,
Try to match striped candies with wrapped candies whenever possible.,
Match color bombs with striped candies whenever possible.,
Avoid detonating color bombs by matching them with regular candies.",How to Beat Level 181 on Candy Crush," This will help make room for the creation of striped horizontal candies, wrapped candies, and color bombs -- all of which are special combinations that can help detonate the icing blocking the cherries in the two side columns.


Try to make multiple striped vertical candies to help clear the icing on the main playing board. Vertical striped candies can be created by matching four candies of the same color in a row, as long as you move the last piece into the combination up or down in a vertical direction. Vertical striped candies can help clear entire columns of candies and icing, and allow cascading candies to fall into the columns and eliminate more candies.;
, While wrapped candies and color bombs can also be helpful in level 181, striped horizontal candies are required to help you beat the level without boosters.


Match four candies of the same color in a row to create a striped candy, making sure you move the last piece into the combination in a horizontal direction to form horizontal stripes on the candy., When combined, striped candies and wrapped candies will clear all candies from the three surrounding rows and three surrounding columns, eliminating a significant number of candies and icing. This special candy combination will also help clear the icing below the cherries in both side columns.


Make wrapped candies by matching five candies of the same color in a T shape, L shape, or + shape.

, When matched with a striped candy, a color bomb will turn all candies of the same color into striped candies that wipe out all candies in the same rows and columns. This special candy combination is another useful way to clear the icing below the cherries in the sidebars.

, Since the cherries are being blocked by icing and not candies, color bombs won’t necessarily help bring down the cherries. Only detonate color bombs if you can combine them with striped or wrapped candies, or if detonating them will help you make striped horizontal candies.

Allow chocolate to spread and cover the bomb dispenser until you’re ready to clear all chocolate covering jellies near the end of the level.",How to Beat Level 275 in Candy Crush," The bomb dispensers will release eight-move time bombs, which will require you to clear the bombs using moves you could have otherwise used to clear jellies.;
, When matched with one another, the jelly fish will swim on-screen, and break select jellies at random, or turn select candies into striped candies., Special candy combos such as color bomb + striped can clear the meringues too early in the game, and result in the release of timed bombs that may prevent you from passing level 275 in 45 moves or fewer.

, Vertical striped candies will help clear the candies and jellies from these columns without clearing the corner meringues blocking the bomb dispensers.Create vertical striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, while moving the fourth candy into the match in an upward or downward vertical direction.

, Keeping the bomb dispensers blocked will allow you to use more moves to clear jellies, instead of forcing you to use moves on clearing time bombs."

Create vertical striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, moving the fourth candy into the match upward or downward in a vertical direction.;
, Matching a color bomb with a striped candy will turn all candies on the board of the same color into striped candies as well, which will immediately detonate and wipe out all candies in the same rows and columns.Create color bombs by matching five of the same-colored candies in a row.

, The ingredients will drop onto the playing board into the same columns that contain the drop zones. Moving ingredients into columns without drop zones could result in your having to use extra moves to reposition the ingredients into columns with drop zones., Horizontal striped candies will be effective at helping you clear the five-layer icing and licorice locks blocking the teleporters to the drop zones.Create horizontal striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, moving the fourth candy into the match left or right in a horizontal direction.

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead and exit. You won’t lose any life as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet.

, Start by matching candies beside the meringue blocks to weaken and remove them. You will need four hits on these blocks to remove them.


Go for possible combos involving four or five candies in a row if you can.

, Aim your hits near the same area as much as possible. Once you’ve penetrated the meringue blocks, candies can get inside the middle part with the jelly squares.

, With some candies inside the middle part, it will be easier to remove more of the meringue blocks. You will also be able to start removing some jelly squares in the process.

, With more meringue blocks freed up, the spaces can now be occupied by more candies. With more spaces on the board, you will be able to make more combos with the candies and maybe generate some special candies too., At the top of the jelly squares are three vertically Striped Candies frozen in marmalade. Get these freed up as soon as you can. These will go a long way in removing the jelly squares in the middle.

, Look for moves that will give you Striped candies. Get vertically Striped Candies in the middle with the jelly squares or horizontally Striped Candies.


Create Striped Candies by matching four candies in a row.

, This can be harder to make, but not impossible. Look for opportunities to do so. Using the Wrapped candies as bombs can really make the jelly squares go away faster.


Create Wrapped Candies by matching at least 3 vertical candies with 3 horizontal candies.

, If you can, put a Striped Candy and a Wrapped Candy together. The best place to have this combo is in the middle part with all the jelly squares. If you’re lucky, you can get a lot of jelly squares this way.

, Look for ways to generate a Candy Bomb by matching five candies in a row. It’s always useful to have this special candy. It’s extra special if you can combine it with a Striped candy to do more damage.

, If you’ve equipped the level with the Jellyfish booster, use this when you can. Jellyfish target jelly squares randomly, so it won’t hurt to have them available.


This booster can also be combined with a Striped Candy, a Wrapped Candy, or a Candy Bomb to do more damage.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move. Keep your focus on the jelly squares."

, When matched with another candy, a color bomb will clear all candies on the board of the same color, and help increase the number of matches you can make to create wrapped and striped candies.Create color bombs by matching five same-colored candies in a row.

, The candy bombs in level 245 have a 12-move timer, which means the bombs won’t detonate unless you fail to clear them by move 12. Spend more time focusing on creating wrapped + striped matches, and less time trying to detonate all bombs on the board as soon as they appear.


Some players admit that having to watch for candy bombs in level 245 helps identify possible matches that lead to the creation of wrapped candies. Take a moment to scan the playing board after every move to determine whether detonating a candy bomb will help you make a wrapped candy.

, Mystery candies are egg-shaped pieces of candies labeled with question marks that leave behind random mystery items when cleared. Mystery items can either be helpful in the form of wrapped candies, striped candies, and color bombs, or can hinder your gameplay in the form of licorice blockers, chocolate, or layered meringues. Since the goal of level 245 is to collect five wrapped + striped combos, clearing mystery candies could result in the appearance of extra wrapped or striped candies that can help you beat the level., Wrapped candies are often more difficult to make since they require the matching of five candies versus four candies. While you may be tempted to make a striped candy whenever you see the opportunity, check to see if there are opportunities to make wrapped candies, first., This can help prevent you from accidentally detonating other nearby wrapped candies after matching wrapped + striped."

"
Be friendly, not creepy.,
Don’t just say “Hi.” Remember, the idea behind Tinder is to match with as many attractive people as possible, and to find someone in that pile that you can get along with.,
Pay attention to their profile.,
Ask a question.,
That being said, avoid yes-or-no questions.,
Leave the compliments until later in the conversation, particularly if you are a man talking to a woman.,
Don’t keep talking about yourself!,
If you have mutual friends or interests, mention them!,
Pay attention to their language.",How to Strike Up a Conversation on Tinder," Making an overtly sexual remark will only creep your partner out, and may get yourself blocked. Keep the R-rated comments out of the chat room.;
, If you want to stand out in someone’s pile, you’ll have to say something more interesting than a regular old greeting. “Hello” is impersonal and uninteresting, and you’re unlikely to get a response back.

, You can probably say something that catches their eye if you ask them something about their interests or comment on a quote that they’ve included in their bio.


Something as simple as “It says on your profile that you went to Stanford? That’s a gorgeous place. What did you study?” will show that you’ve paid attention to their profile, as well as taken a personal interest in them.

, Engaging someone in a conversation is much easier if you give them something to say. In the above example, if you only said, “You went to Stanford? That’s a gorgeous place” and ended your message there, your match will have little to say other than “Yes, it is.” By finishing off with a question about their life, you can express your interest, as well as naturally start a conversation and come off as a sincerely nice person.

, Open-ended questions will tell you more about the person, as well as give you more material to work with when following up with their answer. “What movies do you like?” will be much more conducive to having an engaging conversation than “Do you like comedy films?”

, Compliments may help you woo someone, but it’s more practical to start a conversation first before you start talking looks. Many women, even on dating apps, are easily off-put by comments on their physical appearance, even if they are markedly nonsexual. Your match is likely used to being bombarded by inappropriate comments from men she hardly knows. You will want to distance yourself from these people as much as possible. Strike up a friendly conversation before letting her know, “I just want to say that you have a gorgeous smile.” Even a benign, vague compliment such as a comment about someone’s smile or eyes will seem personal and intimate if you precede it with a friendly, interesting conversation.

, It’s alright to answer any questions about yourself, or offer your own parallels (you went to Stanford? That’s great, I went to Duke), but you want to engage the other person as much as possible. The easiest way to do that is to ask questions about their life. This will show that you have a genuine interest in them.

, Asking how they know so-and-so can help forge a connection between the two of you, as well as tell you something about their history as well.

, It’s much harder to gauge someone’s interest over Tinder, when you can’t assess their body language or tone of voice. Still, you can get a pretty good idea of how they feel about you by how they respond.


If they’re giving you one word answers, or are barely answering your questions and offering little else to the conversation, they’re likely not too interested in talking to you.
On the other hand, if they’re truly engaged in the conversation and providing long responses, as well as asking you questions about your life, chances are that they’re interested in you too.
If someone doesn’t respond to your message, they’re not interested. Don’t message them persistently.
Generally, you should go by the “he’s just not that into you” rule: if someone seems like they’re not interested, they’re genuinely not interested. Move on.

Get rid of any bombs ASAP.,
Get rid of the Chocolate.,
Clear Blue candies.,
Make Wrapped candies.,
Keep trying.",How to Beat Level 165 on Candy Crush," The bombs in Level 165 will explode after seven turns if they are not removed. An exploding bomb will immediately end the level, regardless of what else is going on. Because bombs are so high-risk, clearing the bombs should be your top priority.


Bombs are colored, and can be cleared by being included in combos.;
, Ignore your candy orders for a moment and focus on clearing out some of the chocolate that's blocking your board. Chocolate will automatically multiply, taking up space that could be used by candies. If you leave the Chocolate unchecked, you will soon find your board consumed. You can clear Chocolate by making any matches next to a Chocolate square.


Clearing the Chocolate on the top of the board is the most crucial task you have. If the top of the board gets blocked, you won't be able to get new candies.Every time you make a move that doesn't clear a Chocolate, a new one will appear.
It doesn't matter whether Chocolates are removed by direct or indirect moves, as long as you can open spaces for new candies.
Striped and Wrapped candies are great for clearing out large amounts of chocolate at once.

, Your Green and Yellow candy orders will almost always get filled automatically through cascades and other indirect clearings. This means that your Blue orders should take priority, since you have to make so many more of them.


Once you are low on Blues, make combos that will clear out other candies. Color bombs are useful for removing unnecessary candy colors, which will leave more room for Blue ones.

, Wrapped (special) candies will give you a greater chance in completing this level. When you make special candies, try to save them to use them on Blue candy. This will help you reach your goal much quicker.


You can make Wrapped candies by forming an ""L""-shape with five pieces, or a ""t""-shape with five candies.

, Every board is random, and there is a chance you will end with a brutal board to begin with. Some boards are even impossible, because they simply won't provide enough Blue candies to complete the order. Refreshing the board may help you by offering a better starting situation.


This level is particularly tricky, and very few people are lucky enough to pass it on the first, second, or even tenth try. Keep trying, and you are bound to run into a good board with enough blue candies."

Clear the seven meringue blockers that separate the bottom half of the level from the top half.,
Focus solely on creating multiple color bombs.,
Avoid creating striped and wrapped candies after creating one or more color bombs.",How to Beat Level 153 on Candy Crush," This will expand the playing board, and result in the cascading of candies as they drop to fill in the bottom half of the board. In some cases, the cascading of candies can result in unexpected matches that produce color bombs and other special candies.


Try to create one or more vertical striped candies, which can help clear the meringue blockers at the top, as well as those located in the three bottom rows of the lower half of the board. Vertical striped candies can be made by matching four candies of the same color in a row, while moving the fourth piece of candy upward or downward into the combination.;
, To beat level 153, you must collect one color bomb, as well as one color bomb combination, which is the matching of two color bombs.


Make color bombs by matching five candies of the same color in a row.
Hold off on making matches that create striped and wrapped candies after breaking the meringues, since these candies can be saved for the creation of color bombs later on.

, Striped and wrapped candies can accidentally detonate when you match other candies, and can wipe out any color bombs you might be saving for a color bomb combination."

Match the candies at the bottom half of the level first, if possible.,
Focus on breaking the five icing squares located in the middle of the top layer of icing.,
Look for opportunities to create one or more special candies after clearing the top five icing squares.,
Make vertical striped candies in the columns that contain chocolate.,
Clear licorice blockers by breaking candies located next to the blockers.,
Look for opportunities to match color bombs with striped candies, or color bombs with wrapped candies after clearing icing squares and licorice blockers.",How to Beat Level 123 on Candy Crush," There are two rows of double-jelly candies surrounded by licorice blockers and icing. Breaking these candies can help you get off to a great start, especially since these moves will clear double jelly squares., This may also allow you to work on clearing a high number of double jelly squares without breaking chocolate. After you clear the first chocolate square, the chocolate will grow on the board one square at a time unless you break at least one piece of chocolate per move., Special candies such as striped candies, wrapped candies, and color bombs will help wipe and clear chocolate, icing, and nearby licorice blockers.


Create a color bomb by matching five candies of the same color in a row. A color bomb detonates all existing candies of the same color you match it with.
Create a striped candy by matching four candies of the same color in a row. A striped candy wipes out all candies in the same row either horizontally or vertically, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing.
Create a wrapped candy by matching five candies of the same color in an L shape, T shape, or + shape. A wrapped candy clears out its surrounding eight candies after detonation.

, Vertical striped candies will wipe out all candies -- including chocolate -- in the same row, and will help prevent chocolate from spreading and covering double jelly squares., Licorice blockers cannot be wiped from afar using special candies, but can be clicked on and switched with other nearby candies. Special candies can detonate nearby licorice blockers, but will not clear any other candies past the licorice blockers.

, These special candies can help wipe several jelly squares from the board at the same time -- including chocolate -- and increase your odds for beating level 123.

Take your time.",How to Beat Level 167 in Candy Crush," You can play the game online within Facebook or on your mobile devices. Launch it, then hit the “Play” button.;
, When the game maps loads, navigate through it until you see “167.” Hit the button for the level to begin.

, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. The four chocolate wheels at the corners are blocked by blocks of meringues. The three center columns and center rows are filled with candies. Jellies cover everything underneath. It will be good if you can easily make some special candies to help clear out lots of jellies at the beginning. Do you see good moves to quickly get those?

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead an exit. You won’t lose any life as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet.

, Working from the bottom up can improve your chances for unexpected candy matches as candies cascade from the top and settle into open spots on the board.

, As soon as the candies blocking the chocolate spawners are cleared, the machines will start releasing chocolate squares., All meringues are double-layered, and are covering single-layer jelly squares. Matching candies next to the meringues will help break down the meringue blockers and provide you with access to the single-layer jellies that lie beneath., Since the goal of level 167 is to clear the jellies, you don’t necessarily have to focus on clearing chocolate squares. The chocolate spawners will continue to release chocolate regardless of whether you’ve already managed to clear all existing chocolate from the board., Special candies such as striped candies, wrapped candies, color bombs, and combinations of these candies can help clear all jellies in fewer than 50 moves.Make striped candies by matching four candies of the same color in a row. Striped candies will clear all candies that reside in the same row or column, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing.
Make wrapped candies by matching five candies of the same color in a T shape, L shape, or + shape. Wrapped candies will clear out the surrounding eight candies upon detonation.
Make color bombs by matching five candies of the same color in a row. When matched with another candy, a color bomb clears all candies of the same color as that particular candy.

, At the start of the level, the chocolate wheels cannot generate chocolate as they are blocked by the meringues. As long as the meringues are there, you’re safe from the chocolate. However, there will come a time when you need to break them. All the blocks of meringues also have jellies underneath, which means you need to clear them out to get to the jellies. When you do break the meringues, the chocolate will start to spread.

, You can break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board. It will be very difficult to complete the level if it does. Stop the chocolate early before it spreads all over. Note also that some jellies may exist underneath some chocolate. Do not forget to clear them out as well.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move.

Start with boosters.,
Analyze the initial board layout.,
Restart the level.",How to Beat Level 162 on Candy Crush1," If you really want to start strong, use some boosters. You can use one Color Bomb, one Striped and Wrapped, and one Lucky Candy as boosters on your initial board layout. Just make sure you make them count.


You can equip boosters on the screen where you see the “Start” button. So before you press “Start,” check out the boosters available for you to use. They can be found on the area above the “Start” button.;
, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Do you see good moves to quickly get a Wrapped or Striped Candy, or two? Do you see a Color Bomb in the making somewhere?


If you believe the board is good, proceed to Part 2: Generating Wrapped and Striped Candies.

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead and exit. You won’t lose any life as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet.

"
"
Start at the bottom.,
Focus per quadrant.,
Make Striped Candies.,
Make Wrapped Candies.,
Use special candies.",How to Beat Level 162 on Candy Crush2," The top and middle parts of the board will provide you limited options. Start with the bottom part to get some lucky or chance combos.

, Don’t overwhelm yourself by attacking the whole board. The board is divided into quadrants. You’ll get a better chance of generating your target candies from there, rather than in the middle.

, Look for moves that will give you Striped Candies. You need ten of these to pass the level. If you’re able to get a Candy Bomb, combine this with a Striped Candy and you should be done with your required number of Striped Candies.


To get Striped Candies, make a match of four candies in a row.

, Although you need only three of these, you should also start looking for moves that will generate these. The board’s layout will make it harder to come up with Wrapped Candies, so make them any chance you get.


Create Wrapped Candies by combining at least three vertical candies with three horizontal candies.

, Once you have some special candies available, go ahead and maximize them. No need to keep them for later as they may just end up eaten by the chocolate.


This will also give you a chance to shake the board with some new candies.

"
"
Break the chocolate.,
Make combos.,
Combine special candies.,
Take your time.",How to Beat Level 162 on Candy Crush3," Before the chocolate expands and grows, take them out. They will stop expanding for a move if you break at least one square. If left unmonitored, the chocolate may end up eating your hard-earned target candies.

, Don’t just go for the basic three-candy match. Be creative and seek further combos. Make combinations using a four or more candies. These combos may just shake your board enough for candies to fall in your needed order.

, Look for ways to get the special candies next to each other. Combine these special candies to make great combos, which can also shake your board.


It will be good if you can combine a Wrapped Candy and a Striped Candy, or a Candy Bomb and a Striped Candy.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move."

Craft a good tagline.,
Complete your profile in full.,
Reduce your text, if you need to.,
Avoid sharing too much.,
Rewrite your text if you appear too into yourself.,
Add humor.",How to Get More Matches on Tinder1," A good tagline can sometimes pique the interest of people who may not otherwise match you. By crafting a unique, thoughtful, or interesting tagline, you might lure in people who would otherwise pass you by.


Be honest about who you are and what you like, and include some specific detail that might be interesting. Try to sum up everything in a line: ""Outdoors lover, Columbia graduate, writer, and into the finer things in life.""
Avoid being dishonest. Unless you go sailing a couple of times a month, don’t say that you sail all the time.
Don’t use overtly sexual references.;
, By completing your profile in full, you’ll give potential matches the minimum amount of information they need to assess you. At the same time, Tinder may sort incomplete profiles down to the bottom of the swipe list.


People might pass you by if you skip the bio section.
Use this as an opportunity to give readers a glimpse into who you are. For example, if you volunteer at animal shelters on the weekend and work as a whitewater rafting guide during the summer, let people know.
Make sure to fill in your education qualification. This is important, even if you don’t have a degree from Harvard Business School. It gives people – and Tinder – a sense of your experiences., Just as not having any info in your bio will hurt you, having too much text will also hurt you. By providing too much, you’ll provide potential matches with information that might lead them to move on.

Tinder has a 500-word limit. Try to come in well under that limit. Anywhere between 100 and 300 words is ideal.
Only use as many words as you need to describe yourself and give others a sense of who you are. Your description of yourself might be as simple as ""I'm an introvert who enjoys the arts, classical music, and the outdoors.""
Avoid long words or wordy or run-on sentences., While it may be beneficial to provide insight into your personality, you’ll likely lose matches if you share too much information. Ultimately, less is often better when you’re trying to get matches with people you’ve never met.

Don’t talk about your health, any conditions you may have, or fun facts about you losing part of your index finger when you were twelve.
Avoid writing anything about previous relationships. For example, don’t say “I’m looking for love after a bad divorce.”
Try not to be negative in any way. For example, don’t write “I’m on Tinder because the dating scene is hard.”, When rewriting the text for your profile, make sure you don’t appear like you’re bragging about yourself or your accomplishments. Ultimately, you need to write carefully so you balance confidence and modesty.

If you’re monetarily successful, don’t flaunt it by writing about how you make $200,000 a year and need the right person to complete you.
If you’re very well educated, don’t say you need someone super smart. Instead, write about how you need a witty companion to match your own sensibilities., Humor is an excellent tool to put prospective matches at ease and to get them to swipe you in the right direction. By using humor in your profile, you'll give people who view it a better idea of who you are. You might also make them smile or laugh.

Consider self-deprecating humor. If you're generally a confident person, you may be able to include a joke about yourself. For instance, if you're tall, make a comment about how the air ""up here"" is thinner.
Make sure your humor comes across right. While you may think your joke about dogs is really funny, others may not. To avoid this, have friends review your joke before you post it.
Avoid off-beat humor and jokes about race, ethnicity, religion, or politics."

Choose good quality photos.,
Reduce the number of photos you make available.,
Include an attractive headshot.,
Use a full-body date night-ready photo.,
Pick photos in which you are alone.,
Maintain positive body language in your photos.,
Change your pictures if they're not working.",How to Get More Matches on Tinder2," One of the best ways to lose matches is to upload photos that are low quality. Thus, make sure you choose photos that are clear and are taken under circumstances that frame you as an attractive person.


Be careful when posting ultra-high resolution photos, as they may capture skin imperfections and other issues that could turn people off.
Don’t upload any photos taken with cheap webcams.
Avoid blurry photos or photos taken in mirrors.
Focus on photos that are taken in good and flattering lighting. For example, stay away from photos taken under florescent lighting., The number of photos you upload to Tinder correlates directly to the number of matches you get. This is important, as the more photos you upload, the largely the likelihood that you’ll turn someone off.


Provide between two and six photos.
If you must include a photo of a pet, dogs may help you get more matches than other animals.
Avoid uploading pictures of you as a baby or a child., An attractive headshot should serve as your main photo. It will give viewers an idea of what you look like in ideal circumstances. This is important, as potential matches will want a clear view of your full face before swiping you.


Make sure your face is clearly visible in your pictures.
Avoid mugging or duck-face. Keep it natural.
Your potential matches likely won’t take a chance on someone who’s hiding their face or doing something goofy.
Emphasize your best features. Studies show that men most regularly choose women with larger eyes and lips, while women choose men with beards and masculine features., By including a photo that shows you dressed up and ready to go out on the town, you’ll give potential matches an idea of the person they’ll encounter on a date. Without this type of picture, they’ll be left wondering about the person they might meet up with.


This picture should show you dressed up and looking your best.
Consider using a photo of you strolling under a street light in a nice part of your city or town.
You can use filters to alter date-night ready photos., While it may seem like a good idea to upload photos of you with others you care about, you have a much larger chance of alienating potential matches than winning people over.


Don’t post pictures of yourself with children.
You don’t want potential matches comparing you to someone else or scrutinizing the situations you’re in.
If you must use a group photo, it should be your final photo., Positive body language is key in getting more matches on Tinder. Not only will positive body language make you look more attractive, but it’ll help people get the impression of you as a friendly and likable person.


Don’t slouch.
Avoid crossing your arms or posing in a defensive or threatening way.
Smile! It may increase your appeal to others., If you're not getting matches, change your photos around. By rotating or using new photos, you’ll get an idea of what photos work and which ones don’t.


Look through your existing photo library for possible photos.
Take new photos, if you need. For example, get a friend to follow you around for an hour and take photos. Then go through them and see which ones might work.
Ask friends which photos they think are best. In fact, you might want to ask others who are successful on Tinder what photos they think will work for you.
If you have any professionally taken headshots or solo portraits, those are usually a great choice."

Search a wider area for matches.,
Expand your age range.,
Pay to boost your profile.",How to Get More Matches on Tinder3," Generally, Tinder settings are tailored to people who live in big cities, and want to meet people in the same neighborhood or community. By enlarging the geographical area you’re willing to make matches with, you’ll probably get more.


Go to your settings and make your search distance a little bigger if you want more matches. If it's set at 5 miles (8 km), change it to 20, 50, or even 100. Remember, though, to make a match, potential matches must have similar distance settings.
If you live in a rural area, you might consider making your search area very wide. If you'd be willing to go anywhere in the state for a meet-up, consider it., A larger age range will open many more possible matches. Ultimately, you may discover many people you wouldn’t have otherwise matched with.


Start by expanding your range a little bit. For example, if you originally searched for 25 to 30, expand that range to 20 to 35. You might find you have a lot in common with people that are younger or older than you.
Think about your comfort range. For example, if you’re 25, will you be comfortable dating someone that is 7 years younger or 7 years older? A 14-year range might provide you with many matches., Tinder has recently introduced Tinder Boost. This service allows you to pay a fee to temporarily put your profile toward the top of the swipe list. By paying this fee, more people will be able to see your profile – thus increasing your matches.


Tinder Boost moves your profile up for 30 minutes at a time.
Tinder has said that their service may increase your views by 10 times.
The boosting service costs between 3 and 5 dollars depending on your market.
Tinder Plus users can boost their profile for free."

Select a cover photo that represents you well.,
Work in a classic head shot.,
Add multiple photos to your profile.,
Go without the cringe-worthy selfies.,
Use only clear photos that are focused on you.,
Post limited group photos.,
Link your Instagram account.",How to Make a Good Tinder Profile1," The largest photo on your profile’s ""Edit Info"" screen is the default photo that will appear on your card as people swipe through Tinder. This photo is extremely important, as it’s the only thing that many users will see before swiping right or left to indicate whether they are interested or not. Aside from clearly showing what you currently look like, it should also reflect your personality or lifestyle.For instance, if you’re a business type, you might want to consider a photo that shows you in a suit. Or, if you’re all about the outdoors, a photo in a park may be the way to go.
In order to represent your appearance accurately, use photos that were taken recently.
Note that Tinder will sometimes reorder your photos so that the one that most people swipe right on is your primary photo.;
, Head shots of you looking happy are usually the best photos to use on dating applications. Make sure your profile includes at least one head shot that shows you smiling. Believe it or not, the position of your head matters too - photos with a slight tilt of the head lead to more matches., Shoot for at least three photos on your profile. This will allow potential matches to get a good sense of what you look like, as well as the type of person you are. Specifics are up to you, but it’s best to try and reflect yourself as honestly and genuinely as possible.Ideas for good profile photos include action shots of you doing something you're interested in, such as putt-putt golf or acrobatics.
Travel photos are another good idea, as they provide a great conversation starter.
Another common trope is photos with animals. Note that photos with pets are much more likely to lead to matches than hunting photos.

, No matter how proud you are of your bod, most people agree that shirtless shots aren’t very tasteful. Granted, there’s a big difference between a shirtless selfie in the bathroom mirror and a photo of you on the beach. As a rule of thumb, if you wouldn’t want your employer to see the photo, consider choosing another.To reiterate: mirror selfies, especially shirtless mirror selfies, are not recommended.

, If a photo is out of focus, it sends the wrong message. Photos should also clearly emphasize what you look like, so photos that don’t include you should be extremely limited.Feel free to include a humorous photo, especially if this reflects your personality. Still, keep the emphasize of your photos on demonstrating what you look like.

, One or two group photos are great to include in your profile, as they send the message that you’re sociable and friendly. However, make sure not to use all group photos, so your potential match knows which human you are!, If you have an Instagram account, consider linking it to your Tinder profile. This will allow Tinder users to see the most recent 29 photos posted on your Instagram. Note that this is entirely optional, but it does give potential matches more insight into the type of person you are, and may make them more comfortable about meeting someone online.Be aware that linking your Instagram account to your Tinder does give people access to your Instagram username.
If you do link your account, consider setting up your Instagram account so that potential followers have to ""request"" to follow you.

Matches are necessary in order to chat, so make sure you take the time to craft a quality profile and start sifting through your potential matches.


See this guide for detailed instructions for installing the app and creating a solid profile.
Tinder is available for free for both iOS and Android, and requires a Facebook profile.;
, You should be using all of the available photo slots for various pictures of yourself. Ensure that you aren't posting any pictures of you with a member of the opposite sex, that you aren't in a picture with a child, or that they aren't all group photos.Make sure you're smiling!

, You can chat with anyone that you've ""Liked"" who has also ""Liked"" you back. Open the Matches menu and tap on one of your matches to open a chat window.


Wait about a day after the match is made before you strike up a conversation.
Take the initiative with the conversation. It shows confidence and a willingness to take control.
Don't be discouraged if you don't get a reply. Not everyone will respond to your messages. Brush yourself off and try again with your next match.

, Avoid a simple ""Hi"" or ""Hello"", as this is sure to turn off the majority of people you're chatting with. Look closely at the other person's profile photos and bio to glean any interests. For example, if you see a guy with a surfboard, ask about his favorite surfing spots.


Make sure your grammar and spelling is correct all the time, especially in the beginning of your conversation. Remember, first impressions last!

, Ask simple questions to learn more about the person you're talking to. What are his/her hobbies, interests, etc.? Avoid asking questions that are too personal.


Keep your approach casual. Talk like you’re talking to a friend that you've known for a long time. Stay calm and keep your cool.

, Now that you have gotten your crush's attention and you know a thing or two about him/her, you should know how to keep the other person interested in you.


Don’t be afraid to give compliments. Even if you really don't know the other person that much yet, give out compliments based on your conversation. A simple “I LOVE talking with you” is a great start.
Be careful when you are giving compliments about his/her looks. Focus more on other features aside from your crush's body.
Tease each other. Teasing is a great way of flirting. You can try giving him/her a nickname or just tease them by the silly thing they did.
Remember to keep the teasing light, and always let the other person know that you are joking. A little “;)” emoticon at the end will help, but guys should avoid using emoticons.

, Tinder is supposed to be fun and casual. Coming on too strong or too sexual will turn the other person away, and ruin any chance at future flirting. Keep it light, and save the heavy stuff for if the relationship develops.

, The other person might lose his/her interest if you do. Instead, encourage the other person to talk about his/her self. You can occasionally then throw in some facts about yourself in your conversation.


Know if the topic you're talking about also interests the other person. You will know it by the way the other person replies. If it looks like the other person isn't interested, immediately change to another topic in a subtle way.

, If you started out strong, don't forget to end your conversations strong. Know when to stop texting. You can't keep conversations forever. There always comes a time when there is nothing left to say.


When you feel like both of you are struggling for something to say, end your conversations immediately.
Measure the response. Try to sense if the person likes you or not. If the person doesn't respond much, the person is probably not interested in flirting with you, and you should just end the conversation for good.
You should set up your next interaction before you go. Say something like “Message me again sometime”, or “Let’s talk again tomorrow?”
Don’t just say “Bye!” Tell the other person why you are leaving and what will you be doing.
If you are going to meet up with the person, don't be afraid to say that you can't wait to see him/her.
Avoid an awkward good-bye. Say that you had fun and it was great talking with him/her. Just keep it simple and casual.

, Many Tinder users don't want to keep chatting through the app, as it's fairly impersonal. If you're enjoying the flirt, get their number so your chats can become more relatable. Hearing the other person's voice can do a lot for your connection.


Instead of asking for a phone number, you might find more success in offering yours first, and letting the other person know that there's no pressure if they don't want to use it.

, Tinder is a dating service, and many people expect to be able to meet the user at the other end of the message. If you two are making a connection, you owe it to the other person to meet up at least once to see where it goes.


Pick a safe location where you and the other person will both feel comfortable.
Avoid the clichéd ""dinner and a movie"" first meeting. Instead, meet for lunch or for drinks and see where the conversation goes. See this guide for more first date tips.

Write something in the “About” section.,
Consider mentioning what you’re looking for.,
Attempt humor somewhere.,
Avoid numbers.,
Start conversations with your matches.",How to Make a Good Tinder Profile2," In the “Edit Info” area of the Tinder app, you can add text that will show up in your profile when people touch your photo to check you out further. It’s worth writing something here, even if you want to keep it short and simple. In fact, you probably don’t want to put too much - just a line or two to reflect your personality or a few things that are important to you.The easiest option, which also provides good conversation starters and date ideas, is to include the types of activities you enjoy.
For instance, write something like, “Likes to float in rivers. Also very into eating Korean food.”

, Being explicit about what you’re looking for on Tinder can benefit both you and your potential matches. Some folks use the app to find people for casual hookups, while others are hoping to find a more serious relationship.Simply put something like, “Just here for some fun,” or “Looking for that ride-or-die.”
Note: “NSA” stands for “no strings attached,” which means someone is looking for a casual relationship.

, Especially if all your photos are on the serious side, it’s worth including something on the lighter side in your bio. You don’t quite have to tell a joke, but do let potential matches in on your sense of humor.Good examples include silly questions, such as “If you were a breed of dog, what breed would you be?” or mock confessions, such as “I listen to “Starboy” by The Weekend  at least a dozen times a day.”

, While height has become an extremely common attribute to include numerically in dating profiles, you can simply write that you’re tall, or that you’re interested in tall folks. More importantly, numbers that you definitely want to avoid include things like IQ, GPA, body proportions, or income.Even if someone is interested in smart people, for instance, they’re probably not interested in smart people who like to tell other people how smart they are.

, One of the more frustrating aspects of using Tinder is getting matches that never lead to conversations. Feel free to initiate conversations with matches yourself, and be sure to reply to messages from your matches or un-match them if you're no longer interested.

Don't take your conversations too seriously, especially at first. Keep questions and comments flirty and fun.
Most importantly, convey your personality honestly! If you're hoping to meet someone, give them a good idea of who you are. This will make that first date go much more smoothly.

Advance time.",How to Beat Candy Crush Saga," It is not enough that you know the basics of swapping these colored candies; you should also know what will happen if you align 4 or even 5 candies of the same color. Knowing the “power” of these power-up candies will make a huge difference on your success in clearing Candy Crush Saga levels.


The striped candies will clear all candies on its alignment when swapped with a normal candy. This depends on which direction you produced the striped candy. If you created the striped candy while adding the 4th candy horizontally, it will have horizontal stripes. If vertically added, it will have vertical stripes.
The wrapped candy can be produced by creating two 3-match combination in just a single move. Swapping the wrapped candy with a normal candy will destroy all the immediate candies surrounding it.
The most powerful power-up candy of all is the color bomb. This can be produced by aligning 5 candies of the same color. When swapped with a normal candy, it virtually destroys all the candies in the scene which shares the same color as the swapped candy.;
, There is nothing more than satisfying than watching a bunch of candies getting cleared with combos in just a single move. Doing so just requires your knowledge in power-up candy combinations.


Swapping striped candies will result to clearance of candies horizontally and vertically regardless of their stripes’ orientation.
Swapping wrapped candies will result into a 5 by 5 explosion of candies surrounding it.
Swapping color bombs will literally destroy all the visible candies in the play area.
Swapping a striped candy with a wrapped candy will result into a super candy clearing 3 rows/columns of the candies both horizontally and vertically.
Swapping a striped candy with a color bomb, it will upgrade all the candies with the same color as the striped candy to actual striped candies that will all detonate at once.
Swapping a wrapped candy with a color bomb, it will clear all the candies on the same color as the wrapped candy and a random colored candy mass clearance as a bonus.

, Sometimes we get too busy creating combinations that we forget what the main goal of a level is. It's obviously not always about reaching the highest score. There are different kinds of winning conditions in Candy Crush Saga.


Moves levels. The condition simply indicates that you should meet an allotted score before you run out of moves.
Jelly levels. These tricky levels require you to clear all the jellies in the level to proceed. A classic example of it’s not always about just clearing candies.
Timed levels. These levels will really require your strategy and combination prowess in playing. You prevent bombs to detonate by making candy combinations near them. When the bomb reaches zero – it’s game over for you.
Ingredient Drop levels. Your objective on these levels is to successfully drop the required number of ingredients to the bottom part of the play area before you run out of moves.
Candy Order levels. It is a collection level requiring you to collect certain colored candies, special candies, or combinations to proceed.

, Simple logic for this move is because most of the times, especially during limited moves, clearing candies at the bottom create additional combinations while the candies collapse. Of course, this is no guarantee but very high in probability.

, Threats such as chocolates and bombs should be prioritized more than anything else. If you don’t take care of the chocolates, it will rapidly consume the candies in your play area. This will make clearing candies tougher for you. With bombs, simple enough, if you let the bomb detonate, the level instantly goes to failure.

, Out of reach jellies and those on the play area’s edge are the jellies you should focus on clearing first. Once you clear these jellies, the middle jellies will surely be affected in the process. Besides, they are much easier to clear compared to those located on the edges.

, Even in times where you have time limit, make sure not to rush the level resulting to poor decisions. Remember, you can always pause the game and take a break and evaluate the scenario. Especially if you have power up candies – make sure you use them appropriately!

, Upon entering a level and you noticed an unfavorable candy positioning, without making a single move yet, you can back-out of that level and re-enter without costing a life. You can do this until you find the initial positioning of the candies favorable to you.

, If you have Facebook friends that need additional lives and you can help – by all means, do so. This generosity will be very useful when it is your time to ask for favor such as requesting additional lives or proceeding to the next location in the map that requires friends’ help.

, Candy Crush Saga has some extra items that could actually purchase to help you clear levels. Mind you, these items and boosters are not for free so think very carefully before deciding to purchase anything. Besides, the challenge is to clear levels with just what is provided by the game alone. That’s where real satisfaction sets in.

, In times you already used all your lives and prompted to wait 24 hours to replenish, you can always just adjust your device’s time to “cheat” the system. Adding an additional day to your time will result into 5 fresh lives! Just don’t forget to re-adjust your time after playing. But be warned, doing this technique will cause your next legal wait to an absurd amount of time.

Reverse lookup a phone number.",How to Spot Scams and Spam on Tinder," Some profiles will direct you to click on a link. Beware of any profiles that say, for example, “if you want to learn more about me” or “check out my website.” If the URL looks shortened, it most likely leads to a scam site.


While some profiles may offer legitimate links, never click on a link if you feel unsure.;
, Profiles with one photo, especially when accompanying bios devoid of key details such as occupation and education, are red flags. Also avoid profiles that depend on professional-looking photos, photos that look edited, or photos of celebrities. Skip profiles that confuse you with many photos of different people. Finally, always pass on profiles that try to lure you with scantily-clad, perfect-looking bodies.For example, many spam bots rely on women in suggestive poses wearing bikinis or underwear. Male-themed profiles may show shirtless men with well-chiseled abs.
Scammers are refining their bots, so a spam profile may hide behind an image of a cute girl or boy you’d find next door. If the person looks like a model, it’s probably too good to be true., Tinder’s algorithm attempts to match you with people nearby based on friends and interests you have added to Facebook. When you get matched with a profile that shares nothing in common with you, it is likely a spam bot that didn’t add interests to Facebook., Many spam bots will send you a message as soon as you are matched with them. This is to lure you in quickly. Even if this doesn’t happen, consider the speed of messages. Do any come faster than a real person should be able to type? If so, it is a spam bot.Some spam bots may now be programmed to time their responses. Monitor future messages for inconsistencies, such as for responses that seem generic rather than tailored to your conversation, those that sound nonsensical, and those with poor grammar and spelling.
One way to test for bots is to send a nonsense message. Type a bunch of random letters like “agdsgdgdf.” Bots will respond to it as if it is a normal message.

, Most people won’t jump to racy talk when speaking with a stranger through Tinder. Bots however will quickly escalate the conversation such as by suggesting you may get a phone number if you “play with them” or through other sexually charged messages., Soon enough, the bot will ask you to go somewhere else. They’ll give you a link, saying that they want to leave Tinder or talk to you in private on another site. Do not click any link they show you. If you do, do not give up your credit card information.Some scams will send you a phone number. Don’t give out your phone number or other personal information. Search the phone number through a reverse phone lookup if you are unsure about its legitimacy.Look out also for quickly-sent links where the spammer tells you something along the lines of “you’ve got to check this out” or “you won’t believe this.” Often, they don’t explain the unsolicited link, but they may also talk about an amazing application, video, or product. Don’t even look at these., Real scammers on Tinder will try to solidify a connection with you. They will ask you lots of questions about yourself, particularly about past relationships and your financial situation. They won’t want to tell you lots of details about themselves, and if they do, look out for any inconsistencies.Never give out significant personal information when getting to know someone on Tinder.
As you progress, be alert during all your interactions. Once you build trust, look for scam signs, such as the person making excuses not to meet you, not having new photos to send, or requests for money., Create a screenshot of a person’s picture using your phone, then go to CTRLQ.org. Click the “upload picture” button to reverse search the image. This may link you to the location where the image was taken from, such as Facebook or a cam site, revealing telltale signs such as the person's name differing between accounts.CTRLQ.org doesn’t always work as well as directly searching from Google. To do this, you will have to send the picture to your computer by connecting your phone through USB, e-mailing it, or storing it in a service such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive. Retrieve the image, then go to the image tab on Google’s search engine. Click the camera icon in the search box.
Screenshots on Android are done by holding down the power and volume-down buttons at the same time. On Apple products, hold the Sleep button near the top of the device, then press the home button at the bottom of the device., Spam bots will entice you to sign up for a website, whereas scammers will ask you to send money to help them out of a bad situation, such as car or family trouble. As soon as you are asked for money, cut off all contact.This includes never putting your credit card into linked cam sites or information lookup sites. Perform your own searches on the person through Google and, when using reverse phone lookup, stop once you get the phone number’s area of origin for free.

, Some spammers and scammers will ask you for sensitive information. Besides social security, credit card, and bank information, don’t give out your work and home addresses. Also, don’t give out your phone number to someone you don’t trust.For example, a scammer may ask for your address to send you a gift and others will ask questions early on about how much money you make or where you bank to get a sense of how much of a target you are. Scam websites ask for your credit card and other personal information.
Some spam bots will give you a phone number early on to build trust. Remember to check it online for legitimacy. Don't give out your phone number until you feel safe, since it can be used to sign you up for spam.

, When someone gives you a number, research it. You can Google search it to see if the area code matches your area. Also, go online to sites such as Whitepages or Reverse Phone Lookup. Type in the number and it will give you some information, such as the location of the phone.Lookup sites offer full reports for a small fee, but this offer isn’t recommended. You will get enough information from a standard search without sharing your credit card.

Detonate color bombs immediately after you’ve created them to improve your odds for making more color bombs afterwards.",How to Beat Level 135 on Candy Crush," To beat level 135, you must create and detonate at least five color bombs. Color bombs can be created by matching five candies of the same color in a row, and will wipe out all candies on the board of the same color you match them with.;
, Making matches at the bottom of the playing board will improve your odds for the formation of special candies as a result of the cascading effect, which is when candies fall down to replace those you matched. In many cases, cascading candies in level 135 can result in the automatic creation of color bombs., After chocolate squares start spreading out from the corners to the rest of the playing board, they may interfere with your ability to create multiple color bombs.Match color bombs with candies of the same color positioned next to the chocolate squares. This can help wipe out chocolate, while allowing you to collect a color bomb at the same time.
Allow any horizontal striped candies you create to fall into the bottom row of the board, if possible. Detonating horizontal striped candies in the bottom row can help wipe out the chocolate squares positioned at the bottom left and right corners of the playing board., While you may be tempted to create these types of special candies, these matches can affect your opportunity to make multiple color bombs.

, The detonation of color bombs will result in there being fewer colors remaining on the board, which can help you create more color bombs."

Use special candies with regular candies.,
Make special candy combinations.",How to Beat Candy Crush Level 30," The 25 meringue blocks take up a lot of space on the Candy Crush level 30 game board, so it’s important to remove those blocks first to give you more candies and free up exit routes for the ingredients.You can’t use a color bomb to remove meringue, but you can:Make candy combinations adjacent to the meringue to destroy it.
Make special candy combinations with striped and wrapped candies.;
, Once the meringue is out of the way, you can focus on clearing the first ingredient (a cherry or chestnut) from the board. In the column where the ingredient is, make candy combinations below the ingredient to remove candies and free up spaces. As you clear the board beneath the ingredient, it will drop into the free spaces.


Clear ingredients from the board by getting them all the way to the bottom where the green arrows are, and they will be removed from the board.
In level 30, there are green arrows at the bottom of every column, meaning you can remove ingredients from the board in any column, as long as they are free of meringue.

, As each ingredient drops, continue making combinations under it to remove it. In level 30, ingredients can drop in any column and at any time (even if there’s still one on the board), but a new one will always drop when you remove the last one from the board.


Removing all six ingredients over the course of your 60 moves will give you at least 60,000 points and three stars for the level.

, In Candy Crush, special candies are candies that get created when you make certain combinations on the board. Special candies can be combined with regular candies or other special candies to clear more of the board with a single move. Since you don’t have to worry about positioning your ingredients in the right columns (because they’re all exit routes) in level 30, you can focus more on making special candies and combinations.


Striped candies are created by combining four candies of the same kind.Color bombs (the sprinkled candies) are generated by combining five of the same candies in a row or column.
Wrapped candies are created when you match five or more candies that form an L-shape or a T-shape.

, By combining your special candies with regular candies, you can accomplish a lot more with fewer moves. The special candy uses or combinations are: A color bomb, when combined with any regular candy, will remove all the candies of that color or kind
A candy with vertical stripes will clear all the candies in that column when it’s activated
A candy with horizontal stripes will clear all the candies in that row when it’s activated

, Combining special candies with special candies will remove large numbers of candies from the board at once. Combinations are especially helpful if you’ve only got a few moves left and still have more ingredients to drop.Two striped candies with either vertical or horizontal stripes (the direction doesn’t matter) can be combined to remove all the candies in the row and column where the match was made.A striped candy and a wrapped candy will have the same effect as the striped candy combination, but this combination will remove three rows and three columns of candies.
Two wrapped candies combined will create a two-candy-wide square of destruction around the combination site.
A wrapped candy plus a color bomb will destroy all the candies that are the same color as the wrapped candy, plus another set of candies of a random color.
When you combine a color bomb and a striped candy, all the candies on the board that are the same color as the striped candy will be turned to striped candies, which will all then be activated.
Two color bombs together essentially destroys all the candies on the screen; however, be warned that this doesn’t necessarily mean you are going to beat whatever level you’re on.

Understand the flow.,
Don't make a move unless you're clearing jellies.,
Focus on the bottom first.,
Use striped candy strategically.,
Don't worry about the score.,
Consider reloading the board.",How to Beat Candy Crush Level 33," You only have 17 moves to clear 16 jellies, which need to be cleared twice to go away. The candies move from top to bottom across the gaps in the board. Wrapped candies to not clear anything outside of the area they are in, making them less useful in this level. You have precious few moves to complete the level.


There used to be only 14 moves available, which made the puzzle especially fiendish. It was updated to provide 17 moves, which eases the pain a little but still provides a lot of challenge.;
, Since you only have 17 moves, you need to make sure that every single one counts. You will likely only have one or two moves to spare when you finally clear the board. Clear as many jellies per move is possible, and don't worry too much about creating special candy.


Look at the board above the one you're making a move in to see if there is a better move (one that removes more jelly) available there. Since candies move downwards, if you make a move in the lower board, the candies on the board above it will move, removing that option for later.

, Clear the lower two boards first, as you will automatically clear some parts of the top two boards with chain reactions. Try to focus on one quarter of the board at a time, and you will see other quarters start to clear because of what you do.


If you are out of moves on the bottom, there are very few ways to clear it up and start getting it to move again. Try to play on the bottom and keep it active., Use striped candy to clear a row in not just the board it is in, but also the adjacent board. Striped candies, either on their own or combined with another striped candy prove very useful in clearing rows quickly.

, There is a minimum score required in order to pass the level, but chances are if you clear the jellies you'll probably beat the score without trying. The minimum score required used to be higher, but was lowered when the number of moves was increased., If you don't like the initial candy setup, and you are playing on a mobile device, you can reload the level and start with new candies without losing a life. This can be especially useful if you don't start with many good moves. You can't do this after making a move, and you can't do it on Facebook.Tap the yellow arrow in the bottom right corner. Tap the red door icon that appears. This will take you back to the map.
If you are playing on an Android device, press the soft ""Back"" button at the bottom of the phone once. This will take you back to the map.

Note the colors of candies positioned at the end of the swirls at the bottom half of the board before detonating color bombs.",How to Beat Level 133 on Candy Crush," Color bombs and vertical striped candies will be most effective at clearing the double jelly squares, as well as special candy combinations, such as color bomb + color bomb, wrapped + striped, and color bomb + striped.Make color bombs by matching five of the same-colored candies in a row.
Make vertical striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, and moving the fourth candy into the match in an upward or downward vertical direction.
Make wrapped candies by matching five candies into an L shape, T shape, or + shape.;
, When you match a color bomb with a striped candy, all candies on the board of the same color as the striped candy will also turn into striped candies. Those striped candies will immediately detonate, and clear all existing candies in the same rows and columns., While matches may be mostly nonexistent at the bottom half of the board, any matches you can manage to make will help clear jellies that would otherwise have to be cleared using special candies.

, Horizontal striped candies can be effective at clearing jelly squares located in the very bottom row of the playing board.Make horizontal striped candies by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, and moving the fourth candy into the match in a left or right horizontal direction.

, These jelly squares are often considered the most difficult to clear, but can be cleared most easily using color bombs."

Forgo the opportunity to make a color bomb if you can use one or more of those candies to create a wrapped candy. You only need to collect two color bombs to pass level 347.;
, When detonated, a color bomb will clear out all candies of the same color it was matched with, and improve your odds of being able to make wrapped candies with the remaining colors.Make color bombs by matching five of the same-colored candies in a row.

, Making matches near the bottom of the playing board will result in the cascading of candies from the top, and may result in unexpected matches and the creation of these special candies.

, Wrapped candies and color bombs are made from five-candy matches, meaning you could fare better with saving candies for those matches, instead of turning them into striped candies that may not help you beat level 347.

, Matching a color bomb with a wrapped candy will turn all candies on the board of the same color into wrapped candies -- helping you meet your goal of collecting 10 wrapped candies even sooner. This strategic move is one of the most helpful that can help you beat level 347., The meringues are blocking the chocolate spawner, which will start releasing chocolate once unblocked. Chocolate can make level 347 more challenging to pass, considering chocolate will eat any candies you may have been saving for the creation of wrapped candies and color bombs.On the other hand, breaking through the meringues can help open up the playing board, and expand your options for making wrapped candies and color bombs. Experiment with keeping the meringues intact, and with breaking them to determine which strategy works best for you during gameplay."

Focus on the lower third first.,
Work on the corners.,
Recognize patterns.,
Use special candy strategically.",How to Beat Candy Crush Level 29," The lower third of the board will be difficult to clear because of the unmovable stones taking up a majority of the space. Making combinations here will create combinations at the top of the level too, so focusing on the bottom will keep you productive and maximize your score.;
, Once you have cleared all of the frosted jellies at the bottom of the level, you should focus your attention on the corners. It can be difficult to clear, and getting stuck with jellies here late in the level can really put a damper on your score. Do everything you can to clear the corners as soon as possible., Learning to recognize patterns is one of the easiest ways to maximize payback from every move you make. Look at the screenshot above: you will see that while there are several other combinations available, moving the red candy down as shown will create a special multicolor candy.

, Don't use special candy as soon as you create it. Oftentimes there is a better way to use it in order to maximize jelly-blasting potential. There are a couple ways that you can use these candies to their maximum potential:


Take a look at the screenshot below. While the red-striped candy is already in a useful location, the purple-striped candy has no jelly on either side of it. Setting it off in this position would only waste the move, as well as the candy. It would be better to bring it to the bottom of the board (or, rarely, you can move it upwards if you have two same colored candy right above it), and set it off later.
In the following screenshot, you will see that there there is an available wrapped and striped candy combination, that will set off all candy in a cross pattern. When set off in the center of the game board, this combination can clear almost two thirds of the game board in one move.

, Once you’re in, check how your board is laid out. Analyze if there are any good matches to quickly get a Candy Bomb or two. How about other special candies, can you easily create one or two with the current board?

, If you don’t like your board, you can exit and restart it. As long as you haven’t made any moves, you won’t lose a life., It may be tempting to match all the other candies for points, but your priority should be on the required colored candies. Do not waste moves matching the others you don’t need.

, You can make a Striped candy by matching four candies in a row. When you use a Striped candy as part of a match, it will clear out a whole row or column from the board. You can use this to take out multiple candies of the colors you need from the same row or column.

, If you match 5 candies in a row, you will get a Candy Bomb. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place to swap with to form the five-in-a-row. Take out all the yellow, purple, or blue candies on the board with one move by matching a Candy Bomb with the same colored candy.

, Put a Striped candy, ideally a yellow, purple, or blue one, and a Candy Bomb side by side and match them. All the similar colored candies will be turned into Striped candies and clear out lots of columns and rows on the board.


If you the Striped candy you matched was yellow, purple, or blue, you will have cleared lots of the required number, on top of clearing all other colors found in the surrounding columns and rows.

, Watch the two chocolate wheels at the bottom corners. Chocolate will begin spreading as early as your second move. You can break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board. It will be very difficult to complete the level if it does. Stop the chocolate early before it spreads.

, As early as your second move, licorice will drop to replace some of the cleared spots. Licorice can take lots of space that should be given to the candies you need. Make matches beside them to clear them out. Do not let your board be filled with licorice.

Clear stones first.,
Don’t waste moves on clearing already cleared blocks.,
Create strategically located striped candy.,
Use striped candy and wrapped candy combinations to clear out larger areas.",How to Beat Candy Crush Level 23," There are five vertical columns that have candy in them. First try to see if there are any obvious combinations in them. Working from the bottom up is the best way to set off chain reactions. Since the stones are blocking a large part of the gameplay area, remove them first. Any combination that removes one or more stones should be prioritized.


On this game board, there are several obvious combinations, but removing the purple candy on the top right will also clear out two stones, making more room on the board for future combinations.
Below, you’ll see that just seven moves later, that top right corner has two special candies available, with another wrapped candy possible.;
, It’s very tempting to make combinations in the first few rows, but these don’t add to the final goal of clearing out the jelly. Prioritize by clearing out stones, followed by jelly.


Moves lower on the board are better not just because they set off chain reactions, but also since clearing jelly and the aforementioned reactions will give you a higher final score. Don’t forget the minimum required score for this level must be met to clear it.

, Try to make striped candy that will set off a chain vertically. This is best done in the columns that have jelly or stone in them. You can clear out entire columns in one go this way.


On the gameboard above, there is a yellow striped candy that will clear out the entire second jelly/stone column once.

,


This combination packs the biggest punch as it clears out squares both horizontally and vertically, three rows wide.

, When the game maps loads, find level “258” and hit the button to begin.

, Once you’re in, study how your board is set up. Do you have any good moves that can get you a Striped candy or two? Do you see any matches that can free up the Fish Candies early?

, If you’re not comfortable with your board, you can restart the level. You won’t lose a life as long as you haven’t made a move yet., The center cross area is the only place where you can make your moves and matches. Forget about the four corners with the jellies, since you cannot really touch them.

, A Fish candy is a special candy that cannot be made within the game. These are provided in the levels where they can be used. When you use a Fish candy as part of a match in this level, it will swim to a jelly and clear it. Using these in this level is key to winning it since the jellies in the four corners cannot really be reached by matches. The Fish candies are all encased in gelatin. Make any match with the Fish candy to melt the gelatin and free the Fish candy.

, A Wrapped candy is a special candy created by matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. When used as part of a match, it will first explode and knock out the nine candies surrounding it, and then it will drop and explode again, knocking out another nine candies the same way. This special candy by itself in the center cross area can be useless, but it is very useful when you use it as a combo with a Fish candy.

, A Candy Bomb is a special candy created by matching five candies in a row. Color bombs do not need to be matched in order to be used. and you can just swap it with another candy. All similar candies will be taken from the board. This special candy by itself in the center cross area can be of little use, but it is very useful when you use it as a combo with a Fish candy.

, The six Fish candies aren’t enough to clear out all the jellies on the four corners. You have to save them and make combos out of them so that you can multiply their use and effects.


Combine a Fish candy with a Wrapped candy—This combination is very useful. Having the Wrapped candy in the center cross area is useless, but combining it with a Fish candy will do wonders. The Wrapped candy will be multiplied by three, and they will all swim towards the different jellies on the board. If you’re lucky, they will hit three different corners of the board and blow up there, clearing all the jellies in one move.
Combine a Fish candy with a Candy Bomb—This combination is also very useful. Having the Candy Bomb in the center cross area is of little use since it can only clear similar-colored candies. However, if it’s combined with a Fish candy, the Fish Candy will be multiplied by three and swim to different jellies. Afterwards, each of the Fish Candies will again multiply by three and swim to different jellies again. One Fish candy is multiplied several times, giving you lots of Fish candies.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move. The candy time bombs start counting from 35, so you have 35 moves to get rid of them. Focus on clearing the jellies and the candy time bombs will be taken care of with them."

, When the game maps loads, navigate through it until you see “257.” Hit the button for the level to begin.

, Once you’re in, go over how your board is laid out. Do you see good moves to quickly get a special candy or two? Are there moves that can easily break the meringues so you can get to the mystery eggs?

, If you think the board isn’t any good, you can exit. You won’t lose any lives as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet., Make matches right next to the layer of meringues to slowly break them. You need to hit them twice before they get cleared. Breaking the meringues serve two purposes. One is to enlarge your working space and two is to get to the mystery eggs.

, Once you’ve penetrated the layer of meringues, the mystery eggs can flow through. Match the mystery eggs with the same-colored candies to break them and see what lies inside.

, Mystery eggs contain random items, some good, some bad. If you get a special candy, you’re lucky. Otherwise, you may get a blocker like licorice, meringue, or chocolate. When you do, be sure to stop them right away, especially the chocolate., A Striped candy is a special candy that results from matching four candies in a row. All the orders require at least one Striped candy, so go ahead and make one.

, A Wrapped candy is a special candy that results from matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. This candy can be hard to make, so go ahead and make one whenever you get the chance.

, A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place to swap with to form the five-in-a-row. You only need one of these for your orders.

, You are required to combine a Striped candy and a Wrapped candy twice, a Candy Bomb and a Striped candy once, and two Striped candies twice. Making the candies or breaking them out of mystery eggs isn’t enough. You need to match two together and do that in the required number of times. Once you have one special candy, make some matches and clear some space so you can get the two you need together.

, Once you get the two needed special candies together, match them immediately. Do not let another move go without doing so. You might lose the chance, and the candies may shift after your next move."

, When the game maps loads, navigate through it until you see 169. Hit the button for the level to begin.

, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. You have two columns of chocolate at both sides blocked by columns of meringues. Five columns of candies are in the middle. Focus on the candies. Do you see good moves to quickly get a Striped candy or any special candies you need?

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead an exit. You won’t lose any lives as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet., As much as possible, delay the chocolates from eating your candies. The chocolates are blocked by the columns of meringues so you are safe until you remove the meringues. Start making your candy matches and combinations in the middle to avoid taking out the meringues.

, All the three combinations you need requires a Striped candy. Work on getting this first. Put four similar candies in a row to generate a Striped candy. Once you have a Striped candy, you can go for the combination that’s easiest to achieve.

, You need three combinations to complete the level. You need to match a Wrapped candy and a Striped candy; two Striped candies; and a Striped candy and a Candy Bomb.


Making another Striped candy—Repeat putting similar candies four in a row to generate another Striped candy.
Making a Wrapped candy—A Wrapped candy is a special candy that results from matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. This one’s more challenging and difficult to get compared to a Striped candy.
Making a Candy Bomb—A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place to swap with to form the five-in-a-row.

, It is ideal that you get the two special candies you need for a combination next to each other. Either you form it in the perfect place or you move and drop it to where you need it to be. Once you get the special candies side by side, switch them immediately to match them. Do not let another move go without doing so. You might lose the chance and the candies may shift after your next move., This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move. 35 moves can be a lot.

, There’s no chocolate machine in this level, so you only have the chocolate on the board. Although the chocolate are blocked by the meringues in the beginning, it is inevitable that they will break out. Intentionally or unintentionally, you will make matches next to the meringues that will clear them. Once an opening is left by a meringue square, the chocolate will start to come out. Pay attention when this happens.

, You can break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board. It will be very difficult to complete the level if it does. Stop the chocolate early before it spreads all over. Do not, however, waste all your moves clearing it out. Your priority is still making the combinations needed to complete the level."

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead and exit. You won’t lose a life as long as you haven’t touched any candy., Look for moves that will give you Striped candies. Bring the horizontally Striped candies near the bottom where the chocolate wheels are so that they can easily clear out nearby chocolate and jellies.

, These can be harder to make, but not impossible. Always keep a lookout for opportunities to make one. Using the Wrapped candies as bombs can really make the jellies go away faster.

, If you can, put a Striped candy and a Wrapped candy together. The best place to have this combo is in the middle part of the board so that it can take out jellies and chocolate near the chocolate wheels.

, Look for ways to generate a Candy Bomb by matching five candies in a row. It’s always useful to have this special candy. It’s extra special if you can combine it with a Striped candy to do more damage so that you can clear out more jellies and chocolate faster., At the start of the level, the chocolate is blocked by licorice. As long as you don’t break the licorice, the chocolate won’t spread. However, a move will come when the licorice will have to break, freeing the chocolate. Watch out for when this happens so that you can immediately control the chocolate.

, You can break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board. It will be very difficult to complete the level if it does. Stop the chocolate early before it spreads all over.

, Take note the jellies exist under the chocolate. These also need to be cleared out to finish the level. There are jellies near and around the chocolate wheels, and these are the hardest to reach and clear. Using the special candies and combos will help a lot here.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move."

, Your profile photo is a great way to show off your physical assets and personality. Try to choose something that can best represent what kind of person you are. The same principle applies to your matches – viewing profile photos of others can say a lot. This could indicate the degree of effort they put into their profiles and perhaps how serious they are in finding a match.

For more information on setting up your Tinder profile, see this guide.

, You can only chat with other Tinder users that have been matched with you. In order to make matches, you will need to ""Like"" some profiles. When you start Tinder, you will be displayed the first in a list of possible matches for you in your area. Swipe to the right to ""Like"" the person, or swipe to the left to reject them.

In order to be matched, both you and the other person need to ""Like"" each other's profiles.

, Once you have a match, you can begin chatting with them. Open the Tinder menu and select Messages. Tap the person you want to start chatting with and you can begin composing your first message.

Many people will recommend waiting at least a day before starting a chat. This will help prevent you from coming across as desperate.

, The way you start chatting with a person is going to set the mood for the rest of the conversation. You want to pique their interest to get to know you more. Try not to come on too strong. By being too aggressive, you might just scare them off. On the other hand, try not to come on too weak, else you might just bore them. Talking about similar interests is a good start, which may springboard into more in-depth conversations.

Don't open with a boring line like ""Hey"" or ""Hi"". Instead, comment on something in the other person's profile, or something from one of their pictures.

, Here are some basic questions to avoid with new matches or people you’ve just met:

Don’t ask, “Do I look fat?” If you don’t want to hear an honest answer, don’t ask. Weight is a very sensitive issue. Hearing an answer you don’t want to hear, may just leave you offended and may start conflict that could have easily been avoided.
Don’t ask questions about your match's past relationships. Asking about past hookups early on in the relationship could be misconstrued as prying. Let the person get to know you first before asking extremely personal questions.
Don’t ask question about your future as a couple. Jumping the gun with a question like this may be a heavy assumption that you two will actually work together as good partners. Asking about marriage and children with someone you just met will most likely scare them away.
Don’t ask questions that just feed your ego. Asking questions that put your match on the spot may be off-putting. Examples:

“If I were drowning in a shark-infested ocean, would you jump in to save me?”
“If you were offered $1 billion to leave me, would you take it?”



, Ask questions that you think you would want to be asked. Treat the conversation as if the person was actually standing in front of you. Avoid being creepy, and try to get to know the person behind the profile.

Take a look at the interests and hobbies they may have listed. This will help you determine if you share any interests.
You have to be interesting. Tinder is a form of speed-dating, and boring messages will get ignored. Use the chat to express your creativity and humor, and you can set yourself apart from all the other users in your area.

, Again, Tinder is a speed dating service. In order to make an impression, you'll need some face-to-face time. Tinder is great for initiating the contact, but you'll need to follow up on it.

Say something like ""Wouldn't you rather ask these questions in person?"" or ""Come share a drink with me this weekend."" This will help get you moving towards meeting in person.

Open up Tinder after downloading the app.,

Swipe with Tinder.,
Consider how far you’re willing to drive to meet someone.,
Set the radius higher to get more matches.",How to Adjust Your Tinder Search Distance," Make sure you are connected to the Internet and that your app is enabled to process location information, such as GPS.


To do this, go into the settings menu of your phone. Scroll down to ""location services"" or ""location access"" and you will see different functions, including GPS. Enable it.You are now ready to adjust the settings preferences within Tinder.;
, In the upper left corner, tap just to the left of the ""Tinder"" logo. This is essentially the general control panel, which people use to change their profile settings. You can also go here to change the gender and age range of the matches you are seeking, as well as the distance radius.


This logo looks like a grey gear at the top left hand corner of the screen. This will open a menu. Now that the control panel is open, the first listed option is ""Discovery Preferences."" It has a green heart icon. Tap it.
You can also do this by scrolling left (swiping from the left of the screen to the right of the screen) anywhere on the app.You should see a distance slider that allows you to change the distance radius.

, Sliding to the right extends the distance of your Tinder search. Sliding to the left reduces the radius.


For example, a person’s personal settings might be set at 35 miles. It's more than enough for most people. That means you will be matched only with people currently within that circle around you. With the preferences panel open, you have access to general controls. Second from the bottom is a slider labeled ""Search Distance.""
Adjust the slider bar to suit your preferences, and hit ""done"" at the top right corner of the screen. Slide the icon under ""Maximum Distance"" to the desired search range between 1 to 100 miles., Tinder was among the first “swiping apps,” where the user uses a swiping motion to choose between the photos of other users. Tinder uses swipe right for potentially good matches and swipe left on a photo to move to the next one.


Here’s why you might want to frequently change your search distance. Let’s say, for example, that you are at the gym and want to find people who are active (or if you are at a show.) Set the radius as small as possible and then expand to 3 miles.
The reason you need to set a search range is to screen out potential matches who live too far away from you. Most people use Tinder to meet people who live near them or who are simply in the area they are at.
You’re less likely to get people interested in you with too far of a radius because most people don’t go on Tinder looking for long-distance relationships., When you first hop onto Tinder, you're probably not thinking of anything related to your driving time. Once you get established though, you might have a fleeting thought along the lines of ""I don't mind driving a lot!""Be honest with yourself. 50 miles for a most likely mediocre date is a lot. I'm talking about 1 1/2 hours of driving to get coffee with someone who owns more cats than bars of soap. Don't do it; it's not worth it; you're better than that.
It's important that when you're setting up your profile, you take a minute to think about how far you're willing to drive. If you're younger, consider the other person might not have a car (meaning you're driving the whole way. Or they are).

, A five-mile max distance means that any user who fits your age and gender will show up. If you set it to 1 mile, then Tinder will show you people within a 1-mile radius from where you are at that time.


When you change location, then you are moving the center of the radius and will find different people. One reason people change their distance radius is to get more opportunities because they've already seen most of the people closer to them. The default is 50 miles.
If you’re in a major city, you might want to reduce it to 15 miles; choose a longer distance if you live in a less populated area."

You ""swipe"" people you're matched with and select those who meet the preferences you set for age, distance radius, gender, and so forth. Swiping left means you're not interested; swiping right means you are.You have to let the app have access to your Facebook account, although it will not publish things on your wall. It will allow the app to go through your photos and help you set your profile.
You'll get to chose your discovery preferences, which include the radius in which you'd like to swipe that is up to 100 miles and the age range. The most common age range on Tinder is 18-24, but there are people on the site of all age ranges.;
, From the Tinder home screen, tap the menu icon to open your menu. The menu icon appears as three horizontal lines in the top left corner, just to the left of the Tinder logo. Tap on the tab.


This allows you to go into the app’s profile settings. The age range on Tinder goes from 18 to 55+.In the menu, you should see your name and picture, Discovery Preferences, App Settings, Need Help?, Share Tinder, and Give Us Feedback. Tap ""Discovery Preferences.""
In Discovery Preferences, scroll down until you see a section called ""Show Ages."" This should be near the bottom. There will be many options on the page that appears; scroll down and look for one that says ""Show Ages,"" at the bottom of the page.

, In this section, there is a control bar and a number display indicating your desired age range. To adjust your desired age range, simply slide the two dots on your control bar either left or right.


Sliding a dot left or right decreases or increases its number respectively. The left-most dot controls your minimum desired age range, and the right-most dot controls your maximum desired age range.
So, if your current age range is 20-30 and you would like to include matches up to 35, slide the right-most dot towards the right until the numbers display 20-35. Once your changes are complete, tap the back arrow in the top-left corner to return to Tinder's home screen.

, In the Tinder app, you should see the Tinder logo on the top-left corner of the app. To the left of that logo, you should be able to see what appears to be half a button, or a small button with three small horizontal lines on top of each other. That's the menu button. Press it, and it'll open up a menu.


In the menu page, you should have your profile picture on top with a small ""View Profile"" button. Underneath this, is a list of menu items which you can press. They are ""Discovery Preferences"", ""App Settings"", ""Need Help?"", and ""Share Tinder"". Click on ""Discovery Preferences."" In the page that opens, you can see everything about your ""people discovery"" option.
To select the age range in which you see profiles around you, you need to adjust the ""Show Ages"" slider at the bottom of the page. Then, use it the same way. You can set the minimum and maximum ages on the slider itself, which ranges between 18 and 55+.
The starting age is edited by the first circular selection and the end age is edited by the second circular selection. Any changes in the slider are shown on the right hand side with the age range (e.g. 21-41). These changes will be automatically saved without a need to save it explicitly.

, The Tinder age range adjustment depends on your age and what you are looking for. Leaving the age range wider will allow you to meet more people.


If you are 30 and want to date, try to adjust the Tinder age around or above your age. It does not necessarily mean you will find your future spouse within this age group, but statistically you've got a higher chance to find people who are looking for similar things on Tinder. If you are under 18 you will only be able to see ages 13-17 max.The lower limit is the first white bubble, and the upper limit is the second white bubble. Your age range is every age in between them. Slide each of these bubbles with your fingertip to control the minimum and maximum ages that will appear on your Tinder.
If you're underage, you can't see adults. If you're an adult, you can't find underage people.

, What if you want to change your own age? The age that shows on Tinder for you is pulled from a user's Facebook profile, meaning the only way to change the age on Tinder, is to change your age and birthday information on FacebookAfter you log in to Facebook, click on “about” and scroll to your birth date within Facebook.

Find the app in common app stores like the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.
Tinder will send you potential matches in your geographic area who match your interests. You should swipe right to indicate you’re interested in chatting with a person you’re matched with on Tinder or swipe left to indicate you’re not.;
, You must have an active Facebook site to log in to Tinder. There is no other way to do it. It’s easier if you make sure you’ve got the gender you want selected within Facebook before signing up for Tinder. Tinder pulls your Facebook information onto your Tinder profile.


As Tinder is about to start using many of your Facebook details, including gender, be sure to update all aspects of it, including selecting better photos. Include all of your interests to ensure some good matches.Whatever you select on Tinder will automatically appear on Facebook with one big exception: Tinder only allows you to choose male or female, whereas Facebook has many more gender choices. You might want to keep this in mind and select the gender you most closely identify with between the two (male/female) on Facebook to reduce the chances Tinder will pick the opposite one if you choose another gender option on Facebook.
Tinder says the reason it requires you to log in through Facebook is in order to verify your identity. It’s possible to keep your activity on Tinder private from your Facebook friends, though., The best way to change your gender on Tinder is to change your gender on Facebook so it automatically updates your Tinder page.


Facebook has many more options for gender than Tinder does. Facebook also allows you to choose a preferred pronoun. It’s not very hard to change your gender on Facebook.To edit your basic personal information (such as gender) on Facebook, go to your profile and click “update info” at the bottom of your cover photo. You can edit other information here too, such as your contact information, relationship status, work, and education.
Click on the section you want to change, and hover your cursor over the place you want to edit. Click “edit” or “options” and then “edit” to the right of the section you’ve chosen. On the page with your newsfeed, you will find this section under your name at the upper left of the screen.
Within each section, there is an audience selector next to some of the information. This allows you to choose the audience you want to see the information. Under gender, Facebook also has a pull down tab that allows you to choose “female,” “male” or “custom.” Under custom, you can choose multiple gender options (such as Cisgender Female, Gender Fluid, Female to Male, Trans Female, etc.)

, To adjust your gender within the Tinder app itself, open the app, and press the settings button on the top left of the screen. You are looking for the three-lined menu icon that appears in the top left corner of the screen.


Choose “discovery preferences.” You might need to do this if Tinder assigns a gender for you that you don’t prefer, since Facebook has many more choices for gender than Tinder does.
Press edit in the top right corner of the screen. Scroll down and change where it says gender. You will be able to change such things as distance and age in addition to gender. Make sure you’ve enabled your GPS so the location function will work., You can only choose male or female within the Tinder settings.


Tinder does give you the option to state who you're attracted to rather than automatically assume your sexuality based on gender, though.
Although the only two choices are male or female, you could check both.

, If you’ve changed your gender on Facebook or within the Tinder settings, and you don’t see a change after a few days, try uninstalling and reinstalling Tinder.


Uninstall the app, remove it from your trusted apps on Facebook, update your gender on Facebook, and reinstall Tinder.
To change your gender on Facebook if you’re already on Tinder, log out of Tinder. Log into Facebook. Alter your Facebook gender. It can take a couple of days for your Tinder profile to change, though.

, Maybe you need to change more than just your gender. You can change your photo too, but you can only use photos already uploaded into Facebook.


Under account settings, you should see your profile pictures and several setting choices underneath. Press on your profile picture, and you should see your bio and all the other pictures on your page. The app also pulls your Facebook profile picture and four random Facebook pictures from your site. You can change which images you want to appear, though. You could just change your Facebook profile photo, as Tinder will update the photo. Or, find timeline photos in Tinder settings. Upload the new photo you want to your Facebook timeline (you can privatize it). Choose edit profile, add picture, albums. The photo you uploaded should come up as an option. Choose it."

Take your time.",How to Beat Candy Crush Level 147," Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Do you see good moves to quickly get a Striped candy or other special candies? Can you easily clear out the jelly squares and the meringues?;
, Start by matching candies beside the meringue blocks to weaken and remove them. You will need two hits on these blocks to remove them. Go for possible combos involving four or five candies in a row if you can.

, Aim your hits near the same area as much as possible. Once you’ve penetrated the meringue blocks, candies can get inside the middle part with the jelly squares.

, With some candies inside the middle part, it will be easier to remove more of the meringue blocks. You will also be able to start removing some jelly squares in the process.

, With more meringue blocks freed up, the spaces can now be occupied by more candies. With more spaces on the board, you will be able to make more combos with the candies, and maybe generate some special candies too., Once you’ve cleared up some meringues, you will notice colored bombs dropping with the candies.

, If you cannot clear the bombs where they are, clear some candies below them so that they can fall down to the bigger area. When they get there, it will be easier to clear them by matching them with similar-colored candies.

, Bombs have timers on them. With each move, the timer goes down. Don’t panic yet! Bombs start counting from 15, so you have 15 moves before they exploded. Do not let it run out though, because once it does, it’s game over., Look for moves that will give you Striped candies. Bring the horizontally Striped candies to the bottom so that they can easily clear out the bottom row of jelly squares. Bring vertically Striped candies to the corners so that they can easily clear out the vertical columns of jelly squares.

, This can be harder to make, but not impossible. Look for opportunities to do so. Using the Wrapped candies as bombs can really make the jelly squares go away faster. Wrapped candies work best when used in the corners.

, If you can, put a Striped candy and a Wrapped candy together. The best place to have this combo is in the bottom row and near the vertical columns. If you’re lucky, you can get a lot of jelly squares this way.

, Look for ways to generate a Candy Bomb by matching five candies in a row. It’s always useful to have this special candy. It’s extra special if you can combine it with a Striped candy to do more damage so that you can clear out more jelly squares faster.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move. Keep your focus on the jelly squares."

Get at least 7 candies per move.,
Use the open board.,
Focus on certain colors.,
Make color bombs.,
Make combinations.,
Work low on the board.,
Aim for a lot of “Divine”.",How to Beat Candy Crush Level 140," This is one of the hardest level in Candy Crush since you need to collect 297 candies, with all six colors, within 45 moves. Which means you have to get at least 7 candies per move.


This level may seem dull for other players because it is considered not too thrilling, with nothing on the board except candies.;
, There are no blockers on your board, so this gives you enormous moves opportunities. Use this to your advantage!


There are no tricks in this round, and no bombs will drop down or chocolates will appear randomly; it's just you and the open board filled with candies.

, Target the reds, yellows, and oranges. You should be able to make a filling move every time. Don't be afraid to make special candy combinations, for this boosts up your points.


You need also need 30,000 points in order to finish this game. Again, it's possible to make filling moves since there are no blockers or bombs.

, The strategy is to create special candies. Thanks to the lack of blockers, you will never find another board where it is as easy to form wrapped candies, striped candies, and color bombs. This is one of your biggest assets, so if you ever encounter a chance of creating special bombs, do so.


When you swap a color bomb with a candy, all of that color on the board will be detonated, and following an update, they give lots of points when used.
It's best to use color bombs on a specific color of candy, as it collects a bunch of them and may trigger cascades.
Focus on the reds, oranges, and yellows since these colors are included in the objectives.

, A combination gives a better effect, such as color bomb + striped candy. This turns every candy of that color into a striped candy in a horizontal-vertical pattern from the top left along the rows and then activates them all.


A color bomb + wrapped candy clears every candy of the wrapped candy’s color, then the most abundant color present on the board. In effect, this combination clears two colors and usually scores massive amount of points.
A color bomb + color bomb clears every candy on the board.
A color bomb + candy bomb has the same effect as using a color bomb with a normal candy, except it scores you much more points, and even more, depending how many bombs of the same color are on the board.

, Temptation to move anywhere on the board may be hard to resist since there are no blockers or bombs, but the best way to play this game is by keeping your moves lower on the board. This will bring down more candies and will help form candy combos by catalyst from rows dropping in.

, As you work on the lower part of the board, a lot of combos will become possible. Aim for large cascades while looking for a chance to create special candies. Both will give you more points, which makes the 30,000 goal within 45 moves attainable.

Stop the chocolate.,
Take your time.",How to Beat Candy Crush Level 164," You can play the game online within Facebook or on your mobile devices. Launch it, then hit the “Play” button.;
, When the game maps loads, navigate through it until you see “164.” Hit the button for the level to begin.

, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Is your first ingredient in the column where it can easily drop straight to the bottom, or is it in the column blocked by a chocolate wheel? Can you easily get special candies, especially a vertically Striped candy, on your first few moves?

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead an exit. You won’t lose a life as long as you haven’t touched any candy., If the ingredient is in the wrong column, meaning it’s in the one blocked by a chocolate wheel at the bottom, maneuver it to get it to the correct column with the arrows on the bottom row. This is important as you don’t want to get your ingredient to the bottom and be blocked at the very last row.

, A Striped candy is a special candy that results from matching four candies in a row. When you use a Striped candy as part of a match, it will clear out a whole row or column from the board. If you can, go for vertically Striped candies. With the proper column placement, you can easily drop an ingredient to the bottom in a single move. Position the Striped candy in the column where the ingredient is before using it.

, A Wrapped candy is a special candy that results from matching at least three vertical and three horizontal candies forming a plus, T-shape, or corner-shape. When you use a Wrapped candy as part of a match, it will first explode and knock out the nine candies surrounding it, and then it will drop and explode again, knocking out another nine candies the same way. Position the Wrapped candy in the areas under the ingredient before using it. You will be able to drop the ingredient quickly with this.

, A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible. You just have to work on getting the right candies in place to swap with to form the five-in-a-row. Color bombs do not need to be matched in order to be used. You can just swap it with another candy, and all similar-colored candies will be removed from the board. Take out candies of the same color that are under the ingredient.


You should also try to combine the Candy Bomb with a vertically Striped candy to multiply the effects of the Striped candy. That will definitely make it easy to drop the ingredient.

, There are six arrow marks at the bottom row where the ingredients should fall. Once you get an ingredient in the right columns, focus on clearing the path to get it to the bottom. Use any of the special candies you made to make it easier.

, You are required to bring down three chestnuts and three cherries. You can only have one ingredient at a time on your board. Once one has been cleared, a new one will appear at the top again. Go ahead and try to get it down by using the same strategy as explained earlier., As early as your second move, the chocolate wheels will spread chocolate starting at the bottom. As long as it doesn’t go to the column where the ingredient is, you should be okay.

, You can break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board, especially towards the column where the ingredient is. It will be very difficult to drop the ingredient if it does. Stop the chocolate early before it spreads all over.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move.

Try creating one or more horizontal candies on the left side of the playing board to help clear the licorice locks on the right. Make a horizontal striped candy by matching four of the same-colored candies in a row, while moving the fourth candy into the match in a left or right horizontal direction.;
, This can help prevent the cherry from getting stuck above any chocolate squares that are blocking the cherry’s path to the bottom.

, Failing to clear chocolate can result in the chocolate dominating the right side of the board, and blocking the cherry’s path.

, Striped + wrapped combos are highly effective, as well as color bomb + wrapped or color bomb + striped.


Make a color bomb by matching five candies of the same color in a row.
Make a wrapped candy by matching five candies of the same color in an L shape, T shape, or + shape.
Make a striped candy by matching four candies of the same color in a row.

, Any matches you make on the right side will automatically help bring down the cherry from the left side, and can also help eliminate existing chocolate squares."

, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Do you see some good moves that can get you special candies? How about moves that can quickly get an ingredient to the middle three columns? Better yet, do you have an ingredient already on the middle three columns?

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead an exit. You won’t lose a life as long as you haven’t touched any candy., Look for moves that will give you Striped candies. Ideally, you should aim for a vertically Striped candy right under the ingredient. This will make it a lot faster to drop the ingredient to the bottom.

, These can be harder to make, so look for every opportunities to do so. Try to create one in the column where the ingredient is located so that it can help bring it down.

, Look for ways to generate a Candy Bomb by matching five candies in a row. It’s always useful to have this special candy. It’s extra special if you can combine it with a vertically Striped candy that’s located in the column with the ingredient. This can clear out the column faster, allowing the ingredient to drop.

, If the ingredient on the board isn’t on the right columns yet, take every opportunity to swap it towards the middle. This is your main priority. If you have other combos elsewhere, those can only be distractions and can be a waste of moves.

, There are three arrow marks where the ingredients should fall. These are located on the middle three columns. Once you get an ingredient in the middle columns, focus on clearing the path to get it to the bottom. Vertically Striped candies can be of great use here.

, You are required to bring down two chestnuts and one cherry. You can only have one ingredient at a time on your board. Once one has been cleared, a new one will appear at the top again. Go ahead and try to maneuver it to the middle columns as described above for the next ingredient., At the start of the level, the chocolate is blocked by a row of meringues. Avoid breaking the meringues early in the game so that the chocolate won’t spread. Focus on bringing the ingredients down first. Only break the meringues once the ingredients are near the bottom.

, Once the meringues are broken, the chocolate will spread. Watch out for when this happens so that you can immediately control the chocolate.

, You can break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board. It will be very difficult to complete the level if it does. Stop the chocolate early before it spreads all over. If you can clear them all out, it will be easier to bring the ingredients down.

, This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move. However, you need to balance your moves among the three ingredients you need to bring down. You cannot waste a lot of moves just for one ingredient, unless it’s the last one."

, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. It will be good if you can easily make some special candies to help clear out lots of jellies. Do you see good moves to quickly get those? There are some candies locked by licorice as well. See if there are moves that can easily release them so that you can have more space and movement on the board.

, If you don’t like your board, go ahead and exit. You won’t lose a life as long as you haven’t touched any candy., Some of the candies near the center of the board are locked by licorice. These licorice cannot be moved, so it will be hard to move candies around. Match the candies inside the licorice with the ones outside to break them out. Getting some licorice out of the way can free up some movement space for your candies, enabling you to make special candies.

, Look for moves that will give you Striped candies. Horizontally and vertically Striped candies can be a lot of use in clearing up the jellies and the chocolate. These can come in handy when you’re trying to clear jellies near the corners and the chocolate wheels.

, These can be harder to make, but it’s not impossible. Using the Wrapped candies as bombs can really make the jellies and chocolate go away faster.

, If you can, put a Striped candy and a Wrapped candy together. The best place to have this combo is in the middle part of the board, where all the jellies are.

, Look for ways to generate a Candy Bomb by matching five candies in a row. It’s always useful to have this special candy. It’s extra special if you can combine it with a Striped candy to do more damage so that you can clear out more jellies and chocolate faster.

, Once you’ve cleared up some licorice, you can focus your matches at the bottom of the board. There’s a good chance that you can get some cascading matches if you do., As early as your second move, the chocolate wheels will spread chocolate. You will get chocolate over the jellies you need to clear, adding another step towards their removal. Identify where the chocolate is spreading.

, You can break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board. It will be very difficult to complete the level if it does. Stop the chocolate early before it spreads all over.

, You don’t need to clear out all chocolate to complete the level. However, there will be jellies under some chocolate that you may have missed, especially near the chocolate wheels. Make sure you take them out as well.

, It's a yellow app containing the outline of a white ghost., This will prompt you to create a new Snapchat account., You'll be prompted to enter your name, email address, birthday, and mobile number to create a password. Make sure the email address is valid, as you'll need it if you ever want to reset your password. You'll also need to be at least 13 years old to create your account.You'll need to create a unique username that will be displayed to other Snapchat users. Do not include any personal information in your username. You won't be able to change this username later, so make sure you like the name. If you want to change your username later, you'll need to create a new account.
Snapchat will prompt you to verify your phone number via SMS. Verifying your number allows you to reset your password via text, but is not necessary to create an account.
Snapchat will require you to select a series of images before your account is created. This is to prevent bots from creating accounts automatically. Tap ""Continue"" after selecting the images that contain the Snapchat ghost logo.

, Snapchat will scan your address book to look for other people who are using Snapchat. You can skip this step by tapping Continue and then Not Allow.
, You'll need people to chat with if you want to use Snapchat. Adding someone lets you send Snaps to the person and view their public Story, but the other person will need to add you back in order to reply to Snaps and view a friends-only Story.

Many users don't allow Snaps from users that they haven't added back. If you send a Snap to someone who hasn't added you back, you'll likely see ""Pending"" until your friend request is approved.

, The quickest way to add a friend on Snapchat is to enter their Snapchat username. You can't add someone by email, real name, or phone number unless they're already in your Contacts and has enabled address book matching in their Snapchat settings.

Swipe down anywhere on the Snapchat camera screen. This opens your profile and options.
Tap Add Friends. Doing so takes you to the Add Friends screen.
Tap Add by Username. The username search will appear.

Snapchat will only record as long as you are holding the button., If you don't like the picture or video Snap you took, this button in the upper-left corner deletes it., Photo Snaps display a stopwatch button that allows you to set a duration between one and 10 seconds. This is the amount of time a Snap will be displayed before it disappears.

Video Snaps do not have timers. They will play through the length of the recording and then close.

, You can use the Lenses feature in Snapchat to scan your face and apply crazy effects. You can do this with either the front or the rear camera, but you'll find it easier if you're taking a selfie. Tap the Camera button in the upper-right corner to switch to your front-facing camera.

You can't apply the Lenses effects to Snaps you've already taken. You'll need to activate Lenses before you take a Snap.

, Many offer prompts like ""Open your mouth"" to ensure you get the effect's best results.

The selections of effects rotates on a daily basis, with the oldest Lens in the list being replaced by a new one. If you don't see the effect you want, check back in the next few days.
If you can't get Lenses to start, your device may not be compatible. Lenses requires Android 4.3+ on newer devices, or the latest version of iOS on iPhone 4S or newer. Older iOS and Android devices may not work, even if they're running the latest software versions.

, While the effect is active, you can take and record Snaps just like you would normally. Tap the circle button (which displays the Lenses choice) to take a photo Snap with the current effect, or press and hold to record a video., Follow the steps in the previous section to open the list of available Lenses., Swipe through the menu until you find the Face Swap option. The icon has two smiley faces on a yellow background, with arrows pointing between them.

If you don't see Face Swap, it may have rotated out of the available selection. Check back in a few days to see if it's back.

, Users report that the Face Swap effect works best if neither of you are wearing glasses., These will turn yellow when a face is aligned with it. Once both faces are aligned, they'll be swapped!

You don't have to be standing next to each other, you just need to have both faces aligned in the frame.

, Like other Lenses, you can take a Snap by tapping or holding the circle at the bottom of the screen., If you want to be able to give the picture to your friend or family member that isn't using Snapchat, save it to your phone or to Snapchat Memories by tapping the Save button in the lower-left corner of the scree and sending it ike you would any picture., It's the button in the upper-right that looks like a sticky note with a folded corner.

You can take screenshots of Snaps, but the sender will be notified that you did. Most Snapchat users don't like it when people take screenshots, as it's contrary to the spirit of Snapchat. Check with the sender for permission before screenshotting, or you may get blocked.

, Snapchat allows you to replay a Snap once before you navigate away from the Chat screen. If you leave the screen, you lose your replay.., Doing so takes you to the screen where you can view your friends' Stories., When you tap a Story, it will begin to play from the oldest Snap.

, Your business username is one of the main ways people will add your company on Snapchat. You can change your display name later to match your business name exactly, but your username cannot be changed after making it.

, Snaps go away as soon as the recipient views it, or if it's on your Story, after 24 hours. Because of this, marketing on Snapchat is a very ""in the now"" experience. If you want to share something that your customers are going to want to continue to refer to, consider another method.

, Your customers will add you to their friends list so that they can see your story and receive Snaps from you. Add them back so that you can reach each individual customer if necessary. This interaction also adds to the feeling of being part of the process for the customer.

, Snapchat can send both photos and videos.


Tap the Shutter button in the Snapchat camera to take a photo Snap.
Press and hold the shutter button to record a video Snap. Video Snaps can be up to ten seconds long.

, Using captions for your Snap is essential for businesses, as you can include websites, Twitter handles, or any other information that you can fit. You're limited to 31 characters, unless you use one of the workarounds discussed in Get a Longer Caption on Snapchat.


Tapping the ""T"" button a second time will make the text larger, and tapping it a third time will center the text and remove the caption box background.

, Creative use of the drawing tool can really help your Snaps stand out. If you have the budget, consider hiring someone with some doodling skills. You can do a lot with drawings, and a popular technique is to take a picture of a black background and then draw a colorful sign on it.


Press and hold on the color strip to select from a variety of different drawing colors. See Find Extra Colors in Snapchat for more details.

, By default, your Snaps will only be visible for three seconds. You can tap the timer to change photo Snap length to up to ten seconds. This is important if you have essential information or a lot of text on the screen.


Video Snaps last as long as the recording, but you can increase this by using the Slow-Motion filter. Swipe on the Snap after recording it until you find the Snail filter. This can be really useful if you want a Snap that's just text to be visible for a long time.

, Snapchat's ad program, called ""V3,"" will place your company's video ads in Live Stories. Running full-fledged advertisements in Snapchat is an expensive endeavor, and will only be cost-effective for companies with massive advertising budgets. Unless you consider your company on the same tier as McDonalds, Universal Pictures, Sony, Kraft, or Budweiser, you'll probably want to focus on advertising through your own Story and local geofilters., Your Story is a collection of chronological Snaps that stay up for 24 hours. By keeping your story up to date, your customers will always have something to see about your business.


Stories are a much easier way to reach your audience than sending Snaps to everyone on your list.

, Stories work best when you have a sequential campaign in mind, such as a countdown to a reveal or a series of short Snaps that tell a story together. Plan out your Story so that you know what you're doing ahead of time.Consider doing a Story as a lead-up to a sale or event, or as a way to chronicle a day at the business.
You can use your Story to give a ""behind-the-scenes"" look at your business by posting strategic Snaps throughout the day.You can use your Story to show the specials of the day, since the Story Snaps only last 24 hours.

, Snapchat can give your remote customers a chance to ""attend"" the same event you are. Use your Snapchat Story to chronicle the event you're throwing for your business, or give a glimpse of your company at a trade show or event you're visiting. Not only will this promote the event, it will promote your own business as well., If your product lends itself to physical demonstrations, use Snapchat to give followers a quick peek at ways that they can use your product. These ten second mini-""commercials"" can do a lot to spread the word about your product and increase buzz.

, To post a Snap to your Story, tap the ""Add to Story"" button at the bottom of the screen, or select ""My Story"" when you tap the ""Send"" button. This will add the new Snap to the end of your Story. Your followers will see the new Snap if they are all caught up. People who haven't seen your Story yet today will start it from the oldest Snap still available.

, Snapchat is a great tool for increasing foot traffic to your business through offers. Because Snaps on your Story expire after 24 hours, your coupon has a built-in immediacy to it. Come up with a discount or offer that will get people in the door and more likely to purchase from you., This doesn't have to be fancy, just something like, ""Look out for a special offer today in our Story!"" This will get people's attention and also let people know that the next Snap is the offer.

, There are several ways you can create a coupon Snap. You can record a video Snap of you saying the offer, maybe while displaying the product. You can take a photo Snap of your coupon or offer, or use the drawing tools the draw the coupon on the screen.


Even though Snaps expire, put a date on the coupon anyway in case someone takes a screenshot.

, This engages the customer and cements the relationship they have with you through Snapchat. Your followers can open your Story on their phones and show the coupon Snap.

, You can offer special deals for users that send out Snaps with your product in them. You can advertise this promotion elsewhere so that your customers always know about it. Having your customers send out Snaps to their friends with your products in them will help raise awareness for your brand.

, Snapchat allows you to purchase custom geofilters for your business, which will appear when users are in a certain location at a certain date. This can be really useful for sales or events that your business is hosting. Because the filter cost is determined partly by length, and because the maximum length is 30 days, they are not an effective means of constant advertisement.It can take a few days for filters to get approved, so try to plan ahead and have your filter up and ready to go at least a couple week in advance.

, If you decide you want to make a geofilter for your business, you'll need to create the art for the filter in an image editing program. If you're the artistic type, you can make one yourself, but you may want to consider hiring an artist. There are several design companies that will not make you a custom filter as well.


If you're making your own, you'll need an image editor like Photoshop, Illustrator, or GIMP. There are some guidelines that will need to be followed, such as the image's dimensions and how much space the art can take on the screen. See Create Your Own Filter on Snapchat for detailed instructions.

, Once you've created or received the geofilter for your business, you can upload it to the Snapchat website. Visit https://snapchat.com/purchase/ and click the ""Choose File"" button to upload your image.

, You can set a filter to be active for as little as one hour, or as long as thirty days. Snapchat charges $5 per 200,000 sq. feet, per hour.


It's worth noting that the timezone will be in your current time, but it cannot be changed. So if you're creating the filter for an event somewhere else, keep the timezone difference in mind when setting the times.

, Click and drag the map around, or enter a city, landmark, or address into the search field. Center the map on the location you want to set for your business's geofilter.

, Click ""Enhance"" until it turns into a ""Draw Fence"" button. This will zoom the map close enough to begin creating the geofence.

, Click points on the map to create a geometric shape for your fence. If people are inside this fence, your geofilter will appear in Snapchat for them to use.


You can see the size of the fence and the current cost in the upper-right corner. Snapchat charges $5 per 200,000 sq. feet, per hour.
Make sure that the geofence makes sense for your business. You don't want to include a bunch of the surrounding area, as it won't be cost effective for you. You want to provide geofilters for Snapchatters that are physically close to your event.

, After setting the fence boundaries and setting the dates, you can purchase the filter. You'll need to enter your business's name as the ""Geofilter Name."" Your filter will need to be approved by Snapchat, which usually takes a few days. Once it's approved, your payment method will be charged and the filter will go live at the date and time you specified.

, Once the filter is live, you should be able to select it by swiping left after taking a Snap. Location can be a little iffy sometimes, so make sure you're near the center of your geofence. If you're not seeing any geofilters, you may need to enable location access for Snapchat. See Use Filters on Snapchat for details.

Pin emoji to objects that enter the frame later.",How to Use 3D Stickers in Snapchat," You'll need version 9.28.2.0 or higher of Snapchat, released April 2016, in order to pin stickers to objects and create 3D stickers. You can update Snapchat from your device's app store.;
, You can pin stickers to objects in your video, and the sticker will stay attached to the object throughout the video. This will work best if you have something in your video with clearly defined features and movement.

, You can swipe left and right to see the different categories.

, It will be added to the center of the screen.

, Make sure to hold it until the screen pauses. The video will pause, and you can drag your sticker around.Try to do this during a part of the video where the object is clearly in the frame.

, This will ""pin"" the sticker to the object, and the sticker will follow the object around and scale as it moves closer to and farther from the lens., You can see how well the sticker tracks the object in the preview of the Snap. Note that this feature is still new, and may not always work correctly.

, Test out different things you can attach stickers to. You'll get better results by attaching stickers to slower moving objects that don't get blurry.

, Got something in your video you don't want others to see? You can pin a 3D sticker to it, and it will remain covered throughout the entire clip, even as the camera moves around. The sticker will automatically resize as necessary.

, 3D stickers work great for replacing your pet's face with a smiley face. Take a video of your pet and pin a sticker to it. The sticker should track your pet's face as it moves in your video.

, You can pin more than one emoji to your video at once, allowing different emoji to track different objects. There is no practical limit to the number of emoji that you pin to objects.

, The object you pin an emoji to doesn't have to start in the video. If you pause and attach an emoji to an object that appears half-way through the video, the emoji won't appear until the object appears.

, Repeated attempts at contact from people you've ignored can count as harassment. It's best to simply block them.


You also shouldn't feel bad about blocking people in your contacts list who send you unwanted or inappropriate snaps.

, Even though you trust the friend or friends who you're snapping, you have to assume that anyone can see the snap as soon as it has been opened.

, While it can be tempting to add a snap with a geofilter of your neighborhood to a public story, it's safer to use filters that don't reveal your location.


The same notion goes for snaps of addresses and license plates.

, Again, you clearly trust the friend to whom you're sending the information if it's personal. However, your snaps stop being private and become public as soon as you hit the send button, so anything you wouldn't feel comfortable sharing with people outside of your contact list is best left for in-person conversation.

You will also see a score progress bar. Every time you crush candies (as discussed below), you’ll earn points. These points will help you progress through the levels. If you do not earn enough points over the course of completing a level, you will lose a life. Lose all five lives and you’ll be forced to either wait until your lives refill or edit the Settings. Lives can be viewed on the larger game screen, where your progress through the levels is shown.;
, The game is played by swiping candies, in any direction (so long as it is not blocked), to create sets of 3 or more matching candies. When matched, the candies will crush and shift the candies above them, allowing you to accomplish a series of different goals. If you create sets greater than 3, you will create candy combinations. These are powerful candy crushing machines which work in a variety of ways.


If you match four candies, a special candy will be created which will burst an entire row if matched as part of another set of 3 or more.
If you match 5 or more candies in a T or L shape, you will create a wrapped candy. These explode the square of candies surrounding that tile (when matched) and then explode a subsequent 3x3 block wherever they settle.
If you match 5 candies in a single row, you’ll create color bombs. These look like balls of chocolate covered in sprinkles. These will crush all candies on the board of the same color as the candy you swap them with. They do not need to be merged into a set of three. Choose which color they crush wisely.
You can also match any two special candies with each other. This will produce a variety of effects. Combining striped and wrapped candies and stripes and color bombs are especially productive, as this will clear a large number of candies.

, You can earn a few of the boosters in the beginning of the game. You can also purchase most boosters within the game using actual money. These can help you win a level when you’re too frustrated or unable to continue. Be careful how you use them, however, as you never know when you’ll need one. Be strategic.


There are boosters which add moves, the lollipop hammer (which crushes the desired candy on the board), shuffle candy (which will rearrange the board), among a number of other boosters. They should be explained as you earn them, though almost all you will have to buy.

, Each level will have a set goal. This can be reaching a specific number of points, destroying a specific set of tiles (jelly-covered tiles), or other goals like forcing items to fall to the bottom.

, You will play a series of games, each with a different game board and many with different goals, which will progress you across the levels. The game is split into sections of 15 levels. In order to progress to the next section of level you will have to acquire tickets (3, to be exact). These can be given by your friends who play Candy Crush or you will need to purchase them.

Eliminate complicated or dangerous candies from the board first.,
Pay attention to the edges of the game board.,
Reshuffle the board if it looks too challenging.,
Get your friends to play the game.,
Largely ignore the suggestions the game makes.",How to Play Candy Crush Saga2," There are some tiles, like bombs or chocolate, which should always be eliminated first if they exist on the board these will inhibit your progress or cause you to lose. Bombs end the game if not eliminated in the move limit specified on their face, while chocolate will multiply if not destroyed., You will have many levels where the game board is not a perfect rectangle, or includes a number of gaps in the board. You will need to plan around these gaps and they can make it incredibly difficult to make paired sets.

, Once you become better acquainted with the game, you will be able to tell when a game board will be too difficult to complete. You can reshuffle the board using boosters or by exiting the game before you do any moves.

, The best strategy to progress in the game is to get your friends to play. It is a social game and there will be a variety of benefits to having your friends play. Friends can give you boosters, the tickets needed to progress through the levels, as well as a variety of other benefits.

, The game will make move suggestions if you idle for too long. These suggestions are random and it will usually be in your best interest to ignore them. If you don’t have a time limit, take the time to find out if there is a better move available. If you are only trying to increase points before a time limit runs out, take the game’s suggestion.

Focus on making multiple vertical striped candies within the top section.,
Start in the middle and work outward when matching wrapped candies within the bottom section.,
Look for opportunities to make one or more color bombs in the top section.,
Focus primarily on matching candies in the bottom half of the screen after breaking through the meringue barriers.",How to Beat Candy Crush 197," The top and bottom halves of level 197 are only separated by a single candy square, and vertical striped candies will be most effective at unlocking the meringue barriers located at the bottom half of the screen.To make a vertical striped candy, match four candies in a row of the same color, and move the last candy into the row either up or down in a vertical direction to complete the match.
When making vertical striped candies, try to create them near the center of the board, if possible. Detonating vertical striped candies near the center of the board will create one or more explosions that will increase your odds of completing level 197 within 50 moves.;
, When detonated, wrapped candies will clear the surrounding eight candies. There are 12 wrapped candies in the middle of the meringue barriers at the bottom half of the level, and starting in the middle can increase the opportunity for chain reactions that wipe out all locked meringues and jellies., When matched with another candy, a color bomb will wipe and clear all candies on-screen of the same color the bomb was matched with.


Match five candies in a row of the same color to create a color bomb.

, All the jellies in level 197 are located in the bottom section of the level, and matching candies in the top half may not help you complete this level unless you’re making color bombs or vertical striped candies."

Send a follow request to your friends, family members and everyone you’re connected with on other social media platforms. These people will provide your core audience.You can discover who among your acquaintances is on Snapchat by using the “Add From Contacts” option.Have your close friends spread your info around to everyone they know as a favor to you.;
, After adding friends and family, you can concentrate on convincing other users to follow you. Begin following friends of friends, local celebrities and entertainers and any other accounts that you like. Chances are, they’ll give you a follow in return.Post your snapcode publicly. A snapcode is a one-of-a-kind series of symbols that other users can simply scan with their phones to begin following you.Network on social media message boards. You and other members will be able to exchange info, follow one another and help your respective stats up to become more visible., In some cases, you may be able to appeal to influential users to share your username or give you a verbal shout-out in one of their snaps. This message will be delivered to a much wider audience, and their devoted followers will be encouraged to check out your account. Cross-promotion is a great opportunity for everyone to secure new followers.You may be expected to pay for shout-outs from private companies and high-profile individuals.
Message another user directly or mention them in a snap to bring your account to their attention.

, Since the user discovery feature isn’t very sophisticated, it can be difficult to get your name out there. This is where platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram will come in handy. Take advantage of your contact base on these sites by sharing your Snapchat info and teasing the kinds of exclusive content they’ll be able to find there.Display your Snapcode as a temporary profile picture to let the people on your friends list know how they can follow you.
It will help to reserve your Snapchat for specialized posts that your followers won’t be able to see anywhere else.

, Your Snapchat stories won’t leaving a lasting impression if they’re no different from anyone else’s. Instead of simply sharing selfies or broadcasting photos of your lunch, highlight some unique characteristic or mode of presentation that will help you stand out. More people will be motivated to follow you if they can’t get your type of content anywhere else.Give your account a distinct theme. Your snaps might be centered around documenting thrillseeking adventures, touring local eateries or even performing short comedy sketches.Try not to make the same type of post all the time. This can quickly get repetitive. Always be looking for unusual or exciting moments to share.
Strive to be the only person doing what you do on the app.

, This may be the most important criteria of all. No one wants to feel like they’re being sold something, and if you’re not careful your users will catch onto the fact that you’re using your account to do the bidding of other companies. The snaps you post to your story should be personalized, authentic and come from a place of genuine interest.Package your stories in creative, engaging ways that allow you to relate to your followers’ preferences.
Give your Snapchat followers a more interactive experience by asking questions, posting surveys and urging them to share and post their own responses to your stories., New advances in social media technology have made it possible for users to embed URL links through apps like Emoticode. Downloading one of these programs will allow you to share the online address of your personal or business website to your followers. It will be much easier to get new eyes on your page if people aren’t forced to open a separate browser to find it.If you make a living by selling a particular product or service, be sure to display a link to your online store so that interested followers know where to go to make purchases.

, Teaming Emoticode with a money-processing program like Snapcash can make it possible to turn your account into an entertainment hub and merch marketplace in one. Use your snaps to advertise specialty products, services or offers, then process the payments straight from your buyers. With the right marketing, you can watch your personal brand become a public business.Managing your product sales through Snapcash can help you keep up with order details without the need to go through other programs.Make sure you've taken the proper steps to secure your identity and payment options before exposing your financial info on Snapchat (or any other apps, for that matter)., Companies like Geofilter and Confetti now offer a unique service that lets users design and upload their own custom Snapchat filters. All you have to do is create a filter that represents your business, brand or image, then pay a small fee to have it published. Once it’s been approved, other users will be able to add the filter to their snaps, garnering your account more attention.Each time another user applies your custom filter, it will be like free advertising.Use your filters to get the word out about upcoming sales, events and appearances.

, Many companies are constantly on the lookout for influential users who might be able to attract attention to their products or services. Offers for sponsored content and ongoing partnerships will usually start to come in after you’ve gained a large enough following. If a certain brand proposes to compensate you in exchange for marketing to your fanbase, take them up on it!By advertising for a big company, you stand to make thousands of dollars from a single story.This type of arrangement will work best if you actually like and use the brands you’re endorsing.

, If you’re a recognizable part of the Snapchat landscape, you might even be invited to take control of a company’s account on behalf of the brand. As part of guerrilla marketing campaign, you’ll be responsible for posting original sponsored content that’s more organic than traditional ads. This is another excellent form of cross-promotion that will effectively serve to bring together both users’ followings.For instance, if your Snapchat is outdoor themed, you might spend a day hiking with gear sent to you courtesy of The North Face and use the company’s story to tell users what you like about it.
You’ll typically have to have a pretty high-profile account before you’ll be approached for story takeovers.

, Reach out to larger accounts and share snaps that provide exposé-like coverage of various activities and events. By adding your snaps to stories like the SXSW music festival or the city of Chicago, you can make sure that they’ll be viewed by users who follow those accounts. The traffic from these stories will be redirected back to your account, netting you lots of new followers in the process.Other organizations may even offer to pay you for the right to use your snaps in their stories. Even if they don’t, however, it’s still great exposure and can go a long way in getting you noticed.Although Snapchat recently eliminated local stories from its features, there are still plenty of places you can send your snaps to for airtime, such as small businesses and local news networks.

Move the conversation off Snapchat.",How to Flirt Using Snapchat," The best way to get your crush’s name on Snapchat is to be direct. Whether in person or over direct message on another app, you can start the conversation casually or just say, “Hey, what’s your Snapchat name? I want to add you.”

If you don’t know the person, check their other profiles (such as Facebook or Instagram) for a link to their Snapchat ID, or just ask a mutual friend what their name is.
If you’re connected to your crush on social media, you may be able to add them with Quick Add. Open Snapchat and swipe left to the Stories screen. Tap the magnifying glass, then swipe left on the contact list. If you see your crush, tap +Add next to their name.;
, If you want your crush to swoon over your stories, they’ll need to be following you on Snapchat. If they don’t follow you back on their own, ask them by sending an intriguing Snap that says, “Follow me back!” If you think there’s a chance the person may not know who you are by your username, make sure the Snap includes your name or a photo., A good way to break the ice is to send a Snap that’s relevant to you both. Whether it’s an inside joke between the two of you, their favorite pet, or a song they love, incorporate it into your Snaps whenever possible.

Does your crush love dogs or cats? Send a cute photo of one. Or, even better, send a selfie with a pet that’s extra cute.
If you know your crush’s favorite song, create a video Snap with the song playing in the background. Use a flirty caption like “This song makes me think of you.”

, Sending a selfie to your crush tells them that you want to look good for them. Use these tips to strengthen your selfie game:Point your chin down while holding the camera a little higher than your face.
Try whispering the word “prune” as you snap your photo. This purses your lips slightly, accentuating your cheekbones. This look is flattering for any gender.
Don’t show too much! Flirting is about showing just enough to pique someone’s interest. Focus on your best facial features or great outfits rather than other body parts.
Avoid cliché selfie locations like bathroom mirrors and gym shots.
The best lighting for a selfie is natural sunlight just before the sun sets. Avoid fluorescent lights if possible. If you’re outside or in a dark room, hold a white napkin close to your face (but out of the photo frame) to neutralize the flash.

, Even if your photo shows off your sexy, smoldering eyes, keep your caption lighthearted and flirty. Being coy keeps conversation flowing and creates an air of mystery. Otherwise, you could come on too strong and make your crush nervous.Use captions to start conversations. Ask casual questions, like “What are you up to right now?” or “What’s up this weekend?” so your crush has something to respond to.
For a great flirty conversation starter, try “Looking for trouble.”

, People are attracted to confidence, so send Snaps that show you being confident in your talents.

If you have serious culinary skills, share artistic photos of meals you’ve made. Sometimes the way to a person’s heart is truly through the stomach. For an extra flirty kick, caption your food photo with, “Want some?”
Sing a flirty song that flatters your voice.
Show off your best (or silliest) dance moves to your crush’s favorite song.

, Sending a unique Snap to your crush will make them feel chosen. If they see the same Snap in your story, it will feel less personal, thus less special., While you may know your Snaps are flirty, your crush might still be wondering if you’re interested. Respond to their Snaps and stories with quick, flirtatious lines like “I like that!” or “You don’t look so bad (winky face)” to be obvious without being overwhelming., In a chat, ask to see something in your crush’s life. This could be anything from their beautiful eyes to their new kitten. Even if your crush just sends you a photo of their morning bus ride, remember that they did it just for you!, Snapchat messages disappear after 24 hours so they should be brief. Once your messages venture into 2 or 3 sentence territory, get your crush’s phone number or ID on a text messaging platform to keep the conversation going."

On the other hand, if you already have an account, simply touch ""Log In"" and provide your details.;
, The first time you open Kik, the program will ask you if you want to find your friends. If you agree to this, Kik will use the names, phone numbers, and email addresses in your phone's contact list in order to find anyone you know using Kik.If you choose not to do this now, don't worry — you can always do this manually later by tapping the gear icon on the home screen, then going to Chat Settings > Address Book Matching.

, If you want to add someone on Kik that the program couldn't find in your contacts list, you can add friends at any time in just a few seconds. Start by touching the speech bubble in the top right corner. Then, in the search field, type your friend’s Kik username or real name. Once you start adding friends in Kik, the speech bubble will also show a list of your friends.


You can also search for Kik interest groups by searching for keywords related to your interest (e.g., ""cars,"" ""computers,"" ""style,"" etc.). You can even make your own group by tapping the ""Start a Group"" button.""

, When you get the chance, confirming your email address with Kik is a good idea, as this lets you retrieve your password if you lose it. To do this, open your email and look for an email from Kik with the subject “Welcome to Kik Messenger! Confirm your details inside...‏” Open the email and click where it says “Click here to complete your sign-up"" to confirm your email.


If you don’t see this email, check any junk or spam mail folders.
If you still don't see the email, you can have Kik resend it — see the ""Troubleshooting"" section below for more information.

, Sending messages with Kik is easy! On the speech bubble menu, touch a friend’s name to open a chat. Touch the ""Type a message"" box, then type your message. Touch ""Send"" when you're done. That's it!


Note that, on some devices, the ""Send"" button will look like a blue speech bubble. If you don’t see the Send button, touch the speech bubble to send your message instead.

, Emoticons are fun themed graphics and smiley faces that you can use to add character and flair to your messages. To add an emoticon, touch the smiley face button while you're typing a message to a friend. A menu with many different choices should pop up. Touch an emoticon to choose it.


If you want more options, you can buy additional emoticons in the Kik store. In the emoticon window, touch the + button to go to the Kik store. See ""Using Extra Features"" below for more information.

, When you're typing a message to a friend, to the left of the ""Type a message"" box, you should see a small + button. Press this. If you’ve given Kik access to your camera roll, you should see your photos and videos. Touch a photo to add it to your message. If you want, you can also type a message with your photo or video. Touch Send or the speech bubble button as normal to send the content.



Note: On some mobile devices, especially iOS, the first time you try to send a photo or video from your camera roll, Kik will ask you if it can access your photos. Give the program your permission to continue.
You can also change this setting in your iOS Settings app by scrolling down to the Kik app settings, and then changing the Privacy settings.

, You aren't limited to sending photos you've already taken — with Kik, you can also record and send them on the fly! To the left of the ""Type a message field,"" touch the + button, then touch the camera button. You should see a view of your device's camera pop up. Touch the white circle to take a picture, then touch the Send button.



Note: Again, on some devices, especially iOS, the first time you try to take a photo or video using Kik, it will ask you if it can access the Camera app.
You can also change this setting in your iOS Settings app by scrolling down to the Kik settings, and then changing the Privacy settings.

, In addition to photos and videos from your phone, with Kik, you can also send YouTube videos, sketches, images and more. Doing this is easy — just touch the + button, then touch the globe icon. A small menu of options should pop up. Select the one you want. Your options are:



Stickers: Small images that you can buy in the Kik store. Some stickers are free, while others require money or Kik points (Kp).

Youtube Videos: Lets you browse and send videos from YouTube.

Sketch: Lets you draw a picture.

Image Search: Lets you search the internet for images according to the keyword you type in (e.g., ""flowers,"" ""landscapes,"" etc.)

Memes: Lets you create your own custom ""meme"" images (e.g., Socially Awkward Penguin, etc.)

Top Sites: Lets you browse and link from a list of hot websites. Note that the Kik points site, where you can earn Kp for buying stickers and so on, is in this list.

, Accidentally tap on the wrong picture? Undoing a mistake is easy. To delete an image or video, before sending it, touch the image or video, and then touch ""Delete."" Careful — you can't delete content after you've already sent it.

, Your profile picture is what other people see when they're chatting with you. By default it is blank, but it's easy to set it to show a picture of yourself or something else. To do this, just use the following steps:


Tap the gear icon at the top of the Kik home screen.
On the next page, tap ""Set Photo.""
Pick ""Take Picture"" to take a picture of yourself or pick ""Choose Existing"" to browse your camera roll for a picture to use.

, Bored of the default green chat bubble for your messages? Use the following steps to change it to the color you wish:


Tap the gear icon at the top of the Kik home screen.
Tap ""Chat Settings.""
Tap ""Chat Bubble Color.""
Tap the color you would like from the list of options.

, Once you start using emoticons, it can be surprising how quickly you get used to throwing them into your messages. If you get tired of your basic selection of emoticons, try using the following steps to get more:


Start a message to one of your friends.
Tap the emoticon button.
Tap the + button in the right corner of the menu that pops up.
Select the emoticons you want from the shop.

, Before you add anyone else to your list of contacts, you will have one already pre-set: a contact named ""Kik Team."" This is a support bot — a simple program that will try to answer any questions you ask it. It also has a number of witty one-liners and anecdotes in its repertoire, so try sending it any message you like and seeing what it has to say! You can also send it pictures and videos to have it comment on them.


If you ask the Kik Team bot for help (for instance, with a message like ""I need help""), it will give you a link to the Kik support page at help.kik.com., Resending a confirmation email if you can't find the original or it's expired only takes a few minutes. You do this with the Kik app on your mobile phone, not your computer. Use the following steps:Tap the gear icon at the top of the Kik home screen.
Tap ""Your Account.""
Tap ""Email"" and ensure your address is correct.
Tap ""Email is Unconfirmed.""
When the message pops up asking if you want Kik to send a new email, tap ""Yes"" to confirm.

Note: On Windows Phone, this process is a little different. After going to the ""Your Account"" page, you need to tap ""Account Status,"" then tap the appropriate checkmark to resend the email.

, By default, Kik will notify you when you get a new message. However, if you don't like these messages, you can change the way that Kik notifies you with the following steps:


Tap the gear icon at the top of the Kik home screen.
Tap ""Notifications.""
Check and uncheck the boxes on the following page to change the way that Kik notifies you. You can disable the sound that is played, the vibrating effect, and more.

, Getting messages from someone you'd rather ignore, like an ex-friend or a junk mail bot? Disable unwanted messages by using Kik's built-in block list with the following steps:


Tap the gear icon at the top of the Kik home screen.
Tap ""Chat Settings.""
Tap ""Block List.""
Type in the username of the person you want to block or press the + button in the top right and browse your contact list manually. Click ""Block"" to confirm.
Unblock someone by visiting the block list, tapping the name you want to unblock, and tapping ""Unblock.""

, Kik is constantly being updated and having new features added to it by the Kik team. Sometimes, unfortunately, this rapid update cycle can make the app act strangely. The solution to this problem is usually fairly simple — just uninstall the app, then re-download it and install it once again. You will automatically be updated to the latest version of the app when you re-install it.



Note: Uninstalling the app will delete your history of messages, so save any important information before you uninstall.

Turn off your phone.,
Ask for support.",How to Get Work Done While on Snapchat," If you spend an hour of your scheduled workday on Snapchat, that’s an hour of missed work! Knowing the true amount of time you spend on the app may make you reconsider opening it at work.

Apps like Rescue Time (Android) and Moment (iOS) will track how much time you spend using Snapchat over the course of a day. Try tracking your Snapchat usage for a full week to get an accurate portrait of your usage.
Snapchat users spend an average of 25 minutes per day on the app. Over the course of a lifetime, that’s a little over a year.;
, You don’t have to completely give up Snapchat to be productive. Instead, decide how much time you want to spend on Snapchat a day, then block the app at other times.

Apps like Flipd and Breakfree make it so you cannot open Snapchat when you need to work. You can use these apps to set a recurring block schedule, specify an amount of Snapchat time per day, or to enable as-needed blocking.
Don’t feel discouraged if you keep trying to open Snapchat while it’s blocked. You’re retraining your brain to work for longer periods of time without giving in to compulsions. You’ll notice a major improvement after a day or two.

, Giving yourself a treat after completing difficult (or boring!) tasks can help you build better work habits.Here are some ideas for using Snapchat as your post-work prize:

Allow yourself 5 minutes of Snapchat time (use a timer!) after completing 30 minutes of uninterrupted work.
For every task you complete within a certain timeframe, you can view that many Snapchat Stories.

, If your work is something that can be photographed or recorded, create stories that show your process. This a great way to flaunt your productivity prowess to friends and colleagues.

If you’re writing (or grading) papers, you could create a story that shows your “finished” pile growing.
Physical tasks like cleaning, construction, or cooking can be especially fun to Snap. Give your followers a peek at your workspace, as well as the tools and techniques used to perfect your craft.

, If your job or school duties don’t require a phone, power it down and place it out of sight. As tempting as it may be to leave your turned-off phone on your desk “just in case,” don’t risk getting sucked into Stories. As the saying goes, “Out of sight, out of mind!”

If you’re having trouble resisting temptation, ask a coworker or classmate to keep your phone away from you until a certain time.

, You’re not the only one who has trouble balancing social media and work time. Ask your friend and family how they stay focused, and try implementing some of their advice.

Find an accountability buddy—specifically someone else who’s having a hard time focusing on work with Snapchat around. Make a plan to check in at the end of each day with how much time you each spent on Snapchat. Keep it positive, set goals, share moral support, and celebrate your successes!Try creating a heartfelt Snap or Story that explains what you have to get done, as well as your deadline, then ask for support.

You can earn trophies by performing certain tasks in Snapchat, with more advanced trophies available for more time-consuming tasks. When you first see your trophy case, you'll notice that most are locked and hidden.


Your Snapchat trophies are only for your own personal amusement, and do not have any bearing on the app itself. Trophies do not give you access to more features or privileges, and no one else can see them but you.;

, One of the main trophy categories is based on your Snapchat score. The actual way the score is tabulated is unknown, but generally you'll get 1 point for each Snap you send and 1 for each you open. Sending a Snap to multiple people only counts as 1 Snap. The following trophies will unlock as you reach certain scores:👶 - 100
🌟 - 500
✨ - 1,000
💫 - 10,000
💥 - 50,000
🚀 - 100,000

Since then, Snapchat has continued to push out new Lenses regularly -- face swapping, various animal faces, character transformations, facial contortions, “Birthday Party,” and more.


Lenses are special effects that are applied in real-time using face detection, so you can watch how your actions affect the Lens on screen live. As Lenses are often interactive, you may have to match a certain motion in order to produce a certain effect (e.g. open your mouth for the rainbows to continually waterfall out). There are 10 free, featured Lenses per day, and they change. If you did purchase any Lenses when that was an option, those are permanently available to you.
Lenses are used before you take or record your Snap, while filters are added after you take the Snap. You can use both Lenses and filters on the same Snap.;
, Lenses do not work with the majority of Android smartphones, and only with recent iPhones (though there have even been reported inconsistencies with recent iPhones). If you don't have a new device, there's a good chance that you won't be able to get Lenses to work, and even if you do there is a chance it just may not work.The iPhone 4 and first-generation iPad are not supported. However, various supported devices have had some users report that the feature does not work for them.
Lenses requires Android 4.3 or later for Android devices. Even with the latest updates, some users report that the feature still will not work.

, You'll need to make sure that you're running the latest version of Snapchat to access Lenses. You can update Snapchat from the App Store or Google Play Store.


See How to Upgrade Snapchat for details on updating your Snapchat app.

, Lenses works by recognizing a face and then morphing it with effects. You can use it with either your forward-facing or rear-facing camera, but you may find it easiest to test with the front-facing camera. Opening the app will take you directly to your main camera. There are two ways to access the forward-facing camera:


Tap on the top right icon (a circle enclosed by two arrows), this will give you access to your forward-facing camera.
Simply double-tap the screen to switch between cameras.

, Lenses works best when you can see your entire face in the frame.


Also, make sure the lighting is decent, otherwise this may hinder the facial recognition.

, After a moment, your face will be scanned and the Lens options will appear at the bottom of your screen.


Make sure that your entire face is in the screen, and that you're holding the camera still. You may have to press and hold for several seconds or try a few times until the feature turns on. If you only see portions of the geometric shape covering your face, this may be due to your lighting.

, Swipe left and right to select from the Lenses available. Snapchat rotates the Lens selection on a daily basis, so there are always new choices.


Some of the popular Lenses that you'll likely encounter include puking rainbows, screaming, zombie, ""in love,"" and crying.
“Birthday Party” Lens is activated on your birthday (if you’ve activated Birthday Party in Settings). You can also access this Lens when it’s a friend’s birthday -- simply look for the cake icon next to their username to indicate their birthday, and tap the cake icon to get access to the Lens right away.Because of the rotating selection, the Lens you are looking for may not be available. Check back in the next day or two to see if it has become available again.

, Many Lenses will display a quick command to make the effect happen. For example, to do the puking rainbow you're prompted to open your mouth.

, Once you're ready, you can tap the Capture button on the bottom (in this case it will have the image of the feature you select) to take a Snap (photo), or press and hold it to record a video (up to 10 seconds). Your Lens effect will be recorded in the Snap.


For photos, on the bottom left you will see an icon of a ‘3’ with a circle around it. Tap that to select the number of seconds (up to 10) you would want your photo to last for when being viewed.
Android devices must be running 5.0 or later to record video Snaps with Lens effects. The iPhone 4, 4S, and iPad 2 are not supported. Even with compatible devices, there have been reports of the feature not working for some users.
Consider adding additional effects (text, drawing, emoji and stickers). All the other effects can still be applied onto a Snap that’s used the Lenses feature (as explained in the other sections).

, Once you've captured your Snap, you can send it to the Snapchat contacts you select, post it to your Story (visible for 24 hours), or just save the photo/video without posting just like you would any other Snap.


The second icon from the left on the bottom with an arrow and line will save the photo/video without posting it.
The third icon from the left on the bottom with a box and a plus will only post it to your Story, which is available for 24 hours to anyone you've enabled to see it.
Tap the blue Send To button in the bottom-right corner to select the people you want to send your snap to. You can also select your Story.
After you selected your recipients, tap the blue arrow in the bottom-right corner to send your Snap.

Rewind - characterized by three left-facing arrows, this feature plays your video backwards. This includes the sound of the video.

Faster Fast Forward - marked by the rabbit with lines above and under, this feature speeds up your video times two. The sound is also super sped up.
Slow Motion - appropriately represented by a snail, this makes your video and sound slow-mo.

, This set of filters pulls data from when the snap was taken to give some added perspective.


Battery Life - this filter relates to your mobile device’s actual battery life. It will be smiley, green, and full only when your battery is completely full, or red and nearly empty when your device's battery is extremely low.

To activate Lenses, press and hold on a face in the Snapchat camera frame. After a moment, the Lenses will appear at the bottom of the screen.

, This Lens can be found towards the end of the list, and has two smiley faces on it.

, When you select the yellow face swap Lens, you'll see an overlay of two smiley faces appear on the screen. Line up both of your faces and Snapchat will swap them.


Your face will appear on your friend's body and vice versa!

, This Lens can be found towards the end of the list, and has a smiley face and a camera for the button. When you select it, Snapchat will scan the photos on your device and find pictures with faces that can be swapped.

, Snapchat will scan your photos and find pictures that have faces. You won't be selecting the image itself, just the face that is detected by Snapchat.


This feature overlays a face from one of your photos onto your body in real time - it's sort of like creating your own custom lens in real-time!

, Tap the photo or video. Type a message, and then tap Done, enter, or tap the screen. The text is automatically added to the center of the screen.

, Touch the ""T"" in the top right corner of the screen to enable text effects. This will enlarge the text, center left, and remove the caption bar.

, Touch and drag the text to move it. Pinch the text to shrink it. Zoom the text to increase its size. Rotate your two fingers together on the text to turn the text to the angle you want.

, Tap the actual text. The color picker and keyboard will open. Touch the color picker to change the text color. When you're done, touch Done, enter, or tap the screen.


If you want to change a single letter or word, select that letter or word, and then touch the color picker to change the color that that letter or word.

, Tap the Stickers button at the top of the screen (it looks like a folded sticky note, to the left of the “T”). Swipe left and right on the list to see the different categories. Scroll down to see the selection. Tapping an emoji will add it to the picture, and then you can drag it to exactly where you want it with your finger. You can add as many stickers as you'd like.


Pinch to shrink, zoom to enlarge them. You can also rotate the sticker by placing your two fingers at the ends and rotating them at the same time.

, When you press and hold a sticker on a video Snap, the video will pause, allowing you to drag the sticker onto an object in the frame. Releasing the sticker on this object will ""pin"" it, and the sticker will track the object as it moves on the screen.

, Select a sticker. Zoom in on the sticker so that it completely loses shape, and put the focus on the edge of the emoji or sticker. The translucent edge can act as a custom color filter for your photo or video., Tap the scissors icon at the top of the screen, then use your finger to outline any part of the video, such a person's face. Now you've created a sticker that you can move to any place on the screen with your finger.


Stickers you make will appear at the top of the Stickers menu when you tap the Sticky-Note icon.
You can remove the sticker from your image by holding and dragging it up toward the Sticky-Note icon, which will morph into a Trashcan as you approach.

, Touch the crayon icon on the far right of the top right corner of the screen. Choose a color in the color picker. Touch the screen to draw. When you're done, touch the crayon button again.


If you don't like what you drew, touch the undo button (a left-pointing, curved arrow) to the left of the crayon icon.

, While black and white are built into Android, iOS has a rainbow slider that does not show these colors. To access white, drag your finger from the rainbow slider to the top left corner. To get black, drag your finger from the rainbow slider to the bottom center. To make gray appear, drag your finger from the rainbow slider to the bottom left corner. To find hidden colors (like baby pink and burgundy), drag your finger from the rainbow slider around the screen.


On Android only, there is also a “transparent” color. Simply press down until the full color palette appears; select the “transparent” color there.

, Follow these steps if you're using an older version of Snapchat and don't want to update to the newer versions.

, Touch the photo to open the text box, and then type Sepia….


It's important that you type the three ellipses.

, Touch the photo to open the text box, and then type b&w….

Finally, tap the airplane icon.;
, Opening Snapchat will automatically bring you to the camera.

You can add stickers, text, drawings, or filters to your snap if you wish.

, This will add your snap to the story—although since you’re in airplane mode, the picture or video won’t upload just yet. It will, however, be queued and ready for when you get back online. Here’s how to add the snap:Tap the “Add” icon, which looks like a square with a plus sign on its upper right corner.
If you see a message that begins with “Adding a Snap to your Story allows your friends to view your snap…” tap “Okay.”
Snapchat will redirect you to the Stories page, where you’ll see a warning message that says “No internet connection.”

, Tap the circle at the bottom of the Stories page to return to the camera and then take your next picture (or record your next video).

, As you did with the last snap, tap the Add (+) icon to add your new snap to the story. It will then be queued for upload right after the previous snap.

, Take your time perfecting each snap—your followers will get to view your story all at once instead of having to wait for you to snap the next part. Once you get back online, it’ll be easy to post them all (quickly) in order.

, Now that you’ve snapped multiple photos and/or videos, it’s time to get back online. When you tap the airplane icon (the same one you tapped earlier) again, airline mode will switch off, and your device should connect to the internet.


If your device doesn’t connect automatically, connect to your Wi-Fi or mobile network as you normally do.

, This will bring you to the Stories screen., Now you’ll see a list of each snap you’ve added, all with the text “Tap to retry” beneath., The snap at the bottom is the first one you took, work from the bottom up. Tapping this snap will upload it to the story immediately—you’ll know when it’s finished because the snap will no longer appear in the queue.

, Now that you’ve uploaded multiple pictures or videos to your story, it’s time to check it out! Tap “My Story” on the Stories screen to play your story.

Pause when necessary.",How to Play Temple Run," This app resembles a gold statue's face. Opening Temple Run will direct you to its home page.


If you haven't yet downloaded Temple Run for iPhone or Android, first do so.;
, It's in the lower-left corner of the screen.

, You can change the following options:



Music - Slide left or right to lower or raise the music volume.

Sound - Slide left or right to lower or raise overall sound.

Tutorial - Slide left to disable the tutorial.

Friend Markers - If your friends play Temple Run, leaving this enabled will show their progress.

, It's at the bottom of the screen.

, Your new game will begin.

, This will cause your character to move to the left or right side of the path.

, You'll want to do this as soon as your character reaches a turning point in the path.


Swiping left or right while running on a straight part of the path will cause your character to stumble, which will forfeit your current bonus.
Stumbling twice in a row will cause the enemies behind you to catch you, thereby ending the game.

, Doing so will help your character maneuver over low obstacles and broken sections of path.


You can also retrieve power-ups by jumping through them.

, Sliding helps your character avoid high obstacles.

, If you have any utilities (such as resurrection wings) equipped, doing this will use them.

, In Temple Run, your character starts off running at a reasonable pace through a fairly linear maze. As your time in a specific run progresses, the character's speed and the maze's complexity both increase.


If your character stops running at any time (e.g., because of stumbling twice), the game ends.

, Coins both increase your score and count toward in-game purchases, such as power-ups and character skins. Yellow coins are worth one coin each, red coins are worth two, and blue coins are worth three.


Don't prioritize coin collection over safe running if you're going for a high score.
The magnet power-up will collect coins for you.

, The vertical bar in the top-left corner of the screen grants you a bonus each time it fills up, meaning your overall score (and resulting reward) grow each time the meter refills. To fill this meter, collect coins.


Running into a tree branch or stumbling will reset the meter's progress.

, Sliding helps your character maneuver beneath some obstacles, but it also changes your camera angle, which can cause you to fall into another trap. Obstacles you can vault over instead of sliding under include the following:


Fire
Tree branches
Short gaps

, You can unlock each of the game's power-ups from the STORE section of the home page for 250 gold apiece, though upgrading them after this point will cost significantly more. These power-ups include the following:



50 Coin - Immediately grants your character 50 coins.

Coin Magnet - Gathers coins for you so that you don't have to run through them to collect them.

Invisibility - Allows you to run through obstacles and over gaps for a brief time.

250m Boost - Makes you invincible and boosts you forward for 250 meters of running.

Double Value coins - While not technically a power-up, upgrading this attribute shortens the distance you need to run before coming across red and blue coins.
You can also purchase ""Utilities"", which are items to help you in-game. Tap the screen twice to use them.

, To pause the game, simply tap the ""Pause"" icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.


Closing the game while it is paused won't reset your progress.

, Temple Run 2 has a simple user interface, familiarize yourself with the buttons and other stuff on the screen before you make your first run. Believe me, once you start running – you won’t be able to look anywhere else except for the track ahead of you.

, Your run begins right at the very start of the game. Evil monkeys are after you so you better keep running! The objective of the game is to run away from the evil monkeys while avoiding obstacles along the way. There will be a short tutorial at the early start of your run so don’t worry.


The tutorial will teach you how to jump across gaps. This can be done by swiping your finger upwards across the screen.
To turn to either left or right, you just have to swipe the screen on the direction you want to turn.
You can also slide by swiping your screen downwards. This move is useful in going through low pathways.
You can also tilt your device so your runner can move either to the left, right, or center part of the way.

, If you see coins, tilt your phone to the directions where the coins are at. These coins are very important in improving your power-ups, performance, and other factors that will give you an advantage in running more efficiently in Temple Run 2. They can also be used to access some unlockables!

, While running, you will eventually find power-ups along the way. Grab these power-ups if you have the chance for they will give you certain skills that will help you run further into the game. These power-ups are temporary so better take advantage of their effect while they last.

, There are other objectives available in Temple Run 2 other than just collecting mileage in running. Satisfying objectives such as collecting gems, coins, and certain mileage will give you extra bonuses, too!

, Since this game is primarily a game of collecting distance – it is safe to say that it does not have an ending. You will just keep on running and soon enough find yourself falling or bumping into a tree trunk. In short - it is game over. The game over screen gives you a couple of options.


You can post your stats online via Twitter or Facebook.
Access your Upgrades page and use your resources to improve your runner’s skills.
You can adjust certain settings via Menu.
You can also simply choose to pick yourself up and try again.

, Temple Run 2 has added a mining area that you can run through, or better yet, ride through. Instead of running, you will be riding a mining cart that explores a mine tunnel! This part alters a few commands on how you control your runner.


Swiping down now makes your runner duck instead of sliding.
Tilting your device changes the lane of the mining cart.
There will be no command for jumping while inside the mines.

, There will be instances that the railing your cart is on has its half broken! In this case, you need to tilt your cart to the direction where the working railing is at.

, Like in the first Temple Run, Temple Run 2 still has power-ups that will help you run further through the game. All of them can also be upgraded to enhance their effect or the length of their effect.


The Shield. The shield is a default power-up which protects you from hazards such as the flames, spinning spike wheels, stone blocks and wooden beam.
The Coin Magnet. The magnet is unlocked in level 5. It attracts coins for you so don’t have to approach the coins yourself.
The Boost. The boost is a power-up which lets the runner dash really fast! You can go through any hazard including gaps. Downside is, since you are running really fast, you might not be able to collect coins.

, You can also buy characters in the game. You should be able to unlock them by reaching a certain level and stat. They all have unique abilities.


Guy Dangerous. For Free. Special Power: Shield.
Scarlett Fox. For 5000 coins. Special Power: Boost.
Barry Bones. For 15,000 coins. Special Power: Coin Bonus, an instant 50 coin bonus.

, Upgrades are available also to primarily to improve your point acquisition. .

Coin Magnet - You'll attract any nearby coins without having to touch them.
2x Multiplier - Doubles your current score multiplier (e.g. x3 now becomes x6).

, You'll see ramps on the ends of some train cars. Use these to reach the top of the trains, where you can collect more coins and avoid obstacles.

, When you swipe to move, your character will still take a moment to get over. Make sure you're leaving enough time to get out of the way of approaching obstacles.

, You can swipe to change lanes at any time, even if you're in midair. Try to plan ahead so that you end up exactly where you want.


If you're on the left or right lane, you can swipe twice in midair to move across both lanes in one jump.

, Rolling during a jump will cancel the jump animation and keep you on the ground. This can be very helpful for getting coins on the top of trains and to keep you from jumping too far with Super Sneakers.

, A hoverboard will prevent you from any crash, so it's best top save them until right before you need one. If you're about to hit a train or a wall, double-tap the screen to use one of your hoverboards.


Hoverboards cost 300 coins each, but you'll often get them as rewards as well.
Save your hoverboards for your really good runs to maximize your score. Don't waste them to avoid a crash at the start of a run when you can just start over for free instead.

, The key to getting a lot of coins is to upgrade a few important powerups. You can do this from the Shop menu.

,, Improving these two powerups will lead to many more coins in the long run.

, Each time you complete a daily challenge, you'll receive a reward. Oftentimes this is a significant number of coins.


To view the Daily Challenge, tap the Daily Challenge button at the top of the main menu.
You only have until the timer runs out to complete the Daily Challenge and earn the reward.

, Each day in a row that you complete the Daily Challenge, you'll get a more impressive reward. By completing five days in a row, you'll earn a Super Mystery box, which can contain a whole lot of coins. You'll get a new Super Mystery Box for each Daily Challenge you continue to complete in a row.

, While completing a mission will not directly result in coins, reaching Multiplier 30 will result in Super Mystery Boxes as mission rewards. These can contain a lot of coins, so try to complete as many missions as possible.


To view your current missions, tap the Missions button on the main menu.

, This costs $4.99, but is a one-time purchase that will permanently double all of the coins you earn. You can find this at the top of the Shop menu.

Work to get Bonuses.,
Remember, its not how much fruit you get, its how much you make out of the fruit.",How to Play Fruit Ninja in Arcade Mode," Slice fruit together to get combos. When you get a combo (slicing more than 2 fruits at the same time) you get extra points. Example: You slice 4 fruit at the same time, You get 4 extra points! If you slice 6 at the same time, you get 6 extra points.;
, If you slice enough combos, you'll get one of those, gaining extra points. but with more points. Different Blitz: Combo Blitz: 5 points plus combos. Received after 3 combos in a row. Great Blitz: 10 points plus combos. Received after 6 combos in a row. Awesome Blitz: 15 points plus combos. Received after 9 combos in a row. Super Blitz: 20 points plus combos. Receive after 12 combos in a row. Hyper Blitz: Get 25 extra points plus combos. Receive after 15 combos in a row. Unbelievable Blitz: 30 extra points plus combos. Receive after 18 combos in a row. If you get more combos after the Unbelievable Blitz, you will keep receiving it every 3 nonstop combos until you stop hitting nonstop combos.

, Frenzies will bring you nonstop fruit without bombs for a short period of time, freeze will freeze your time and make your fruit go slow motion (great for hitting combos!) for a short period of time, and double points will double your points (including extras from combos and blitz.)

, Bombs in Arcade Mode are different than Classic. Instead of ending your game, they take away 10 points, and stop any blitz you were in. Hitting 3 bombs will make you receive the ""Bomb Lover"" award in the bonuses in the end of the game (worth 50 points!)

, At the end of the game, they give you 3 bonuses. You can get many different ones, and even if you meet the criteria for more than 3, they will only give you 3. If you get less than 3, they will give you an award like ""Juicy Slicing"" or ""Fruit Salad"". Avoid these, as they only bring you 5 points each. Try to get ones like ""Impossible 9 Fruit Combo"" or ""Combo God!"" They bring you 50 points each. Look up more bonuses and aim for them!

, Happy slicing!

Avoid the bombs.,
Know the modes.,
Unlock extra stuff.",How to Play Fruit Ninja," Android or IOS user? Not a problem. You can get the installer on Google Play if you are an android user or have it on Apple Store.


If you are an Xbox 360 enthusiast, you can buy Fruit Ninja Kinect from the Xbox marketplace for just $9.99. Unlike the version for android phones and tablets or apple’s iPod, iPhone or iTouch, this one utilizes its Kinect peripheral by using the player’s hands and arms to slice the fruits that are being thrown in the air.
A Facebook version Fruit Ninja Frenzy was also released. It functions the same way as how you play it using a tab or a smart phone but this time slicing fruits using the mouse. This version introduces currency in the form of juice and starfruit.
Another version of Fruit Ninja is the Fruit Ninja: Puss N’ Boots. This has identical gameplay as the original only it has the Puss N’ Boots theme.;
, Once the app is installed, it’s time to unleash the ninja in you. This isn’t just about swiping your fingers from left to right or waving your arms up in the air, it requires accuracy, speed and right timing. There are combo hits that can add up points as you continue.


Try not to miss a fruit! Three fruits missed, the game ends. It is crucial to slice all the fruits to proceed to the next level.

, Bombs are occasionally thrown out of the screen, once sliced and mistaken to be a fruit the game ends.


Use your ears! Listening carefully is one of your weapons. Sound is an ally. Once the hissing noise is heard, it means there is a bomb coming.
In the arcade mode, slicing a bomb is not a big deal. It will not end your game. Just avoid it as much as you can because doing so will give you additional ten point bonus at the end of the game if all bombs were avoided.

, Aside from the usual hack and slash mode, there are different types of modes that you can also choose from in Fruit Ninja.


We have what we call Zen mode in which players are allowed to achieve high scored without bombs appearing on the screen but it is time pressured. Players are given a minute and thirty seconds to slice as many fruit as they can.
In Arcade mode, players are given sixty seconds to achieve a high score. Bananas which are equivalent to different unique bonuses are added up to this mode such as doubling the points that the player already scored for a limited time, increasing the amount of fruit thrown on the screen and slowing the phase of the fruit being thrown on the screen.
In Classic mode, pomegranates are occasionally thrown on the screen which allows the player to slice it up multiple times to earn extra points.
There are other modes available in Fruit Ninja that are dependent on the game version they are in such as Multiplayer mode.

, Fruit Ninja is a great game for children and adults. It has low learning curve and one of those games that you can truly say you enjoy while you’re actually doing challenging tasks. Once you master the game, you can now unlock some extra blades and background wallpapers.


Unlockable items  usually become available after completing certain achievements. They may also differ between versions.

Check out a cheat site.",How to Play 4 Pics 1 Word," You can download 4 Pics 1 Word through the Apple App store or the Android Market on Google Play. Alternatively, you can play a desktop version as long as you have a Facebook account.


No matter how you play the game, you will need to have a Facebook account to play. Once you install the app, you will be asked to log into your Facebook account before you play. While 4 Pics 1 Word is technically a single-player game, you can interact with your Facebook friends through the game.
Download the game for your iPhone or iPad here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/4-pics-1-word/id595558452?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2

Download the game for your Android here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.lotum.whatsinthefoto.us

Get started with the game by going to this website: http://www.4pics1word.com
;
, Once you start the game, you will be shown a screen with four photographs. These four photographs each have something in common. Sometimes it will be obvious, while other times, it can actually be fairly hard to guess. This is especially true of later levels.


The puzzles are somewhat randomized, but you can expect to find most of the easier ones early on and more of the harder ones in progressive levels.
One example puzzle has two photographs of women with their arms in the air and two others of the sea. The common thread in this puzzle is ""wave,"" which is the answer you will need to type in to pass the level.

, Below the pictures, you will see blank spaces indicating how many letters are in the answer. Below that, there will be a scrambled keyboard of possible letters you can select from when typing in your guess for the answer. Tap on these letters to spell out the word you believe to be the answer.The answer to the puzzle is the common theme between the four photographs.
Note that you will be provided with more letters than necessary. This is not simply a scrambler-type game.
When you answer the question correctly, you will be rewarded with three coins and can progress to the next level.

, After you pass through the first five levels, you will be asked to rate 4 Pics 1 Word. A pop-up will appear stating that if you like the app, you can give them a 5-star rating and earn an extra 150 coins.


If you want to get the coins, you will need to click on the ""Rate now!"" button and give the app five stars.
You can also choose ""Remind me later"" if you want to wait until you have played the game a little longer or ""No, thank you"" if you do not want to give the rating. Not providing a five-star rating will mean that you will not get the 150 coins, of course.
The coins come in handy for later levels, and you will need them for the cheat/help buttons when you get stumped on some of the harder puzzles.

, The ""cheat"" or ""help"" button looks like a small bomb and is located in the bottom right corner of the screen. Pressing it will give you two options that can help you complete the puzzle.


The first option you have is to remove some of the available letters, thereby making it easier to guess the puzzle. Doing so will cost you 90 coins, though.
The second option you have is to reveal one of the letters in the answer, which can also help clue you in about the correct word. This will cost you 60 coins.

, Once you successfully solve the puzzle for each level, you will win the game. The app will offer you a congratulatory message and be done.


At this point in time, there will be no further puzzles for you to access. Wait until the app gets an upgrade to see if more puzzles have been added at that time.

, If you are stumped on a puzzle, you can take advantage of the fact that the game uses your Facebook log-in by tapping on the Facebook icon in the lower right corner of the screen.


This will automatically generate a post featuring a screenshot of the post you are currently stuck on. Click on the ""Share"" button to post it to your timeline.
You can also include your own comments about the puzzle, explaining why you need help, which guesses have not worked, and so on. Provide your friends with as much information as possible to help them help you.
You will need to be logged into the Facebook app on your phone or tablet for this to work. If you are playing the game on your desktop, you should already be logged into Facebook since you are using it to play the game.
This is the extent of social interaction you can find in the game. You cannot compete with others or play the game directly with others.

,


Coins cost $0.99 for 350, $1.99 for 750, $4.99 for 2000, $9.99 for 4500, and $19.99 for 10000.
Note that this is the only feature that costs money to use. All other features are free, and the game is also a free download. Moreover, the app remains ad-free.
It is a wise idea to do this selectively. Since there are other options you can use to help complete 4 Pics 1 Word levels, spending money on coins is usually unnecessary.
On the other hand, if you find yourself stuck and with nowhere else to turn, you can use this option, but it is recommended that you buy the lowest amount. If you need to buy more after this, then you can consider one of the higher amounts, since those come at a better bargain.

, As the game has grown in popularity, so has the number of resources for those looking for a little extra help. In particular, there are a wide variety of websites that will provide you with hints and answers to the puzzles you get stumped on.


4 Pics 1 Word Answers allows you to look at hints for the puzzle before reading the answer, if you desire to do so. The hints are text descriptions of the actions and subjects of the photos.
Several websites ask you to enter all the letters in the puzzle and to select the amount of letters in the answer. The website will then generate all possible answers using those letters without ever looking at the photos in the puzzle. Websites like this include 4 Pics 1 Word Cheats (http://4pics1wordcheats.com/).
Other websites provide answer to each puzzle according to the number of words in the answer. These websites include 4 Pics 1 Word Cheats (http://www.4pics1wordcheats.net/).
Similarly, VGChartz (http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251147/4-pics-1-word-answers-cheats-and-hints/) will provide you with puzzle answers split into level categories.

, Type in “2048” on the search field then tap the Search button.

, Locate the correct app and download it by tapping the “Install” button.


The app is free.

, If you don’t have an iOS or Android mobile device, you can play the game directly from the developer’s page at http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/.

, The game will give you an initial 4x4 board, totaling 16 tiles. Two tiles of 2 will be placed at random positions on the board.

, Swipe up, down, left, and right to move the tiles across the board. The tiles will slide towards the other end, as long as there’s available space.

, When tiles of the same number touch during a move, they will combine into one tile carrying the sum of the two tiles.


For example, two tiles of 2 will combine into a tile of 4. This will essentially free up a space on the board.

, On every move, whether you were able to merge 2 tiles or not, a new tile of 2 or 4 will randomly appear on the board. This is how you get new tiles and numbers in play.

, Continue moving the tiles across the board to increase the numbers on the tiles. The objective is to reach get a 2048 tile on the board. This get be achieved by combining two 1024 tiles, coming from two 512 tiles, merged from two 256 tiles, and so on.

, The game ends when the board is completely filled with numbered tiles and there’s no move available.

, There’s no time limit to the game. Play each move slowly and consider all options before sliding tiles.

, Focus your tiles on the bottom corners. Having new tiles appear on top will make it easier for you to move and merge them.

, If you like patterns, try to build one with the numbered tiles. Have the larger numbered tiles on the bottom to the right or left, followed by decreasing numbered tiles on the next rows. This way, you can easily merge the tiles when you reach the matching numbers.

, Once you’ve gotten the largest numbered tile on one corner, don’t move it. Moving the other larger tiles to merge with this one will be much easier.

, You can easily get a high score or even reach the 2048 tile by not moving or swiping up. Just move or swipe left, right, and bottom, and you’ll be fine.

Wait another 3 hours.,
Re-assigning your dwellers.",How to Make Babies in Fallout Shelter," If you haven’t done this yet then make sure that your Shelter has a living quarter/s.;
, Now that you have a residential quarter, it’s time to assign a pair of dwellers who’ll occupy it for the meantime. To increase the chances of getting a baby, make sure that either the male or female dweller has a high rating for Charisma (at least 7 or up).


Be careful with male dwellers who have high stats in Charisma. They can easily impregnate their partners, and before you know it, your shelter will be overrun by babies.
Initially, you will want only one male dweller to father the babies in your vault to make it easier to identify them later on.

, Once you’ve assigned dwellers to the living quarters, you’ll just have to wait for them to get to know each other. Once this happens, they’ll move out of sight for a while and when they get back, the female dweller will almost always be pregnant., After a dweller becomes pregnant, you’ll need to wait for 3 hours before she’ll deliver the baby.


Although pregnant dwellers can still work, you’ll need to assign 1-2 male dwellers to work with them. Since the game won’t allow you to equip them with weapons/arms to defend themselves, they’ll be at a disadvantage when your vault gets attacked.
If possible, place your pregnant dwellers in quarters/stations found the end of your vault where raiders would have a hard time getting to them., Once the dweller has delivered her baby, you can then proceed to naming him/her. A baby will take after the father’s last name so as to make it easier for you to differentiate him/her from other dwellers.Naming a baby is optional and will not have any effect on his/her future stats as an adult dweller.

, You’re then going to have to wait for 3 more hours for the baby to grow up so that you can then assign him/her to a station/quarter. At this point, it would be good to monitor your shelter’s production of resources since babies are going to require these as well.


Due to the cost of rearing them, having too many babies in your shelter at once can drain your resources. Plan your baby making at all times.

, Once babies have grown up, you can then treat them as you would any other dweller and assign them to stations/quarters that would best fit their traits.


A baby inherits his/her trait from her parents. If the parents have high stats in Charisma, then the baby will almost always have similar stats as well.

Go out and explore.,
Talk to as many people you can.,
Add contacts.,
Constantly give gifts.,
Plan your dates.,
Collect K-Stars and Gold Hearts.,
Go to any bar or restaurant.,
Select a contact to date.,
Complete all dating tasks.",How to Go on a Date in Kim Kardashian Hollywood," In order to have people to date, you will have to expand your network by going out and exploring different places. After all, fans and influence are what make a star. It is important to have a lot of people in your network who may help you become a famous A-list star. Proceed to bars, restaurants, stores, etc. and approach different people.;
, Part of building your network involves building relationships with a lot of people. In order to do this, you will have to communicate with different types of people. Once you have selected people to talk to, you may choose to either “Network” or “Flirt” with them. In order to go on dates with them, you will have to “Flirt” with them. Networking is also ideal—especially with experts like photographers, bloggers, etc.—as they may help you in your journey later on as a celebrity. But whether you are to “Network” or “Flirt,” it is recommended that you make contact with people of the same rank as you or even higher.

, Once you have decided who to include in your contact list—may it be a potential date or a helpful network—you may just simply choose to add them as a contact. If you try to add someone who has a higher rank than you, you may have to “charm” them with a few K-Stars. If the levels are not too far, you may pursue adding the contact by successfully guessing their name. For potential dates, you may want to add as many as possible.

, Maintaining a relationship is costly and in the game part of this “cost” involves giving your potential dates different types of gifts. Aside from maintaining the relationship, giving gifts to people is another way to increase your fame. To give them gifts, you may simply select the contact through your contact list and then choose to “Gift” them. After this, you may select what item to give them—you may choose to give them any type of clothing or accessory.

, Just like in real life, dates can be costly and tiring. Every date will cost you quite a lot money and energy, so it is best to always plan your dates properly. Schedule your dates when you do not have a pending task or appointment since both events require energy. Also, you are only given 24 hours in the game to complete a date once you have asked someone out so be sure that you have enough energy and money before asking.

, While you are preparing for a date, it is best to collect enough K-Stars and Gold Hearts while you do other tasks in the game. These K-Stars and Gold Hearts can help make a date successful. K-Stars can be used to purchase energy if you run out during a date, while the accumulation of Gold Hearts provides more chances for a date to be successful. K-Stars can be collected when making five-star appearances, while Gold Hearts can be collected when you purchase furniture or clothing items with a gold heart icon on it.

, When you have made yourself available for a date, you may simply head on out to any bar or restaurant and invite someone out. To do this, you will just have to click on the Pink Plus icon on the screen and select the name of the person you would want to date. Before doing this, make sure that you have a good standing with all of your potential dates.

, Once you have clicked on the Pink Plus icon, you will have to select the name of the person you want to date. After selecting the name of the person you’d like to date, tap on “Call” and your date will begin shortly.


Be sure to wear something “nice” to a date by wearing clothes with a Gold Heart icon, as this helps improve the dating experience and provides you with more dating bonus.

, As soon as your date arrives you may begin the date by tapping on the pink pins scattered across the screen and completing every task. Each task shall consume energy so it is always best to make sure that you have tons of energy before going on a date. If you do not complete all the tasks in time, your date will be a failure and could hurt your relationship with the person. It is also important to note that having successful relationships are important in order to increase your fame status in the game, so be sure to handle your relationships properly.

, This is the “Mighty Eagle” icon.

, The Mighty Eagle upgrade can be purchased for a one-time fee of 99 cents., All your birds will disappear, and a can of sardines will appear on your slingshot., After a few seconds, the Mighty Eagle will fly down from the sky and destroy all pigs and blocks in its path. The destruction caused by the Mighty Eagle is calculated based on the damage sustained, and on where you place the can of sardines.Try aiming the can of sardines so it lands directly in front of the pig structure. The Mighty Eagle will fly down into the ground, spin out of control, and cause a higher amount of destruction.

, At that point, you’ll be rewarded a feather.

Build up your multiplier.,
Upgrade your power-ups.,
Stock up on hoverboards.,
Collect keys.,
Grab a lot of coins.,
Practice often.",How to Get a High Score on Subway Surfers," The best way to get a higher score quicker is to improve your multiplier. When you first begin playing, your multiplier will be set at x1. Every time you beat a set of missions, you will level up, and your multiplier will permanently increase by one, up to x30. This means that your score will be 30 times what it would normally be if you have a full multiplier.


Missions include collecting a specific number of coins, jumping a certain number of times, picking up specific power-ups, and more. You can see your active missions by tapping the Missions button at the top of the main menu.
If there's a mission that you just cannot do for whatever reason, then you can skip it in the shop for a certain number of coins, depending on what level you are on. Your multiplier will still go up like normal if it is the last mission that you need to level up.;
, The Coin Magnet, Jet Pack and 2X Multiplier are the most powerful pickups for increasing your score. The Coin Magnet will pick up any coin you run past, even if it isn’t in your lane. The Jet Pack will launch you above the course, where you are free to collect coins without worry. The 2X multiplier will double your current multiplier, up to 60x.You can upgrade these powerups by spending coins that you earn on runs. Increasing the effectiveness of these powerups can dramatically increase the amount of coins that you earn when you are using them.
Upgrade your Coin Magnet and Jet Pack first. This will help you early on in the game as you earn coins to unlock more upgrades and complete missions. Once your Multiplier is close to 30x, start upgrading the 2X Multiplier powerup. This will really start to significantly boost your scores., These can be purchased for coins or won in prize boxes. Hoverboards last for 30 seconds, but their true power comes in taking a hit for you. If you hit an object while riding a hoverboard, your run won’t end. Instead, you’ll be back on foot, continuing your run and increasing your score. You should always have a good stock of hoverboards to use in emergencies when you can’t avoid hitting something.


Moving forward is one of the two primary ways that you earn score. Hoverboards ensure that you keep moving forward, and your score keeps increasing.
Have 600 to 900+ boards. Use them when your character already runs too fast for you to handle.

, Keys are a currency that allows you to continue your run when you hit an object. Keys can be found while running through the course, in mystery boxes, or from weekly missions. You can also buy keys for real money. Having a good stock of keys can help keep a good run going a long time.Only use keys when you hit something without a board, at 500k+ score.

, It may seem obvious, but it can’t be stressed enough. For a really high score, you need to be grabbing as many coins as possible. This means using your powerups to their maximum effectiveness, performing perfect runs and lane changes, and not missing the timing of your jumps.

, Since every run is different, you can’t just memorize the level and do the same thing over and over until you have the high score. You need to practice so that you can see the patterns coming and react in time. You probably won’t get a very high score when you first start, but after a few weeks of practice, you’ll start to see it creeping closer and closer to that elusive 1,000,000 point total. Keep at it!

Don’t quit.",How to Get High Scores in Angry Birds 2," Unlike in the original Angry Birds, where the sequence of the birds to be used was predefined, you can sort and use the different birds your own way. The three different birds available to you for the level are shown in the bottom left corner.;
, Using the right bird for the job can make a lot of difference in destroying the structures and the piggies, which in turn will bring your scores up. The more damage you cause, the more points you get. The selected bird will be placed on the slingshot, ready to be flung.


Red—Red is the most common bird in the game. It’s the red bird that can knock most structures down.
Blues—Blues are three birds in one. You only shoot one blue bird and tapping on the screen will split it to three identical blue birds. You can knock down three different places in one go.
Chuck—Chuck is the triangular yellow bird. It can zip through most structures, like wood, by tapping on the screen while it’s in flight.
Matilda—Matilda is the white egg-shaped bird. It will poop out eggs when you tap on the screen while it’s in flight. Matilda and its eggs will knock structures that they hit.
Silver—Silver is a new bird in Angry Birds. Tapping the screen while it’s in flight will make it do a loop-de-loop then nosedive. It can be used to hit those hard-to-reach parts of the structures.
Bomb—Bomb is the black bird shaped like a bomb. Throwing it on structures will trigger an explosion that will cause more damage.
Terence—Terence is Red’s giant brother. You can knock down anything with it.

, Pull back the bird and align your aim. Release and watch the bird hit your targets., It can be a good idea to view the whole picture before even putting a bird on the slingshot. Get an idea what elements are in play and what structures and piggies you need to hit. Focus your shots on the parts of the structures that will cause the most damage and take out the most piggies to get more points.

, Spells are like power-ups or boosters that you can use to boost your shots and increase your scores. Spells are equipped on the pre-game screen. Tap the spells you want to use before hitting the “Play” button. You can use them by placing them on the slingshot just like the other birds.


Golden Duck—Use this to shower the whole environment with golden ducks that will drop on and destroy the structures in the level. One use of this spell can take out everything and complete the level for you.
Frost—Use this to turn all the blocks to ice. Ice structures can easily be broken compared to ones built with stones.
Hot Chili—Use this to turn a random piggy into a time bomb that can take out other piggies and some structures.
Pig Inflater—Use this to bloat all the piggies until they burst. Once they do, they can take out items and structures around them.
Mighty Eagle—Use this to launch the Mighty Eagle across the whole screen. It will bring a huge wind with it, taking down almost everything.

, You only have a maximum of five lives at a time. If you don’t think you can’t complete the level, don’t just quit. Try and finish it still. Even if you don’t, you will still get an idea what the level holds so you can prepare your strategy the next time you play it. Some levels have multiple environments, and playing it through can get you a glimpse of all the structures you need to destroy in the level. Think of the right birds and the right spells you need to use to boost your scores."

,, The monster pairing proven most successful at breeding the Bowgart is the Potbelly + Maw combination; however, Toe Jammer + Furcorn, and Mammott + Oaktopus are also successful pairings that can breed the Bowgart., The breeding structure will begin flashing to indicate that your monsters are now breeding. The breeding period for the Bowgart lasts 12 hours. After the breeding period has ended, the Bowgart egg will be relocated to the Nursery and ready to hatch.


To avoid having to wait for the breeding period to end, accept the offer to pay 12 diamonds immediately after tapping on “Breed.” You will then have the option to sell the Bowgart, or place it on an island., The Bowgart egg will now be waiting for you at the Nursery.


If your breeding attempt was unsuccessful, return to the breeding structure, tap on “Retry,” and select either the same monsters you used previously, or try a different monster pairing. In some cases, you may need to try breeding the Bowgart one or more times using different monster combinations as outlined in step #3.

, You will receive a notification informing you that the Bowgart egg has hatched. You can now sell the Bowgart monster, or select the option to place the Bowgart at the Plant Island, Cold Island, or Gold Island."

, When you are a medium sized blob (150 to 600 mass) you now have to start eating other players. Once again, it is not advisable to split into four pieces. You can now begin to shoot viruses into other players, then eat up all their tiny blobs. If you are lucky, you will be able to eat their big blobs too. Viruses at this stage can be your friend or a deadly enemy., When you are a big blob (600 to 1000 mass), do the same as you do when you are a medium sized blob but don't shoot players with viruses, as you will be too big and slow to maneuver around them to get at the little blobs. Continue to split and if you want, you can split into four pieces at this stage., When you are a massive blob (1000+ mass), keep away from viruses. Other players will try to shoot them at you and if you split, big blobs will probably eat most of you up, thus replacing you on the leaderboard. It is advisable to team at this point, as it is hard to stay on the top for a while without teaming., When you are quitting, you can just quit or you can be nice and give all of your mass to a very lucky tiny blob."

, Note that opening the game for the first time may take a while.

, You only can select Level 1 (Sunshine Glade) if you have recently downloaded the game. You have to reach a certain height or a certain amount of Mega Points to get to the other levels.


When you have pressed Play, the screen will turn darker. Do not worry because it is normal; it means that Mega Jump is loading. It should also show a ""loading"" bar; it may take a while.

, The character will only go up if you touch the coins. If you don't touch a coin, your character may jump down and you will lose the game. See the ""Layout"" section below for a brief description of what you may find on your screen.

, Different objects or power-ups have different effects. In Level 1, all of the objects are good but, once you're on level two, some of the objects may prove to be bad.

In some cases, you aren't allowed to upgrade your power-ups any more, just like your levels. Mega is the maximum amount. Your characters cannot upgrade and they do not bring any benefit except for a different character playing your game. That is all you need to learn! Enjoy and have fun!

,


If you see a coin at the top-left and the number 76, that is how many coins you have collected. If you get 100 coins, you will get 10 Mega Points and you would get an extra boost.
If you see a blue wig with purple sparkles at the top-center, that is your power-up(remember that the power-up can be different so it may show a different power-up image). If it starts fading, that means it's running out.
If you see the number in red at the top-right, that is your height. The higher you are, the more likely you would be able to go to the next level. You also can buy levels by using your Mega Points.
If you see a golden circle, that is a coin.
If you see an object continuously moving, that is your character which it will collect the coins and power-ups for you.
If you see a star on the bottom-right, that is your Save Stars. You can purchase them for 500 Mega Points. When you are falling, you can click on one of them and you will be saved by a boost-up which has the colors blue and orange.
If you see a pause button (bottom-left), that is your Options.;
, The x2 button means that the height amount doubles.

Move your corner tile when forced to, then return it.,
Keep trying until you win.",How to Beat 2048," You probably already know how 2048 works, but just in case, here are the basics. Note that this is how the official game works, but there are many parodies, imitations, and even predecessors, many of which have different mechanics.









Swipe the screen up, down, left, or right to move all number tiles in that direction. Each tile moves in that direction until it hits the wall or another tile. (Use your arrow keys in the computer version.)
Each time you make a move, a new 2 or 4 tile appears in an empty spot in a row or column that was moved last move.;
, When a move causes two tiles of the same number to hit each other, they merge into one tile with a value equal to the sum of the two tiles. For instance, two 2 tiles combine into a 4. The goal is to create a tile with a value of 2048.








, It's easy to get sucked into the game and make moves as quickly as possible. If you want a better shot at winning, fight this impulse and only make a move when you're ready. Look ahead and try to imagine how the board will look after you make the next move, or at least what will happen to a few important tiles.








, A common strategy among players is to build up a high number in one corner. It doesn't matter what corner you pick, but once you pick, stick with it.








This tactic works best when the corner is part of a row you keep permanently filled. This lets you move the tiles left to right without dislodging your high-value tile.

, If you see a long row of similar tiles, it's usually a good idea to combine them all and give yourself more room on the board.







, One basic approach is to alternate tapping up and right until no squares are moving. Tap left when this happens, then go back to alternating up and right. This won't guarantee you a win - in fact, it usually won't get you there. However, it can get you a fairly high score, and it's a quick way to try to beat your previous record.







, Start a new game, then swipe left and right rapidly. Continue until you have a couple rows of 2s, 4s, and 8s. This isn't necessary to win, but it usually puts you in a good position and gets you to your first larger tiles faster.







, Combine the early tiles into a 16 or 32, and put it in a corner. The goal of this method is to keep this tile in place for as long as possible, gradually building it higher and higher.








This strategy was used for the world speed record of 2048, which reached the final tile in 1 minute and 34 seconds., For instance, if your high-value corner is in the top right, fill the entire top row with tiles. Alternating the two directions toward the corner (""up"" and ""right"" in this example) is a good way to achieve this. Once filled, you'll be able to move left and right as much as you like, without the high-value tile shifting from its corner.









Keep an eye on this row, and refill gaps that appear whenever possible, without shifting the corner tile.

, For most of the game, it's much more important to make 8s, 16s, and 32s than it is to aim for a single larger number. Ideally, these mid-range tiles will gather near your chosen corner tile. This sets you up for chain reactions of several combinations, which will get you much further than focusing on building one single tile higher by itself.








, Often, things won't work out perfectly, and you'll end up with a 2 or 4 trapped between a 256 and a 64, or similarly inconvenient positions. This is a good time to pause and think carefully about each move, and aim to free that small tile. There are a couple different tactics for this:









Choose a tile next to the trapped tile, and plan on how to combine it. If it's a large tile, you may need to plan multiple moves ahead to do this. Once it's set up with an equal tile next to it, swipe so the tile you've been planning to combine is the one that moves.
Alternatively, try to create a gap in the row with the small, trapped tile, then shift left and right until it is positioned over a tile it can combine with. This will not typically work well on a crowded board.

, In almost every game, you'll come to a point where you're forced to move your corner tile out of position.Look ahead to see which of the available moves benefits you the most. Swipe that direction, then swipe immediately back to return the high-value tile to the corner.









In some copycat versions of the game, you can make a move that does nothing, and a random tile will still appear. In this case, you theoretically never need to move your tile from the corner, but it still may be necessary if your screen is in danger of being filled.

, You'll still need some luck to beat the game, so don't expect to win first time. If you're forced to move your corner tile, and an unfortunate new tile appears in that corner, your chance of success are much lower. You might still win if you can clear off five or six empty tiles, or if your highest tiles are 64 or 128.If it's later in the game than that, there's usually no point in trying to get out of it.

The main objective of the game is to think of words that are associated with other words that link to each other.

, You will see a word in a red oval. A bunch of other white ovals filled with dashes and a number is linked to that one word via a grey dotted line. Each dash represents a letter and the number shows the total number of letters in the word. For example, ---- (4) suggests the word has four letters.

, In the example to the right, three words can be associated with ""Surf"" and one word with ""Up"". Also, ""Surf's Up"" can be broken into ""Surf"" and ""Up"", creating two associations.

, If it's right, you'll get points (see Tips), the oval will become red, and the grey dotted line(s) will transform into a black solid line. Other associations may appear, allowing the level to expand.

, These are indicated as a white question mark (?) in a green speech bubble. To see the clue, tap the word and it will appear at the top of the screen.

In-game hints: When you start a level, you will be given a number of hints (depending on the size of the level, they can be from 10-25). Hints reveal the word one letter at a time - one hint reveals one letter. Use sparingly and save until you're nearing the end of the level.

Facebook: You can ask friends on Facebook for help on words. A news story will appear on your Facebook wall requesting help.

, The bird should bump into an obstacle and cause some damage to it. Repeat this process until all of the pigs are gone or you've used up all of your birds.

, As you progress, you'll notice that there are different kinds of birds and they create different results when tapped. (You have to launch the birds first before tapping.) Here is what each bird does:


Red bird: The most ordinary bird; it doesn't have any special effects other than being able to be catapulted into the pigs. In the Red's Mighty Feathers update, his new power is when you tap somewhere on the screen, he goes to that place.
Blue bird: Tap the screen and it becomes three mini birds. This bird is best for breaking glass.
Yellow bird: Tap the screen and it goes very fast. This bird works best on wood.
Black bird: Tap the screen and it explodes instantly. Let it hit an obstacle and after a short time delay it will explode. This bird works best on stone. In the Short Fuse update, instead of exploding, he sends out a very deadly shockwave that electrocutes pigs nearby.
White bird: Tap the screen and it will drop an explosive egg. The corpse, if done right, will fly off and potentially cause additional damage. This bird also works best on stone.
Green bird: Tap the screen and it will fly back. This bird is similar to a boomerang.
Big Brother bird: Similar to the red bird, but bigger in size and more powerful.
Orange Bird: Very small, but swells up to big proportions. Try to squeeze it into tight spaces.
Pink Bird: Small, but levitates objects with bubbles. Use her to disrupt the bottoms of tall towers.
Mighty eagle: Press the button at the top of the screen and a sardine can appears. Launch the sardines and the mighty eagle will appear. You have to pay for this feature and once you use it on an unsolved level you have to wait another hour before using it on the next level. You will not get any stars for using this bird.

, Use Strategy to Eliminate Enemies. As you know, eliminating all the pigs is your ticket to clear a level in Angry Birds. Regardless of the environment and structures where the pigs are, using the correct strategy will help you get rid of these pesky pigs and progress forward.

, Before launching your feathered army, have a clear look of the entire stage. See how many pigs are there, where a structure’s “weak” point, what are the obstacles, and such. Point is, don't just go rushing your way to finish a stage - observe first.

, In cases of structures which are kind of protecting the pigs, most of the time, you don't attack the pig or the structure's walls directly - you go for the base! Every structure will eventually collapse if you target on its basal support. Also look out for thin layers on a structure’s built for it may be an entry for your army birds.

, Most of the time, Angry Birds stages have TNT’s or explosives. These explosives can be of good use to you for they can clear obstacles when triggered. These TNT’s are strategically located where they can affect the environment when triggered so consider targeting them sometimes when an obstacle seems impossible to be destroyed by mere birds.


Explosives usually have boulders near them or other explosives for maximum effect to the structures around them. If this is the case, it is most likely that you need to target this TNT to clear a stage.

, When you launch one of your birds, it will leave a trajectory line. You can use this trajectory line as a guide on the correct direction where you should launch your next bird. This is very helpful to make every bird land on the target you’re aiming at.

, It is almost sure that you won’t be able to clear all stages in just one try. You will surely fail especially on the later stages of the game. If this happens, don’t lose heart and try again. Angry Birds has no limit when it comes to continues so take advantage of this. Learn from your mistake and do better on your next try.


Sometimes when it’s obviously impossible for you to clear the stage, it’s advisable to just hit that Try Again button just to save time and try again.

, You pass a level once you get rid of all the pigs on that level. If you don't pass the level on your first try, you can easily try again.


There are seven different groups of levels in the game. Complete a group of levels and unlock another group of levels in the game. In the Angry Bird seasons version there are ten groups of levels. You can also get Angry Birds Rio which has two groups of levels.

, This can take quite a while (fortunately, as who wants all the fun to end?). There are guides available either as separate apps or videos on sites such as YouTube and these can be of great help.

, Scouting will help you to work on how will you attack and deploy your troops. It can also help what kind of defense strategy is your opposition applying.
, Previous attacks of yours can assist you to work on your mistakes. You can see trap locations and clan castle troops. Replays of others are also very watchful which can show others' attack strategies.
, Make sure everything is planned about how you and your clan mates will attack. For example, if your clan has 40 members, top 20 players will attack only top 20 players of your opposition clan and others will attack the rest.
, After you practiced attacking, you must have known what kind of troops are better for you. Use them in your clan war battles.

Inferno towers are said to be upgraded first for only those who have a town hall level 10.,
Upgrade your X-bows.,
Work on your air defenses first.,
Upgrade your wizard towers.,
Mortars are required to upgrade next.,
Archer towers and canons are single targeted.,
Walls are also very useful for defense.",How to Upgrade Correctly in Clash of Clans2," This is because it is only available for the last town hall level of the game.

, Just like inferno towers, you can build them when you reach Town Hall level 9.

, They are very important because people mostly attack with air troops and air defenses can finish them very easily. They can be built when your town hall is on level 4.

, They are splash defenses which can take down huge group of troops. Same as air defenses, they are available after you reach town hall level 5.

, They are also splash defenses which are very dangerous for troops such as archers, barbarians and goblins. They are built when you reach town hall level 4.

, So they are less important and are asked to upgrade later on.

, They slow down the enemy's troops.[[Image:Upgrade Correctly in Clash of Clans Step 11.jpg|cehfnghdbv"

Decide what type of base you want.,
Max out collectors first.,
Go for walls and defenses.,
Buy builders.,
Have a good base layout.,
Don't town hall rush.",How to Upgrade Your Base Efficiently in Clash of Clans," Several new ""types"" of bases are out there, the main two being a Trophy rush and Farming base. If you are trophy rushing, upgrading your barracks, army camps, laboratory would be the best for you. If you are farming, where you stay in a low league than you could be in in the effort to build up lots of materials, then upgrading walls, defenses, collectors, and storages is the way to go.;
, If you start to go for other things like walls and defenses first, it is going to take a long time to get the gold and elixir needed for these upgrades. If you have your collectors maxed out for your level, then you will be able to get these upgrades faster in the long run.

, Put defenses as priority over walls, and the defenses you want to upgrade first are mortars and air defenses, as all attacks use a creature that can be taken down with one of these two defenses. Upgrading the walls to the max may not be efficient for your town hall, such as town hall 7 where the walls cost 200k elixir apiece.

, Builders allow you to build more things at once, maxing out at 5 builders. These cost gems, but don't waste gems on speeding up production, use them on buying builder's huts as they allow you to build things faster.

, There's no point in trying to stock up on supplies if you lose all the gold you make in one attack. Keep your dark elixir drill and all storages in the very inner part of you base. Then surround them with your defenses to make people go through all your defenses before they can take your supplies.

, Some people only focus on upgrading their town hall to get the most defenses quickly without actually upgrading their defenses. Upgrade everything to max before trying to upgrade your town hall.

"
"
Upgrade your troops.",How to Save Resources on Clash of Clans1," You know how upgraded troops cost more? Well, you can save elixir by this easy tip! For example, you're almost finished upgrading your Archers to level 3. Fill up your Army Camps with level 2 Archers, maximum. When the laboratory finishes upgrading, your Archers will auto-upgrade at no extra cost.;
"
"
Defend your resources.,
Place your defenses in the right spot.,
Deal with Wall Breakers.,
Deal with Giants.,
Look for hidden Teslas.,
Look out for clan castle troops.",How to Save Resources on Clash of Clans2," Save up as much of your resources as you can. Put the collectors/mines/drillers on the outside of your village. They have less value and contain less resources. Put the storage on the inside of your village to ensure maximum protection from your enemies.

, Cannons and mortars can't fire at air targets, so if balloons attack them, they'll be destroyed. Put them within an attack radius of an air defense or Archer Towers. Wizard Towers are vulnerable to clusters of Barbarians or giants/any troops with very high health, so cover it with an air defense or Archer Towers. Add any Air Bombs if available.

, We know we hate them. Remember the days when we would put walls around our village and place any extra walls to thwart Wall Breakers? New update makes sure Wall Breakers are more intelligent and pass through unused / miscellaneous walls. Add cannons and Archer Towers around your village because they can target Wall Breakers faster than other defenses.

, Archer Towers are more effective in killing Giants than cannons or mortars. If you have at least 10 Giants surrounding any defenses, they're screwed. Spring Traps are more effective at killing Giants. 1 Spring Trap can throw up to 3 Giants at a time. A Giant Bomb can damage every Giant in the surrounding area. Bombs aren't that effective.

, If you have more than 5 Giants, you can successfully destroy a Tesla. The most obvious places to find a Tesla is an unusual collection of walls around a village. The Walls protect the Tesla, so don't spawn there. Also P.E.K.K.A's are very weak against teslas.

, Put down one troop in the clan castle radius and if there are any troops inside they will target your troop. Then drop a troop at a time and lure them away from the enemy defenses and bring them to the side. Then drop the amount of troops needed to finish up job without any defenses bothering you. Then you don't need to worry about that.

"
"
Look for tombstones.",How to Save Resources on Clash of Clans3," If there is an unusually large amount of tombstones in an area, that means there were deactivated traps there. Other players have used up the traps, which means you can spawn your troops there without fear of traps. Another tip: If you can spawn troops inside of a village, be careful. They can place a spring trap there or a Giant Bomb, so place a single troop to activate it, then throw in everything.

, Cracked eggs can be matched in groups of at least three before you can get the creature inside them. Once you’ve matched three or more cracked egg, a chick or dragon (depending on the egg) will pop out.

, Some levels will have cropsies encased in ice. You can use an activated Shovel to break the ice and free the cropsie, egg, or flower underneath.

, If you want to bloom flowers, just use an activated Shovel on them. Since it requires three matches next to a flower to bloom it, you will also need 3 Magic Shovels to make one flower bloom.

, Make matches nearby required cropsies to give them crop bonuses. You can also focus making matches on one area, that way bonus points will accumulate on nearby required cropsies, so when you make a match with these cropsies, you’ll earn more points towards reaching maximum Growth Rate.


Try to also make four or five-crop matches (straight, T, or L shapes). This increases the chance of giving bonus points to required cropsies nearby, giving you more points when you match them.

, If your level has areas of grass where cropsies can lay, make matches there. Cropsies on grass will automatically get additional points with each move. The more bonus points the Cropsie has (and you make a match with them), the faster you’ll reach the level goals, and the more points you’ll get.

, Cascades often happen when you make matches near the bottom of the board. It occurs when matches are made with cropsies that come down from the top as they fill up the tiles your match had made. The more cascades made, the more chances you get in reaching the goal in just a couple of moves, giving you a chance to reach Hero mode.

, When you reach the level goal and you still have some moves left, you’ll enter Hero Mode. In Hero Mode, the required cropsies will randomly get bonus points with each move left. If you haven’t reached maximum Growth Rate for the level yet, use Hero Mode to help you get there.


The best way to reach max Growth Rate in Hero Mode is to try to make matches with cropsies that have the most number of bonus points. You’ll reach 3 stars in no time!

, If you don’t get 3 stars the first time around, try the level again. As long as you still have lives left, you can continue to replay the level until you get the 3-star Growth Rate.

, Drop the pin or enter the address of the place you would like to go.

Make sure Uber is available in the city you are visiting.,
Contact your credit card company to ask about international purchases.,
Unlock your phone.,
Buy a SIM card and select a plan.,
Download and install the Uber app on your phone in advance.",How to Use Uber with an International Phone3," An up-to-date list of cities that have Uber service is located at https://www.uber.com/cities/.

, If you are travelling to a country where you plan to use Uber, make sure you have a payment method that works in that country. Credit cards are a popular way to pay for Uber, and many credit card companies will have no issue overseas. However, some cards may prevent international purchases, and that can hinder your ability to use Uber.


If you live in the US or Canada and have cellular service through T-Mobile, AT&T, or Bell and Rodgers, your phone is compatible with GSM networks.Other providers may also have phones that use GSM—call your carrier if you are not sure.
Some CDMA providers (like Sprint and Verizon) have a range of “world phones” that can be used on either CDMA or GSM networks.
If your phone is not GSM-compatible, you can still use the Uber app when you have access to Wi-Fi. This can be dangerous to rely on, as Wi-Fi networks are not always available.

, If you have an unlocked GSM phone, get a local (to your destination country) phone number by purchasing a SIM card for use in that country. Not only will doing this save you roaming fees, but it will also ensure that your Uber driver can call if he cannot find you.


A few weeks in advance (if possible), call your carrier’s customer service phone number and ask if your phone is locked. If it’s not—great!
If the phone is locked, as the customer service agent to unlock it for international travel.The agent may offer you an international roaming plan as an alternative. These plans do not come with a local phone number in the company where you are traveling and cost far more money than you’re used to paying for calls, texts, and data.If you do decide that an international plan sounds right for you, you should still be able to use the Uber app to make your reservations.

, If you’re staying in the country for less than a month, expect to pay anywhere from $15-40 for a SIM card and prepaid calling, SMS, and data credit.


If you have already arrived at your destination, head to a mobile, electronics or department store and view your options. Most stores will activate your new SIM card on the spot.You can buy a SIM card online in advance. This gives you the opportunity to do research before making your purchase. Popular international SIM providers like LycaMobile and Lebara make it easy to buy a SIM card and activate it online.

, If you have not already done so, install Uber from the App Store (iPhone) or the Play Store (Android) and create your Uber rider account before you leave. This will give you time to test the app’s functions when you’re still in a familiar environment.
