Determine how happy you are with your ride.,
Consider your own requests.,

Customize your tip.,
Hand your driver their tip.",How to Tip an Uber Driver," You should ask yourself the following questions:Did the driver arrive on time?
Was the ride smooth?
Was the car clean?
Did the driver have a good attitude?
Was a reasonable route used?;
, If your driver has been receptive to unusual or difficult requests during your ride, their patience might warrant a tip.

This especially applies if you were sick--or otherwise afflicted--during your ride.

, Generally speaking, you'll want to tip between fifteen and twenty percent of your total fare for an average tip. If your driver was truly exceptional, you might want to tip higher.

If you don't have access to a calculator (e.g., your smartphone), take a tenth of your fare (for example, a tenth of twenty would be two) and double it to make a twenty percent tip.

, Since Uber doesn't allow for tipping from within the app, you'll need to give your driver their tip in cash. Based on your consideration of the ride and both your driver's behavior and your own, put together your tip before arriving at your destination., Do this once you arrive at your location.

Some drivers won't take a tip outright. You can choose to leave the tip anyway at your discretion.

Never use the same password on more than one site or service.;
, Security experts recommend a password that is at least 12-15 characters.You should also use a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols in your password, and try to avoid words that are found in the dictionary.

, If a hacker gains access your email, they can change any of your Uber account information. Your email password should be unique and secure.


If your email provider prompts you to choose a security question for your account, pick a question with an answer that you’d never share with others.
Hackers can find answers to “What’s your mother’s maiden name?” and “What’s the name of your favorite sports team?” on your social media accounts.

, If your phone is ever lost or stolen, your lock-screen password can keep your data (including your Uber account) safe from prying eyes. If you don’t have a lock code or pattern set:

iPhone: Go to “Settings” > “Touch ID & Passcode” and tap “Turn Passcode On.” Follow the prompts to set a passcode.


, While it may seem helpful to have your difficult passwords written down on a sheet of paper, that sheet could get into the wrong hands. Keep handwritten passwords away from areas visible from doors and windows.

, People often choose weak passwords because they worry they won’t remember those that are longer and more secure.

Choose uberX for the fastest service.,
Choose UberPool for the cheapest ride.,
Choose UberSELECT for a high-quality alternative to uberX.,
Choose UberBLACK for a luxurious service.,
Choose UberSUV for rides of large parties.,
Choose UberACCESS for disability accommodations.",How to Pick the Correct Uber Type1," UberX is the standard service offered by Uber. Given its high level of demand, this is the most common service and therefore often the quickest service to arrive at your pickup location. Its base fare is $2.20, and operates at 1.30 per minute. All uberX cars:Can carry up to 4 passengers.
Have 4 doors or more.
Are newer cars (though exact requirements vary by city).;
, This service functions as a ""carpool"" service. If two or more riders request an Uber and are traveling in the same direction, they may share the ride on the way to each destination. Though UberPool will not always find multiple riders to pick up and drop off during the course of a trip, when it does, it will often be slightly slower than UberX.Because it is a shared ride service, you can reserve up to only 2 seats in an UberPOOL.
All UberPOOL cars can carry up to 4 passengers.
All UberPool cars are newer models (though exact requirements vary by city).

, To qualify for the UberSELECT service, drivers and cars undergo a more rigorous ""vetting"" process that is used to ensure a high-end service to those who request it. These cars are roughly twice as expensive as uberX per mile (with a base fare of $5). These cars must fulfill certain prerequisites, namely that they must:Be a 2007 model or newer (as of 2016).
Be higher end sedans only (exact requirements vary by city).
Have leather/vegan leather seats.
Have at least 5 working working seatbelts.

, UberBLACK also aims at being high-quality, but to an even greater extent than UberSELECT. These cars are roughly 2.9 times more costly than uberX (with a base fare of $8) and fulfill the following prerequisites:The car is a luxury sedan (model & year requirements vary by city).
The car must be newer, black, have black leather interior, and very clean.
The driver typically follows by a dress code and may provide service amenities and refreshments.

, SUVs operate a higher-end service, much like UberBLACK and UberSELECT, but seat up to 7 passengers. Because of the high-end nature of this service, it is more expensive per person than uberX., UberACCESS offers vehicles with size and functional requirements that are inclusive to people with less physical mobility. UberACCESS consists of two options:UberWAV, which accommodates people requiring wheelchair accessible vehicles.
UberASSIST, which is a service equipped with drivers who are specially trained to assist seniors and people with other mobility limitations.

Have a valid U.S driver's license
Own a car that can seat four passengers;
, You will have to scan and email certain documents to Uber to verify things like your age. Scan and email Uber a valid driver's license and proof of insurance., Uber will ask you to let them do a screening online. This checks your driving history to make sure you're a safe enough driver to work for Uber. This should only take a few minutes after you consent to the screening., Uber drivers are paid via direct deposit. Using your Uber username and password, sign into vault.uber.com and hit ""modify"" to add payment information. For your security, Uber will then send a four digit pin to your phone. Enter this pin to get into the website and enter your banking information.If you don't receive your pin, sign into to the Uber app through your phone. Tap ""Profile"" and reenter or update your phone number.

, Once you've accessed the Uber site, you can enter your banking information for direct deposit. You will need information like your bank account and routing number, which you can find through an online banking system or by looking at a check. When you're done, simply tap ""Save."", Uber pays every Monday, so you should get a notification about your earnings then. However, payments are usually not reflected in your bank statements until Thursday. On Thursday, check your bank account balance to make sure the payment was processed.Contact Uber via phone or e-mail if your payment did not go through. Sometimes, payments may be delayed due to holidays.

, Your Uber account should provide you a statement each week explaining your earnings. This explains the amount of money you made through trips and tips, as well as any reimbursement you received from Uber for things like tolls.Uber provides an estimate of weekly payments through their app, but the estimate is rarely 100% accurate. Depending on things like tips and promotions, you may make slightly more or less than expected. Your rolling payment statements can help explain any discrepancies., If you want a more flexible payment option, sign up for Instant Pay via your Uber account. This allows you to cash out whenever you earn money via Uber. To set up Instant Pay, simply tap ""Earnings"" through your Uber account. Tap ""Instant Pay"" and then enter your debit card number.Not every Uber driver can sign up for Instant Pay. If you're paying for features like vehicle financing, you cannot sign up for Instant Pay. If your account has any security issues, you cannot sign up for Instant Pay until they're resolved.

, As long as you have at least $1 in earnings, you can cash out of Instant Pay whenever you want. All you have to do is go to your ""Earnings"" tab in the Uber app and click ""Cash Out."" You can cash out up to five times a day.Any money you don't cash out by Uber's weekly paydays will be direct deposited into your bank account on Mondays.

, In general, chasing surges throughout the day is unlikely to make you a lot of money. Many cars will enter surge zones, driving up competition. When driving for Uber, try to drive around a central location in the city. This way, you'll be pinged to get rides from people in surrounding areas and can pick up steady work.You should also avoid driving around areas like the suburbs of large cities. People often call Ubers to be taken into the cities, but the cost of driving miles and miles often outweighs the money you make.

, While chasing random surge prices is not recommended, do not ignore surges altogether either. Some surge prices are predictable. When areas are packed with customers looking for a ride, the demand is high enough that you should get rides even with competition.Bars closing and major events ending are generally the most predictable surge times. During these times, hovering around these areas increases your likelihood of getting a high paying ride.

, While driving, occasionally sign into the passenger app. If a lot of drivers are clustered in one area, it'll be harder for you to pick up rides. Go to areas where there are less drivers on the road.However, avoid completely secluded areas. Stick to central locations rather than driving to the middle of nowhere, where there may not be a high demand for rides.

, If an area is busy, but surge prices have not gone into effect yet, you can hack the system. When going to a surge area, log into the passenger's app until you reach the area. This shows Uber more people are heading to a particular area, which may lead to surge prices., Figure out the cost of owning and operating your car, the gas you use per mile, and IRS deductions from your final paycheck. Each week, add up the extra costs and subtract them from your paycheck. This will show you how much you really made.By driving in far away areas or simply not working enough hours, you can actually lose money driving for Uber. If your number comes out negative, strive to get more rides and tweak the locations where you're driving.

, Uber ratings actually matter a lot. Customers may not want to take rides from drivers with low ratings, so always be courteous to customers. Getting frustrated or crabby could knock your ratings.Customers who are angry, emotional, or intoxicated are typical for Uber drivers. Deal with such customers with patience, even when they become unruly. While it can be frustrating, remember how much your ratings matter to power through unpleasant interactions.

Stock up on food and water.,
Make a note of public restrooms.,
Head to central areas during downtime.,
Ignore Uber's texts.,
Increase surge fares.,
Use the passenger app.,
Don't drive over 10 miles to pick up a passenger.",How to Make Money As an Uber Driver2," Key to earning as much money as possible during your Uber shift is limiting the times during which you aren't in your car. Rather than looking for parking and spending valuable time (and money) finding somewhere to buy food during lunchtime, consider packing a lunch or other meal that you can eat comfortably from your car while pulled over.

, Your bodily needs are unavoidable during a long day of work, but you can limit the time and gas you spend looking for places to use the restroom by searching your map for public restrooms in the area where you're working.

, If a passenger requests a destination that is in a suburb or less densely populated area, it's important not to stay there after the trip is complete. You'll find much higher demand for Uber in busy urban areas, so always make an effort to search for new passengers here rather than in less socially active places (especially ones where people are more likely to drive their own cars).

, Uber will often text drivers with advice on where to head to find lots of passengers. However, this causes lots of drivers to head to ""high-demand"" areas, reducing the likelihood of surge pricing and of all drivers even managing to find passengers. By merely avoiding the areas that Uber texts about, you increase your likelihood of finding passengers.

, Uber turns on surge pricing according to the number of Uber drivers operating in an area, which is determined by the number of drivers logged into the app at a given time. You can increase the likelihood (and rate) of surge pricing by logging out of the driver app just before typical surge price hours - for example, just before 1am on a Friday night or just before rush hour on a weekday - and then logging back in a few minutes later, after passengers have started requesting rides en masse. This increases both the likelihood that a surge will occur and the surge rate that passengers experience when requesting rides.

, While the driver app does not allow you to see other Uber cars in the area, the Uber passenger app does. If you find yourself without any passenger requests for an extended time, download and open the passenger app. You may find that the map shows you many other Uber cars in your immediate vicinity. When this happens, drive away from the other cars on the map (it may take less than even a mile) and you will increase the demand for your car's service.


This trick involves a tradeoff between supply and demand of Uber cars. Ideally, you should drive as far away from other Ubers as possible without leaving a well-populated area, where the demand for Uber is likely to be high.

, The average Uber trip in the United States is 6.4 miles.By driving much longer than this to pick up a passenger, you greatly undermine the trip's value to you as a driver.

, By default, your pickup location will be your current location. You can make adjustments if necessary.

, Different cities will have different ride options available, at varying prices. The most common option in most areas is ""uberX,"" which is everyday drivers in everyday cars. This is typically the cheapest option with the most available drivers.


For larger groups (up to 6), select the ""XL"" option.
Luxury options will cost more, and may not be readily available in your area.
""UberPool"" allows you to share rides with other Uber riders and split the fare. It is not available in all areas.

, In some areas with uberX rides, you'll be able to see your guaranteed fare when selecting the vehicles. Otherwise, you'll see a fare estimate based on distance and current traffic.


Look for any current surge pricing. Surges occur when multiple riders are requesting rides from the same area, and will result in higher fares.

If you're facing a high surge, consider another transportation method or choose another pickup location.

, You'll be asked to confirm your pickup location if you didn't modify it earlier.

You'll be notified through the app one minute before your driver arrives.

, You can see your driver's car on the map and an ETA at the bottom of the screen.

, The car model will be displayed underneath the driver's name. This will help you identify your driver in a busy area.

, The Uber app will tell you your driver's license plate number. Use this to help make sure you're getting in the right car., Don't say, ""Are you here to pick up <your name>?"" Instead ask, ""Who are you here to pick up?"" The driver will know your name through their Uber app, so this will ensure that you're safely getting into the car that you ordered., If you leave something behind, you'll have to coordinate a meeting with your driver later to retrieve it, which can be a hassle. Double-check that you've grabbed everything before getting out of the vehicle., After the driver ends your ride, the Uber app will prompt you to rate your driver.


Be honest with your rating, but also keep in mind that Uber will kick drivers out if their rating falls below 4.6 stars., You don't need to do anything to pay your driver after the ride. Your payment method will be charged automatically through the Uber app. If you feel like tipping your driver, you can do so with cash. Tipping is not required, and it's not possible to add a tip to your automated payment.

You're charged a cancellation fee if you cancel after 2-5 minutes have passed since ordering the ride. The time until you get charged varies depending on your city.

, It's located under the list of Help options.

, You'll want to tap the option that's most pertinent to your situation. The disputable reasons include:



My driver didn't start or end my trip on time - Keeping in mind that Uber estimates are fickle, choose this option if you feel like your trip took an unreasonably long time solely because of your driver's behavior.

My driver took a poor route - In extreme cases (e.g., your driver went the opposite way of your objective), Uber will refund your fare if you choose this option.

My driver stopped mid-trip - You shouldn't be charged for any unscheduled stops. If you were, choose this option.

I did not take this trip - If you see a trip and a receipt for which you were not present in your ""Trips"" tab, choose this option.

I missed my flight or event - While Uber usually won't claim responsibility for these, you can choose this option if you feel like your driver was the sole reason you missed your event.

I was charged a cleaning fee - If you feel like you were wrongly charged for cleaning, choose this option.

I paid a toll for my driver - Any tolls encountered along the way should be factored into your Uber fare automatically; you shouldn't have to pay a toll for your driver.

I paid my driver cash - Most Uber services are cash-free; if you paid cash for your ride, choose this option.

, Depending on the reason you choose, your options for doing so will vary.


For example, if you chose ""My driver took a poor route"", you'll only see a ""Share Details"" field for you to describe the event.
If you chose ""I paid my driver cash"", however, you'll have more options such as ""Did your driver ask for a cash tip?"" and ""What was the amount of cash paid?"".
Be thorough when providing this information. The more detail you provide, the more informed a decision Uber will be able to make.

, Uber will review your provided information; if they deem your fare unreasonable, you should see a partial (or full) refund in a few days' time.

You shouldn’t have any major violations, such as reckless driving.In the last seven years, you should have no drug-related infractions or DUIs. In addition, you can’t have any driving felonies, such as a hit-and-run.
In the past seven years, you shouldn’t have committed any violent crimes, sexual offenses, thefts, property damage, felonies or drug related offenses.;
, You’ll need a valid driver’s license for your state, as well as one year of driving experience in the United States. If you recently moved and hope to drive for Lyft, you should go to the DMV and get a license.If you recently moved and got a new in-state license, you will need to prove that you have one year of driving experience. You could take a photograph of your old driver’s license before trading it in for your new in-state license., Your automotive insurance should be in-state and your name should be on the policy. In addition, you must be insured to the level of the state minimum.The name on your insurance policy has to match the vehicle you want to drive for Lyft.

, You’ll need a four door car that is in good condition.In particular, your car should have all of the safety features, no major damage and should be clean. It should meet the following specifications:It should be a 2004 or newer model.All seatbelts in good working condition.
Good tire tread depth. You should be able to fit a penny within all parts of the tread.

The body of the car must be in good condition.
Working mufflers and tailpipe.
Seat adjustments work properly.

, If you have all of the requirements except for a car, you can still drive for Lyft! You can drive for one of the car rental companies that have arrangements with Lyft, such as Hertz or Enterprise, for example. This can be a good way to try out the job, although you may want to own your own car for this job eventually, given the rental costs.It may cost in the range of $150-250 per week to rent a car to drive for Lyft., You need a smartphone for this job, since you will get your jobs by looking at the Lyft mobile app. In particular, you’ll need at least an iPhone 4 with an iOS 9.0+ operating system. If you use an Android device, it should be running at least a 6.0+ operating system., On your smartphone or personal computer, go to the Lyft website. You will need to enter your first and last name, email address, city and phone number. At this stage, you can also get a rough estimate of how much you could make based on your city and the number of hours you plan to drive., After creating your account, you will be asked to fill out basic information that Lyft will use to perform a background check, driver’s record check, identity check, vehicle check and make sure you meet the driver’s requirements. Lyft will contact you about the status of your application., If you pass the online application process, you will get an email from a Lyft mentor. A Lyft mentor is an experienced Lyft driver who will test your suitability for the position. You will set up a meeting with the Lyft mentor. At the meeting, you’ll have to take the mentor for a drive. At this stage, you may want to ask the mentor a few questions about their experience of driving for Lyft and try to get a few tips.The mentor will take a photograph of you, your car and license, which they will send to Lyft on your behalf., Open the App store on your smartphone. Open search and type “Lyft.” Click on “Get” to download the mobile application. Once the App is downloaded to your phone, you should see a steering wheel in the top right corner. Tap on the steering wheel to get to the driver’s side of the application., In order to get paid from Lyft, you’ll need to enter your banking information into the driver dashboard on your Lyft account. Although you can do this from a mobile phone, you may prefer to enter this information on a computer. You’ll need to enter your bank’s routing and account numbers.If you look for the routing number on a personal check, it is the 9-digit code on the lower left corner.
You’ll see the account number on the right side of the check. It is a 13-digit code.
Lyft will only transfer money to a checking account.

, Since you can make more money per hour by driving during “prime time,” you’ll want to determine when “prime time” is scheduled in your city. Typically, “prime time” is scheduled for late at night when people are coming back from the bars. The early mornings are also typically “prime time,” since many people will be using the app to get to work., The most lucrative times of year to make money in your region will vary depending on the local economy. So it helps to know when tourists begin coming to your city or town, for example, as well as when major festivals or events take place., Talk to other Lyft drivers. Join a social networking site for Lyft or Uber drivers in your area, such as a Facebook group. Ask for tips from more experienced drivers, such as how to get the most lucrative trips and the best tips., Since passengers will be rating their experience in your car, you’ll need to practice friendly, positive customer service. Lyft is known for offering a friendly, upbeat passenger experience, so you should be prepared to chat and drive. Being friendly should help not only with your tips but also with your ratings, which influence how many rides you get."

Receive more positive attention from Lyft.",How to Decide if You Should Drive for Uber or Lyft," The dollar amount of a sign-up bonus that you can earn naturally depends on the city that you’re applying to drive in. Lyft generally offers larger sign-up bonuses than Uber; a typical Lyft bonus can range from $500–750, and may even reach $1,000. While Uber often does provide a sign-up bonus to new drivers, the amounts are substantially lower. In some cities, Uber may not offer a sign-up bonus at all.In order to earn your sign-up bonus for Lyft, you’ll be expected to give a certain number of rides before you receive the bonus. Depending on the city, the number can range from 25 to 100.;
, The amount that a driver will earn from a single ride can vary based on the city, time of day, and other factors. However, broadly speaking, Lyft drivers tend to be paid a higher rate than Uber drivers. Lyft drivers on average make about $17.50 per hour. Uber drivers make about $15.68 per hour.The Lyft app also allows customers to tip their drivers, which the Uber app does not. Tips can dramatically increase a driver’s take-home pay.

, Although both apps provide a similar service, Uber is still far more commonly used than Lyft, and provides a ridesharing service in more cities. Uber has a larger customer base, so as an Uber driver, you’ll have more opportunities to give rides and make money. This also means that, as opposed to driving for Lyft, you’ll stay busier and have more consistent passenger pick-ups.However, be aware that, if you drive for Uber, there will also be more drivers in your area with whom you’re competing to pick up the same clients. This may mean that, although more clients use Uber, the competition for those clients is stiffer.

, If you’re looking to rely on your ridesharing job as your primary source of income, it’s not a bad idea to drive for both companies. Regardless of which company you choose to start with, neither company has a policy that forbids drivers from working for the other simultaneously. This will give you added job security, as you can pick up Uber rides when the Lyft pings are coming in slowly.If you drive for both companies, you’ll also be able to avoid downtime between rides. Also, sometimes one app or the other goes down for no apparent reason. If this happens while you’re working, you can switch and pick up rides on the other app.

, Lyft is a smaller company than Uber, and, although its client base is growing, still has fewer regular customers. If you’d like to ease into your role as a rideshare driver, plan to start with Lyft. As a new driver for Lyft, you’ll be less likely to get back-to-back ride requests.That said, if you’d prefer to forego an easier beginning experience, sign up for Uber. You’ll likely be in a fast-paced driving environment immediately.
Although having many ride requests when you begin may be daunting, by the time you’ve learned the ropes, you may come to appreciate the lack of downtime and the resulting higher income.

, Both Lyft and Uber have strict rating requirements for the drivers: if an individual driver’s rating slips below a 4.6, their position may be terminated. Uber average’s a driver’s most recent 500 ratings, whereas Lyft only tracks the most recent 100 ratings. Older ratings are no longer counted.This means that if you acquired some low ratings as a beginner driver, they’ll only effect your overall rating for a short time under Lyft. With Uber, low ratings earned in the first weeks of driving will bring down your average for much longer.

, While both companies place certain vehicle requirements on drivers, Uber’s tend to be less stringent. Lyft only accepts drivers that have newer cars, while Uber permits drivers to have somewhat older vehicles.Regardless of the company you apply to work for and the year of your vehicle, you’ll likely need to have some maintenance performed before you can start picking up customers.


Check the Uber and Lyft websites for more information regarding the type of vehicle maintenance each requires.

, Lyft is known to have a welcoming company culture, which passes on various benefits to drivers. For example, Lyft gives riders the opportunity to tip their driver, while Uber has no tip function in their app. Also, Lyft takes certain steps to accommodate their passengers: if a passenger rates a drive with three stars or fewer, the app will not match this driver and rider again.Further, Lyft offers what are called “Power Drive Bonuses” to drivers who exceed a certain number of rides a week. This bonus allows busy drivers to keep a higher percentage of their fares.

, Uber asks its drivers to dress professionally and treat passengers as if the driver were a chauffeur: drivers are expected to open doors and lift luggage for their passengers. Nearly all Uber cars and SUVs are black, and the company discourages individual accessories on or in the car.Uber also encourages drivers to have a separate phone used specifically for the ridesharing app.
Conversely, Lyft does not discourage drivers from using their personal phones to run the Lyft app.

, According to some of the companies' ex-drivers, Uber can have strained relationships with its own drivers, whereas Lyft is generally an encouraging company. Lyft encourages community among its drivers, and the company makes it clear that it respects and appreciates its drivers.For example, Lyft sends drivers a “care package” consisting of a few small Lyft products after the driver has provided 1,000 rides to clients.

Avoid canceling UberPool rides whenever possible.",How to Avoid Uber Cancellation Fees1," The best way to avoid an Uber cancellation fee is keeping track of time. If you don't cancel the Uber in a timely fashion, you'll be charged a fee. When you call your Uber, take note of what time it is. If you choose to cancel, make sure you do within five minutes.It's easy to lose track of time when you're rushing to get ready for an Uber. It can help to set a timer on your phone for five minutes shortly after calling an Uber to make sure you cancel your ride in time.;
, In the event you need to cancel, do so in five minutes. If you wait too long, Uber will charge you a cancellation fee as you may have inconvenienced the driver. If you find you need to cancel, do so as quickly as possible to beat the fee., An UberPool ride is a ride you share with other passengers. While UberPool is cheaper than calling a regular Uber, policies regarding cancellation fees are stricter. If you cancel an UberPool at any point, you're charged a fee. To avoid Uber cancellation fees, only call an UberPool if you're 100% sure you're going to take the ride.While it is generally more difficult to cancel an UberPool without a fee, in special cases you may be able to contest a cancellation fee. For example, if you had a major issue with a driver, such as the driver not showing up in a timely fashion, you may be able to cancel and report the issue to Uber. Uber may cancel the fee.

Be wary of scams.",How to Avoid Uber Cancellation Fees2," Drivers may sometimes cancel a trip if they're surprised by your destination. If you wait a few minutes after a driver requests a ride to enter your destination, the driver may cancel if they do not want to take you to that area. This can sometimes result in a cancellation fee.Punch in your destination prior to calling your Uber. This way, you can make sure you get a driver willing to take you to a particular destination, reducing the likelihood the driver will cancel.

It's particularly important if you're going to an area that a driver may not want to drive. Areas that are very far away or where traffic is generally busy, such as airports, may cause riders to hesitate.

, Make sure you get to your car as soon as your Uber arrives. Drivers have the right to cancel a trip if you do not make it to their car within two minutes of their arrival. In this case, you can be charged a cancellation fee.Sometimes, drivers arrive very quickly to a destination. It's a good idea to get packed and ready before actually calling an Uber so you can head out the door as soon as the driver arrives.

, Sometimes, Uber drivers will scam users in order to pick up rides, cancel, and make money from the cancellation fee. In a well known scam, drivers call and claim they can't see your destination and that you need to cancel the ride to fix the problem. Drivers are usually not being honest in this situation and you will end up getting charged a cancellation fee and not getting your ride. If an Uber driver calls you with this story, call Uber customer service and report the driver."

From there, click ""I had an issue with my fare."" When the next menu opens, click, ""I was charged a cancellation fee."" You will then be prompted to provide the details of how you were charged the fee.Usually, you can get your money back if a driver issue caused a cancellation. For example, if a driver was very late and didn't return your calls, you may have been forced to cancel the ride after five minutes. In this case, Uber may refund you the money as the driver was to blame for the issue.
Remember, Uber does reserve the right to charge fees if you cancelled the ride after five minutes or made your driver wait an unreasonable time. Under these circumstances, Uber may not refund you.

UberPOOL is a service that seeks to find riders traveling in the same direction who are willing to share their journey with other riders. To take an UberPOOL:


Open the Uber app.
Drag the sliding button at the bottom of your screen to the word POOL.
Proceed to request an Uber as you normally would.;
, Some Uber riders are familiar with the experience of ordering an Uber and having their phone die before the car arrives, thus canceling the Uber request and leaving the rider unable to order another. To reduce your risk of draining your phone battery before your Uber arrives:


Close the app as you are waiting for your car. You will receive an automatic notification when your driver is arriving.
Turn down the brightness on your phone's screen.
Turn off Bluetooth.
Close any apps you are not using.

, As Uber can take up to 20 minutes to arrive at your pickup location, it's worth trying to try to find somewhere to hang out while you wait for your car. The Uber will proceed to the location you originally set when booking the trip, so you don't need to worry about the car not being able to find you.

, After your Uber request is accepted, you will see a circle just below your app's map that cycles between an image of your driver and their car. Tap on this icon to see both displayed at once. Take note of the driver's face, the model of their car and the car's license plate. This will help ensure that the car you get into is the one that you ordered.

, On the screen that displays your driver's name and their car, you will also see a star rating underneath their face. This is the rating given to them by other riders, and can be used to gauge the experience that other riders have had with this driver.


Although Uber's standards for driver quality are much higher than the bar that most of us would set as ""safe"", it is worth noting that drivers whose average rating drops below 4.6 stars are at risk of being suspended until they complete a re-training program., Send a text to somebody who you trust in order to keep them in the loop about your whereabouts. Commit to letting them know when you have arrived safely at your destination.

, If you find that your safety has been compromised before your driver arrives, you can cancel your trip:


Tap on the circular image of your driver's car and face to bring up more information.
Tap the ""Cancel"" button on the bottom-right corner of the screen.

, If you are concerned that your driver is driving unsafely, tell them you would like to end the trip early and you will only be charged for the distance you have travelled.

, If your driver does not pull over when you ask them to, call emergency services immediately.

, If you take a trip that makes you feel unsafe, be sure to hold your driver accountable for the experience. After your trip is complete:


Open the Uber app, where you will be asked to give your ride a number of stars.
After giving a star rating of less than 4, you will be asked what was lacking in your experience. Tap on the option that corresponds to your concern and type in a description of your journey to send to Uber support.

Build walls effectively.,
Use other structures as defense.,
Join a Clan.,
Place your defenses within range of one another.,
Leave unnecessary buildings outside your walls.,
Protect your gold and elixir stores.",How to Protect Your Village in Clash of Clans1," The first aspect to a great defense base in Clash of Clans using all of your walls, and using the walls effectively. At lower levels you won’t have a lot of wall to build so you want to put your most valuable resources inside your walls.


At the beginning of your village your three biggest resources are your elixir and gold storages, and your Town Hall.
For defense minded players, the Town Hall is your most valued asset. If your attacker cannot destroy your town hall, the most the attacker can get is one star. Town Halls also have the highest hit points of any building, except walls.
Focus on building walls around your Town Hall and other defense weapons to protect it.
If you leave any gaps in your walls, enemy troops will walk through the broken area.
Don’t place all of your defenses and resources inside your walls. Aim to eventually build several layers of walls around your most important buildings and resources.;
, Archers, Wizards, Hog Riders, and flying creatures are capable of shooting or flying over walls. Use less important buildings to create a buffer for these attacks, delaying your enemies’ progress.


Use your cannons, Archer towers, and mortars as a buffer. Place these units inside your walls if you can. If you don’t have enough walls, use these defense buildings to complete your outer defense.
Your Archers and cannons should be on the front lines of your defenses. These units are capable of firing quickly and will draw attackers in.
Keep your mortars and Air Defense units in the center of your base. These units deal splash damage, meaning the attack targets an area of troops, not individual units.

, Build a Clan Castle and join a clan for extra defenses. The Clan Castle is extremely helpful when defending your village as you can request troops from your clanmates to fight in your village when it’s being attacked.Keep your Clan Castle near your Town Hall if you are playing defensively. This will allow your troops to start close to the action and add an extra defense against your most important resources.
Keep your Clan Castle Upgrade priority high as you gain levels.

, Think of your defenses like a chain. Enemies like Archers, Wizards, and Barbarians have no preferred target and will attack the closest building. Therefore, create a chain to deal consistent damage from the front to back.These troops will attack your walls, Archer towers, and cannons first if these buildings are at the outside of your village. Place your cannons near your Archer towers so the cannons can attack along with your towers as troops invade.
Place your mortars more in the center of your village, but within range of your Archer towers and cannons. The mortars can deal splash damage while invading troops are busy attacking walls and outlying structures.

, Army camps, barracks, spell factory, laboratory, and even gold and elixir mines should stay outside of your walls. At lower levels, you won’t have the quantity of walls to encase every building; most of these buildings don’t offer any resources worth protecting.


While gold mines and elixir collectors will house some resources, it isn’t usually enough to concern yourself with, especially if you play often enough and frequently empty these buildings.
Use these exterior buildings as another layer of defense. Enemies like Archers, Wizards, and Barbarians will attack the closest target. Place a cannon or mortar within range of these buildings to get some early attacks in before your enemy destroys the outer building and sets in on the walls.

, Like your Town Hall, your gold and elixir stores house a large number of your resources. Put these buildings close to your Town Hall and near mortars.


It’s also a good idea to place bombs near your stores to get a quick attack in when enemy troops move to attack your stores.

Be ready to leave as soon as your Uber arrives.,
Be kind to your driver.,
Tip your driver.,
Respect your driver's vehicle.,
Don't act intoxicated.",How to Check Your Uber Passenger Rating2," As independent contractors, Uber drivers' ability to make money comes from the amount of work they're able to secure during a shift. Making your driver wait undermines their ability to earn their wage and may make them more reluctant to give you a 5-star rating. Limit the amount of time you make your driver wait by being ready to hop in the car as soon as they arrive at your location.

Try to gather your belongings before requesting the Uber.
When Uber sends you a notification that your driver is approaching, make your way to the pickup location (assuming that the location is the street outside of your address - if it's farther away than this, plan accordingly so that you can be there as soon as your driver arrives).

, Some Uber drivers work shifts of up to 19 hours at a time. Remember that any job comes with stresses that can be intense, and that your driver will appreciate you treating them with kindness and consideration even if they're working more manageable schedules than this.Practice patience with your driver by keeping in mind that they're doing their best to get you to your destination as quickly and as comfortably as possible.
If you have concerns with your driver's quality of service, try to bring them up non-confrontationally, or wait until the end of your journey to report them to Uber instead of bringing them up directly.

, Uber doesn't allow you to tip through the app, but your driver is still offering you service akin to a taxi driver or a waiter. Consider carrying cash during your Uber rides to give your driver after pleasant service, and they will likely reciprocate by giving you a high star rating. Think of it as a ""five-for-five"" deal., Uber drivers offer up a valuable asset of their private property to service rides to customers. Remember that an Uber driver's car is different from a train or bus in this sense, and the person who uses the vehicle the most is the same person who has to maintain it. When riding in an Uber car, adopt a ""leave no trace"" policy whereby you commit to leaving the car in as good of a state as it was in when you entered it.

Don't leave food wrappers or drink bottles behind in your car.
Be mindful of mess on your clothing or shoes and be conscientious about getting any dirt you track into an Uber out when you leave it.
If your Uber has leather seats, ask your driver if they are comfortable with you putting your personal belonging on it before placing them there.

, Drunk and intoxicated customers can make for a very stressful experience for your driver, who may feel anxious about their passenger's potential belligerence or sickness. Remember that your driver's car is their personal space, and exercise whatever restraint you're able to in the car after a night out.

If you fear you may fall ill in the car, let your driver know; they'll appreciate you giving them the opportunity to pull over and allow you to be sick somewhere that won't damage their car.

Upgrade everything you can before you upgrade your Town Hall.,
Create room for advanced defense buildings.,
Redesign your village as needed.",How to Protect Your Village in Clash of Clans2," Once you get into the middle levels, having a Town Hall of level 4-7, you want to maximize your defenses before trying to upgrade your Town Hall. For a defensive minded player, focus your resources on your Clan Castle, towers, walls, storage, and mining structures before your army.


Focus on upgrading your walls first. Walls are the most expensive buildings to upgrade, but will provide the best defense against all ground troops. However, don’t focus on maxing out your walls as this won’t allow you to upgrade anything else.
Upgrade your mortars and air defenses. Once you get to higher Town Hall levels, you’ll be attacked by airborne creatures like dragons. Additionally, your enemies will send flying healers to aid troops on the battlefield. By upgrading your air and splash damage defenses you can counterbalance new enemy troops from breaking through your walls.
Upgrade your Wizard and Archer towers next. Wizard towers have a relatively short range, but are powerful and can be hard to take out at higher levels. Put your Wizard towers near your Town Hall, storages, and mortars to develop a powerful back line of defense.

, As you level up your Town Hall, you’ll gain access to more versatile and powerful defense buildings. Air defense towers, the Hidden Tesla, and the X-Bow are more defensive buildings that can provide your village with a lot of defensive power. Make sure to edit your base when you can buy these items.


The Air Defense tower becomes available at level 4, and exclusively attacks air units like Dragons and Healers. Place your Air Defense towers towards the center of your base to combat incoming airborne attacks. Be sure to protect your Air Defense with walls and other defensive buildings.The Hidden Tesla becomes available at level 7 of your Town Hall. It has a fast attack speed which is effective against light units like Archers and Barbarians. It’s also hidden which means your enemy cannot see it when attacking. Place your Hidden Tesla on the perimeter of your base to pick off Wall Breakers and Archers before these units can deal a lot of damage and open an attack path., As you get to higher Town Hall levels, you’ll not only have more options for buildings, but you’ll be able to build multiple buildings of the same kind. You’ll also be able to build more walls.


Take advantage of building more walls as soon as you have access. There are several strategies to building your base as you gain levels and resources. A standard base puts defensive and storage units inside the walls. It also has only one large wall, which allows you to place a lot inside, but is vulnerable once Wall Breakers, Giants, and Goblins enter.
A pocketed base surrounds each individual defense building with its own wall. During the mid-range levels this strategy will protect your Town Hall, Clan Castle, gold and elixir stores, and a few defensive buildings. Consider opting for larger pockets of wall that you can place several buildings inside. This will create several layers of defense, while still ensuring that you can protect your most valuable assets.
Remember as a rule of thumb, to place your splash damage buildings like your mortar and Wizard towers towards the middle while your Archer towers hold the front lines.

"
"
Get as many defensive buildings as you can.,
Upgrade your new towers.,
Build the Archer Queen Altar.,
Continue to upgrade current defenses and build new ones.,
Add new gold and elixir storage.,
Rearrange your base as needed and continue to upgrade Heroes and walls.",How to Protect Your Village in Clash of Clans3," Once your Town Hall is at level 8 and higher, you’ll have a lot of options for a variety of defense buildings. Spend your resources on upgrading your current defenses, especially your Clan Castle, but save enough to start adding a few new buildings as well.Don’t neglect to upgrade your walls which are still your best source of stopping power.
It’s also a great idea to focus on your dark elixir. Dark elixir is rare to win in battle and almost just as hard to mine. By adding and upgrading your dark elixir drills you can quickly produce enough to get the Barbarian King. The Barbarian King can be used to guard your village and attack enemy troops. This unit is great for defending your gold and elixir stores.
Build at least one more of each tower once you reach level 8. Keep your Town Hall and Clan Castle in the center surrounded by your strongest walls. Place your new towers in a square or circular formation as close to your Town Hall as possible, with the exception of your Archer towers, which should be lining your perimeter.
Keep your Air defense and Hidden Teslas relatively close to one another.
Get the Air Sweeper when it becomes available to blast airborne enemies back. Position your air sweepers away from other anti-air defenses. If you place your Air Sweeper too close to anti-air defense, it will blow the enemies out of range. Instead, try and place so it blows your enemies into an attack range.

, Once you’ve attended your existing defense building upgrades, upgrade the new towers you’ve added to provide better protection.


Upgrade these towers one at a time, and keep upgrading each one until it will take more than a day for the next upgrade.
Focus on upgrades that won’t keep your Builders busy for several days on one project. If you try to upgrade two Air Defense towers at once, you’ll use up your Builder’s time and won’t have time to attend to your other buildings before being attacked several times.
The same strategy applies to your mortars and Wizard towers. In addition, if too many of your defenses are being upgraded at once, you’ll have less defense units when you are being attacked.
Once you have tackled the larger projects, focus on upgrading your traps such as your bombs, balloons, and skeletons.

, Once you upgrade your Town Hall to level 9 you can get the Archer Queen. This unit is similar to the Barbarian King and will defend your village.You can place your Archer Queen next to your Barbarian King and have the two fight together, or spread the two units out to cover more ground.

, As you reach level 9 of your Town Hall you’ll also have access to a new X-Bow and more walls. Have one builder begin building new walls while another builder constructs the X-Bow.


Add any other defensive buildings that are available next. If you’ve been diligent about upgrading your existing defenses, you should be able to focus on adding new ones without much of an added attack threat to your existing structures.

, In order to hold enough resources for upgrading your new defenses, you may need to increase your resource storages. Before spending more resources on upgrading these new defenses, attend to your storage capacity.


As you continue to make upgrades you’ll need to be able to produce more gold, elixir, and dark elixir quickly.
Place your largest stores closer to the center of your village to protect your resources.

, As you slowly build all of your defenses and make upgrades on the new ones, you’ll need to make sure that your Barbarian King and Archer Queen are powerful enough to defend your village during upgrades.


You’ll also have to make more room for your new buildings following your previous strategy. Remember to keep mortars, Hidden Teslas, and Wizard towers to the center of your village. Place Archer towers, traps, and cannons closer to the perimeter.

Select a base layout.,
Use compartments.,
Rearrange your base into a diamond layout.,
Use the Army Camp base design.,
Have a star shaped base.,
Choose a base to design of your own if none of these work for you.",How to Have a Good Base in Clash of Clans1," Search the Internet for base ideas and designs that you may use. Pick one and try to use it to see how well it works out. Some good base design choices include well balanced resource and defense buildings to defend well against attacks. Loot is also kept safe as well as the town hall. Go to websites such as the Clash of Clans wiki, forums, or other websites, and find ideas from there.;
, Surround a building with upgraded walls. Add another building after those walls and surround that building with walls as well. Adding multiple buildings and surrounding them all at once in a large compartment is also a good idea. Place any extra walls you have around walls against the most important defenses, resources, etc. This will ensure the best defense so that you do not lose all your loot when you get attacked.


At some town hall levels, you will not be able to fit some buildings because you do not have enough walls. Remove any extra walls in between compartments and just merging the buildings together into one large compartment. Otherwise, only place your most important buildings inside compartments, and be sure to protect your town hall as well if you are not farming.

, Add compartments, and place your resources and town hall in the middle, surrounding them with walls. Add defenses all around the resources and town hall, adding walls to protect those as well. Balance out your collectors and mines as well as other buildings until it matches up to look like a diamond. Builder huts can be placed at the corners of the entire grass field so that enemies will take more time to attack them and lose.


If you have unlocked Dark Elixir, you might want to think of dropping trophies and placing your Dark Elixir in the middle instead, since starting at town hall 7, Dark Elixir is scarce, and people will always try to steal it. Place traps such as giant bombs and flying troop traps around the dark elixir, but traps can also be used in sneaky places, such as in a small space where you didn't add a wall, or all around an important building.

, Rearrange your base into a diamond shape, but leave out all the army camps you have. Place one army camp at each of the four corners of the base. Surround them with walls, but be sure that there is at least a whole line of space between the building and the walls when you surround the front of the camp.


When troops attack your base and they should go for the army camp as the last building to win the attack, the extra space causes the troop to be farther out of range, with causes the troop to go off into another building, moving farther and farther away so that it is more harder to win. With ground troops, this base can be effective.

, This type of base sort of looks like square compartments as well as other shaped compartments to look like a star that has several points. Start with a triangle or square compartment and work your way using other shaped compartments all around that one compartment. Place your town hall or resources right in the middle for best protection.

, You can always make your own base if none of these designs work out for your base. Include strong defenses and walls, as well as some traps to prevent enemies from coming through. Use any of the tricks that were shown above, such as the double layered wall trick, or the spaced walls. Make sure your base is as effective enough to defend against a decent amount of attacks.

"
"
Raid for gold and elixir frequently.,
Upgrade your mines and collectors first.,
Upgrade your small defenses next.,
Start on your bigger defenses.,
Work on your offensive buildings.,
Finish up any extra buildings that need upgrading.",How to Have a Good Base in Clash of Clans2," Buildings in your base may start to cost more than 500,000 to 1 million gold or elixir, starting at town hall 6. Upgrade your resource buildings as soon as possible in order to gain more loot at a time - your defense buildings should be next. Save as much gold and elixir as you can. Use up all your resources before you log off so no one will steal it. Train troops in your army camps that do not require a lot of elixir for a costly combination.


Use the Barch Strategy. Train up some archers and barbarians, enough to take out a small high level village. It is also inexpensive and also gets trained quickly. Spells can be taken into battle as well, but they may be a bit too expensive.

Find a base with plenty of resources and spread your archers around the closest resource buildings. Attack a village with very nearby resource buildings and vaults that are full. If it has at least 90,000 loot, it is a worthy base to attack. Make sure you can get to the loot easily. Send in your barbarians for back up and wait until your troops collect as much of the loot as possible. It doesn't matter if you win or not - as long as you get all the resources, you're okay.

, If you upgrade your buildings as soon as possible, you will be able to collect more loot each time you go on. Do not upgrade your vaults yet - you will be holding too much loot. Level up your vaults once your most expensive buildings have been finished upgrading. Use any extra loot on upgrading walls or resetting traps/defenses, until there is no more loot you can spend.

, Level up most of your archer towers and cannons first since they are pretty low damage defenses, and can be easy to upgrade. Upgrade all your archer towers at once, then your cannons so that your archer towers can do more damage to ground and flying troops. Upgrade your bombs and other traps since they do not cost much.

, Raid a lot and do Clan wars in your Clan in order to get a large amount of loot for these buildings. X-bows, Inferno towers, and other large defenses cost a huge amount of resources to upgrade. Collect your treasury bonus only when necessary in order to save it as well as the Clan war bonus.


Consider buying a shield. If you have extra loot, but are so close to having enough to upgrade a large building, do not spend it. If you leave it, you will get attacked, and your loot may get stolen. Buy at least a village guard in order to give you just enough time to get the small amount of loot you need to finish upgrading a large building. Use any extra time from the shield or village guard to collect more loot.

, Upgrade your Clan Castle first. The Clan castle costs more than a million gold starting at town hall 5. Use village guards to protect your loot and attack during these two hours so that you can gain more gold. Upgrade your Army Camps as well in order to hold more troops to attack.


Village guards allow you to attack freely as much as you want. Buy a village guard for 10 gems each day whenever you are about to attack nonstop gaining resources quickly.

, Upgrade your laboratory, spell factory, etc. Level up all your buildings to the max level until you have the strongest base you can have. Upgrade your town hall after and start to work on upgrading your defenses to become even more stronger.

"
"
Scout the enemy base that you want to attack beforehand.,
Locate the clan castle and click on it.,
Identify the spot where you can drop a troop/s to pull out what's inside the clan castle.,
Find an anchor point.,
Identify what troops and how many of them will be needed for the lure.,
Identify the troops that you'll use for anchor.",How to Lure Clan Castle (CC) Troops in a Clash of Clans Clan War," You would generally want to plan how to attack the enemy base in order to get the maximum 3 stars during clan war.;
, A circle around the clan castle will show its area of range. This means that any attacking troop reaching this area would trigger the troops inside the clan castle to come out.

, Look at the clan castle's area and check the enemy base's perimeter to determine the best location to drop your troop for the lure. This will depend on the base layout.


Some bases would have an easy lure which means that you can drop a single troop (barbarian or archer) and all the clan castle troops would be lure out.
Other base layouts would be considered as hard lure if the clan castle area is located in the middle of the base and you would need to destroy defensive structures and/or walls first before reaching it.

, This generally is a structure that is out of range from the enemy's defenses. Most bases would have structures on each corner so these would be ideal anchor points.


Click on the enemy's defensive structures near your chosen anchor point to check its area and make sure that your troop will be out of range from these defenses.
Another thing to consider is where you are planning to deploy your attack troops. You want to find an anchor point on the side of the base where you're planning to initiate the attack since you want to kill what's inside the clan castle and proceed with your attack seamlessly.

,


For bases with an easy lure, you can just drop a single barbarian or archer to get all the troops in the clan castle.
For hard-to-lure bases, you might need a couple of giants, hogs, or balloons depending on the number of defensive structures that would attack your troops before reaching the clan castle's area.
Be careful when using balloons for lure since troops that only target ground units (e.g. barbarians, balloons, valkyries, and lava hounds) won't come out even if your balloon is within the clan castle's range.

, In general, one archer would do the trick. Archer is a ranged unit so you can deploy it farther away from the anchor point and outside the range of defenses.


For hard-to-lure bases where all the structures are within range of defenses, you can opt to create an anchor point by destroying the defense that covers your anchor point first.
Use the least number of troops for lure and anchor since you want to maximize your troop count to destroy the entire base.

",How to Play Clash of Clans," First priority is to make your base more defensive so no one takes away your treasures. Focus on trying to put your town hall in the center of your base so that it is hard to take more trophies from you that come with taking down the town hall.;
, Good initial defenses are walls and the mortar. If you have these, you are much less likely to have someone raid you and steal your gold and elixir. Walls are much better upgraded so make sure you can do that quite quickly.Try to get the walls to level 3 as quick as possible.

, It is great if you can protect the town hall, gold storage(s) and elixir storage(s). Kick the builder huts and army buildings out. Also, do not try to put walls around everything. It's better to have double thick walls than one huge line.

, Do not waste them, especially your gems because they come in short supply. Do not spend your gems! Save them for another builder hut!


Use your gems to build builder's huts. It is tempting to them all right away, but don't. You will need your gems later.
In the tutorial, you are given 5 wizards to destroy the base. If you only use two, you will have the other 3 in your army camp already. This will let you have wizards at Town Hall 1, which you usually don't unlock until later in the game.
The most efficient way to spend gems is to invest in builders' huts as this enables you to upgrade multiple towers and other defenses at once.
Don't spend on extra gold or elixir storage at first, because you don't need it.

, You can buy more gems with real money.There are other ways of getting gems than spending money. So if you don't want to spend your money, not to worry. You can get gems when you remove trees and obstacles from the area around your base.

, Build a strong base to protect yourself from attackers. It is very satisfying to have enemies attack you and fail. Don't rush while upgrading. Upgrading certain areas more than others instead of them being consistent can cause problems, such as only upgrading town hall to have more storage you can't use.

, Many players agree that having most of your base concentrated in the middle is a good strategy.

, Place your storages and town hall in the center of your base, behind the defenses and walls.

, That way, when enemies attack the middle of your base, they won't have time to get to your huts as well.

, After you have gained resources, make your base even stronger by upgrading walls and other defenses and towers.

, Traps do a lot of damage to attacking enemies and are worth upgrading, the one time hit damage can easily take out groups of smaller troops and seriously hurt larger types too. Put them in sneaky places that people wouldn't expect.

, Eventually, you can aspire to other more advanced defenses like archer towers and anti aircraft defenses. Mortars do a lot of damage per shot but they shoot very slowly. Keep these in the center of your base because of their blind spot and their superb range. If you do not protect your air defenses your base will fall to healers.

, Attacking is all good. There is no downside and you can get valuable items and trophies. You may want to lose trophies to get resources from easier defenders. You will not get as much per raid but it's easier and you don't have to spend as much on your army. It is easier to steal resources than mine for them. And, it is fun!

, You can see how much gold each possible enemy base you can attack has. If it has none, don't bother attacking. If it has a very large amount, it may be too well defended for you to attack. However, if it has a large amount and you can take it ,do it. Take a few risks!

, Have your troops attack the storage areas for gold and elixir first.


After a successful attack, you will bring back more gold and elixir, which you can then spend.
If you are losing an attack, there is no shame in just pulling back your troops to your base. You can always train more troops later. Know when to quit.
When you attack a gold storage, the gold will go into your bank account immediately. Even if your troops are killed during the attack, the gold remains in your account.

,, To train, tap the barracks and you will see the train menu. The best ones to train at first are barbarians (for 25 elixir each) and giants (for 500 elixir each.)

, The laboratory lets you upgrade your troops so they have more offensive power and can sustain more damage. You can also get advanced kinds of troops such as archers, a wizard, and goblins. You can also build a spell factory after a while. This can create many spells that add different advantages to your attacks.

, By farming, put your town hall on the outside of your base, and your Storage on the inside. This way, attackers will only destroy your town hall for a 1 star and also, you will get a free 12 hour shield.

, Normally, when you attack, you will always find an inactive player (You can tell if they have full collectors and are not in a league) Once you find an inactive base, just drop goblins/archers on their collectors and then surrender (unless there is a town hall to snipe).

, Normally, people wouldn't want to spend real money on gems, but you can get gems/giftcards another way by using apps like FreeMyApps. You can get paid points by doing surveys, or downloading & playing FREE apps (does take about 2 months to get a 10$ app store gift card)

, Take it from the goblins in a singleplayer mission!

, No problem! Just find a base with at least 5000 Dark elixir and Lightning spell their dark elixir storage (or just any storage) Note: This is actually easier in Gold 2 and up.

, When you remove an obstacle, you are awarded anywhere from 0-6 Gems. The amount you receive is predetermined, and follows the pattern below, which repeats after reaching the end. This pattern cannot be changed, and will always repeat in the same order:


6, 0, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0

, Plants will reappear once every eight hours, allowing you to keep removing them for more Gems. They will not appear, however, if all of the space in your village is taken. The plant must also have an extra tile of space between it and any other object, meaning the surrounding 8 tiles will need to be empty as well.


Rocks do not come back, but plants do.

, You will earn an achievement for clearing obstacles from your village. After clearing five obstacles, you will earn five Gems. When you remove 50 obstacles, you will earn ten Gems. When you remove 500 obstacles, you will earn 20 Gems.

, Clash of Clans awards you achievements when you accomplish certain goals in the game, such as upgrading buildings, winning battles, and collecting gold. Completing these achievements earns you rewards, including gems. The more difficult achievements will earn you more gems.


When you open the Achievements screen, you will see your current progress towards available achievements. Prioritize your playtime to try to earn these achievements as quickly as possible.
Each achievement has three levels, with increased rewards for each level.
By completing all of the available achievements, you can earn up to 8,637 Gems.

, The most valuable achievements are earned through battle with other players. You can earn thousands of Gems by completing these achievements. Some of the more high-value achievements include:


Sweet Victory! - This achievement is earned by winning trophies in multiplayer battles. Winning 1,250 trophies will earn you 450 Gems.
Unbreakable - This achievement is earned by successfully defending against attackers. Defending against 1,000 attacks will earn you 100 Gems.

, There are a variety of achievements that aren't related to combat that can earn you some Gems as well. These don't pay out as handsomely as the combat achievements, but can be earned by upgrading your town. You can earn achievements by removing obstacles, upgrading the Town Hall, stealing Gold, unlocking units like the Archer and Dragon, and completing the Campaign.You can usually earn up to 20 Gems for completing these achievements.

, After completing an achievement, you'll see a Claim Reward button in the Achievements list. Tapping this button will reward you with the Gems for completing the achievement. You'll need to manually collect your rewards whenever you complete an achievement, or your rewards will just sit there.


There is no time limit for collecting your rewards, but there is also no benefit for letting them sit unclaimed. Make sure to check your list regularly to see if you've earned any new achievements to claim.

, When you start out on Clash of Clans, you're awarded 500 Gems. You're forced to spend 250 of them during the tutorial, leaving you with 250. Do not, under any circumstances, use these to speed up the build times of your village. Just wait out the timers, as you'll want these Gems later.


It is not possible to skip the tutorial and save the 250 Gems, but you spend them on a Builder's Hut which is essential to the game, so you're not really losing anything.
The tutorial will suggest that you spend Gems to speed up production. This is the developer's way of trying to get you to spend more real money on the game. Ignore these suggestions so that you can save the Gems instead.

, Clash of Clans allows you to buy other in-game resources with your Gems. Don't do this. While it can save you some time, you can earn all of these resources through playing the game., You'll be constantly reminded that you can speed up timers by spending Gems. This may be important during super-competitive play, but for most people it's just a Gem sink. If you're out of things to do and are tempted to spend Gems on a timer, just consider playing a different game for a while., Builder's Huts are the most useful buildings you can purchase because they give you more builder units. This allows you to construct other buildings much quicker. Your primary focus for your Gems should be obtaining these Builder's Huts. Once you have all five Builder's Huts, you can start spending Gems on other things.

, If you use an Android device, you can install the Google Opinion Rewards app from the Play Store. This app will send you the occasional marketing survey, and you'll be rewarded Google Play credit for completing them. You can then spend this free Play Store credit on Clash of Clans Gems. Most surveys only take a few seconds to complete, and award between $0.10 and $1.00.

This app is an official app developed by Google, and is safe to download and use.
The Google Opinion Rewards app is not available for iOS devices.

, If you aren't already signed in on your device with a Google account, you'll be prompted to sign in. Google accounts are free to create., You won't get many surveys unless you turn on location services. This is because many surveys are based on locations that you have recently visited.

Open the Settings app on your device and select ""Location.""
Ensure that ""Location"" is toggled on at the top of the screen.
Allow location access if prompted when opening the Google Opinion Rewards app.

, You may not have any surveys available immediately when you first start the app, but they should eventually start to appear. You'll get more surveys by visiting businesses and traveling a lot. The answers you give do not affect the value of the reward you will receive.

You'll receive a notification on your device when a new survey has become available.

, It may take a little while, but you'll likely amass a nice amount of Play Credit before you know it. Once you have enough to afford some Gems, open the Gem store in the game and buy a pack you can afford. Make sure your Google Play balance is selected as the payment method during the checkout process."

Use +2 Magic Beans.,
Stick to the grass.,
Make matches at the bottom of the board.,
Create special crop combos.,
Focus on the required cropsies.,
Use Boosters.",How to Fight Rancid the Racoon in Farm Heroes Saga," Launch your Farm Heroes Saga game, either from your Android/iOS device or from your Facebook account on a web browser. On the game map, select a level with a purple marker and a raccoon icon on it.;
, Magic Beans are a kind of in-game cash in Farm Heroes Saga, which you can gain by beating levels. When you begin a Rancid level, a screen will pop up displaying three difficulty levels: “Hard” (no bonus), “Medium” (+1 bonus for every match), and “Easy” (+2 bonus for every match). Medium and Easy levels cost Magic Beans to play.


Click/Tap the Magic Beans below the “Easy” level to begin playing that level. Each required cropsie in this level will have a +2 bonus, making it easier to beat Rancid.

, If the level has grass on the board, try to make matches on it as much as possible to bump up the value of your cropsies and do maximum damage to Rancid. Making matches here will also help trigger cascades.

, Making matches lower in the field enhances your chances of making a combo. This will also help you trigger cascades, which can make random matches that will ultimately help you gain more points, thus helping you to lower Rancid’s health bar.

, Another eminent way to increase your cropsie bonuses is by making four- or five-crop matches (straight, T-, or L-shape). This will spread additional bonuses on surrounding required cropsies, thus helping you lower Rancid’s health bar faster.


Matching four cropsies yields a +2 bonus on the crops located in a specific row or column where you’d otherwise get a +1 bonus.
Matching five cropsies removes all similar cropsies from the board, thus yielding you extra points. It will send orbs flying across the level, bestowing +1 bonuses to faraway required crops.
Making a T- or L-shaped match will produce light to shoot out in all the directions from the match, giving you a +1 bonus point to all required cropsies in that row and column.
The more points you score, the more damage you cause to Rancid.

, It is very normal to lose sight of your goal and just make all the matches you can in any Rancid level. However, you need to keep in mind that your moves are very limited, especially in a Rancid level, so concentrate on the required cropsies that will defeat him and help you to beat the level.


Focus especially on the required cropsies that have higher bonuses so that you can preserve your moves and lower Rancid’s health faster.

, Boosters should definitely be used in levels where you have less moves to make. It can make the difference between winning and failing a level. You get free boosters every 5 to 10 hours. Boosters can be found at the top right of the game screen. There are three kinds of boosters in Farm Heroes Saga.


Magic Shovel Booster: This allows you to remove one crop. You can use this booster when you only have a small number of moves left and you badly want to collect one cropsy to complete a level.
Bonus Reward Booster: Every required cropsy will get +1 bonus on the board on applying this booster. So when you need more points to win the game, apply this booster. It will give your score the boost it needs.
Tractor Booster: This booster will remove a full row of cropsies by driving over it.

, Double-check your goals before you start. You’ll find them at the left side, next to the board. The number of moves will be below the goals. Keep watch of your goals as you play the game. Also, check out the board if there are good matches to make.

, The best moves you can make is at the bottom row of the grass. This is where you can use the flowers and buckets to your advantage.


This will also help you trigger cascades, allowing you to gather enough suns, carrots, and water droplets to beat the game.

, Since you only need 2 chickens, try to get as many of the required cropsies first before attempting to hatch eggs for chickens.

, Once you’ve gotten enough cropsies, get started on hatching chickens. In order to get chickens, you need to match 3 eggs to make one broken egg, and then match 3 broken eggs to gather one chick.

, Boosters should definitely be used in levels where you have less amount of moves to make. It can make the difference between winning and failing a level. You get free boosters every 5 to 10 hours.

Go for the gold.",How to Get Big Loots in Clash of Clans," These two units will make up the bulk of your army. Barbarians draw the attention of defenders and take some damage, while archers hang back and destroy buildings from afar.


You're going to need around 90 archers and 60-80 barbarians;
, Goblins are great for getting loot, as they automatically target resource buildings from the start. They are also the fastest unit in the game. They don't have much health, so they'll need to be deployed behind your main troops if you want them to survive.

, These guys will let you get through tough walls much quicker, giving your troops more time to attack buildings before they succumb to defenders.

, Upgraded units will survive much longer in combat. Upgrading your units should be one of your early priorities so that you can increase your returns from battles.

, Split your training up between Barracks to create a well-rounded army as efficiently as possible.


In the first two Barracks, train 45 archers each to reach your 90 total.
In the second two Barracks, train 40 barbarians each to reach your 80 total.
Split your support troop training across all the Barracks.

, There are a lot of players who either left playing Clash of Clans or have not been playing it for a while. How can you tell which bases are inactive? You need to check the following things:


Check if the trophy icon is grayed or not. Trophy icon is located at the top left beside the player's name. If it is gray, then it means that player is inactive.
Deploy one archer in front of any resource collector, either gold or elixir. See how many you get from each hit. If you get anything above 500 in one hit, it means that player is inactive for quite a while.
If you get more than 1,000 from 1 single hit, it means that you have hit a jackpot. Don't leave this base.
If you see that all the workers in the builders hut are sleeping, then you can see that the player is not playing for a while.
If there are many bushes and trees, it's another sign of inactivity.

, Bases that have resource collectors and storages placed towards outside of the base are the best.


See where the gold storage is placed by pressing the gold storage icon.
See where the resource collectors are placed by pressing the collector icon.
Snipe the town Halls. This might sound weird, but you can get big loots from the snipes. If a base has 200-300k loot, and you are sure it's mostly in the storages, snipe the town hall; you can get at least 70k loot, which is decent for a town hall snipe.

, This will help you decide where you should place your troops. Your target will depend greatly on the layout of the base and its defenses.


If going for resource collectors, look for resource collectors that are placed outside the walls, stacked together, or outside of the range of defenders.
If you are going for storage, look for the easiest way to reach the storage buildings and for storages that are bunched together.

, Select the desired troop by tapping on the troop icon at the bottom. Deploy the troops at the enemy's base by tapping anywhere on the base. Do not deploy troops all at one place, or mortars will destroy them in one single hit.

, Identify the weakest sides of the base, or the closest locations to any storages or resource collectors, and deploy your barbarians. Once your barbarians have started taking fire from defenders, send in your archers to start attacking everything in sight.


Use your Wall Breaker to clear a path for your barbarians to pour through.

, After you have deployed your barbarians and archers, and a path has been cleared, send in your Goblins. They will make a beeline for the nearest resource buildings, so make sure you deploy them in a location that takes advantage of this.

, If resource collectors are placed outside the walls, hit them with your troops. If the enemy's defense is in the range and it killed your troops, deploy a stronger troop like a giant first so that it absorbs the damage done by defense and you can deploy attacking troops.

"
"
Try to do this at higher levels.,
Make sure that you have about the same level Town Halls in the war.,
Coordinate with the other clan leader to start your wars at the same time.,
Try again if you didn't get paired up.",How to Find a Player in Clash of Clans2," Because you're relying on luck to get matched with your friend, you'll have better luck at the higher levels. This is because there are less possible matches at the higher levels, and tons of possible matches at the lower levels. If you're trying to match up against a friendly clan, you may have to wait until you are both high level.There is no way to specifically choose which clan you are going to attack.

, When you're trying to get matched up against your friend's clan, make sure that both clan's Town Hall levels are fairly close to each other.


For example, Clan A may have four Level 10 Town Halls and three Level 9 Town Halls. Clan B may have four Level 10 Town Halls and five Level 9 Town Halls.
You'll have the most success if both clans have the same number of Town Halls at the same levels. Both clans should at least have the same number of the highest-level Town Halls.

, Both clan leaders should try to press the ""Start War"" button as close to the same time as possible. This will increase the chances that your clans will be matched against each other. You may have to coordinate over the phone or chat app to make sure you press at the same time.

, This process is based on timing and luck, so there's a good chance that it won't work right when you try. You'll just have to try again the next time your clan is ready for war.

Make matches in the grassy areas.,
Make matches at the bottom of the board.,
Make matches nearby required crops.,
Gain crop bonuses by making exceptional matches.,
Take advantage of Hero Mode.,
Concentrate on one area to enhance bonuses.",How to Gain Points in Farm Heroes Saga," If the level you’re playing has grassy areas, do matches on it because grassy areas double up the points for whatever you match.;
, Making matches lower in the field boosts your chances of making a combo. This will also help you trigger cascades, which can make random matches that will ultimately help you gain more points.

, If you ever run out of moves for the required cropsies, try to make moves next to those crops. This will add bonus points to the adjacent required crops.


For example, if you gather three onions and one of them has a +2 bonus point, this means you will not just collect three but five onions in just a single move, thus increasing your crop yield along with the bonus points.

, Another great way to increase your points and crop bonuses is through making four or five-crop matches simultaneously.


Matching four crops yields a +2 bonus on the crops located in a specific row or column where you’d otherwise get a +1 bonus.
Matching five crops removes all similar crops from the board, thus yielding you extra points. It will send orbs flying across the level, bestowing +1 bonuses to faraway required crops.
Making a T or L-shaped match (i.e., matching six crops) will produce light to shoot out in all the directions from the match, giving you a +1 bonus point to all cropsies in that row and column.

, If you complete the level goal within moves lower than the limit, you can use the moves left in Hero Mode, where all cropsies are randomly given extra points.


After every move during Hero Mode, several goal cropsies will be given bonus points. You’ll find the points at the bottom right of the cropsies. Look for those with higher points and make matches with them. This will give you higher points in the level and help you reach 3 stars.
Since Hero Mode is untimed, you can take your time to utilize the remaining moves to look for matches that have higher bonuses.

, Limiting your moves around one area will help you gain more points by awarding surrounding required cropsies with added bonus points than the crops on the rest of the board. The more you make matches in that area, the more points will be gained. Once the required cropsies in the area reach a good score (3, 4, or above), make a match with them.

, Each level will require you to collect a certain number of cropsies. Keep this in mind, so you won’t lose focus when blooming the flowers.

, Before you attack your level, know first where the flowers are located. You may not see them first because they aren’t in bloom yet. You can identify the flowers by the four leaves with a spiral on top.

, In order to collect a flower, three different matches need to be made right next to it. Look at the cropsies surrounding the flowers and plan your moves.


Remember your objectives or goals for the level.

, Identify a flower you want to collect. Choose a match you can make from the cropsies surrounding the flower that will also contribute to the goals of the level. Do not match cropsies that won’t count towards the goals, unless there’s no other option.


Swap cropsies to make your first match. The cropsies will be removed, and the flower will start to grow. You can now see the flower’s face.

, You don’t need to work on a flower on consecutive moves. You can make matches elsewhere, especially if you have better moves there.


Once you see that you can make matches from the cropsies surrounding the flower that will also contribute to the goals of the level, swap those to make your second match. The cropsies will be removed, and the flower will grow further. You can now see the flower smile.

, Swap cropsies from the cropsies surrounding the flower to make your third match. The cropsies will be removed, and the flower will fully bloom. The flower will be removed and added to your collection.

, Work on the other flowers on the board until you reach the target number of flowers to be collected. Don’t forget the other goals of the level too.

, Once you’ve finished level 275, level 276 of the game will be accessible for you to play. Tap on the level from the game map to open it.

, Double-check your goals before you start. You’ll find them at the left side, next to the board. The number of moves will be below the goals. Keep watch of your goals as you play the game. Also, check out the board if there are good matches to make.

, In Farm Heroes Saga level 276, the technique to beat Rancid is by gathering enough onions, strawberries, and water drops. As there are just four types of Cropsies on the game board, it’s very easy to make the correct matches. Emphasize making your match as big as you can (match of 4 or more). The bigger the match, the more damage you do to Rancid.

, Make matches near the grass as much as possible to bump up the value of your Cropsies and do maximum harm to Rancid. Making matches here will also help you trigger cascades, allowing you to gather enough onions, strawberries, and water drops to beat the game

, Boosters should definitely be used in levels where you have very less amount of moves to make. It can make the difference between winning and failing a level. You get free boosters every 5 to 10 hours. Boosters can be found at the top right of the game screen. There are three kinds of boosters in Farm Heroes Saga.


Magic Shovel Booster: This allows you to remove one crop. You can use this booster when you only have a small number of moves left and you badly want to collect one cropsy to complete a level.
Bonus Reward Booster: Every required cropsy will get +1 bonus on the board on applying this booster. So when you need more points to win the game, apply this booster. It will give your score the boost it needs.
Tractor Booster: This booster will remove a full row of cropsies by driving over it.

For Android and iOS, look for the game app on your home screen. Tap on it to launch the game.
On Facebook, on the News Feed page of your account, look for the Apps heading on the left panel. A list of your app’s will be showed here. Click the Farm Heroes Saga link to play the game.;

, Magic Beans are a kind of in-game currency in Farm Heroes Saga, which you can earn by winning levels. When you start a Rancid level, a screen will pop up displaying the three levels “Hard” (no bonus), “Medium” (+1 bonus for every match), and “Easy” (+2 bonus for every match). Medium and Easy levels cost Magic Beans to play.


Click the Magic Beans below the “Easy” level to start playing that level. Each carrot Cropsie in this level will have a +2 bonus, making it easier to beat Rancid.

, You may be able to figure out many unnecessary matches on the board, but the only thing that you’re required to focus on are the carrots, which can destroy Rancid in this level.


Unless really necessary, don’t spoil your limited moves on matching the Cropsies that are not required.

, Be careful of the rabbit that will frequently pop up and steal your carrots, thus making it difficult for you to reach your goal.


To stop the rabbit, make matches alongside of him. Doing so will paralyze the rabbit for a couple of moves.
You can also purchase some Shovel boosters (using magic beans) and use it to hit the rabbit on the head, which will stop him for a series of turns and halt him from taking your cropsies. It costs 250 magic beans to buy a Shovel.

, Boosters should certainly be utilized in levels where you have less number of moves to make. It can make the difference between winning and failing a level. You get free boosters after every 5 to 10 hours. Boosters can be found at the top right of the game screen. There are mainly three types of boosters in Farm Heroes Saga.


Tractor Booster: This booster will delete a full row of cropsies by driving over it.
Magic Shovel Booster: This allows you to eliminate one crop. You can use this booster when you only have less moves left and you only want to collect one Cropsie to complete a level.
Bonus Reward Booster: Every required cropsy will get +1 bonus on the board on utilizing this booster. So when you need enough points to win the game, utilize this booster. It will give your score the boost it requires.

Fast-forward the clock.",How to Beat Farm Heroes Saga Without Gold Bars," You are given five lives maximum at a time. The number of lives you have is indicated inside the heart icon on the top left part of the header. A countdown timer is displayed right beside it. It indicates the amount of time needed to replenish a life.;
, If you cannot wait, you have two options to resume playing. One is buying a full set of lives for 12 Gold Bars, and the other is to ask you friends. The latter option won’t cost you any money. The game is integrated with your Facebook account, and all your friends who play the game can be asked for lives.


Once you see the “No more lives” screen, tap or click the “Ask friends” button, and select the friends you want to ask lives from by ticking on their names. You can ask from only a few or from all of them.
Once you’ve selected friends, tap or click the “Send” button to trigger your request. Once your friends respond, you will get the lives they give you.

, It takes 15 minutes to replenish a life. If you’ve already used up all your five lives, you will have to wait 75 minutes to get your full set of five lives. Leave the game for a moment, and do some other stuff. When the required time has passed, you can resume playing with your new set of lives.

, You can trick the game into thinking that the required time has passed so that it will automatically replenish your lives. Go to your device’s clock settings, and set the time to something in the future or at least 75 minutes ahead. Once done, restart the game. Don’t forget to set your clock back to the correct time after doing so., Open Farm Heroes Saga online through Facebook or the Farm Heroes Saga app on your tablet or smartphone.

, You will be given rewards on a daily basis upon login. The daily rewards come as a seed garden, and this will appear on your first login of the day.

, To get your bonus, tap or click the “Collect” button. The rewards vary though. Most days, you may get Magic Beans in varying amounts. If you’re lucky, you’ll get boosters. If you got a booster, it will be added to your available boosters.

, Every 25 days, the Daily Bonus garden will be refreshed, so if you’re patient and collect each day, you may be able to collect boosters without spending a single gold bar.


Because the rate of getting boosters as bonuses can be low, use them wisely.

, Like most of King’s games, there will be some gates or roadblocks after a certain portion of levels. These gates or roadblocks prevent you from continuing with the next levels without first unlocking them. Continue playing the game until you reach such gates or roadblocks. The first one will appear at level 40.


Once you’re there, you will be given several options to proceed. There’s an option to pay your way with real money or with 9 Gold Bars, which will make it really easy and quick. However, if you don’t want to spend on the game, you may want to do some of the following steps.

, Since the game is linked to your Facebook account, you can ask your friends who play the game to help you out, similar to asking for lives. On the Roadblock screen, tap or click the “Ask friends” button. Select the friends you wish to request from, then tap or click the “Send” button. Select as many as you can so that you can unlock the next levels faster.

, If you don’t want to bug your friends, you can wait four days for the roadblock to get cleared automatically. Of course, this means you won’t be able to play for the next four days.

, You can do the same trick of cheating the clock. Go to your device’s clock settings and set the time to four or five days ahead. Once done, restart the game. The game will think the appropriate amount of time has passed, and the roadblock will get cleared.


Don’t forget to set your clock back to the correct time after doing so.

, A pre-game window will appear detailing the objectives to beat the level. Understand them. and click on the “Play” button. Depending on the level, you may be playing in three different game modes.


Refer to Parts 3, 4, and 5 to know more about playing in Rescue Mode, Classic Mode, and Score Mode, respectively.

, In Rescue Mode, the pets are usually stuck at the top of the columns of blocks. On the pre-game screen, you will be told how many pets you need to rescue and how many points you need to meet in order to beat the level.

, Once in the level, don’t go on attacking the board right away. Plan your moves. See how you can bring down the pets, and what you need to do to reach the required points. Don’t make any move that will leave a pet behind at the top of a column.

, Before making any move, visualize how the blocks, pets, and other items on the board will fall.

, In Rescue Mode, getting the pets to the ground is one of your priorities. Clear the paths by matching same-colored blocks from where the pets are to the ground. Take out the obstacles that may be present. Use the items and boosters available for you in the level.

, If the level provides you with a rechargeable rocket booster, use it when it’s all fueled up. Aim the rocket on a column with a hard-to-reach pet. Flying the rocket across the whole column can bring the pet to the ground in one swoop.

, Use the bombs properly. Bombs can make more impact when they’re on the ground, next to hard-to-remove blocks.

, Another priority in Rescue Mode is the score. Check your points regularly, and see how far off you are. Adjust your plan accordingly if you’re falling short of the goal.


Go for huge groups of same-colored blocks for some huge points. Use the multiplier blocks properly to get even more points. Simply bringing the pets to the ground may not complete the level just yet.

, You don’t have to use up any of your boosters unless you really need to. Don’t waste your boosters as they do cost real money to buy., In Classic Mode, there are no pets in play. Instead, you need to clear a certain percentage of blocks in order to beat the level.

, Before making any move, visualize how the blocks and other items on the board will fall.

, Match same-colored blocks to clear the blocks off the screen. Some obstacles also count towards the total number of blocks, so take them out as well. Use the items and boosters available for you in the level.


Save the rocket booster for last, as it can clear out one of the last remaining columns of blocks that won’t match. Clearing out these last few blocks can make or break your game.

, Use the bombs properly. Bombs can make more impact when they’re on the ground, next to hard-to-remove blocks.

, Most likely, levels in Classic Mode will require a minimum number of points, on top of the percentage of blocks cleared. Focus on getting huge points by combining huge groups of same-colored blocks on every move. Doing so will help you rank higher in your leaderboards.

, You don’t have to use up any of your boosters, unless you really need to. Don’t waste your boosters. They do cost real money to buy., In Score Mode, the main objective is to meet the target score within a limited number of moves. These levels may or may not have pets in play.


If there are pets in play, it’s likely that there will also be a required number of pets to rescue. Be clear on all the objectives to beat the level.

, Once in the level, don’t go on attacking the board right away. Plan your moves. See how you can bring groups of same-colored blocks together to make one big cluster. This is the best method to get high scores in the game.


Use multiplier blocks properly to multiply your points further.

, Before making any move, visualize how the blocks, pets, and other items on the board will fall.

, Focus on getting huge points by combining huge groups of same-colored blocks on every move. Use the items, and boosters to add to the points. Achieve the target score early so that your remaining moves can be used to add to the points.

, You don’t have to use up any of your boosters, unless you really need to. Don’t waste your boosters as they do cost real money to buy.

, If a level combines Score Mode and another mode, merge the plans and strategies listed in the appropriate parts above with the ones for Score Mode.


Refer to Part 3 if there are also pets to be rescued.
Refer to Part 4 if there’s a target number of points.

, You don’t have to use up any of your boosters, unless you really need to. Don’t waste your boosters as they will cost you real money.

, If a level combines Score Mode and another mode, merge the plans and strategies listed in the appropriate parts above with the ones for Score Mode.

, You won’t know how your board will look like after several moves. However, you have control over your first few moves. Plan them out properly to get the pets down early.

, If there’s no time limit on the level, take a good look at the whole board before each move. Don’t risk leaving any pet at the top of the columns.

, Get the blocks standing between the pets and the ground off the screen as soon as possible. Do this by matching the same-colored blocks underneath the pets. Remove any obstacles as necessary.


Use the items, like the keys and the bombs, on the board to make your work easier.

, Focus on getting the pets down as early as possible. This minimizes the risk of leaving any of them at the top of the columns.

, Attack the board evenly, taking out blocks from all columns as much as possible. Don’t focus on just one set of columns. If you do, you risk the screen going down faster, leaving some columns very tall.

, If for some reason you left a column or two very tall with only a few valid moves left, the board will shake. If you have pets at the top of these columns, you’re at risk of Pet Snatchers. Act quickly and save the pets; otherwise, your next move may be your last.

, If you have the rocket booster fueled up, use it. Take down the tall columns with pets on top. The rocket will fly over the whole column removing the blocks on it. The pets on the column will fall, safe from Pet Snatchers.

, Of course, you can’t forego the scoring requirement. Keep this at the back of your head. Get huge points by matching large groups of same-colored blocks. Otherwise, you may have saved the pets from Pet Snatchers, but you might still lose the level for not meeting the minimum score."

, Bring down the diamonds in glass cases to smash them and score 1,000 points per diamond. These add a lot to your score target.

, If your options are limited to make huge groups of same-colored blocks, go for the simpler ones and clear them out as well. One of the goals is to clear 85% of the blocks, so you need to clear out as much as possible.

, Smash the glass case that contains the key by bringing it to the ground. Use the key to break the locked blocks. These do count against the total number of blocks in play.

Maintain your trophy level.",How to Farm in Clash of Clans," Farming is a term in which the player changes her or his attributes of attacking and defending so that s/he is mostly focused on resources not trophies. It involves intentionally losing so that you drop down to lower levels, giving you the opportunity to attack weaker opponents. Since Clash of Clans has several systems in place to try to prevent farming, it requires manipulating some things in your favor.


Farming is based both on trophies and your Town Hall level. You receive penalties for attacking towns that are more than one level below your Town Hall, so you'll need to balance your level and your trophies. More on that later.;
, Before you start farming, you will want to ensure that your town is set up properly to both protect your resources and allow you to lose enough to drop down to the level you want to be at. There are several strategies to keep in mind when designing your town.


Protect your storage's. Since you are farming for resources, you don't want your spoils going to a lucky invader. Place your storage's in the center of your town, surrounded by several walls and various defensive buildings.
Place your Town Hall in your second layer of walls. This may seem like it will hurt, but that's the whole point. It gives you more room in your base for storage's. People will also attack you, and if you put it inside the walls, but not in the core, many attackers will go for the Town Hall, getting 30% which equals a free 13 hr shield. Putting your Town Hall in the corner is not good because a Town Hall is worth 2 storages now.
Do not put your storage's right next to each other. If you put them together, if the attackers get to your storage's, they have gotten to them all. By spreading them out, you reduce your overall loss of resources.
Place high-level resource collectors inside walls and leave the others outside. Keep checking the game after every 6 to 8 hours and collect the resources from the collectors.

, This achievement is awarded after you win a certain number of trophies from multiplayer battles, and gives you almost enough gems to purchase the third Builder's Hut. This is essential for keeping your town upgraded.

, This is widely considered to be the ideal range for farming, as it allows you to get significant amounts of resources without coming across enemies who are too powerful.If you have very good troops and a strong base you can climb up to 2000-2500 trophies because there you usually find more loot especially dark elixir.

, Your Town Hall level dictates the amount of loot you can get from raids on other towns. If you attack a Town Hall two levels below yours, you will only receive 50% of the loot, and even less for town hall levels lower than that. However, there is no bonus for attacking town hall levels above yours.


Max out the upgrades for each of your defensive buildings, army buildings, and walls before upgrading your Town Hall.
The best Town Hall level for farming is generally 5-7, but can definitely be applicable at the upper town hall levels as well.

, You want your army to constantly be reinforced, so that there is as little downtime as possible between attacks. With four barracks, you can have a large portion of your army restored by the time your first attack finishes.

, Opinions vary wildly about the best setup for your farming army, but generally you're going to want some combination of Goblins, Archers, Barbarians, Giants, and Wall breakers. The most common configuration is Barbarians and Archers (widely called ""Barch"") but you can sprinkle in wall breakers and giants if needed.


Giants are expensive, so only worry about adding a few.
Early levels should focus on Barbarian-heavy armies.
Later levels generally call for more Goblins than anything else, though some strategies call for more Archers.
As you increase your Town Hall Level, your maximum army size will increase, allowing for a greater unit variety, as well as a greater spell variety.

, Minions train very fast and don't cost very much, so they are great for quickly bolstering your forces. They can be very useful if you are trying to farm as quickly as possible, as you can quickly replenish your troops between battles. It becomes easier to use Minions more frequently at Town Hall 8 because you will have two Dark Elixir drills and be able to produce more Dark Elixir on a daily basis.

, When determining whether or not to attack a town, it will be helpful to know how much your army costs. Calculate the total costs of your attacking army, and then find 1/3 of that value (this will help you determine when it's time to retreat). You don't want your loot to be worth less than the troops you are losing., You will be much more successful when farming if you focus on a specific resource type instead of towns with a spread of resources. Having a spread of resources in your town also makes you a target for all other farmers.


Pay attention to the upgrades you need next and focus on that resource.

, Ideally, the town you target will have about 100k of the resource you want, and won't require a large army to take. You can also look for towns that have more resources and are poorly defended., These are the best targets you can find, as you can usually score large hauls for minimal effort.


If the town has gray league shields, then it has been inactive for at least the current season.
If the Builder's huts are ""sleeping"", the player is likely neglecting the base.
Look for round loot numbers. This usually indicates that the storage's are empty by the collectors are full, which means that they will be easy picking.

, Always keep the opposing town hall level in mind. You are penalized 10% for attacking a Town Hall one level below, and 50% for a Town Hall two levels below you. If you think you can get away with it, attack Town Halls with a higher level, as you get bonus rewards.

, These are typically the best for farming, as collectors are easier to raid than storage's. Make sure to only perform these raids when you find a town with full collectors.

, if you can't find towns with full collectors, you will need to run Storage Raids. Try to find towns where the layout is poorly optimized or where the storages aren't defended well so that you have enough time to destroy them and collect the loot.

, Send your troops in groups of five or so to minimize the effects of Mortars and Wizard Towers, which can wreak havoc on large groups.Use Giants as distractions since they can soak up lots of damage.
Avoid deploying Wall breakers if a mortar is incoming.

, Once the attack begins, you'll want to focus first and foremost on the loot. Destroy the collectors or the storage, depending on the raid. This usually puts your destruction rate at 30%.

, Spells can help turn the tide of battle, but they can be very expensive. Try to avoid spells if at all possible, or you may not make any profit on the attack.

, Use archers to destroy some of the unprotected buildings to boost your destruction rate up to about 50%. This will help you win some trophies so that you can maintain your trophy range., Try to stay within the 1,100-1,200 range at all times. If you start to go above 1,200, lose a few battles on purpose to lower yourself back down. If you go too high, you will have extreme difficulty finding viable targets for your farming efforts.


You can forfeit battles after gaining the resources you need to ensure that you don't get too high of a rating.

, If you can’t find the pets when you started this level, it’s because all of them are locked up in cages. Unlock the pets as soon as you have a chance so you can work on getting them down.


Unlocked pets will go up to the top of the column, so it will be a waste to get a caged pet to the bottom and have to bring them back down again after they’re freed.

Drop in all the Wall-breakers to make the way for the Golems.,
Immediately, drop some of your Wizards to clear the outer buildings.,
Quickly, drop in all the remaining Wizards, P.E.K.K.A.s and Barbarian King.,
Drop Rage and Heal spells.",How to Do Gowipe for TH8 in Clash of Clans," Gowipe mainly constitutes of 3 main troops i.e. Golem, Wizards and P.E.K.K.A. The number of troops needed must be chosen wisely as it totally depends on the strength of the base.Golems range between 2 or 3 in Town Hall 8. The number of Golems is directly proportional to the strength of the base.
Wizards are usually taken 18-21 in numbers. If the base is very large or has a lot of compartments, you may take more than 20 wizards for the attack.
P.E.K.K.A.s are mostly used for soaking up the defenses so 2 or 3 units are adequate for this composition.
Wall breakers play an important role in speeding up the attack. Take 8 to 10 units for breaking at least 2 layers of walls.
Take a Giant and fill the remaining space with archers. These two troops play a crucial role in killing the Clan Castle troops.;
, Spells play a significant role in this attack. For Town Hall 8, a combination of heal and rage spells are used for speeding the attack keeping in mind that troops must last for long. Poison spell must also be taken to kill or weaken the Clan Castle troops or skeletons., As stated earlier, Gowipe can easily get 2 stars on your Town Hall or one level above you but the base selection must be ideal as Golem is a slow troop but can handle a lot of damage.


Make sure that the base is not very large as Golem might run out of time to destroy all the defensive structures.
Check if the base has a lot of spaces between buildings. Avoid such bases as spring traps might take away a lot of wizards, thus making the attack very slow.

, Drop an archer to the area which comes under the range of the Clan Castle, drop another archer away from the range of all the defenses to bring all the Clan Castle units to a spot such that all units are near to each other.


In case, the Wizards and Archers come out, drop a poison spell to wipe them out. A level one poison spell is enough to take down the max level Wizards and Archers.
If a troop with high hitpoints like Dragon or Balloons comes out, from a giant to distract the troops and then scatter 4 to 5 wizards along with archers to kill them within the first 30 seconds of the attack.
If Lava Hounds come out, drop a Golem and then scatter 5 to 6 Wizards along with Archers to disintegrate it into Lava Pups, they won't cause much damage and would be killed by the wizards later.

, If you are carrying 2 Golems, make sure that you drop them 10 to 11 tiles away from each other. Else, if you are carrying 3 Golems, drop them 5 to 6 tiles away from each other. Make sure that they don't target the same defense., Golems can become very fragile if they are left to deal with walls for a long time. Make sure that the Wall-breakers aren't killed by the splash damage defenses like Wizards and Mortars.

, Make sure that you have at least 12 or 13 wizards remaining for leading them inside the base.

, P.E.K.K.A.s and Barbarian King are fond of going around the base, make sure no outer building remains for them., Always get the best out of your Heal spells, drop them such that they cover maximum troops. Rage them when the troops are near the Town Hall.

Match large groups of blocks.,
Use the balloons.",How to Beat Level 145 in Pet Rescue Saga," You only have 40 moves to work with, and in that time you have to get to the key at the top of the stack of caged blocks. Focus your attention on the bottom center of the board, around the caged blocks,which can only be removed after you break the cages that are trapping the blocks inside. You have to deal with the caged blocks one at a time, and there are three ways to break the cages without boosters:Make matches around the caged blocks.
Match blocks beneath them so the cages fall.
Use a bomb.;
, If you’re having trouble breaking the caged blocks, you can try a booster. Either select the boosters you want to use before starting the round, or wait and see if a useful one pops up for you to use throughout the game.


The column blaster booster (the rocket) will clear a column of blocks and cages.A line blaster booster (the red spring) will clear a full row of blocks, cages, and pet carriers.A mesh mash booster (the wire cutters) gets rid of the cages around the blocks and turns them into normal blocks., As you break the cages around the blocks and remove those blocks, the key will work its way down. When you get the key to the bottom and free it, this will break the chains on the stone boxes the animals are on, which will allow you to proceed with rescuing the pets., Once you have retrieved the key and freed the animals from the locked stone boxes, the objective is to get them to the bottom of the screen by removing blocks around and below them. Once they get to the bottom, they are safe., Each safe pet is worth 1,000 points, which will get you part of the way to your 23,000-point goal.

, When you match and remove larger groupings of blocks at a time, you get more points. Anytime you spot a big group of blocks that are all the same color, go ahead and take those down!This will also charge up your column blaster booster, and when that’s ready to use you can gain even more points.

, The balloons are like color bombs, and activating a balloon of one color will destroy all the blocks on the board in that color. Time your balloon use to destroy large chunks of blocks at a time and score big points with a single move.Don’t waste a balloon if there aren’t many blocks of the corresponding color on the board.

Decide which type of base you want to have.,
Decide what you want to make your layout.,
Keep splash damage buildings close to the center.,
Centralize any buildings in your ""normal"" category, including archer towers and cannons.,
Follow your gut with your traps.,
Use ""double-walling"".,
Build a ""troll base"".,
Use funneling.,
Use wall-breaker sniping.",How to Design an Effective Base in Clash of Clans," There are three main types of bases: Farming, Trophy, and Hybrid.


A farming base is a type of base mostly active when you farm. The main idea of this base is to leave your town hall away outside your walls. You may lose some trophies. Don't worry, because you will rewarded with a 12 hours shield during which no one can attack your village! You also generally keep your storages and possibly your collectors inside your walls.
A trophy base is one in which you put your town hall inside your base, and your trophies are the most important thing to you. It is just the opposite of the farming base. You will risk losing your resources.
A hybrid base is one where it defends your trophies and resources equally.;
, Some popular base designs are:


An egg-shell base is where the base is surrounded with multiple walls. For example one core surrounded by walls, with an outer layer of walls surrounding less important buildings.
A compartment base is where all of the most important buildings have their own compartment, and less important buildings go outside the base. These form an extra ""building wall.""
A bulkhead base is kind of like the Titanic. The idea is that there is multiple compartments, so if your enemies flood one section, the others will support it. It is sort of a mix between an egg-shell and a compartment base.
A modified compartment base is where your compartments hold 2-3 buildings instead of each compartment holding only one.

, These are some of the most important buildings to keep close to the center of your base. The mortars especially are important, because of their huge range and weak zone. The wizard towers give you a bit more leniency, because they have a smaller range and no weak spot.

, The best thing to do with is make sure they offer each other coverage. This way, if one tower is being attacked, the others are taking out of the attackers. Also in this category is the air defense. You want to centralize these, because if they get destroyed, your base is easy picking for dragons.

, They're some of the most versatile buildings in the game. They can be used for several techniques, including funneling and wall-breaker sniping (see part three). Basically, have fun with them. If you want to make a troll base, make one. Just do what you want.

, This is where you put one wall layer, then a space, and then another wall. This way, archers can't shoot over the wall.

, This is where you place a ""accidental"" hole in the middle of your base, and load it with traps. You also surround it with good defensive buildings, so inexperienced players will put down loads of troops then get them blown up.

, This is where you make an ""accidental"" hole in your wall, so troops will go inside there and get blown sky-high by the traps you set.

, This is where you put a wall with broken spots in it, and put spring traps in that hole. That way, the wall-breakers will get sprung into the sky instead of breaking your wall.

Drop your golems spaced away from each other.,
When the defences are targeting your golems, quickly drop your wallbreakers.,

Drop your royal witches last but not least.,
Drop your spells and heroes only if you need them as this composition already can give you a 2 star.",How to Do Gowiwi in Clash of Clans," Note that you should have two golems already trained up in your army camps.;
, Remember to at least have 5 when attacking. But be careful of your wallbreaker placement as splash damage can kill your wallbreakers in one or two shots., After a few seconds, drop your skeleton wallbreakers. Have at least seventeen wizards so that you can have high damage, which is key to this composition.

, It's always good to have five witches altogether, two from your clan castle and three from your own dark barracks., If you want spells, use jump spells and rages.

, Click Yes.

, This is known as Preparation Day. You can organize your base, view enemies, and offer advice on clanmates' bases.

, You only have one day to do it, so choose wisely.


Remember, in a clan war, all you're out for is to crush the opponent's base and get as many stars as possible. As such, resources and storages shouldn't be protected by walls. Rather, keep them close to the outside of your base, with defenses such as Archer Towers or Mortars to protect them.
Enemies still get loot if when they destroy storages and resources, and getting loot from bases is the secondary goal of attackers. If you are a farming type player, keep your resources and storages inside your walls, and put utilities such as Builder Huts, Barracks, Spell Factory, and Army Camps outside your walls.
Keep your Clan Castle near your base. If your clanmates donate to you, the troops inside can help defend a siege against your village.

, Look at bases and decide where, when, and how you can your troops.


Remember, your primary goal is to get lots of stars. The best place to deploy is in range of the Town Hall, which is an easy star if destroyed.

, The clan war isn't all about you; your clanmates matter as well.


If you see their Town Hall out in the open, let them know, and remind them you don't want a farming type base in the war.

, Chances are they know quite a bit about organizing your base and attacking enemy players.

, Not only can donated troops defend your village, they can also be used in attacks.

, Not all of them are useful.


Use Barbarian Kings and Archer Queens if you have them.
Wizards are one the best troops for wartime. They deal heavy damage to buildings, but they are slightly weak. Use Healers to back them up.
Archers are also extremely useful, especially when leveled up, because they can shoot things from afar, whereas other troops, such as Barbarians, have to get close up to destroy things. We recommend using high level Giants to soak up damage and destroy defenses and deploying the Archers behind them.
P.E.K.K.A.S: They work best when used with another unit of their own strength. Barbarian Kings, high level Giants, and Golems all work great alongside this fearsome foe. Using a Rage Potion to boost its power makes P.E.K.K.A. virtually unbeatable.
Troops such as Lava Hounds, Barbarians, Minions, and Balloons aren't very effective unless you have a brilliant strategy for them.

, As mentioned above, Rage Potions and P.E.K.K.A. mix nicely, but there are also lots of other awesome combinations.


Use a Healing Potion on a Healer healing strong troops. This can literally turn the tide of the battle.
Jumping Potions are extremely useful when mixed with Barbarians. As you might already know, Barbarians have a tendency to destroy anything closest to them and not care about any defenses hurting them (not until it's too late rather). A Jumping Potion can redirect their attention to defenses, and with a swarm of them mixed with a few Archers, it can be devastating.
Use Frost Potions on defenses that are really damaging your troops.

, You never know when there are triple bombs or giants bombs, so sprinkling allows at least some of the wizards to survive.

, Only drop rages when your giants are stuck on a wall or when your wizards are targeting the Town Hall. Heal spells are recommended because wizard towers are deadly to giants.


Note: Any other spells are not recommended.







, Heroes are not recommended for use because the giant and wizards will give you at least 2 stars but if you really want to use them, drop heroes when it's the correct time.

, If you have heroes that are 5 and up, activate their abilities.

Upgrade your defenses and traps.,
Upgrade your troops and spells as much as possible.,
Upgrade army camps, barracks, and your Clan Castle.",How to Ascend the Leagues of Clash of Clans1,"


Build every building available to your Town Hall Level.
Try to upgrade every building as much as possible before upgrading the Town Hall.
Although more builder's huts are important, they are not as necessary for your overall defensive strength.
Try to find or make a good base design.;
, This requires elixir or dark elixir. Upgrades for troops are available through the Laboratory (Town Hall 3 and higher). Focus especially on units that you use.


Upgrading troops that you rarely/never use are not as important, but would be good to upgrade since your attack style may change.

, Rebuild the broken building with 40,000 gold. This may seem a lot at the beginning of the game, but eventually it seems like nothing. This is possible at Town Hall 3 or above.


Upgrade army camps for larger attacks.
Upgrade barracks to be able to make more units ahead of time.
Upgrading barracks also allows more storing/banking elixir in the building.
This is done when you have a full army camp and you make more troops; the unit should say stopped and exclamation marks appear above the building. You can refund the elixir by tapping the red minus box for the troops.
You must cancel troops before donating or attacking; otherwise they will fill the empty spots.

"
"
Find an attack suitable to your skill, Town Hall level, and needs.,
Watch replays, both defensive and offensive.",How to Ascend the Leagues of Clash of Clans2," Some players are better at hit an run attacks (quick and cheap to make). Some players are better at large scale attacks (slow to make but powerful).


Have a goal before attacking: gold, elixir, and dark elixir.
Go for targets that have enough of the resource you want, and the resource that is easy enough for you to get.
Don't just go for the ones with a lot of loot available; it needs to be within your power to get them.
Accept failure. Learn from mistakes to improve your strategy (this will also help make you better for war).

, Notice where things went right or wrong. Watch other people's attacks; notice their army composition.

"
"
Lose on purpose defensively.,
Lose on purpose offensively.",How to Ascend the Leagues of Clash of Clans3," This is more effective for the higher Town Hall levels (not recommended below Town Hall 5). It is especially helpful for Town Hall 7 and up. While some players do this for easier targets, you can do it to avoid losing resources.


Put your town hall to the very corner and storages into the center, protected.
The goal of this is to have people snipe your Town Hall, give you a 12 hour shield, thus protecting your from massive attacks.
At higher Town hall levels, losing a few thousand in gold and elixir is basically nothing, especially compared to what you will earn by collectors in 12 hours.
You can easily earn your trophies back when you decide to stop farming.
By having lower trophy count, there will be weaker enemies to attack you, which means that it is less likely to lose a lot of resources, making it easier to have a lot to use for upgrading.

, This can help you go lower in trophy count and farm faster.


Do not do this if you have a big shield.
If you have a barb king and/or archer queen, just use one of them, and exit battle.
If you do not have one of the heroes, just use a single small troop, like a barbarian.
The other player will feel happy and might attack you back, just to take your Town Hall, giving you a 12 hour shield to just relax and collect.

, Make a general plan of what you are going to upgrade, how you will get the resources, and when you will do them. Stick to the goal.


Ask clan-mates their thoughts on it, and be willing to change your plan if they offer a better one

Be patient.",How to Run a Successful Clan in Clash of Clans," It isn't advised that you start a new clan unless you're already fairly advanced, level 70 or so. If you aren't, almost no one will want to join, and you might be hassled and made fun of. This is an unfortunate part of that community, but you can get around the cyberbullying by joining another clan to get started and build your status. Once you've learned the ropes and become a fairly skilled player, start your own clan and plot your domination and execute it.


One rule of thumb is that a clan should be created at Town Hall level 7 or 8. This is because if you are a clan leader, you must look powerful with your defenses, displaying large stores of mortars and other supplies. In Town Hall level 7 and 8, a lot of new things like Barbarian King are unlocked, making you more powerful, and a more attractive leader.;
, There are three basic types of clans — Hardcore, Farming, and Casual clans. Planning your clan and attracting members for your new clan will be much easier if you have some plan for how you'll run things and your general strategy.


A Hardcore clan, better known as a Trophy Pushing clan, is constructed around the idea of constantly warring. They mostly always have wars that go from back to back, and usually never stop, so be prepared to invest precious time.
Farming clans are basically the opposite of hardcore. Farming clans rarely have wars and ""just like the name suggests"" they farm. The only point in joining a farming clan is to get high-level troops for your farming.
A Casual or a Hybrid clan is basically just a combination of the two, warring usually but not always and, farming a lot on your off time.

, In order to get new members in your clan, you should come up with a clan name which will attract people and make them want to join yours above all others, when new members are searching for clans to join. Unique clan names will be the only name that comes up when someone's searching for a specific term, making it critical that you avoid cliches or common types of clan names.


Try to come up with something fresh and exciting, and avoid boring clan names like ""The Clash Clan"" or ""The Great Clan"" or ""We Do War."" No thanks.
Look at the most popular clan names and come up with very different types of names, names that sound like rad raider clans from the Viking days. Try out something awesome and specific, like ""Witchsmoke"" or ""Dragon Eye."" ""Green Valkyrie""? Now you're talking.

, Try to give a symbol that goes with the clan name. For example, if your clan name is Fireworks Ahead, give a red background and orange strips. Be sure that your symbol is memorable and striking so that people will recognize it in an instant. A great symbol can do a lot to attract new members and strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.

, Take a while to write up a friendly bio of your clan, one that states what you clan is about. For example, if you want to be a trophy hunting clan put that in your bio. If you want to start a friendly or a farming clan, put that in your bio. There should be enough of substance in your description that prospective members will have something to grab onto, but not so long and involved that you might turn off casual members.


Some players elect to include their clan rules in the description, while others choose to make that available later with individual clan members. Whatever you choose to do, it's up to you. You're the leader!

, At first, it'll seem hard to find enough new members to make it worth your while, but patience and persistence will pay off in the long run. The best way to seed your new clan with members is to set the clan to ""Anyone Can Join,"" to allow people to drift in and become members without vetting them first. You'll end up with a lot of scrubs, but you can always kick them out later.


It's likely you will remain with around five or ten members for a while, depending on your rank. The higher you are in rank, the easier it will be to get people to join. If you're having trouble gaining members, be patient and gather players slowly by leveling up until you reach 20, which tends to be a breakthrough point. Many people will start to join and you will soon have a clan of 50 or more.

, Once you've got a good base to start with, you can change the settings and start picking stronger players that will improve your clan. Make sure they have moderately strong bases and a sufficient amount of points. If you let anyone in, the member limit will be reached and you'll find that your clan doesn't have very good ranking. Its better to start with a good foundation as a small alliance with good players, rather than a full alliance with all new players who just wanted a clan to be in.


Some players like to start out by offering free elder status for the first few, while others look on this as a bad way of doing business. This tends to attract ""hoppers,"" or players who only stick around for a short while and become inactive. It's better to accept and promote only strong players who'll improve your clan, not abandon it.

, You will find many players there who are not a member of a clan yet. Invite them, and also tell them to join your clan, spelling out your goals for your clan and advertising the benefits of joining.


Invite players from your trophy league, as many as possible to give your clan the biggest and best start the that you can. You can also invite your real-life friends to join up and join your clan before branching out on their own, if necessary. It can be fun to war with your buddies.
Try to not recruit clan hoppers or people that will just negatively impact your clan, unless you're really desperate for members. Lots of people in global chat will want the status of Elder or Co-Leader in your clan, which can make the game less fun for you when they start abusing their power.

, It's common to shout-out your clan on YouTube comments streams, message boards, and other types of chats to attract attention and gather new members into the fold. If you're the leader, it's your job to advertise and to gather new members. You might even consider making it a rule that every new member has to post in several places to keep the word about your clan spreading and keep new members joining on a regular basis.

, Clash of Clans should be fun, and if you're going to all the trouble of starting your own clan, you want to make sure that it's populated with fun players who are good at the game, not a bunch of trolling noobs who're going to bring everybody else down. If anyone bugs other members, is inconsistent, or breaks the rules, kick them out of the clan.

, It doesn't matter if he/she is a TH4 or a TH9, your first priority should be to find a loyal clan mate., Rules are very important in clans to help keep everyone on the same page and give yourself concrete reasons for kicking out the bad seeds. Give a warning that anyone who breaks any rules will be kicked out, then follow up on your punishments if it comes to that. Letting it slide once will ensure that it'll happen again in the future. You've got to rule with an iron fist.


Make sure your rules can be enforced and are specific. Saying that you'll kick out anyone who's ""lazy"" is hard to understand, and can undermine your authority if one person defines laziness differently than another. Be specific in your rules and your warnings.
Common rules include rules against cursing, rules that everyone needs to use both attacks, and rules that everyone should participate at certain times to make clan wars a success.

, Good clans all have one thing in common: strong defensive networks. Set up a defense first, and make sure to keep the storage stuff well defended. Mortars must stay near the town hall and cannons outside those. Only attack someone you know you can handle. Single-player missions are not worth the money you'll spend to beat the money.


Place weapons and walls around your most valuable property. You can also place a wall around your base to help if other people attack you. You can place army camps, barracks, and builder huts around your defenses, taking time to upgrade continually.

, It's important to promote players occasionally, or people may become bored by playing with your clan and would rather be a part of a group with more responsibilities. Promote your members to elders if they are active and honest, and have been to your clan for a month at least. Promote them to co-leaders if they are trustful, or if you know the person in real life. Give all the promoted members some tasks.


Don't give out free promotions, unless you're really desperate for new members. Some trolls like to join clans, become co-leader, then kick everyone out. No fun. Only promote people you know in real life as co-leaders to lower the risk of a coup.
Kick out inactive players. Members who are not active, not participating in at least 2 or 3 wars in a row, and not donating, kick them out.

, Ask your members to donate a minimum of certain number troops in a week and donate the same amount to fulfill the clan's aspiration.

, The most important thing about being leader of a clan is managing the clan wars appropriately. If your clan gets smashed, many members will leave and find another clan. There's nothing more fun than beating the other clan by so much that you can tell your clan to go for loot, giving all your members as much as a 600k loot bonus.


Communicate effectively to plan together before the war, telling your clan to ensure they use both attacks, and other more specific strategic plans.

, Be friendly and discuss with them about clan rules and also about other topics, such as sports. Ask everyone to get a messaging app, such a GroupMe, to allow everyone to talk about clan wars without having to go through the chat log-in game. This can be an effective leadership tool.


Make sure you listen to your clans input as well, especially the elders. Try to come to a consensus whenever possible, but don't forget that it's your job to make the ultimate decision, if necessary.

, You're going to lose members quickly if you don't practice what you preach. If you've got a rule against cursing and start dropping f-bombs, you're going to have a revolt on your hands. Show up at the appropriate times, do what you say you're going to do, and follow the rules that you create to cast yourself as a good leader.

, Some players have a strict rule against promoting co-leaders, choosing to take sole control of the clan. This eliminates the possibility of coups, in which someone takes over your clan and kicks everyone out to start over. Alternatively, some players think it's an effective command strategy to gather a base of as many as three or four co-leaders that you trust and that are within 10 levels of you.


If you do choose to promote players to co-leader, make sure they've played with you for a long period of time and have donated a sufficient number of troops to the clan. Write this into the rules so everyone can be clear on how promotions work.

, In order to keep your clan alive, you must be active. Try to play every day and check your clan properly.


Offer constructive feedback. After warns, replay some unsuccessful raids and try to tell your members how they could have done better. For example, if someone used an all P.E.K.K.A. army, tell them to try an all dragon army next time because it will be more effective.

, Your clan won't immediately start raiding other clans and rise to dominance in the first fifteen minutes of playing. You've got to prepare for the long haul and wait while you slowly gain new members. Give your new clan time and focus on building an effective defensive network and in gaining new members of the clan before you rush into things. It's fun to go starting wars, but not until you've got an effective base built up, and enough clan members to make it worthwhile.


Don't rush the town hall. Beginning players have a tendency to rush the town hall building project, which can end up getting everything off on the wrong foot. Instead, max out everything in the store, and then you can upgrade your town hall.

Launch the game on Facebook. Open your Facebook account on your PC web browser. You’ll find a panel on the left. Scroll through it until you see the Apps section. This section contains the apps on Facebook that you use and are linked to your account. Click on Bubble Witch Saga from this list. The app will load within Facebook. Select the level you want to play and click on it.
Launch the game’s mobile app. Look for the Bubble Witch Saga app on your mobile device, and tap on it to launch it. Select the level you want to play, and tap on it.;
, Get to know the current level and get an idea how deep or how many bubbles you need to go through to clear the level. Know also the points needed to get at least one star.


If you don’t get at least one star even if you clear the level, you will lose.

, Start playing the game by shooting the colored bubbles. Bubbles are cleared when you hit your bubbles to the same-colored bubbles up top.

, Each level’s requirements for the number of stars vary, so you have to know how much you need per level. The point requirements for one, two, and three stars are indicated on a score bar beside the main scoreboard. You will be able to see your progress here, with every star earned clearly visible beside it., The bubbles you shoot follow the path indicated by the dotted line. You will know where your bubble will land by observing the direction of the dotted line. You can also bounce the bubble off the walls to reach those hard-to-reach spaces.

, If you can, go for the gaps and aim higher. If you’re able to clear out higher bubbles, the lower bubbles attached to them will fall off and bounce towards the jars at the bottom, giving you extra points.

, Do not settle with just clearing out a few bubbles. Go for huge combos by clearing out a huge collection of same-colored bubbles with one shot. You can also get some chain reactions. You will be able to clear out the level faster and get huge points with that.

, Towards the bottom, right on top of the jars, you can find some colored spiders. These spiders give you score multipliers. If you have some bubbles that can fall off, get them to hit these spiders to give you more points.

, These are the game boosters. Use these sparingly as they can cost you real money. Use these only as a last resort and when you’re confident that you can complete the level. Otherwise, it will be wiser to just restart the game.

Be sure you have plenty of shards to donate and use for the guild, and that your max gold capacity is 500000, as creating a guild will cost that amount of gold.;
, Join a different guild and gain some experience about it.


See how many vice leaders there are and how strong they are. You will need these tips on how to promote your members - one vice leader could kick out a lot of people in the guild, and before you can kick them out, they would have left and you would have no members left in your guild.
Check then guild's ranking. There is an event called a torch battle in a guild where you haul torches from other guilds to earn shards and Honer Badges. If the ranking is in the top 3000, the guild will be able to do torch battles. If not, they will not be able to do torch battles. Boss battles are for every single guild. Learn tips on how to get your guild ranking up.
View the other members' bases. Check if they are strong. Keep in mind these tips if your members are vice leader, since vice leaders need to be strong. Vice leaders have the privilege to kick out lower ranking members, and one low level vice leader could possibly kick out all the powerful members. You wouldn't want that.

, In order for members to want to join your guild, you need to be a strong leader in order to gain their trust. Some people don't want to join a guild with a low level leader. Upgrade your Town Hall whenever possible, have upgraded defenses and walls, as well as your heroes and other buildings.

, Shards are used to activate boss battles, send out guild invites, and improving your guild. Shards can be donated to transform into credits in the guild. The credits are what are used for these things.

, Have enough might to at least have unlocked Lost Realm or Wretched Gorge, which takes 10000-20000 might. This will make you look like a strong leader. Upgrade your base equally however.

, Tap the tab that says Create Guild. Be sure you have enough gold, at least 500000, to be able to create your guild.

, They usually would want to join a guild that has a cool name, with no spelling mistakes, or any other mistakes in them. Don't choose something like The Killers, or The Guild Clashers. People wouldn't be intrigued in that. Consider something that sounds like you are powerful, but be nice, like Skyhigh Warriors or Night Killers.

, Select a badge that would match your Guild's name. For example, if your Guild's name is Phoenix Power, choose a badge that looks like fire or the flames from a Phoenix. If it is something like Night Killers, choose a badge that looks dark like it is at night. Have a badge that seems as if you mean what your Guild name is.

, Good might requirements can be 1000, 5000, or even 10000 might. Be sure you have the same amount of might that your requirement is. If you have 5000 might and the requirement is 10000 might, it wouldn't make sense. Soon, once you have more might, you will be able to change the might requirement to get stronger members. Change the might requirement at least 5000 more might up every time you and a few other members have moved up.

, Mainly type in how many shards your guild members should donate each day, week, etc. You should also type in when boss battles will start each day or week. Put the server time since there may be people who join your guild that live around countries that have different times in them. If there is enough space in the description box, you can list things like no cussing or info about promotions. You can also just type in a friendly summary about how your guild will be like.

, Once you type in the name of the guild, you cannot change it. You can only change the badge, might requirements, and the description. Fix spelling mistakes to make a good impression on members who join, as well as mistakes in the description.

,, You will need to start it off first.

, A good amount of shards to donate would be 500-1000. Don't waste all your shards on your guild though. this will convert into credits, which will let you gain more members at first and let you do boss battles once you have a certain amount of members.

, Be careful of who you accept into your guild. As soon as you invite people, most clashers will see your invite and apply if they meet the requirements.

, There should be a number on there - that is the number of people that applied. Tap on a member (not apply or reject yet) and view their base. Be sure the base is settled in one area, the Town Hall and loot is protected, and other defenses are protecting the base. Their heroes should be a high level as well.


Accept members with legendary heroes only. These people will do better in boss battles and are stronger for the guild. If they have at least 2-3 good legendaries, they can also be accepted.
Choose members that apply with high level might. People that join should have might that is a bit farther than the requirements. Accept any of those clashers.

, This will make them want to stay in the guild. Discuss how they can become more powerful, how to improve their base, and other topics in everyday life as well. You don;t want to bore them with stuff about Castle Clash only - talk about other things and events that are happening in your life. Don't reveal any personal information though.

, The maximum number of members for your guild is 50. However, if you want to level up your guild, it can have 55 members instead. Ask others to recruit members and donate shards so you have enough to invite members. It costs 60 credits to send out a guild invite.

, Be sure they stay strong and have donated a good amount of shards. They should have donated at least 100. If they haven't been active or donated for a few days or at least a week, demote or kick them out.

, There are all kinds of ranks such as Elite, Soldier, Vice Leader, etc. A bad vice leader could easily take over the whole guild by kicking everyone out. It doesn't happen much, but you never know if it could. To promote a vice Leader, create requirements for people to become one, such as having donated at least 300 shards, are active, and fight in boss battles.


If a person is really trying to become one, wait a few days and see if you trust them since they may actually be plotting to take over the guild. They may trick you however.

, This way, you can defeat the boss and get honer badges and merits. Start a boss battle by spending 50 credits. Let everyone know and they should start fighting it. If you can defeat the boss in one battle, do only a few million damage to let others have a chance to kill it.

, Torch Battles are where you haul torches from other guilds to earn shards and honer badges. Make sure others are participating in them as well, as this can be a difficult event and you can possibly get no shards or HB if no one participates. Let them all know about the torch battle in guild chat.

, If you kick out members just for the fun of it, everyone will leave and join another guild. You would find your guild empty. Kick out members that aren't active/not participating in events, don't have enough might, or aren't powerful.

",How to Play Castle Clash," You only have 30000 gold and mana at first, so you'll want to upgrade your gold and mana vaults at least to level 4 so you can have enough. Things cost a lot more than usual on Castle Clash, so you'll need as much of the resources and possible.;
, The Town Hall is very important for your base. It keeps track of all the buildings in your base, and the more you level it up, the more buildings you will be able to add.

, A Warehouse is where you store items you get in the game. Every day you log onto Castle Clash, you will get a daily reward. The reward can be any item (a hero card, gold pack, mana pack, etc.), honer badges, and some gems. You will need a Warehouse to be able to claim these items, as well as store them in the Warehouse.

, If you run out of gold or mana to spend, you can later collect more from your Mana Mills and Gold Mines. If available, buy another gold and mana vaults, and a few more Mana Mills and Gold Mines. This will help you store more mana and gold, and it will produce more mana and gold as well.

, Watchtowers are defensive towers that can protect your base while you are offline. Continue upgrading them and they will take more HP out of the attackers if they attack your base. Once they reach level 10, your watchtowers can be upgraded into other better towers. The different kinds of towers are listed here:



Watchtower - This is the tower that you buy when you first start off in Castle Clash. They shoot very slowly however.

Arrowtower - This is a tower that's like a watchtower, but shoots more quickly, so it can kill small attacking troops more faster and easily. Sometimes, it can kill a low-level hero as well. You can also sacrifice heroes to level up the tower's special skills.

Cannontower - A cannontower does not look like a watchtower or arrowtower. Instead it has a base at the bottom, and the top part sticks out of it. The top part shoots bombs at attacking troops and heroes. However, when attackers try to destroy the cannontower, it does not shoot anymore. This also can be upgraded by sacrificing heroes.

Zappingtower - This is a tower that has a glowing blue ball that zaps multiple targets at once. For example, if two attacking troops start heading towards the zappingtower, the zappingtower lets out streaks of light that zaps both of them at the same time, so the zappingtower can kill many troops at once, and can even do the same with heroes. This tower also can be upgraded by sacrificing heroes.

, These will make it harder for the attacker to get in your base. You might not have enough walls at first, so you should surround your most important buildings. Every time you upgrade your Town Hall, you will be able to get 10 more walls to put around your base.


Upgrade your walls so they have more HP and the attacker won't be able to get in that easily.

,, Surround it with defense walls to keep it more safe since it's one of the most important buildings.

, If you put them in the edge of your base, attackers will get to them easily and your resources will be stolen more easily. When you start out on Castle Clash, you usually get attacked a few times since you're new, and you have only a few resources at first.

, Place your army camps on the outside of your special buildings. Hire enough attackers so they can attack someone's attack troops. They will probably lose all of theirs and they might lose, which will make your defense successful.

, on the sides. Hero bases should be placed anywhere, usually scattered around your base. You can hire heroes later and it will look like the heroes are guarding the base. Heroes are more powerful than attack troops, and have more HP than usual. This way, a hero will protect your base better.

, You will need attack troops if you want to attack someone. At first, you will have the guardian, hunter, pyromancer, and treant attack troops. Use a bit of all of these kinds of troops. They all can be useful in some way.

, Heroes are very important, and it is likely you will get the Executioner hero. Each hero has a special talent. You can also roll gems to hire different heroes once you've earned enough. Consider rolling 3x since rolling gems for a hero one time may give you slime, which is not a hero and can only be used to upgrade the hero's skills. They can be helpful for making your hero more powerful however.

, The more frequently you level up your attack troops, the better. To level one up to level 2, it will cost 30000 gold. Level 3 will cost 50000. Later, it will cost more than a 100000 gold, so you have to upgrade your vaults more as well. Once an attack troop gets to level 5, you will be able to unlock stronger new attack troops. They will have more HP and survive longer in a raid or expedition.

, Heroes are very important. A 1 star hero is level 20. A 2 star hero is level 40, and a 3 star hero is level 60. Every time you level up your hero, you will be able to earn XP for the hero to become 20 levels more. You may even be able to do up to level 100 heroes and up. Note: 4 star heroes can study inscriptions.

, Since you just started off in Castle Clash, you might find bases that are easy to attack, have weak defense troops, or may not have any defenses at all. A good base to attack will have the following:


Check the level of the base's buildings. You can see this by how it looks. For example, if they have a mana or gold vault that's bigger than usual, but there are no defense troops, it would be good to attack if the vaults look full.
Check the level of the defense towers. There may be no defense troops, but there will be towers, which can kill the attack troops easily if they're low level. If it's a low level defense tower, it would be good to attack. You can check the level of the watchtower by how it looks. For example, if it looks like a regular wooden watchtower, it might be level 1, 2, or 3. If it looks like a thick watchtower that looks black, it might be a very high level for you to attack, such as level 8, 9, or 10.
Check how much loot there is available. Make sure there is a lot, otherwise if there is not, don't attack this base. When you start off attacking, there will usually be at least 10000 or 1000 loot of mana and gold. If there is less, you shouldn't attack this base.

, Treant's main building they like to destroy is a watchtower or defense tower. No matter if you drop them anywhere far away from those towers, the treant will just find a way to get to the watchtower and start destroying it. Treants also have more HP than the other attack troops, even when they're level 1 or 2.

, The reason you should send any troop in after the watchtowers are destroyed is because a watchtower can kill one of those troops in one hit, which will make you lose more troops easily. Treants have enough HP to handle it.

, Send them to destroy the Town Hall first, since that's the source of all the buildings in the base.

, They can kill one of the defense troops attacker in one hit. Then once all the troops are gone, you can send the treants to destroy the watchtowers, while the heroes destroy the other buildings. You can send the rest later too.

, In the Lost Realm, you will need a lot of these - crystals will get more and more important throughout the game. Collect crystals to fill the capacity of how much crystals you can fit.

, It is almost just as hard to get blue crystals, especially if your capacity is very big and you have not filled it up yet.

, To go into battle, you will need to have enough stamina. It will show how much stamina you have at the top left corner. If you don't have enough, use gems to buy stamina, wait until you get more, or use a stamina card.

, Press Battle for however much stamina it takes. Then press attack. Your heroes will then go into battle and battle whoever you chose. Know that the other opponent will have multiple heroes as well.

, Tap the question mark. Sometimes, out of these mystery boxes, it will either give you a Merchant or a Treasure Trove.


Tap on a chestbox if you would like to claim a prize in treasure trove. Tap all the chestboxes to claim all the prizes.
For merchant, several items will be shown, which cost either gems or gold to buy, such as valuable crests and other things. Save up enough gold every time you play Lost Realm just in case a merchant shows up and you are able to buy something good for your heroes.

, Aim for getting a whole set of the 5 of the same crests and put 5 of those crests on your hero. Your hero will gain a third ability. The more higher level and rarer the crests, the more strong it is (e.g. War God crests, Berserk crests, etc.). Study inscriptions for a certain amount of blue crystals and mana. Make sure you have enough to study all the way up to 100. Level up your heroes' skill levels and star levels as well.

, After a certain amount of battles you do in the Lost Realm, you will be able to fight in a boss battle. Even though the boss can be a smaller level than your heroes, it will be harder than you think. Earn thousands of red crystals in boss battles, as well as one kind of crest.


From the mystery boxes, besides Treasure Trove and Merchant, there is a boss battle called Here Be Demons. The demon you are fighting sort of looks like a dragon. Aim for beating the demon before one hour passes - that is the limit you have before it disappears and you lose. Use your 6 chances wisely - you only have 6 chances to use, and they each take a few minutes to refill. The demon's HP will leave off wherever it was last time though, so you won't have to restart. Use the help of your guild mates and buddies with strong heroes for a better chance of winning.

, Use the same strategy as raids, but in a different way. Since you're in high level dungeons, there will be other upgraded defense troops and heroes, as well as zapping towers, cannon towers, and arrow towers.

, Drop treants to destroy the defense towers. Make sure the enemy heroes are not in the range of them. You can also put any other tough troops in front of the defense buildings to destroy them. Usually, troops that target the defense buildings all the time are better to use.


Use flying troops and more upgraded troops such as ornithopters and mechs to deal more damage. Unlock these troops as soon as you upgrade other troops to their max level. Some of these troops, if there are enough at once, can actually destroy an enemy hero, giving more time to your other troops and heroes to attack.

, Scatter them across the base so they can destroy them and the buildings more easily at once. Drop them in front of defense attack troops as well, since some heroes can kill many at once.

, If possible, save one hero to destroy the town hall since that's the hardest to destroy.

,, Storm Mesa is pretty similar to Wretched Gorge since they are just battles that are more complicated than each other. Press the first one to go to Storm Mesa, and press the next one after that to go to Wretched Gorge.

, Have 3000 might or more to go into Storm Mesa (the same goes for Wretched Gorge).

, Take level 100 heroes to beat the boss in Storm Mesa, since they have 'extra' HP.


In Storm Mesa 4, the boss in the middle is level 180, but seems to have doubled HP. Even though the other 4 bosses are only level 60, they are more stronger than you because they are the bosses. It is suggested you do this with your guild mates or with a team, since you actually need 3 high level Pumpkin Dukes to win this.
For other Storm Mesas, take heroes with you only and attack a base with 1 boss. You cannot take anything else with you, but if you join a team to defeat the boss and heroes, three other groups of level 100 heroes will be available as well. If you want to do a solo, it will be much harder.

, Level up your heroes as much as possible. You will probably need 10000 might to enter the first Wretched Gorge, so by now, you should have over level 100 heroes. The best level is probably 180.


Instead of attacking some kind of base with multiple bosses to defeat, you will be in a regular base setting, and other troops, heroes, and bosses will be attacking you. The goal is to protect your base from the attackers. Later, the boss will come. It can possibly be up to level 200, so make sure you have high level heroes. You can not take attack troops with you though.
You will need to set up a sort of 'mini-base'. Three other players will be with you as well, and they will have bases too, so when you put your bases all together, you will make one big base that may be able to defend the bosses and heroes. In your base, you can set up walls, hero bases, heroes, and defense towers.

, You have up to 10 expeditions a day, and if a base is not right for you, you only have 5 chances to skip, so consider having high level heroes.


In expeditions you earn honer badges and merit badges. You can use merit badges to buy hero cards, gold/mana/honer badge/shard packs, etc.

, You can have up to fifteen, even though they are not on a hero base. Consider choosing your ""top fifteen"" heroes. These are the heroes that are the most powerful. Usually, it depends on the skill level of the hero, not really the actual level of the hero.

, Since you only have 5 chances to skip bases, you should usually attack the first base you see. Skip only if it's really bad for you.

, They should be able to destroy those first, then you can use other heroes to destroy other buildings.


In an expedition, you aren't able to drop all of your 15 heroes. You can only drop a few of your fifteen. Get more might, and you will get bigger rewards, and you will also will be able to drop more heroes into battle.

, On the near bottom right side, you will see four arrows pointing in different directions. Tap that button and you will be able to rearrange your whole base to make it better. Tap Remove All. This will not delete your buildings. It will add them to the inventory, where you can tap one of those buildings and place them on your base. Try to rearrange your base every now and then to prevent attacks and even make your defense successful when you do get attacked. Each building is sorted out by level.

, Upgrade your most important buildings, such as the Town Hall, defense towers, Mana/Gold Vaults, Mana Mills/Gold Mines, etc. Upgrade your Relic Hall as well frequently to get more spells you can use in battle. You can also level up your army camps to fit more attack troops. Walls are also important to upgrade too.

, Save up as many honer badges as possible and fight in dungeons a lot, since every time you want to upgrade a hero to another star level, it will take certain requirements, such as how many dungeon battle torches you need to have, how much gold, and it even takes in honer badges. You can also study inscriptions of one kind of crest so your hero has another special talent. Make sure to save up enough extra heroes, slimes, and tome books so you can earn XP and improve skill levels.

, Battling in all types of places (arena, raids, dungeons, etc.) can earn you great rewards, and you will even complete achievements and quests to earn gems.

Tap a gold vault and level it up by tapping the Level Up button.,
Save or buy as many gems as possible.,
Be prepared to fill your vaults up the hard way.",How to Get to a Million Gold and Mana in Castle Clash," It takes a while before getting to a million, especially more than just one million. Make sure to focus on that goal more when you play Castle Clash. As you continue to upgrade your vaults, it will start to take more than 1 day to finish. To level it up to level 25, it will take up to 22 days.;
, To get more mana and gold, you will need more mana and gold. Make sure your current mana and gold vaults are completely filled since it might take over a million to upgrade the vaults themselves. Upgrading a mana or gold vault will start to take a million to level it up starting when you level it up to 16. The maximum level to upgrade a mana or gold vault is 25.

, To get more vaults, you need to upgrade your town hall to have access to more buildings. The maximum mana and gold vaults you can have is 6; in the new update, you are now able to upgrade your town hall to 25 to get one more extra gold and mana vault.


Level your town hall to level 17 to get a 4th mana/gold vault. When you get one or more of your mana/gold vaults to level 21, it will start storing 1 million of these resources.
Level 25 is the maximum level of all buildings now, thanks to the update, including resource buildings. Update Castle Clash to get higher level buildings and more resources.

, Save gems and buy a third builder for 500 gems. Save 1000 more and buy a 4th. Continue buying builders until you have 5. You need as many as possible if you want to level all your vaults to maximum level.

, Tap a mana vault and do the same. Repeat this process until you run out of builders. If you level the vaults up in a pattern, it will save your mana and gold leveling them up at the same time. In a matter of days, you will find that your capacity of gold and mana has been upgraded.


Quickly fill your vaults again. Do dungeons, raids, or collect from the Mana Mills and Gold Mines. Consider leveling up your collectors as well so that you can restore most of the spent resources and easily fill it again. You will need as much resources as possible to level them up, as they will later cost a million to level them up themselves.

, If you have enough money in your credit card, but the maximum number of gems you can get. This is optional however. If you want to hurry it up, you can use gems. Have a lot of gems to speed them up, as they will cost thousands, since they take days to finish upgrading. Use gems only when needed. Don't waste all your money on one game.

, When you get to a million gold and mana, your collectors don't fill up your vaults all at once. Raid other players, use gold/mana packs, buy gold/mana with gems if you want, or just collect from the collectors every day until it's full.

If you have only one chance once one comes back, don't use it.,
Come back at 7:00 PM to come and claim your rewards.",How to Earn Shards in Castle Clash1," In a guild, there are two events to get honer badges and shards. Torch battles give you a lot of shards, depending on how many torches you haul. Makes you're the guild you join in is in the top 3000, otherwise, this guild will not be able to do a torch battle.;
, This when torch battles start. They will end at 7:00 PM. Have a lot of heroes that are level 20. Your heroes must be at least level 20 to haul torches. You will have 10 chances to haul torches at a time. It takes 30 minutes to restore another chance.

, It can be anyone. Consider doing the guilds that are at the top of the list. Depending on your heroes level, it will take a certain amount of time to haul a torch. Usually 10 minutes will be for a level 20 hero, but higher level heroes could do less. Once you've earned a torch, that will count as one more shard you will get for the rewards. You can also get a lot of honer badges from this.

, Don't forget that other guilds can steal torches from you too. If someone steals a torch, it will last a few minutes for them to get them, usually 10 minutes as well. Before the time runs out, you can battle with them using one of your heroes. Use your most powerful and highest hero. If you win the battle, the other guild doesn't get the torch, and your torches are safe. Be careful however, because one person from a guild could have many heroes, and use all those to haul a whole bunch of torches from your guild. Battle to get them back.


If you lose the battle, you may not be able to battle again, so don't battle that person if you know you might lose.

, The maximum number of torches you can get is 60, which means the maximum shards you can win is 60.

, Consider hauling torches again every time you have five chances at least. There is still plenty of time in the day.

, Tap Events, Torch Battle, and tap Claim. The shards and other rewards will automatically go into your account.

Tap the Battle button.,
Choose a good dungeon to attack.,
Tap any Normal Dungeon or Expert Dungeon level.,
Level up your heroes for Normal Dungeons 2 and Expert Dungeons level 10.,
Don't use attack troops for dungeons.,
Do dungeons with a castle tower on them.",How to Earn Shards in Castle Clash2," Tap the blue portal thats on the bottom of the raid button.

, Try the Normal Dungeons for practice. You can get 1-4 shards in there. It's much harder to get shards though. Normal Dungeons 2 is harder, but gives more shards. If you have level 60-80 heroes, the first 9 expert dungeons will be better. Unlock an expert dungeon and complete a few. They give 6-14 shards, and they are much easier to earn since hey have lower heroes, and not many.

, Each level will give a certain amount of shards, depending on the difficulty of the level.

, In Normal Dungeons 2, there are heroes that past level 60, so try to get your heroes higher than that so you can kill those heroes. Expert Dungeons 1 are easier from levels 1-9. However, starting in number 10, there is boss that is more difficult to kill. If you are able to beat the dungeon without any of your heroes dying or losing too much HP, you will gain 14 shards.


The dungeons will get harder as you go however, especially in Expert dungeons. Normal Dungeon levels will soon have many heroes that are harder to kill, so it may not be possible to earn a lot of shards from them, unless you are doing dungeon levels for Normal 1, levels 1-16, you may be able to earn at least 3 shards from most of those dungeons. Levels 1-9 in Expert give shards easily. If you do a lot of those dungeons in a few days, you may earn hundreds very easily.

, They die easily, so if they do, you may not get the shards. You may only use them in extremely easy dungeons, which only give one shard usually. You can however, kill all heroes and defenses before deploying them so they don't die, but heroes are much more better.

, Usually, dungeons with a blue tower of a castle on them are more complicated, but they reward more shards. Just like in the Expert dungeons, if there is a boss, it will usually have a blue tower, and it will reward more shards if none of your heroes die or lose large amounts of HP.

HBM stands for Here Be Monsters.,
Have high level heroes.,
Level your heroes' skill levels using other heroes and slimes.",How to Earn Shards in Castle Clash3," This is just like HBD (Here Be Demons), but instead, there are different kinds of heroes and a few waves to go through. However, in each level, you get a certain amount of shards.


Here Be Monsters is 5 waves in one level. In the first wave, there will be a few low level heroes attacking your base. When you kill that set of heroes, you move on to the next wave, where the heroes' levels are increased, and may be harder to kill. The 5th wave is the hardest. There are high level heroes that are difficult to kill, and there is also a boss. The boss can be a dragon, a dinosaur, or the Centaur King, which is usually the boss you kill in Boss Battles, Storm Mesa and Wretched Gorge.

, A, B, and C are the easiest levels, and as you go, they give more shards. For example, A gives 10 shards. B gives 15. C gives 20, and so on.

, The higher your skill talents are, the better. The boss always has a better skill talent, and even though the boss is level 10 in A, it can actually kill a level 60 hero. Save up all your extra heroes (from gem rolls and cards) and slimes (slime, crystal ooze, or gelatinous champion) for when you really need to level them up. Consider getting them up to 4/9, since that is when they get strong.


As you go, level your talents more to get stronger for the levels. When you win, you always get shards. When you lose however, you do not. You only get the rewards for the other waves you have won, such as gold, mana, or exp.

Evolve your hero the 4th time.",How to Improve Your Heroes on Castle Clash," Every time you complete a successful raid, EXP is gained. This EXP is split between all the heroes you put on the battlefield. Use strategies to ensure a three flame victory in order to gain more EXP at a time. Place your best or your worst heroes on the battlefield, depending on if you want to make your best heroes even better, or get your worst heroes started on becoming stronger.


The higher level the person is that you attack, the more EXP you will gain. Attack bases that are high level in might, but have low enough heroes and buildings for your heroes to defeat. This will also make it a sure chance that you will win three flames, and prevent your heroes from dying so that you don't have to waste gems or time trying to revive them.;
, Sweep the highest dungeons you have already done before or do a dungeon you never did before, gaining more EXP faster and easily as well. Make sure you can actually defeat the base. Consider sweeping dungeons instead. After the Castle Clash update, 25 more dungeon chances were added, meaning 30 sweeps would give more EXP then just 5 chances to gain EXP. At the same time, this would allow you some extra chances to do some higher dungeons manually.


Battle in boss battles. At the last stage of every expert dungeon, a boss is on the battlefield as well. Fight in these dungeon stages as they usually give the most EXP.
Take out all your heroes on the hero bases except the one(s) that you want to level up. This will cause all the EXP gained to go to that one or those hero(es).
Use dungeon cards. This will give you another 5 chances in order to gain EXP faster.

, Just like the dungeons, Here Be Monsters is 5 waves of monsters and heroes attacking your base. When you successfully defend the base in one of the stages, you will gain resources and other items, as well as the access to sweep the stage of 5 waves. Battle in higher stages to gain more resources and EXP. Sweep ones you have already done to get EXP and resources quicker.


Use Here Be Monsters cards to gain more chances to sweep stages. This will allow you to gain EXP and resources faster.

, This is similar to Here Be Monsters except that there is the same of one hero attacking your base at once. Each stage has one wave, but each stage increases the number of the same hero attacking your base. Sweep or battle in these stages to gain EXP, resources, and in rare cases, win a purple legendary hero, making you even stronger.

, Claim rewards once you've completed them, and try saving your gems. These rewards include tomes, which can be used to level your hero up. The best tome that is easiest to get is Tome 3, which provides 20,000 EXP for a hero.


Quests also reward shards. Shards can be used in other ways to improve your heroes.

, In some days of the calendar, blessed tomes are rewarded, which can only be rewarded through the daily rewards. The collection of these tomes include Blessed Tome 1 (100,000 EXP granted), Blessed Tome 2 (500,000 EXP granted), and Blessed Tome 3 (2,000,000 EXP granted). Even though these may seem like a lot, as said before, your heroes will require a lot more than this much. Save up tomes like these and use them only when actually needed, as they come in short supply.

, Shards are used to buy essences. Essences can be useful in feeding to your heroes, allowing their skill levels to get higher. Perform HBM (Here Be Monsters) and HBD (Here Be Demons) waves and stages to gain shards. Battle in dungeon stages to occasionally get shards every few battles. Try out Storm Mesa rounds with buddies, random players, or guild mates. Sometimes, shard packs could be rewarded, usually in Storm Mesa 1 and Storm Mesa 4 rounds. Use shards to buy essence in the hero's altar.

, Use all your shards until they're finished. It's okay if you use all of them at once, since there are many easy ways to gain shards each day quickly. Feed the essence to your heroes once they're bought. Save up as many shards as possible however - this will allow you to buy legendary essence, gelatinous champion. This is the highest essence type you can buy, and it provides up to 3000 EXP. Level your heroes' skills as much as possible, easily using this type.

, After a few updates, new essences were added into the game. They now provide a lot of more EXP for your heroes, which makes a huge difference. These essences can only be gotten through the daily rewards. Make sure to log in every day in order to claim your reward. The collection includes the Mystery Essence 1 (15,000 EXP granted), Mystery Essence 2 (30,000 EXP granted), and Mystery Essence 3 (150,000 EXP granted).


Consider saving up these essences. They come in short supply - it would be best to use them only on the very strong legendary heroes, and only when it gets harder to level their skills up.

, Roll heroes with honer badges or gems (gems is most recommended since honer badges are used for leveling up the hero as well). Level up the elite and ordinary heroes using green and blue tomes. Get them up to at least level 40 or 60, and then feed them to your hero. This will give EXP to your legendary hero's skill level. This can also be done for other ordinary or elite heroes, but legendary heroes are usually the best type hero to do this for.

, Do quests each day, collect the daily reward each day, and complete achievements. These are the easiest ways to gather gems. It takes 300 gems to roll one talent. If you get a good talent that is 5/5, you got pretty lucky. A list of good talents are:


War God
Revive
Revitalize
Self Destruct
Bulwark
Tenacity
Corrode
Psyshield
Heaven's Wrath
Condemnation
Berserk

, Put the correct best talents you have or got on the correct heroes. Make sure they match the hero as well for the best strength.

, Buy runes with fame, in which you can earn from the Lost Battlefield. Defeat players in the Lost Battlefield and use runes to level your hero's talent up to 8/8 instead of 5/5. Gain the correct type and amount of runes in order to level each hero's talent to the max. From then on, you will be able to possibly evolve your hero.

, Complete as many battles as possible and gain red and blue crystals, as well as several types of rewards. Blue crystals are great for inscriptions for your heroes, and red crystals for creating new crests and talents for your heroes. Gather as many blue crystals and mana as possible - these are the main resources needed in order to inscribe your hero.

, Raid constantly and battle in the Lost Realm to collect these resources, and use them to make your hero stronger. Get your inscription to at least level 21 in order to allow your hero access to a second talent. Increase it up to level 100 in order to ensure the best strength for it.


Inscribe other elite and ordinary heroes, and feed them to your legendaries. This will make your legendaries have even better skills.
Inscribing your hero is always the surefire way to make it stronger in battle. Get your inscribe level to at least 21 in order to place crests in it. Crests allow your hero to have 2 talents and one ability at once. The max inscribe level is 100. Level the inscribe level as much as possible - once it's up to 100, your hero will almost seem invincible in every battle.

, Win as much starting crests as possible from the Lost Realm, and then use them to make even better ones. You might even get a really good talent, and for free as well, using no gems. Place crests on your heroes, allowing them to have an even better strength.

, Honer badges can be used to level up your hero to the max star level - level 10, which will set your hero's max level to 200 (if you do level the rest of the last 20 levels). Battle in the arena frequently and try to win as many as possible - depending on your ranking in the arena, you automatically gain honer badges each hour. Get a high ranking in order to increase the number of honer badges you gain.


Fight in raids and dungeons as well as battle the boss in order to gain honer badges easily. Use extra gems to buy 1000 honer badges from the shop if you are no longer saving them up, or will continue to later on.
Raid as much as possible in order to gain gold. Use these resources in order to level up the star level. Level your hero to the max level, and repeat until you've reached the max star level.

, Not only do you need gold and honer badges, but flames are important as well. Flames can be collected in dungeons. If you get a three star victory, you get three flames. Two stars equals two flames, and one equals only one flame.

, Level your heroes to the max before trying to level the star level - this way, you'll easily get your hero to be stronger.

, Green and possibly blue tomes are not very useful when your heroes are at high levels. Sell unneeded blue and green tomes for honer badges, in order to upgrade your heroes' star levels. Sell blessed tomes and purple tomes only when you really need honer badges, and you don't really need them. Blessed tomes give massive amounts of honer badges when sold. Consider saving some for leveling and some for honer badges.

, In order to evolve your hero, you need/it must be:


Level 10 in star level
Level 180+ in regular level (preferably to the max for more strength)
1000 red crystals
1 evolution rune
Another duplicate hero/20,000 shards

, Even though you could be less than level 200 to evolve the legendary hero, it is suggested to do so in order to gain maximum strength.

, Use the fame to get evolution runes. Try to save them up in order to use them for other future evolutions (the max number of evolutions possible is 4 times).

, Press the evolve button and follow the instructions that show along the way. Claim the blessed tome rewards after and level your hero to the max once again (Your hero will be evolved once now and change appearance, but they still can be evolved 3 more times. They will leave off and star level number 4, in which you must use the books to level them up again.).


Use the books to sell for honer badges if needed. Make sure you actually want to do this - books like these could be used to level up the hero again after quickly. Consider saving some for the leveling, and some for selling.

, Your hero should have maximum power now that you have done everything possible to make it strong. Repeat this process with other legendary heroes until you become strong enough to take on any base.

, Open all the cards you have gotten. Be sure that there is enough space in your hero's altar so you can fit more heroes.

, Ordinary and elite heroes can be helpful, but some elite heroes are slow and they have to actually go right to the enemy to attack instead of attacking from far distances. Sell those if you'd like. Keep all legendaries you get, except if they are a bad hero, such as a Paladin. You should also keep Gelatinous Champion essences so you can use them for skill talents. Slime and Crystal Ooze is good as well.


A Paladin is some kind of knight hero, but it is not very effective. It's more like an elite hero, one that ha to go to the attacker completely and attack with something face-to-face. They are also not as powerful as other heroes, even though it's a high level.
Gelatinous Champion is a kind of essence that gives 3000 skill talent points. If you have a lot, you can use them to upgrade your heroes HP attack. An HP attack is when a hero gains enough energy (you see how much energy they have in a purple bar while attacking), then they use their special skill.

Save up plenty of resources.,

Choose a good design.,
Use large amounts of walls.,
Upgrade your hero bases.",How to Do Guild Wars on Castle Clash1," Level up your heroes to at least 100 in order to have good chances of winning. Consider using legendary heroes and getting more heroes by rolling gems as well as getting a card from the daily rewards.


In Guild Wars, there will actually be very low bases as well. The choices of bases to attack range from the highest might player to the lowest. If you have at least level 140 - 160 heroes, you can almost reach the highest, or you will be in between.;
, Gather plenty of mana and blue crystals. Constantly inscribe your best heroes that you will be using whenever you have enough resources. Raid other bases in regular attacks to gather mana and do Lost Realm whenever you have stamina to gain blue crystals.

, Visit your warehouse and equip your heroes with the strongest possible crests you have. Guild Wars do not allow you to use any magic, which will make it a bit tougher to attack bases. Crests are a great addition to help your hero gain another hero power. Battle in the Lost Realm frequently and try to get Here Be Demons, which can give you a Mythic Crest bag if you win.


Battle the types of battles that take more than 6 stamina to attack, where there are more upgraded heroes you need to defeat. These battles can get you Rare Crest bags as well. Open them, hoping for a good crest. Mythical Crest bags actually can give you crests such as War God, etc. These crests work best on legendary heroes.
Try to get as many Merchants and Treasure Troves as possible. Make sure to raid other bases for enough gold every time before you start Lost Realm, since if you get a Merchant, that will be the only chance you get to buy something if there is something good, but expensive. Save crystals not only for Treasure Troves, but also for inscriptions. If you open each Treasure Box in the Treasure Trove, make sure to have enough extra crystals for inscribing your heroes.
Use red crystals to combine some crests you have for higher level ones. The same can be done with blue crystals in a different way. You combine one crest with a different crest and get a better one. Red crystals are rare however, so try to gain several red crystal packs and use them to gain more. Use them wisely, and make sure you still have a fair amount of the crests you combine.

, Leveling up your heroes is, of course an important part. Do quests all the time in order to collect plenty of books. Collect the books that are only available from the Daily Calendar too. Gain as many blessed tomes as possible - they are different from regular tomes, and can give up to 500,000 EXP to your heroes! Use them either for honer badges (by selling them to upgrade your hero's star level) or for leveling up your hero's levels.


Keep a balance between your books - you will need plenty of honer badges if you are low level and need to upgrade your hero's star level. Sell your blessed tomes for honer badges - they give a huge amount if you sell those. Use the regular tomes to level up. It could be the other way around - use whatever way you would like.

, Save up plenty of gems and roll 300 gems at a time until you get better talents for your heroes. This is known as your hero's second ability/talent. Save some extra gems however, and aim for getting a 5/5 talent. Make sure it is an accurate talent, such as War God, Berserk, etc. Check the list below for talents you should aim to roll for.


War God - Increases attack power, 8/8 talent increases your hero's attack by 90%.
Berserk - Increases attack speed, 8/8 talent increases hero's attack speed by 70% (very affective on Pumpkin Duke since he normally has a talent that also speeds up heroes).
Revitalize - Gains energy at start of battle, which helps a hero unleash its special ability faster to deal more damage. 8/8 talent increases hero's energy by 100% at start of battle.
Revive - Revives hero right after it dies once with a bit of HP, 8/8 talent revives your hero with full HP.
Self Destruct - Deals a huge amount of damage to nearby targets upon death, 8/8 talent does 1000% damage.
Deadly Strike - Has a chance to deal more damage when attacking, 8/8 talent has a chance to do 15 times more damage.
Tenacity - Increases HP, 8/8 talent increases HP by 100%

, Fame is used for upgrading talents to 6/8, 7/8, and 8/8. The only talent you can roll for is 5/8 as the max number. Do Lost Battlefield each day and use up all your chances. Battle wisely in order to not lose a chance when you lose a battle. Attack higher players so you can get more fame and move up in the week's rankings, which can gain you gems as well.

, Use skill essences and other heroes you do not want to use. Consume them into the other hero you want to upgrade, and level up the ability as much as possible. Upgrade the ability all the way to the max - 10/10. This will ensure that your hero deals the most damage when it has enough energy to use its special skills.

, During the time of building up your base, when you reach a higher level, your buildings will cost a large amount of resources to upgrade. Frequently raid other bases with large amounts of loot, and collect as much of it as possible. Spend all your resources before you log off - you don't want someone to raid your base and steal all your gold and mana.

, Use your mana and gold to upgrade your buildings as much as possible. Raid other bases a lot so that you can collect enough loot to fill your vaults. If you upgraded your watchtowers to the maximum level, choose either an arrow tower or a magic tower. Cannon towers hardly do much damage. They can slowly melt down a hero's HP, but they are not as effective.


Arrow towers fire arrows more faster than a Watchtower, and they do way more damage. They can kill off a hero and do extra damage as well.
Magic towers are probably the best choice to use in Guild Wars. They deal a decent amount of damage, can do extra damage, and can also stun enemies for a long time. You can use a mix of arrow towers and magic towers, or just one type.

, Consider using the corner base design. It can protect your heroes well, and uses the defenses in a balanced out way. It is also a popular choice for most players. Keep your extra buildings (resources, etc.) near the defenses and your defense heroes so that they won't be able to win at least one flame when the Guild War starts. Other designs can be searched up on castle clash websites, or the castle clash wiki.

, Layer up to at least five layers of walls around your base, or a few layers of walls if you are using a compartment base. This is a great design for corner bases, skull knight bases, etc. If a player that has heroes with Self destruct, they could wipe out your heroes in no time, and win. Layer as many walls as you can so as to soak up any Self Destruct damage. Place the walls to make sure no enemy ground hero is able to get through until your heroes kill them.

, Upgrading your hero bases can increase the attacking range of your heroes, making it more easier to defend against enemies. Use mana to upgrade all your hero bases more to have better range for your hero.

Prepare your defenses.,
Provide advice to your guild mates.",How to Do Guild Wars on Castle Clash2," In Guild Wars, you will only be allowed to use heroes and troops, and no spells. Spells can provide useful in battle, but might make Guild Wars too easy. Raid other bases and practice attacking without magic. Beat high level bases that you can take on equally. That way, in the war, the same will happen and you will be able to win easily.

, Expeditions only allow you to use heroes and nothing else, and they can be good practice since once one of your heroes die, you can't revive them until the expeditions refresh. Practice doing as many expeditions and try not to lose any heroes. Get three flames if possible.

, Put your base on defense for a while and see how it goes. Watch replays of people who attacked you before the war starts. Futz around with your base and test out more defensive attacks. See what you can improve on and what you should do in order to win defensive attacks in the war.

, Do dungeons and see how your heroes can handle high damage bombs (there are a lot of these in dungeons), high level enemy heroes, and high level buildings. See what you need to improve on and level up your hero to be stronger as needed.


Change your crests and talents if they do not seem to be helping out your hero that much. Decide if you need to inscribe more, and collect the resources to do it. You can also gain fame from Lost Battlefield and buy a 5/8 talent pack. This will give you a 5/8 talent, in which you can then improve the talent more (if it is a good one) using talent runes.
Do lost Battlefield. The Lost Battlefield is also a great way to practice, as it gives fame, and lets your heroes practice without any troops or spells.

, Pick the heroes you want to go into battle. Place your heroes in good places that would have a good range when enemies attack, such as right at the edge of a wall. That way, the hero will be able to kill the enemy hero, while the enemy is just busy trying to break a wall.

, Add garrisons to your defenses so that they can unleash their special abilities as well. Use heroes that are not chosen to go into the war. Fill up as much of the purple as possible. The purple is known as 'legendary', but you must also fill up as much of the green and blue garrison as well. This will have your enemies possibly stunned the whole entire battle if you have a magic tower, and do extra damage to an enemy if with arrow towers.

, Give them tips on how they can defend their bases and attack, and make sure to warn everyone so that several people can participate to gain the most points.

, Look over its enemy defenses, plan out how you will be able to defeat the heroes and defenses, and create a strategy to destroy the base. Find out where the bombs and traps could be hiding in so you can take them out with small troops, and then send your heroes in. Have a good idea of how you will defeat the base.

, Attack the base with some troops as well. Some troops such as Ornithopters might work since they are a flying troop, and they can do as much damage as an Arrow Tower. Take some ground troops with you as well to take out the bombs and traps. Send your heroes in places where you're sure there aren't any hero traps - they can do quite a lot of damage and can possibly take out half of your hero's health.


Find out which is the best base to attack since you have practiced attacking bases with no spells. Try to take out the defending heroes with flying troops and stronger heroes, until all of them are gone. Carry on destroying buildings and winning the base. Collect as many points from the base as possible - this will be added to the total score that determines how much fame each member will get.
If one or more of your heroes die and you did not get a flame yet, you can either just let the rest of the heroes destroy the base (if possible for them), or just end the battle so the heroes won't have to revive for a long time. Attack again after, but make sure you think up a new strategy to win the base. It will not take off any of your 5 chances. You can use gems to revive them however if they do die and you win.

, Ask them how they did their attacks and do your attacks in the same way. Share your advice as well and tell them how you can improve on your attacks so they can win the war.


Ask them what the best talents and crests are for guild wars. Your guild mates might be able to tell you some good heroes, talents, crests, etc. to use for the guild war. This will help you have the best chances of winning the base.

, Target up to the highest base you can possibly attack without losing. Gain as many points as you can in order to win as much fame as possible. Guild Wars give out over a hundred or more fame, which is more than usually what you get in the Lost Battlefield.

, Collect your fame prize once the war is finished and see which guild won. If your guild won, great! If not, try to figure out a way you can get your guild to have the highest ranking in the next guild war.

Not all manufacturers allow this, and even if they do not all models may be supported.To quickly see which models your manufacturer allows to be unlocked, search ""manufacturer unlock bootloader"" (e.g. ""HTC unlock bootloader""). This will typically display the manufacturer's bootloader website as the first result.
Nexus phones can always be unlocked.;
, Even if your device's manufacturer allows unlocking the bootloader and your device is supported, your carrier may still block it., When you unlock your bootloader, you typically void any warranty that is currently active. You also break the DRM on your device, which can cause problems with streaming music services. Unlocking your bootloader also disables Apple Pay as a security measure. Finally, throughout the entire process you run the risk of permanently disabling your device., You'll need a few utilities on your computer in order to proceed with unlocking your bootloader.

Visit the Android developer website.
Scroll down to the ""Get just the command line tools"" section at the bottom of the page.
Click the link for the ZIP file for your operating system.
Place the ZIP file in a folder that you want the tools to be located in.

, Double-click the ZIP file after you've placed it in its folder and click the ""Extract"" option., This will display a list of available SDK tools., This is the only software you'll need for unlocking your bootloader.,, You'll be able to find these on the support page of your device's manufacturer's website. Make sure to download the drivers that match your device's model.,, This folder was created when you installed the SDK software., Make sure you right-click in a blank spot., A Command Prompt window will appear already set to the correct location., You should see your device's serial number.,,, This will enable the Developer Options menu.,, Not all phones will display this option, and it is only necessary if it is there., This allows you to send commands to your Android through ADB., The following process will vary depending on your phone manufacturer. Be sure to follow the instructions they provide exactly. What follows here is a general guide., The process for this will vary depending on your device, but generally you'll need to turn off your phone and then hold Power and Volume Down for 10 seconds., This command is different for every manufacturer. For example, for HTC you would type fastboot oem get_identifier_token.

Make sure your Android device is still connected to your computer and the Command Prompt window is open from the platform-tools folder.

, You'll see a long code appear on the screen, and it may be broken up into several lines. Click and drag to highlight the entire code. Press Ctrl+C to copy it., Use the bootloader unlock code request form to submit your code and request your unlock code. This can take a week or two, depending on the manufacturer., When you receive your unlock code, you'll be given the command to use to apply it to your device. This command varies depending on the manufacturer. Your Android will need to be connected to your computer and in fastboot mode.

For Nexus devices, run fastboot oem unlock, or fastboot flashing unlock for the Nexus 5X and newer.
The command for your manufacturer may be different. For example, HTC users would type fastboot oem unlocktoken Unlock_code.bin after placing the Unlock_code.bin file received from HTC into the ADB folder.

, You may be prompted by your phone to confirm the unlock., This command will reboot your device and exit fastboot mode., You'll see this message every time you turn on your device as a security measure. Make sure your device boots completely into the Android operating system as normal. You're now ready to install a custom recovery., If your manufacturer or carrier will not allow you to unlock the bootloader, your only other option is to find and use an exploit to bypass it. This process is different for every phone model, and some phones simply cannot be unlocked at all.

The best place to get started are the XDA Forums. Find your phone model and look for any bootloader unlocks released by the community.
When performing an unlock using an exploit, be sure to follow every step in the XDA thread exactly, as the risk for bricking your device increases dramatically when not using official methods.

, This guide will cover installing TeamWinRecoveryProject (TWRP), one of the more popular recovery methods for Android ROMs. Another popular recovery is ClockworkMod Recovery (CWM). Both should work for installing most ROMs, though some ROMs will require a specific recovery environment.,, If your device is not on this list, try a different recovery environment like CWM.

Note that while your device might be supported, your carrier or region may not.

, This will display more details for your specific device., This will download TWRP in IMG format to your computer., Place it in the same location as your ADB binary files. This will allow you to transfer it to your phone using ADB in the Command Prompt., This will make it easy to enter the name during the transfer., If you don't still have the Command Prompt open, hold ⇧ Shift and right-click in the open platform-tools folder. Select ""Open command window here."", This will copy the TWRP image file to your Android device and replace your current recovery environment with it.,, This will enter recovery mode in most devices.

Some devices may have a different button combination for entering recovery mode. Perform a web search for ""model recovery mode.""

, This will allow TWRP to access your encrypted device, which is essential for creating backups., This will open the backup utility in TWRP. Creating a full backup of your system (Nandroid) will allow you to restore your device in case something goes wrong during the ROM installation., This will back up all of your essential system files and data., You'll see this at the bottom of the Backup screen. The backup process will likely take a while to complete, so let your Android device process.,, This will have different names depending on your device (PDS, EFS, WiMAX, etc.), and your device may not have anything listed here., This will back up your IMEI information, which will be essential for restoring connectivity if you break something later., The XDA forums is the most popular Android development community on the internet, and you'll find virtually every available ROM here., You'll see popular devices listed on the main page, or you can use the search bar to find your specific model.

Make sure your model matches both your device and your carrier. The same device on two different carriers will have two different model numbers, and you'll need a ROM that matches your exact model.

, Each device on XDA will have a section that's dedicated to ROM development. You'll be able to find virtually any ROM of note for your device here., The number of ROMs available for your device is heavily dependent on how popular it is. Some devices may only have one or two ROMs to choose from, while others may have dozens. Some devices don't have any ROMs available at all, but these are usually devices that don't have unlockable bootloaders.

Different ROMs can accomplish different things. Some ROMs are designed to be as barebones as possible for maximum performance, while others will add a bunch of features that aren't normally available on your device.

, ROMs often add new features, but they also often have limitations that may not have been present on your original device. Make sure that you will be OK with the feature set of your new ROM., Many ROMs will have special instructions that you'll need to follow during installation. It is imperative that you follow the author's instructions exactly, or you may encounter serious problems., This will begin downloading the ROM file, usually in ZIP form. ROMs may be fairly large, and the file could take a while to download., This site allows you to download Googe's proprietary apps, like Gmail and the Play Store, since ROMs cannot legally include them., You'll need to select your device's architecture (platform), operating system version, and the variant you want.

If you don't know your device's platform, you should be able to find it on the XDA Forum's device information page for your device.
Make sure the OS version matches the ROM you are installing, not your current OS version.
Most users can select Stock as the variant, which includes all of the default GApps.

, This will begin downloading your selected GApps package. You should now have two ZIP files: your chosen ROM and the GApps file., If it isn't already, you'll need to connect your Android to your computer via USB so that you can transfer the files onto the device's storage., You can transfer the files to either your Android's internal storage, or to the SD card if you have one inserted., You can click and drag them to your device's storage. Make sure they are placed in the base directory for either the internal storage or the SD card (don't put them in folders).,, You'll need to open Recovery mode, which you'll do from the powered-off state., This process will vary depending on your device, so perform a web search if you aren't sure. Generally, you'll hold Power and Volume Down until the recovery menu appears. You'll know you're in the right place when you see TWRP., It is always recommended to wipe your device before installing a new ROM. This will delete all of the data on the device., The reset process will only take a few moments.,, Make sure to start with the ROM, not the GApps file., The ROM file will begin installing, which may take several minutes to complete., Now you'll be installing the GApps file,, The GApps installation will begin, which may take as long or longer than the ROM installation., This will clear the cache, which is necessary for starting the ROM the first time., Your Android device will reboot, and if everything went smoothly you'll load your ROM's home screen environment.It may take a long time for your new ROM to boot. This should only happen the first time you boot it up.

Try entering Samsung codes into the dialer.",How to Spot a Fake Samsung J71," The 2016 Samsung J7 was released in four colors—black, white, gold, and rose gold. The 2015 model was only made in black, white, and gold.If the phone is not one of those colors, it’s not an original.;
, The Samsung J7 has two Samsung logos—one on the front (above the screen at the center), and one on the back (at the center, but closer to the top than the bottom). The logos should not be stickers, and should not flake off when you rub them.

, Fake phone manufacturers are pretty good at making their phones look like the real thing, but one foolproof way of checking is to compare your phone to another of the same model. Try these short tests:Locate and press the buttons on the phone. Are they in the same place on both phones? Do they feel the same when pressed?
Stack the phones on top of one another—are they the same size? Look at their edges—a fake J7 is probably thicker than a real one.
Turn the brightness on both phones to the max. Are the colors more bold on one than another?

, Samsung has a few “secret codes” that you can use for troubleshooting. These codes should only work on a Samsung phone.



*#7353#: A menu should appear, containing several options (Melody, Vibration, Speaker, Dimming, etc). If your phone is a Samsung J7, you will see this menu.

*#12580*369#: You should see the “Main version” screen, which shows a bunch of random numbers specific to your phone. If your phone is a Samsung, you’ll see this “Main version” screen.

*#0*#: You should see several gray square buttons (Red, Green, Blue, Receiver, Vibration, etc) on a white background. Again, if nothing happens, the phone is not a Samsung J7.

Find your phone’s 15-digit IMEI number.,
Enter the IMEI at http://www.imei.info.,
Click “Check” to view the results.",How to Spot a Fake Samsung J72," A quick way to check the authenticity of a Samsung J7 is to check its IMEI in an IMEI-checking website. There are a few different ways you can find the number:


Dial *#06# from the J7. As soon as you enter the final #, the IMEI will appear on the screen (it will say “IMEI” just above the number).
Look for the IMEI on the packaging, or under the battery. You’ll have to slide the back cover from the J7 to access the battery.
If you’re buying a J7 online, ask the seller (if you’re buying online) to give you the number.

, You don’t need a user account or password to use this tool—just type the IMEI into the blank.

, Now you’ll see a bunch of information about your phone. You should see the word “Samsung” next to “Brand.” If you don’t, the phone is not a legitimate Samsung product.

"
"
Look at the price.,
Shop with one of Samsung’s authorized dealers.,
Ask the seller for the IMEI.",How to Spot a Fake Samsung J73," As of October 2016, a brand new Samsung J7 goes for about $250. You may see some variation in that price with different retailers due to sales, but not by much. If you find one that’s only $150 and claims to be brand new, it’s probably not real., Samsung’s website has a list of all businesses authorized to sell its products. Visit http://www.samsung.com/us/peaceofmind/authorized_resellers.html to view the current list., If you’re buying a phone online from an individual on a site like eBay or Craigslist, you should always check the IMEI before buying. If a seller doesn’t want to give you the IMEI, you shouldn’t trust that seller.

, Open Trigger. Select the green plus sign to add a new task. The heading should now read 'Add one or more triggers'.

, Select the plus sign and tap NFC. Press next. It will now show a range of restrictions that you may wish to add.

You should see 'NFC' appear and any restrictions you've added. Press 'next'.

, If you wish to use your NFC tag for driving, rename your task 'Driving' in the name space at the bottom. When done, don't select 'next'.

This can be useful, but to start off with, don't add one until you get the hang of it. NFC tags can be re-written when you want, so don't worry about wasting a tag. Select 'done'.

, Take the tag you want to write and tap the back of your phone against it (ensure that you have NFC turned on). It will write the tag! You can now exit the app.

, If your tag is for driving, put it in your car. You can have a tag in the form of a sticker or key ring accessory for example. Handy places for an NFC tag are: On your keys for when you're out and about, in your car for driving, on your front door for when you come home, and on your laptop to turn on your personal WiFi Hotspot.

, To use your tag, simply tap the back of your phone against the tag but make sure NFC is turned on in settings. Anyone can use your tag as long as their device has NFC. This can be really handy and can be used to exchange contact information in businesses without the need for business cards.

, There is a whole range of things you can do with NFC and it can make life loads easier. Once you get the hang of it, you can try out experimental things, like using NFC to turn on your computer remotely! If you're tech savvy, you can even use it to turn on your lights when you get home providing that you have the correct equipment."

Insert the card into your Android device.,
Connect the Android device to your computer.,
Enable MTP on the Android device.,
View the expanded storage.,
Copy content.",How to Use Your Android As a Portable Hard Drive," Only do this step if your phone has a microSD card slot for storage expansion. The memory card acts as the external memory so that the files aren’t mixed with the folders that are essential for some of your apps to function.


Head to your favorite online store or computer/cell phone accessory store and purchase a microSD card.
The maximum capacity depends on how much your phone can handle (flagship phones usually take up to 64GB of expanded storage). If you wish to use it for Word documents and other such data, an 8GB microSD should do fine.;
, Look for the microSD card slot of your phone, which should either be on the sides of the device, covered by a flap, or at the back of the device, right under the back cover. Check your device’s user manual for an accurate diagram of where the slot is.

, Now that the microSD card is inserted, your device should display a notification in the status bar at the top that says something along the lines of “Reading media.” Grab the USB cable that comes with your Android device and plug it into the charging slot of your phone.


Take the USB 2.0 (white), or USB 3.0 (blue) end of the cord and insert it into a vacant USB port on your computer. The computer should detect the phone as a USB device, and install the drivers that will let you view the contents of the data storage.

, By default, the phone should connect as an MTP device, which lets it act as a media storage device much like a normal USB drive. If not, swipe down from the notification bar at the top, and tap on the USB icon with the description that says “Connected as a media device.” You will then see a few options. Make sure “Media Device (MTP)” is checked.

, Now that you’ve set up the USB connection, you can access the contents of both the internal and external storage of your Android phone. To view the content, head to My Computer on Windows, or the drive icons that appear on the Mac desktop after you plug the device in.


Select the SD Card folder, or the internal storage, depending on which storage you would like to store your files. For phones with no microSD slot, you will only be able to use the internal storage for this purpose.

, Open in another window the directory on your computer that contains the files you wish to copy over to your Android device. Select the files by holding the CTRL key on windows (the Command on Mac), and left-clicking on the files you want to copy over.


Press CTRL+C, or CMD+C, to copy the files. Click on the window of your phone’s storage, and press CTRL+V, or CMD+V, to copy the files over.
To retrieve files from the phone and transfer it over to a computer, do the same thing, except that you copy the files from storage on the phone and transfer it to a location on a computer.
There you have it. A simple way to keep files handy in case there is no Internet for cloud storage, or if you simply want to carry some lightweight data with you to transfer wherever you go.

, What is the purpose of the AlertDialog box? What are the options going to be for the user? Is it possible that the user would ignore this process otherwise? Write down what the user will be prompted for and note their choices and what they do. If the writing seems unclear for the user, they may not understand the purpose of the AlertDialog box.

, Draw what you want the AlertDialog box to look like. Write down the list the options you would like to implement and their resulting actions. Think carefully about what the user is being prompted for and ensure the writing does not create ambiguity.

, A software development kit or SDK is used to develop software in a specialized environment for creating programs and applications. You can download SDK direct from the Android developer website., Even if you have an existing project, creating a project can be ideal if you want to create a testing environment before adding code to your main project. From the menu bar click on File>New>New Project… and follow the prompts to create a new application.

, The AlertDialog will need to be brought up by an action performed by the user. You can edit the main layout of the app under the “activity_main.xml” file to provide a button to test the AlertDialog with. There are two ways to create a button. Switch between design and coding methods by clicking on either Design or Text which are located at the bottom of the main window pane to switch between the different modes.


The Android SDK allows you to edit your layout such as the main front end which can be found in the project hierarchy under the Layout folder by using a drag and drop interface to create a button.
You can also create a button in XML code yourself by editing the XML document. Note the line indicating the onClick action is used to execute the AlertDialog box when the button is clicked on.





<Button
   android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
   android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
   android:text=""Test Alert Dialog""
   android:id=""@+id/buttonTest""
   android:layout_alignParentTop=""true""
   android:layout_centerHorizontal=""true""
   android:layout_marginTop=""77dp""
   android:onClick=""showDialog"" />




, This will be needed in order to access the class to create the AlertDialog prompt. The AlertDialog’s class provides the ability to create the Dialog box on screen, set it’s options, display titles and show contents within the Dialog window. To import the class, open the “MainActivity.java” file. Scroll to the top of the file and place this among the other classes being imported to the project.





import android.app.AlertDialog;





This class will be useful for your entire application. Be sure to add it to the top of your code hierarchy.

, A button object help identify a push-button widget as seen in the XML code.In your main java code, “MainActivity.java” identify and initialize a button object in the beginning of your main method, which is the main class of your app.





private Button buttonAlertDialog;
buttonAlertDialog = (Button) findViewByID(R.id.buttonTest);




, Using an OnClickListener, you will be able to anticipate when the user taps on the button to initiate an action. An OnClickListener is performed by listening for user input when they click on a corresponding button. We will use the listener to open our AlertDialog prompt.





buttonAlertDialog.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
@Override
public void onClick(View alertView) {
});




, Within the onClick function, you will need to create an AlertDialog object and provide it with a title, message and button types to use for your prompt.


Create the alert dialog box object and set the builder to refer to the new object and create the box.





AlertDialog alertDialog1 = new AlertDialog.Builder(MainActivity.this)




, A setter function allows you to provide a variable to an object. This is ideal to avoid using global variables that can cause performance issues. A title is entirely optional, but you can set one to appear at the top of the AlertDialog window.





alertDialog1.setTitle(“wikiHow Alert Example”);




, Enter a message to describe what you want the user to answer.





alertDialog1.setMessage(“Android is providing you a message to acknowledge.”);




, Provide buttons for the user to use. You can use a combination of a positive button, a negative button and a neutral button. You can use any combination of the three types but can only use one of each for up to three buttons. Use the onClick functions to provide an action when the user clicks on one of the three buttons at the bottom of the AlertDialog prompt.





alertDialog1.setPositiveButton(""OK"", new OnClickListener()
{
   public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which){
}
}).alertDialog1.setNegativeButton(""OK"", new OnClickListener()
{
   public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which){
}
}).alertDialog1.setNeutralButton(""OK"", new OnClickListener()
{
   public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which){
}
});




, You can provide a cancel function to the back key on the Android device itself without tapping one of the buttons as well. If it is set to false, the back button on the Android device is ignored.alertDialog1.setCancelable(true);




, Use this to create the AlertDialog object. This will need to be done before showing the AlertDialog on screen.





alertDialog1.create();




, Once the object is created, use this action to show the AlertDialog on screen.





alertDialog1.show();




, You can use one of three different types of lists you can use. Instead of using the setMessage function, use a list if you want to provide multiple choice answers. Your list will need to have an array created independently to list the different available options. The list will use an array to display the different available options.





final CharSequence[] items = {""Edit"", ""Rate"", ""Share"", ""Related""};




, Use setItems to provide a list of options to choose from. This will appear as a list of radio buttons to check. The function will require an array of options to choose from and an onClickListener to represent the user’s input.





dialog.setItems(items, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
   public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int item) {
       //Place resulting actions in this function
       //The Item integer variable is the index position of the selected item
   }
});




, Use setMultiChoiceItems if you want the user to be able to select several options. Their options will be shown in checkboxes when used.





dialog.setMultiChoiceItems(items, null, new DialogInterface.OnMultiChoiceClickListener() 
{
   public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int item, boolean isChecked)     
   {
         if(isChecked)
                //If there are checked items
       //Item is the index position of the selected item
   }
});




, Use setSingleChoiceItems if you want the user’s singular choice to be persistent. Their options appear with radio buttons which appear as circles with dots inside of a selected choice.





dialog.setSingleChoiceItems(items, -1, new DialogInterface.OnMultiChoiceClickListener() 
{
   public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int item)     
   {
         if(isChecked)
                //If there are checked items
       //Item is the index position of the selected item
   }
});




, A custom AlertDialog allows you to create a layout featuring it’s own parameters and can obtain information that can be used to obtain a user’s login information, configuration settings and more. You can create a new layout that will be created in XML coding format. Some Android SDK provide the ability to use a drag-and-drop function to easily create a layout that will auto-convert into XML for you. From the menu bar at the top of the window, click on File>New>XML>Layout XML File. Provide a layout file name then click on Finish. Your new layout will appear in the main window pane.

, You can add in components using one of two methods. You can open the layout file from looking in the project hierarchy shown on the left hand side. Then open the following folder paths: “<AppName>>app>src>main>res>layout”

, A new class will allow you to separate the code for your unique alert layout. Click on File>New>Java Class. Type in a name for your new Java class then click on OK. For this example, we will call this example class “CustomDialogExample.”

, The Dialog Fragment allows for maximum compatibility with the different versions of Android OS. import android.support.v4.app.DialogFragment;


Make sure the main class method extends to the DialogFragment.






public class CustomDialogExample extends DialogFragment




, A Layout Inflater instantiates a layout XML file into view objects.A View object is the basic structure for user interface components in a rectangular screen space and draws objects and widgets on screen.LayoutInflater inflater;
View customView;




, We will need for it to be public so that it can be accessed elsewhere in the application and it will return a Dialog object. It will take in a Bundle object





public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState){
}




, With the LayoutInflater and View objects created, inflate the layout and obtain the custom layout onto the View object from within the onCreateDialog function.





inflater = getActivity().getLayoutInflater();
customView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.dialog_custom_background, null);




, In the onCreateDialog function, use the AlertDialog builder to create the layout.



AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(getActivity());}}



You may wish to add in a button to close the AlertDialog.





builder.setView(customView).setPositiveButton(""OK"", new OnClickListener()
{
   public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which){}
});




, Because we are not in the main focus of the application, we will end the onCreateDialog function by returning with our new AlertDialog.





return builder.create();




, You will need to call upon your function from elsewhere, such as the main method of your application. For this example, we will call this public function customAlertDialogExample which will take in a View object.





public void customAlertDialogExample(View customView)
{
CustomDialogExample dialog = new CustomDialogExample();
dialog.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), “MyCustomAlertDialog”);
}

,,, This button appears after the app has downloaded and installed.

,, The scanner will have a hard time if part or all of the barcode is too dark.

, Make sure the entire square code is inside the box on your screen.

, When scanning a traditional line barcode, the line in the viewfinder needs to be perpendicular to the lines of the barcode.

, This can help focus if the barcode appears blurry.

, When the scan is successful, you'll feel the device vibrate and hear it beep.

, After scanning a code, you'll see the type of information that it contained. This can range from text to website URLs. The content will be displayed at the top of the screen.

, Your available actions will vary depending on the type of code you scanned.For example, if you scanned a code for a website address, you can tap the Open button to open the website in your browser or the Share button to send it to someone else.
If you scan a contact you'll be able to add it to your contact list or share it.
If you scanned a product, you may be able to perform a product search and a web search. The product search will look for retail outlets that carry that product.
If you scanned a calendar event, you can add it to your calendar.

, QR codes can contain a variety of different types of links and content. Traditional line barcodes only contain a number. This number may be associated with a product if it is popular. If the barcode was created specifically for a single store or some other local outlet, it will likely just be meaningless numbers.

, In this menu you can individually change the volume of notifications, ringtones, system sounds, and media. Increase the sliders to their maximum volume by either moving them all the way to the top or all the way to the right.

, An important thing to remember when using an Android device is that it is essentially a mini computer, meaning it has a limited processing power. Keeping many apps running in the background can decrease the speed of your device, because it will be using its processing power to keep these apps open.

Accept the terms and conditions. There are various options for improving the audio output that can be found ""Speaker Settings."", Tap speaker modifications and select the volume you want. Don't try maximum volume immediately because it could damage your speakers. Gain increases the volume past your devices maximum volume, however, having this setting too high for a prolonged period may damage your phone's speaker.


Also, having the gain too high can make the volume seem saturated. You'll come to another screen in which you can ""reprogram"" the maximum volume of your phone.

, If all else fails and you still want an increase of volume, you may resort to purchasing an amplifier, such as a Boostaroo, that plugs into your headphone jack. These are ideal for motorcycle speakers, or if you want to be able to plug multiple accessories into your audio jack while maintaining high output.

, Move your audio file to your computer using an SD card, USB cable, or another device used for transfer. Increase the volume of the file on your computer using an audio editing program.


For example, if you have a music file that's not very loud, plug your phone into the computer using a usb cable, find the file on your phone (usually the song name followed by .mp3). From there, import the file into an audio editor and amplify the file as much as you like. Then transfer the file back to your phone.

, Go to the market icon on your phone, type in ""Advanced Task Killer"" and download it. It is free. Once you have downloaded it, put it on your home screen. Click it and you will see a list of every app and task that is running on your EVO. Some of these apps on your EVO will turn on automatically with no rhyme or reason. Unless you see the apps running, you would have no idea. These apps are bleeding the battery life of your phone dry! Simply check every app you want to kill and then tap ""Kill selected apps."" This will save you big time on your battery life and it is free.

, This is free. Once again, go to the market place icon on your phone, type in ""Battery Status Pro"" and download it. There is a paid and free version. You only need the free version. Put this on your home screen once you download it. Tap it and you will see a complete breakdown of the battery life left on your phone. You get down to the second time left on your battery in various modes from Standby Time, Talktime, Internet Use (with or without Wi-Fi), etc. This app will let you know exactly how much time you have for whatever you want to do. This is a great way to budget your battery life so you do not waste it on something you do not need.

, Users can adjust the frequency to which the network searches for your emails. If you have your EVO searching for your emails every 5 minutes, those searches every few minutes will help drain your battery. Go to Messages, tap the Menu button at the bottom-More- Settings-Send & Receive-Set download frequency. Here you can adjust the network to check for new mail every 5-60 minutes. Depending upon the account and how frequently you need to see new email, try every 30 minutes. Now you can always open your messages in the meantime which will automatically refresh and bring up any new mail. However, this tiny adjustment will help save quite a bit of battery life throughout the day.

, The EVO offers a ton of great apps for social networking. Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter all have their own apps. This makes life a lot easier if you are as involved with the social networks. However, a default setting on most of these apps will keep them on indefinitely which will give you immediate notifications across your network. This is all well and good but that tiny luxury will kill your battery life. Make sure you have these apps all set not to automatically update. To make sure, tap your Advanced Task Killer and kill them if they are running.

, If you are busy or won't need the phone immediately, just simply tap the button on the very top of your phone. This puts your phone into sleep mode. Your phone is still on and you will hear notifications, but you will save hours on your battery life by leaving the EVO in standby mode. Additionally, make sure your home screen times out at some point in case you forget to do this manually. Go to the Menu button on bottom and then Settings - Sound & Display - Screen timeout. Here you have the option to have your home shut down anywhere from 15 seconds to never.

, You can no longer manipulate system settings without specific permission from the user. Future releases of Android will require you to issue an “Intent to launch the appropriate Settings configuration screen,” allowing the user to change the settings themselves.

, Layouts with view hierarchies of more than 10 deep or 30 broad can causes crashes.

, Applications that assume a user has a certain hardware feature can cause compatibility issues. If your application is designed specifically for a certain hardware feature such as a physical keyboard, it should be equally as useful to users without that specific hardware feature.

, Issues with automatic reorientation is often due to applications assuming the screen can only rotate when a physically keyboard is exposed. You should ensure your apps could be reoriented on any hardware and at any time. Also, apps that require shaking motions and other physical gestures requiring the device’s accelerometer may interfere with reorientation.

It is just good form to set up a price range for yourself before setting out to buy a new device of any kind.;
, Once you have decided on the make and model, and if you already have a contract with a cell phone carrier, you can go on to their website and see if they have the one you chose in stock. Normally, when an existing client wants to purchase a new device, carriers will have a special price for them.


If you don’t have an existing phone carrier, you might want to do some research online to check out prices from the different carriers in your city/country. Since you are only going to use the device with WiFi, the service the carrier provides shouldn’t matter in your decision.

, If you are trying to find a good device and don’t want to pay a lot of money for it, this is a good way to go. People sometimes sell their used phones on the internet after they get a brand new one, and usually they’re in pretty good shape. You do want to be sure you are getting a phone that is in good condition, so check the ratings for the seller (usually this websites have a rating system), and ask about the return policy, if you are not happy with your purchase.

, Nowadays, cellphones are sold in a lot of different places, not only by phone carriers. A good option are the discount department stores. These stores usually have a technology department where, among other things, they sell smartphones with and without contracts. You can go on their website or just head to the nearest store near you to check out their prices.

, Sometimes, someone close to you is about to get a new phone and they don’t know what to do with their old one. Offer to buy it from them as soon as they get it deactivated. This is probably the easiest way to do this, with the obstacle that you have to find someone that is willing to sell you their old phone.

Download an app to make phone calls.,
Send texts and messages.",How to Get a WiFi Android Phone with No Contract2," Since your Android device doesn’t have a contract, that means you don’t actually have a phone service on it. However, this does not mean you won’t be able to use it to make calls. For this you would have to download one or more apps that will allow you make calls from your phone to other phones. The most used apps for this are Whatsapp, Viber and Skype. Facebook also has an option of calling through the Facebook chat app, but you won’t actually be calling a phone number. The person you call through the Facebook app will receive a voice call through the app, it won’t go through as a regular phone call. On Skype, you will have to buy credits to be able to make phone calls.


This will only work if you are connected to a WiFi network. Since you don’t have a contract, you don’t have cellular data available, so having WiFi is absolutely necessary.

, Again, since you don’t have cellular data on your device, you will have to rely on texting apps to get a hold of your friends and family. Facebook Chat, WhatsApp and Skype are the most popular.


As with the calls, you need to be connected to a WiFi network to be able to use the messaging apps. No WiFi connection, no fun!

You just need the ""SDK Tools only"" package, not the entire development environment. Download and run the installer for your operating system.

, Use your standard USB cable to connect your Android device. Install any drivers that you may be prompted to install.

, If you didn't have this turned on already during the root process, you'll need to enable USB debugging now.Open the Settings app and tap ""About phone.""
Tap the ""Build number"" entry seven times to enable the hidden ""Developer options"" menu.
Open the new ""Developer options"" menu at the bottom of the previous screen.
Enable ""USB debugging.""

, ADB runs through the Command Prompt. The best way to launch it is to find it using Windows Explorer first.


Navigate to the folder you installed ABD to. By default, it is C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools.
Hold ⇧ Shift and right-click in the folder.
Select ""Open command window here"". This will launch the Command Prompt at the current location.

, Once you're in the Command Prompt, you can tell ADB to retrieve the list of apps installed on your device. Type the following into the Command Prompt:


Type adb shell and press ↵ Enter. This will start a dedicated command prompt for your device.
Type cd system/app and press ↵ Enter. This will open the apps folder on your device.
Type ls and press ↵ Enter. This will display a list of all of the apps installed on your device.

, The list of apps will likely be fairly large. Scroll through the list and find the app you want to remove. Note the entire file name of the app.

, Type rm AppName.apk and press ↵ Enter to remove the app. You can repeat this for any other apps you want to remove.Type reboot and press ↵ Enter after you are finished removing apps to reboot your phone and finish the process.

Do you only need your phone for phone calls, texting, and Facebook? If so, most phones today have these options and you can save money by purchasing cheaper phones for these purposes.
Is the phone going to be used for multimedia and gaming? If so, a mid-range to high-end flagship phone will be in order. These tend to have more storage for taking HD pictures and video, as well as higher level processors and cameras.;
, There can be a lot of different facts to be stated about computer processors. A few basics can help a user to make the best decision.



Cores. The more cores a processor has, the faster it will be (dual core, quad core, etc.) Many phones today run quad core processors; however, great deals can be found with dual core phones, as they contain older technology but are perfect for basic phone tasks. Some Android phones with dual core processors include the LG Realm, Motorola Luge, and the LG L60. Phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5, Motorola Droid Turbo, the HTC Desire and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 have quad core processors.

Clock speed. On most advertisements for phones, the clock speed of the processor will be displayed. This is measured in gigahertz (Ghz). The higher the number, the faster the device, for the most part.

, There are two basic types of memory on a phone: main storage and RAM.


The main storage is where applications, media (pictures, videos, etc.) are stored.
RAM is always the smaller of the two memory types. RAM is basically live, active, memory that the phone uses to run multiple apps all at once. Many high-end flagship phones run high amounts of RAM for gaming and multimedia.
The average phone today comes with 16GB (gigabytes) of storage; however, the amount of RAM can be different. It ranges from 3GB to 512MB for older, more basic phones. (1GB is 1,000 MB.)
Generally, the higher the amount of GB in the phone, for either storage or RAM, the more expensive it will be.

, The camera in a phone measures the picture quality based on megapixels (MP); this is called the resolution. While this should not be the only factor, it is an important one. iPhones generally come with an 8MP camera (sometimes called a shooter). For Android, this is more mid-range. Android phones can come with a 2MP–20MP shooter. The Samsung Galaxy Note, the Google Nexus 6, and the Samsung Galaxy S5 are a few Android phones that have particularly good cameras.


The more MP, the better the quality of the camera.
Generally, the more MP, the more space will be taken up in storage for each picture or video taken.
Many newer phones come with two different cameras, one facing the user (front-facing) and one facing away (back camera). The front-facing camera will have a lower resolution, usually around 2MP or so. It is mostly used for self-portrait and video calls.
Video quality is also important. Most phones with an 8MP back camera will shoot in HD (high definition) video, giving clear, crisp video. However, a few phones with lower MP front-facing cameras are capable of this as well.

, The screen on today’s phones is a very important feature for many users. Lower-resolution screens can make many pictures, videos, and games look grainy. There are a few basic things to understand when choosing the right screen.


Is it HD or not? There are two different numbers associated with screen resolution, and they should be displayed like this: 1280 x 720. This particular resolution is the lowest HD screen available. Anything lower is not considered to be HD.
Generally, the higher the resolution, the sharper the screen.
Today, high-end phones can come with QHD screens. These can have resolutions as high as 2560 x 1440.
A final important factor is the pixels per inch (PPI) measurement. The PPI of a screen determines how sharp the display is when zoomed in. Edges of text and the like can become grainy even on HD screens that have a low PPI. However, this number is not very important for the basic functions of your phone, such as Facebook, texting, or email.

, There are many different places to purchase an Android phone. A few are online stores, mobile carriers, and electronics stores. These will all have different ranges in deals and packages for different phones. Make sure to compare pricing differences between each market.


Online markets can be unsafe. However, places like Ebay have user protection to safeguard user information and ensure that returns and refunds are enforced.
Online markets are also much more likely to have older, or more basic, phones available than other markets.

, Do not simply pick up a phone and buy it. Make sure to compare phones to each other. Look at the specifications and price of each phone to weigh each phone’s strengths and weaknesses.

, Some good deals can be passed over when searching for the perfect phone. Having a technologically inclined friend who respects the buyers point of view can be a of great help. Buy that new Android phone and enjoy!

, Any picture taken by your camera or other camera app will be stored in the DCIM folder.

, If you've downloaded a file using a web browser like Chrome or Firefox, your downloaded file will likely be located in the Download folder. Certain apps may place downloads made with that app inside the app's folder instead of the Download folder.

, One of the main benefits of a file manager app is the control you have over your files. Press and hold a file to select it. You can then perform a variety of different tasks, including moving, copying, or deleting the file. When you select to ""Move"" a file, you will be given the opportunity to navigate to the location you want to move it to.


Press and hold a file and then tap additional files to add them to the selection. You can then manipulate or move all of the files at once.

, Tapping a file will allow you to open it. You'll be shown a list of apps that support the file if you haven't opened that file type before.


You may be able to select ""Open as"" from the file's menu, which will allow you to choose a different app to open the file with. This can be really useful if you are trying to use an app that isn't showing up on the regular list of compatible apps.

, Another popular use for file managers is their built-in ZIP support. Most file managers can extract ZIP files so that you can access the contents. You can also usually select multiple files and create a ZIP archive from the selection menu. This is great if you need to send multiple files to someone.

Know when you need to use it.,
Understand how the PUK code works.,
Check the SIM card packaging.,
Call your network provider.,
Check online through your network provider.,
Enter the PUK code into your mobile phone.,
Enter a new pin code.",How to Determine Your Mobile Puk Code," If you have a PIN number on your SIM card as an extra security measure, you'll need to type the PIN number in each time you turn on your phone. Otherwise, the PUK code is needed only if you enter the SIM card pin code wrong too many times.A message will appear on your phone saying your PUK is locked. At this point, you will need to enter your PUK code or you won't be able to access the phone.
If you also enter the PUK code wrong 3 times, the SIM card will be locked. If you enter the wrong PUK code 10 times or more, then you will need a new SIM card. Some phones call this a PUC code instead, but it’s the same thing. The code is 8 digits long.;
, A PUK code (personal unlocking key) is a key that is used to protect your mobile SIM card. Keep in mind that the PUK code is unique to your SIM card.


There are a few other reasons why you might want to know your PUK code; the most common is if you're moving from one network service provider to another but want to keep the same mobile number.
Working out your PUK code is normally very simple although it can vary depending on who your current provider is. Make sure you write it down somewhere so that you don't forget it once you get it, and also be aware that some service providers limit the length of time the PUK code will be active.
A PUK is a second level of security on a SIM card. The PUK code is unique to the SIM inside the phone and not the phone itself. The PUK is kept by the network operator.

, If you have recently purchased a SIM card, then look on the packaging. Sometimes the PUK card is printed on it.


Look at the box that your SIM card came in, and the PUK code should be there on the box or label.
You could also call the retailer you have purchased the phone from if you can’t find this code, and they should be able to assist

, The PUK code is unique to your SIM card, so you can only get this from your mobile network. Sometimes the network will give you this when you first get the SIM card, but not all networks do this.


If you cannot find it, give your mobile network a call, and customer support will be able to give you the PUK code or generate a new one after you have answered some security questions.The network provider is going to ask you to prove your identity. Sometimes, this entails providing your date of birth and address. You won’t be able to get the PUK code if you can’t prove that you own the phone. You might be asked for the SIM card code from its packaging too., You can try online to find your PUK code as long as you have an online account through your network provider (most offer this service).Log in to your mobile phone account on your computer and look for a PUK code section on your account page. Where this appears will vary among network providers. For AT&T Wireless, you log into the AT&T online account. Select “wireless” from the “myAT&T” tab at the top of the page. Select “phone/device.” Select: “Unblock Sim card.” A new page will open that provides your PUK card.Some prepaid phones also use PUK codes and will provide them to you online if you know the mobile number and the name and date of birth of the account holder.If you don’t already have an online account, it’s usually easy to create one if you have your mobile number and basic information to prove your identity.

, You will usually see a notification show up on the phone that will prompt you to enter your PUK code.


Follow the instructions on the phone to complete the process.
Different mobile phones will have different steps, but most will inform you they've locked the phone down and that you need to type in the PUK code.

, If you’ve had to enter your PUK code because you had the PIN code wrong, once you enter the PUK code, you will need to input a new PIN for the SIM card.


After you have done so, your cell phone should be unlocked, and you will be able to use it again.
Some phone users must enter **05* before entering the PUK code. Then, enter the 8-digit PUK card and hit enter. Nexus One users should type in the **05*, their PUK number, *, their new PIN number, *, their new PIN number again, #."

Take a look at the images on this post, to see some different Android devices.

, When the device is unlocked, you should see many different coloured tiles, on a plain background. These tiles may be animated, and show data as it is received. In the top right, a small white arrow is visible. Tap this, scroll to settings, find the about section and you will see what version of the OS you are running. These phones are relatively new, and there are not many on the market yet.

, There are so many different Mobile Operating Systems, it would be difficult to list them all. Take a look at the images to see whether your phone matches any. It could be Symbian or WebOS or many more!

Track your daily food intake.,
Try a recipe app.,
Find healthier food alternatives.,
Look up restaurant food nutritional information.,
Send yourself reminders.",How to Use Your Smart Phone to Improve Your Health1," One of the easiest ways to improve your health with a smartphone is to track your daily food intake. Writing down what you eat helps you identify unhealthy eating habits, become aware of your daily nutritional intake, and makes you accountable for what you eat. Many apps, such as MyFitnessPal and MyNetDiary, will allow you to input foods you eat. The app will compile a daily total of calories, fat, carbs, sugar, protein, and other nutrients.Many of these apps allow you to input weight loss goals. By giving the app your current weight, goal weight, and number of pounds you want to lose a week, the app will provide you with a daily calorie goal to lose weight.
Most apps let you input food from a searchable database, scan barcodes on food packages, and input nutritional information manually.
There are many apps available for free for both Apple and Android devices.;
, Recipe apps can be helpful when trying to make healthier food options for your family. Apps, like Yummly, offer numerous recipes that can help you achieve your fitness goals. They let you search by type of food, like Italian, Asian, or Mexican, or by main ingredient. Some apps will also allow you to choose gluten-free, paleo, healthy, quick, or low-carb options.


Some of these apps give you an option to build a grocery list you can consult when you go shopping.
You can also find apps specifically geared towards your health concerns. There are apps for healthy diabetes recipes, vegetarian and vegan recipes, and low carb or sugar recipes.
Many apps are available for free for Android and Apple.

, When you are shopping, your smartphone can help you make better food choices. You can search online for suggestions to make healthy alternative or to find similar foods with less calories and fat or without certain ingredients., Smartphones are not only great for apps. Smartphones also give you access to the internet, which can come in handy when you are trying to eat healthy. Most restaurants disclose the nutritional information of their item menus online. This is useful when you are tracking your calories or just trying to make healthy options.


Just search for the restaurant’s name and the words “nutritional information” to find calorie, fat, sugar, carbs, and cholesterol content.
Browsing restaurant nutrition information can be an eye opening experience. Many so-called “healthy” food options, such as salads, have more fat and calories than other menu items because of dressings and toppings. You can also compare similar item menus, choosing one that has significantly less fat and calories.

, Everyone needs extra motivation. Your smartphone can provide that motivation for you. Set up your phone so you get daily texts or calendar reminders of your healthy eating goals. These reminders can have a motivational message, a visualization of your weight loss progress, or even just a message to eat more fruits and vegetables.For example, your text might say, “Making healthy choices today means you are one step closer to a healthier you!”
Another text might say, “You can do it! 1500 calories of yummy, healthy food. How awesome is that?”
You might remind yourself of your goals: “Three weeks, three pounds down! Look at how great you are!”
Your message could be something simple like, “Make healthy choices!” or “Don’t get fries when you go to lunch with the office” or “Eat 5 servings of fruits and veggies.”

If you just got a brand new TI-84, take it out of the box.
,
Take off the back piece and place four AAA batteries into the calculator.

,Slide it back into it the case.,
If you're using any of the newer TI-84 C editions, you will need to plug the calculator into the charging port and wait a few minutes for it to charge.,
Get to know the layout.,
Go ahead and play around with the calculator by pressing some buttons.,
Now that we know how to type in our calculator, we can now use the graphing function, the main feature of this calculator.,
Now if you don’t like looking at a graph, you can make the calculator show the same function as a table.,
The TI-84 can also graph out a piece-wise functions.","How to Use a TI‐84 Calculator (Plus, Silver and C Editions)",",,, You can find the charging port located at the bottom of the calculator indicated by a USB symbol.

, Once the batteries are in place, you may now turn on the calculator. At the bottom left corner, there is a button that says ""On."" Go ahead and press it to begin using the calculator.

The basic layout is comprised of white colored buttons for the numbers, and gray colored buttons for the basic operation symbols. All the black color buttons are for programs and other operations such as log, natural log (ln), and the trig functions.
At the top, there is a blue color button labeled ""2nd."" This feature will let you use any of the subscripts labeled above every button. For example, if we want to use the π icon above the ""^"" button, we would have to press the ""2nd"" key and then the ""^"" key for the calculator to display a π symbol on the screen.

, To solve the expression, ""2+5,"" you would have to press the appropriate buttons that would show ""2+5"" on the calculator screen before pressing enter to get the answer of ""7"" to appear on your screen. For a negative number, we would have to use the (-) symbol down by the enter button.


For example, you know that negative two multiplied by negative five is ten. To enter this into the calculator, you would press the (-) symbol and use parentheses before pressing the other appropriate buttons for ""2x5"" and enter to see the answer -10 appear on the screen. In order to use parentheses (found above the ""8"" and ""9"" number buttons), you would type the open parentheses first and the close parentheses after whatever expression intended to be calculated inside of those parentheses
For practice, solve the problem, six divided by two raised to the third power. You would type (6/3)^3 and then press the enter key after, in order for the calculator to accurately solve for the value of this expression.

, To use the graphing feature, we have to press the ""y="" button located at the very top left of the calculator. This option lets us write in our function. Almost any kind of function will work if there is no syntax error when writing in the equation. To write the unknown variable, use the x button located next to alpha (labeled as X,T,theta,n).


For example, write in the equation, x^2+x-2. To see the graph, press the graph button located at the top right corner. The calculator will graph out the function, and you can scroll around the graph by using the left and right arrow buttons.
If you want the calculator to tell you where the graph is at zero, you can press ""2nd"" and then ""trace"" for it to give you a list of options to calculate values on the graph. Now scroll down to where it says zero. This will take you back to the graph and allow scrolling towards different values where one is positive and one is negative.







, By pressing ""2nd"" and then ""graph,"" the same function will now be presented as a table of values. You can scroll up and down to see what values you would need.

, Piece-wise functions are functions with varied conditions. For example, this piece-wise function shows three different parts but is defined as one function. Y=x^2 if x<2.  Y=6 if x= and Y=10-x if x>2 and x is less than or equal to 6.


The idea behind graphing these kinds of functions is similar to graphing regular functions, but now you have to include more parentheses in our function. Graph Y=x^2 on your calculator. You would add parentheses to your function and your conditions. Now write on y1, ""(x^2)(x<2)."" To write the greater than or less than button, press 2nd math, and a list of commands will appear. Now, do the same thing for other three conditions.






Y2=6 (x=2) and y3=(10-x)(x>2)(x >or equal to 6)   Once they're all in place, they can be shown on the graph and table.

See how others react to your smartphone use.,
Consult with family and friends.",How to Know if You're Addicted to Your Smart Phone," Every individual with a cell phone looks for notifications of email, messages, “likes” on social media, or missed calls. But what may seem like harmless checking may be a bigger problem, especially if you peek at your smartphone every couple of minutes.Asking yourself the following questions may help you realize that you have an addiction:


Have I been pulled over for texting and driving?
Do I use red lights to answer social media posts?
Do people tell me to get off of my phone and pay attention to them?
Do I use my smartphone at inappropriate times, such as at doctor’s appointments or meetings with my kid’s teacher?
Is my smart phone always in my hand or close by?Does my battery last through the day?
Does the smart phone join me in the bathroom.
Do I use my smart phone in social situations, such as dinners with colleagues?
Is my smartphone use causing considerable problems in my life such as legal issues, falling grades, or isolation from loved ones?Does it take me much longer to complete tasks now because I'm checking my cell phone repeatedly?
Have I found it difficult to make conversation with people face-to-face?;

Sleeping problems
Craving access to your smartphone

, You may find it difficult to ask yourself questions about your smartphone use. You might even forget every now and then. Keeping track of when you reach for or use your smartphone can help you figure out if you have a problem. This can be the first step in controlling your addiction.Write a note or make a symbol in a notebook any time you pick up your smartphone.
Download one of the many new apps that actually track your smartphone use. Apps such as BreakFree and Moment automatically track your smartphone use. Such sites also allow you to track progress you make with your addiction.Look at your social media accounts, which often indicate the last time you logged in. If it was only a few minutes prior, you may be addicted. Consider the question, “Do I always look for how many people liked and commented on my post?”
You ma also consider if you do this in other areas of your life. Try asking yourself, ""Are there other things that I do as frequently?"" and ""How does time spent on my smartphone measure up to time I spend working, with my children, or doing other activities?""

, If you’ve recognized considerable smartphone use, it’s important to know why. Figuring out specific situations that make you reach for your device can help you remove yourself from them or stop using your smartphone during these times. You can use an app that tracks your use to detect patterns or do it yourself.Ask yourself the following questions to recognize patterns of use:


When do I reach for my phone?
Is there some reason in particular I reach for my phone? Is it boredom? Stress? Anxiety? Or another underlying issue?
Do I pick up my smartphone because other people are picking up theirs?
Have I been addicted to other behaviors, items, or substances in the past?

, How others respond when you reach for your phone can be a great indicator of an addiction. Listen to what others say or do with their bodies to cue you into a potential problem.Look at how people react when you reach for your phone. Do they roll their eyes or sigh? Body language such as crossing arms, huffing or sighing, looking at anything but you, turning away from you, rubbing their faces in exasperation, or giving you “death stares” may indicate that people think you have a problem.
Listen to what people say when your reach for your phone. If a friend says, “Come on, Teddy, focus on me,” or “Can’t you put that thing down for one minute,” the person may be subliminally telling you that you have a smartphone addiction.
Watch people’s body language when you are in a group and the center of attention.

, If you’ve recognized typical signs of a smartphone addiction but are still unsure, talk to a trusted family member or friend. Open up about your concerns and ask if the person has noticed any potential problems with your smartphone use. The answer may be painful to hear, but someone who cares for you will give you an opinion in a way that won’t hurt your feelings. The person may even help you curb an addiction.Ask family members if your behavior is related to something such as tension in the family. Approach the question gently. For example, “Hey Al, I think I may be addicted to my smartphone. I’m wondering if it’s because of it distracts me from all of the problems with mom. Have you noticed any problems with my smartphone use? Could we spend some time talking about it?”
Understand that it is hard to ask someone about your smartphone addiction. Sometimes, the person may be reluctant to answer. Approach the situation delicately. Say, “Callie, I need your opinion. I think I have an addiction to my smartphone. Do you think I do? Please be honest. I know it’s hard, but I really value your opinion. I know what you say comes from the heart.”
You may also want to ask friend and family if they have noticed a decline in your real-life relationships or social skills due to your smartphone use. Ask them to provide you with examples of anything they have noticed.

, Backing up your data simply means keeping a duplicate data of all the data in your smartphone. There are many viruses in the internet nowadays that can just blast off your smarty pants to heaven. So if you keep a backup, then you can just not make a big deal out of it as you've a backup.

, Mostly, as a matter of fact, all the smartphones have the power of multitasking, which basically means that you can run may applications all at once. While this an advantage for many, it is a disadvantage of some of us. Mostly, we forget to shut down the applications which we've used and use some other applications. While on the background, the other application is running and we are not using it, it'll only take the juices out of the smartphone. For example, many of us switch on the Bluetooth or WiFi search even though we not need it at that particular moment. So quick note: Shut down the applications correctly after using them.

, Smartphones are commonly used for accessing the internet than making calls so that calls for a good internet browser that can making make our internet experience much more better. While it is obvious that smartphones are supposed to come with a smart browser,most of them don't. So always install a smart browser in your smart phone. Google Chrome, Opera, Firefox, UC Browser may be some guys that can help you get through it.


As mentioned earlier, viruses are everywhere in the Internet. So while accessing internet from your smart guy, it may suck in some viruses.They may enter through a browser, not just any browser, a bad browser with very less security. So installing a smart browser will help you though a great start from getting away from these malwares.

, If you are security conscious and still don't trust your smart browser from protecting you from the viruses, just install an anti-virus in your smartphone. Anti-virus for smartphones are spreading like wildfire so you should get yourself one too.


Always buy an antivirus that is good. Go to sites line www.Cnet.com to check the reviews of anti-virus and then only buy it. Don't just buy an anti-virus out just from the wind. Remember 'less money, more work'
Nowadays, there are a lot of fake antiviruses in the market. Yeah! You read that right, fake antivirus.These fake anti-viruses tell you that they can be downloaded it for free which is true. Now, they don't kill viruses they make viruses. So beware of these types.

, Most of us have a list of tons and tons of people in our contact list. Long Story Short: Just delete all the contacts of people to whom you are never going to contact. It's a waste of very little amount of space on your device and it also make your contact list a little longer, which can make it harder for you to search for other contacts.

, Most of us get a lot of messages from our friends, parents and lovers. These messages just fill up our inbox and makes it a junk box. What must be done is, just delete these messages after you're done reading them. Of course, don't delete them if they're highly confidential or from a very 'special one' whose memory you want to keep on your device.

, After all the hard work that your device does for you, you can do it a favor and buying it new clothes or as some would put it, skin. Skins are not only new clothes for your smarty, it also make them look attractive plus as a bonus, when you drop your smartphone for whatsoever reason, this skin may just be little protective as a shield or something.

, Black markets.. what are they? In simple worlds, they are just these fake markets, that's all. As a smartphone user you must have come across an app market or the famous store icon in your smarty boy's face. That store is the place where you download new apps, songs wallpapers, etc on your smartphone. And these 'black markets' are also those type of markets. No won't charge you extra money to download stuffs, they make you download stuffs for free even, but beware, these black markets also send a viruses in that thing you're downloading which can make your smartphone dumb.

, After all the inner details and giving much power to your device from inside, now look at the outer side. Your smartphone is always vulnerable to all those dusts and pollution which can damage your smart phone from inside. So you need to clean them too.

Install your GPS unit on your boat properly.,
Familiarize yourself with your GPS device.,
Ensure the proper map is installed on your device.,
Know the basic functions of the GPS or Chartplotter device.",How to Use a Marine GPS," There are two types of marine GPS units ones with internal antennas and units with external antennas. The GPS devices with internal antennas are used on smaller boats with no top or cover since the receiver is built into the unit and it needs direct line of site to the satellites providing the signal to the device. The second ones are the external antenna units. In those cases, make sure the antenna is installed on top of the hard cover of the vessel and it has direct line of site to the satellites. In addition, the external antenna needs to be wired back to your GPS console as well and connected to your GPS receiver as well.;
, Read the owner's manual of your device and get familiar with the particular model of GPS you own. Since the basic principals of operating a GPS are similar, there are differences between models how they function. Also reading the manual will educate you on the various terminologies that you may not understand otherwise.

, The map is an essential component of the GPS device so we can visualize and see where our vessel is located. There are multiple types of charts or maps out there, however the important part is to select or install the map of the particular region you navigate in. Regional maps provide better details than world maps for example. So you need the detailed map to be able to see in detail where you exactly at.

, Once everything is connected and the proper map is loaded on the unit now we are ready to navigate.


The screen will show a boat or a triangle on the map that is your vessel in relation to the map. The device should show your GPS coordinates and a scale of distance as well for your information.
Zoom in our out on the map by pushing the zoom in or out button on your device. The more you zoom in, the more specific details you get. However, your visibility of your surroundings is reduced so find a happy medium where you have enough details and you can see a few miles ahead as well.
Move the cursor (boat or triangle) to the desired destination you want to navigate to and mark your destination. Most of today's GPS units will automatically calculate the distance and time based on your speed of your boat to the destination set. In addition, you will see a line to your destination and the GPS will advise you if you are on course or if you need to compensate your heading to get to the desired destination.

Buy a smartphone or car GPS to get directions and your location.,
Open the ""Map."",
Click on ""My Location."",
Choose your destination address.,
Follow the GPS instructions to get to your location.",How to Use a GPS1," The GPS market is flooded with different devices, options, and features. Unless you plan on using your GPS in the wilderness or for research experiments, however, your smart phone or a car GPS, can provide directions and your location quickly and easily. Most have touch screens and come with a rechargeable battery.



Smart Phones: Most smart phones come pre-loaded with a ""Maps,"" or ""Directions"" app that uses GPS. If you do not have one, search and download an app, like Google Maps, from your app store to use GPS.GPS Devices: These are small, rectangular devices that specialize in driving directions and finding restaurants, airports, and other points of interest. Examples include TomTom and Garmin, and most cost under $170 dollars.;
, This is the basic screen for a GPS. It shows a location, usually with your current location at the center, and all of the roads and major landmarks nearby.

, Some GPS use touch screens, others have keypads, and some have scroll wheels and buttons. Click on the button labeled with a compass, navigational arrow, or crosshairs to show your current location.


Your location is sometimes stored under the heading ""Where am I?"" ""Favorite Locations,"" or ""Current.""
iPhone users can see their current location using the built-in Compass App. Make sure you ""Allow Location Services"" for the compass under ""Settings"" → ""Privacy"" → ""Location Services"" → ""Compass""

, Using the search bar found at the top of your GPS, type in the address you want to reach. Many touch screen GPS's let you choose a location by holding your finger on the location in the map.


Some GPS's will prompt you with a button labeled ""Get Directions."" Choose this if there is no search bar to input an address.
If you know the exact latitude and longitude of your trip, use these; they will give you the most accurate location possible.

, The GPS will give you directions at every turn you need to take. Don't worry if you miss a turn -- most GPS will auto-correct and give you a new route to get back on track.


If you are struggling to keep up, check your GPS's settings and make the ""Turn Warning Frequency"" setting longer -- giving you more time to hear the next direction.

Learn to read latitude and longitude coordinates.,
Mark your current location as a waypoint.,
Set waypoints in advance if there are no addresses.,
Plug your GPS into your computer to download the data.",How to Use a GPS2," Latitude and longitude are represented by numbers, known as degrees, which measure your distance from two ""zero lines."" Longitude measures your distance East or West of the prime meridian, and latitude measure your distance North or South of the equator. This is the most accurate system of measurement for your GPS.


An example (guess where it is!), is 37°26'46.9""N, 122°09'57.0""W.
Sometimes direction is noted by positive or negative numbers. North and East are considered positive. The previous example could be written as: 37°26'46.9"", -122°09'57.0""
If there is no notation, know that the latitude always comes first., Waypoints are saved in the GPS to be viewed later, allowing you to take notes, draw maps, and keep information on the landscape easily. On your GPS, click ""Save Location,"" ""Add to Favorites,"" or ""Mark Waypoint.""


Complex scientific GPS systems often let you mark specific waypoints -- artifacts, streams, rock formations, etc.
The more points your save into your GPS, the more accurate your map of the area when you get home.

, Plug in the longitude/latitude coordinates of water sources, campgrounds, or ranger stations under ""Get Directions"" or ""Find Location,"" then save them by clicking ""Add to Favorites."" You can now access it anytime. ""Add to Favorites"" might be labeled by a star or flag as well.
Click ""Saved Locations"" or ""Favorite Locations"" to see you waypoints anytime. You can click on them to get directions from anywhere in the world.

, Most complex GPS systems come with software that lets you save your data onto your computer. The program will import your way points and use them to make a map of the area you were in, complete with elevation data and any notes you made on your GPS.


If you are mapping a specific area, make as many waypoints as you can for an accurate map. The more data the program has, the better the final product.

Plug your GPS into an internet-enabled computer using the cord that came with the unit.
Perform an internet search for ""your GPS + Map Update"" follow the onscreen instructions., There are over 25 satellites orbiting earth that receive signals from your GPS and use those signals to determine your latitude and longitude. Developed by the army, GPS can accurately tell your location anywhere in the world by several feet -- as long as the signal can reach the satellites.Cell phone GPS uses cell towers and internet signals to find your location, so they won't work in the wilderness. , GPS needs a clear view of the sky to accurately communicate with the satellite's, so move away from overhangs or tall trees and head outside if you have issues. Generally, if you can see the sky, the GPS can as well.


Tunnels, caves, and basements may all keep your GPS from communicating to satellites and working successfully.

, Most GPS devices are built in Asia, and are used to communicating with satellites over that area. Initializing your GPS acquaints it with your local area. To initialize a GPS, go to ""Settings"" and click ""Initialize."" Follow your GPS's manual if you have any problems finding the setting, and know that this may take up to 20 minutes.


Turn your GPS off and restart it if you are having problems.
Make sure you have a clear view of the sky.
You may need to reset your GPS the first time you buy it by clearing the memory. Refer to the manual for instructions., This is especially useful when hiking. In the parking lot, find your GPS's satellite lock setting and have it get to work -- it usually takes several minutes.Signs that you have a bad signal are changing directions, jittery locations, or error messages., Because a GPS can run out of battery, lose signal, or break, you should never rely on it completely to get around. While useful, you need to be prepared in case you cannot use it for some reason. "

Find shops, restaurants, and events near you.,
Have fun Geocaching.,

Find a lost phone.",How to Use a GPS4," Most GPS devices can find much more than addresses these days. Try searching ""Indian Food,"" ""Post Offices,"" ""Gas,"" ""Rock Climbing Gyms,"" or whatever else you are interested in and see what pops up. This can be incredibly useful when you are in a new city, or if you just feel like finding the closest burrito shop.


Apps and Internet enabled GPS (like those found on phones) will always have this feature.
Many portable GPS devices have a section labeled ""Nearby Locations"" or ""Find Locations"" that list businesses within a short radius of your current location.

, Geocaching is when people hide objects in the world with GPS coordinates. It is a global community that prides itself on sharing and exploration, and can be a great way to see the outdoors. To Geocache, buy a GPS and sign up for one of the many internet-based services and forums.

, Most modern GPS devices and apps can be turned on while you run or bike, and store the information on your speed, elevation, and distance for later. You will need a specific app like NikeFit, MapMyRun, or AppleHealth to get the most out of this feature.

, Because smartphones are constantly hooked up to a GPS, you can use them to find lost or stolen phones if you act quickly. Download a tracking app on for your phone and sync it with your computer to always keep tabs on your phone's location.


Use ""Find my iPhone,"" by going to the Find my iPhone Website and inputting your Apple username.

, For a lot of the function keys, you will be performing them on numbers you input. Some calculators will perform the function on a number you've already entered, while others will perform it on the next number that is entered., Test out the button order on an easy and quick problem. For example, try taking the square root of 9. You should already know that the answer will be three, so this is a great tip to use in the middle of a test if you forget which order you're supposed to be pressing buttons.

Press 9 and then the checkmark key. If nothing happens, press the checkmark key and then press 9.
Some calculators will add parentheses to the calculation, such as √(3. You will need to add the closing parenthesis ) before completing the calculation.
You may have to press the equals key to see the results.

, Another good test for button order is using the yx function. Since it involves two numbers, you'll want to ensure you know which order they go in. Try performing a simple test, such as 23. If you get 8 as the answer, then you did it in the right order. If you got 9, then you actually did 32., When you are using the SIN, COS, or TAN functions, you will have to keep in mind two different things: the order of the button presses, and radians versus degrees.

Perform a simple SIN function with an easy to remember answer. For example, the sine of 30° is 0.5. Determine if you need to enter 30 first or press sin first.
Check your answer. If you get 0.5, then your calculator is set to display in degrees. If your answer is -.988, then your calculator is set to radians. Look for the Mode button to switch.

, Things can get a bit more complicated when you start entering longer equations into your calculator. You will need to take order into consideration, and will often make use of the () keys. Try entering the following equation into your calculator: 3^4/(3+(25/3+4*(-(1^2))))

Note how many parentheses are necessary to keep the formula intact. Proper parentheses use is essential to successfully using the calculator

, Saving your results and pulling them back later is an essential skill for dealing with longer problems. There are a couple of different ways to use stored information:

Use the Answer key to recall the last displayed answer to an equation. For example, if you just entered 2^4, you could subtract 10 from that result by pressing ANS + - + 1 + 0.
Use the M+ or STO (Store) keys to add values to the calculator memory. You can then use the REC or MR keys to recall that value from the memory for use in an equation."

Decide where to print.,
Frame and/or mat them.,
Use digital displays.,
Top tables with photo books.,
Rotate images.,
Create a collage of guests.,
Customize other decor with transferred images.",How to Decorate with Smartphone Photos1," If you're using the photos themselves to decorate your home, you have plenty of options when it comes to printing them out. Have your photos printed professionally in a variety of sizes if you like, either by bringing them to brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, or by signing up for online services that will ship them to you once you upload them, like FreePrints or PrintStudio. Or simply invest in a photo printer and either upload your photos to your computer or use a wireless printer to print them directly from your phone through WiFi.
, First, decide where to hang or mount your photos. Your options here are really only limited by your living space (or office space, or work space, or really anywhere you're free to decorate), so punch up your walls, shelves, end tables, bureaus, desks, or wherever else you please. You can always tack them up as is, but for a more elegant look, frame them, mat them, or do both to make them pop out that much more., Save money, space, and materials by uploading your photos to digital displays instead of printing and framing each one. Buy one or more digital frames that can store hundreds of different images apiece. Additionally, create slideshow screensavers on other devices, such as computers and smart TVs., Photo albums have long been a popular way of filling table space, but an advantage of smartphone photos is that you can easily upload them to online services that will custom-make a printed photo book for you. Compile archival photos covering your whole photo history with a nice hefty volume for your coffee table. Celebrate specific events or people with smaller brag books for your end tables.Online services offering these include:

Rag & Bone
My Publisher
Books to Me
Mosaic
Keepsy

, A major advantage of smartphone cameras and personal photo printers is being able to print countless new photos without having to finish a roll of film and then wait for someone to develop them. Incorporate this speedy aspect into your decor by dedicating a few frames to a steady rotation of brand new photos. Instead of (or in addition to) displaying permanent keepers, create timely displays celebrating recent events, which can then serve as instant conversation starters for guests. Examples include:

Activities that you or your family are involved in, like sports, performances, or church events.
Day trips, nights out, or whatever else you did last weekend.
Holidays and family gatherings.

, Another way to take advantage of the instant gratification of taking and printing smartphone photos is to adopt the old Polaroid technique of taking a picture of each new guest and adding them to a collage in your home. Make people feel even more welcome by celebrating their dropping by with an immediate portrait. For a more unified collage, consider:

Designating a certain area as a backdrop for each photo, like a blank wall or the front door.
Incorporating the collage itself into the photo by using that as the backdrop to create a visual chronological record of its growth over time.

, The internet offers a wide array of companies that offer new ways to display your photos through other means than picture frames. Upload your photos and use them to decorate your home through custom made items like:Beverage coasters
Throw pillows
Shower curtains
Photo blocks

These include:Instagram
Pixlr
Qwik

, If the idea of hanging a straight-up photo on the wall sounds a little boring, consider an app like Prisma. Run your photos through its style transfer to create new images that mimic the painting styles of various artists, including:Edvard Munch
Pablo Picasso
Vincent Van Gogh

, First, download PixelWakker. Then take a photo, which this app will then break down into a collection of dots. From there, you can then create a totally new striking image through four different effects:Dots
Lines

Color rain

, Another way to transform a photo into a more compelling image is use an app like Photochop. Import a photo and divide into separate tiles. Then create a new distorted image of your original photo by manipulating each tile. Options for each tile include:

Maximize natural light.,
Avoid multiple light sources.,
Diffuse harsh light in dark settings.,
Steady your camera.,
Take multiple photos of action scenes.",How to Decorate with Smartphone Photos3," Take photos of subjects facing sunlight whenever possible so details aren’t obscured in the shade. If you know you want to use a photo of someone in particular as part of your decor, ask them to pose a little after sunrise or during sunset so you can bring out their features with the warm tones that the sun imparts at these times of day. Additionally, be on the lookout for eye-catching ways to use particular beams of sunlight, like photographing someone in the shaft of light coming in through a window., Keep in mind that subjects lit by various lights at various angles will create a hodgepodge of shadows. Expect these conflicting shadows to catch the viewer’s attention more so than the subject itself. Whenever possible, limit yourself to a single light source so shadows are cast consistently, which makes for a more dramatic effect., Your smartphone may or may not have a flash, but even if it does, avoid using it if possible. It may light things up, but expect the quality to be unattractively harsh. As an alternative, cover a pocket flashlight or the flashlight feature on a second phone with a thin white napkin. Illuminate the subject with a softer light for a less jarring photo., Avoid taking photos with only a single hand holding your phone, since this increases the chance of it altering position slightly and losing focus. For best results, hold your camera in two hands and support your arms or elbows on a stable surface. Also keep your feet and legs in mind and squat a little to stabilize your center of gravity so you don’t sway a little without realizing it., If you’re trying to capture a dynamic action rather than a static subject (such as someone in the act of skateboarding instead of just posing with their skateboard in hand), use your phone’s digital storage to maximum effect. Instead of waiting to capture the “perfect shot,” take as many photos as you can without pausing. Then review them afterward and pick which ones work best."

Similarly with Sprint, as the Palm Pre only works with Sprint right now. If you are willing to change cell phone services (you can now take your number with you), then this should not be an issue. (Note: It is rumored that the Pre will come out with AT&T and Verizon later in 2009. Similarly, it is rumored that the iPhone will come out with a Verizon compatible version at some point in 2010).;
, Since mobile to mobile calls within one network are usually covered without counting towards your monthly minutes, you may find yourself spending a lot more minutes (and dollars) calling people depending on which carrier you choose.

,


One of the biggest differences between the Palm Pre and the iPhone is that the Palm Pre allows you to have multiple applications open at once.
The iPhone will only let you use one application at a time, and forces you to completely quit what you are doing if you need to use another application. For example, that means you can't be logged into IM while you are look at a map on the iPhone. On the Pre, this would be no issue.
The iPhone has been out longer so if you desire access to a lot of applications, then the iPhone might be a better choice right now.

,


The Palm Pre can sync with multiple contact lists (Facebook, your computer, Outlook) and will merge them together seamlessly.
The iPhone can only sync with one contact list at a time.

The Palm Pre has a keyboard with little keys on it, so it is a bit easier to type on.
The iPhone does not have a keyboard, instead you type via a keyboard that shows on the touch screen.

Download a security or locator app.",How to Prevent Your GPS Enabled Cell Phone from Being Lost or Stolen," Are you someone who likes to have their cell phone handy at all times? Keeping it in your pocket or purse is fine, but if you sit down at a table or in a bar, setting your phone down on the table can set you up to forget it later, like the guy who forgot his iPhone 4S. Keep your phone on your person at all times. If you’re someone who doesn’t need it with you all the time, you might want to consider leaving it in the car if you’re going into a bar or sporting event, or other place where it could be easily lost or stolen. If you do leave it in the car, be sure to keep it somewhere out of sight, like in the glove compartment. If a thief sees a $500 smartphone sitting in plain view, you might end up losing a cell phone and having to pay for a broken window!;
, In the event that your phone is stolen, having your serial number can be a big help. With it, you might be able to call the manufacturer and report the phone as stolen, so if someone sends it in for repairs, it can be returned to you! For example, if someone steals your iPhone and you have the serial number, you can report it to Apple. Then, if the thief brings the phone in for repairs at an Apple Store, they will know it’s yours!

, There are a number of apps you can download that allow you to track your GPS-enabled cell phone, lock it remotely, remotely erase your private data, and so on.


If you are an iPhone user, Apple's Find My iPhone can do all of these things. Find My iPhone also works for iPad and iPod Touch when connected to WiFi.

Consult the owner's manual on the type of antenna your GPS has.,
Get away from obstructions.,
Orient your patch antenna properly.,
Orient your quadrifilar helix antenna.,
Hold your GPS receiver at shoulder height.,
Turn and face different directions.",How to Get Better Accuracy with a Handheld GPS1," Since antenna positioning is very important for accuracy it is good to be sure about what type of antenna you have. There are commonly two types - patch and quadrifilar helix antennas. The first one is built into the device and the other one is external. Remember to always point your antenna (regardless the type) towards the sky. , Since GPS depends on satellite data it’s best to make sure nothing obstructs the signal between them. When trying to get a lock on your position with your GPS receiver be sure to stay away from trees, buildings, and other natural or man-made obstructions that can reflect or block the signal, thus degrading accuracy. The goal is to both be in view of as many satellites at once as possible and to get a clear signal.

, GPS antennas may have different designs that can give you better signal from their certain positioning. Chances are you have a patch antenna in your GPS receiver (you can confirm it using a manual).Holding your GPS flat with a patch antenna will give you the best signal.

, Hold your GPS erect if you have quadrifilar helix antenna.

, Even if you are standing in an open spot your own body may block the signal, so elevating your device to a shoulder height will give you better accuracy.

, When you are in an open field and have your GPS positioned properly the only other thing you can do to improve accuracy is to turn and face different directions in order to increase the number of satellites in view. The more satellites 'see' your device the better and faster your GPS will provide position information."
"
Turn on ""position averaging"".,
Adjust averaging setting to collect more points.,
Stand still during the averaging.,
Use manual waypoint averaging.",How to Get Better Accuracy with a Handheld GPS2," This is a feature that allows your GPS to take measurements about once a second and calculate an average position before saving it in the GPS receiver's memory. It is needed if you want to pinpoint a specific location. Three minutes of averaging should provide enough measurements to improve the accuracy of your position. , If you are located in an obstructed area you may need more data to pinpoint your location more accurately. Thus if your GPS is collecting just two or three points (coordinates) you should set it to ten or twenty. The longer you stay still and the more data you gather, the better accuracy you may get. , Your accuracy can get worse if you move (especially fast) while collecting points. If you are under a tree canopy or in other obstructed area be patient and gather as much data as possible to get most accurate reading of your position., Instead of using an averaging feature on your GPS you can record your waypoint (fixed position) coordinates over the course of several days and average them by adding up the last numbers of your recorded coordinates and dividing the total by the number of readings (times you recorded the coordinates)."

Make sure your GPS receiver is WAAS compatible.,
Turn on WAAS or your region-specific augmentation system.,
Make sure a WAAS satellite is visible to your GPS.,
Make use of the GLONASS system in obstructed locations.",How to Get Better Accuracy with a Handheld GPS3," There are some region-specific augmentation systems that can make your GPS more accurate. For instance, Wide Area Augmented System or WAAS was designed for North America. It provides corrected GPS signal through its network of satellites and ground stations. You can find out available systems in your GPS Menu > Setup > System.


There is a European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service or EGNOS for Europe
Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) for Asia
GPS-Aided GEO Augmented Navigation System or GAGAN for India
System for Differential Corrections and Monitoring SDCM is in development for Russia , You don't need any additional equipment. Just press Menu button (twice, if necessary), choose Setup > System and choose the augmentation system you want. You can use WAAS outside the US but the data will not be corrected thus it won't be as accurate., Since not all satellites are WAAS-enabled you may not always benefit from the system. Trees and other obstructions may also prevent you from getting a corrected signal, so be sure to stay in the open unobstructed areas away from trees, cliffs, and basins., GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigatsionnay Sputnikovaya Sistema) is a Russian Global Navigation Satellite System that can work alongside your GPS and provide more accurate data faster from its network of 24 additional satellites. Developed in the 70's for navigation and global positioning, GLONASS is now used in commercial GPS receivers (as WAAS system), smartphones and tablets. Just like WAAS you can turn it on in Menu > Setup > System. "

First you should learn a standard GPS device.,
Check the back bumper.,
Check under the hood.,
Check the wheelwell.",How to Look for a GPS On Your Vehicle,";
, Typically, GPS units have two parts, the electronics component and the antennae respectively. the electronic component is usually in a plastic case with a magnet on the bottom, and connected by a wire to its antennae. Generally, the electronics unit is much larger than the antennae. Because the antennae receiver must be able to locate, transmit and receive signals from satellites, its placement is critical as it must have no metallic obstructions between it and the sky. Passive GPS devices are single units, often small enough to fit in the palm of a hand.

, The antennae can be attached to the metal frame underneath the plastic bumper cover by using a real time GPS system. A passive, single car DVD Nav can easily be attached to the metal frame under the plastic bumper.

, For a real time GPS device, the electronics unit is place to a place where will not damaged by heat from the engine. And its antennae maybe attached to the radiator grille or underneath the plastic front bumper. A single passive GPS unit may be place anywhere in the engine compartment where the heat will not damage it.

, The wheelwell is very important place for the GPS unit is visible but don not rule it out. Check the outer edge of the wheelwell for the antennae. A single, passive GPS car navigation system may be attached in the wheelwell or to the undercarriage.

, Choose between one for your car (Garmin Nuvi, Magellan Maestro, Magellan Roadmate, TomTom one, TomTom go), one for your motorcycle (Garmin zumo, tomtom rider) or a top of the range mobile phone (TomTom mobile, iPhone)/PDA (TomTom navigator) which will often include GPS.

, A particular brand may have 3 or 4 different models with a variety of prices and features going from low-end to high-end.


Some have maps for more than one country or the capability of adding them (though this will cost extra). To add maps you will need a GPS unit with sufficient memory space and sometimes an SD memory card slot.
Some maps are considered better or weaker in some areas than others. Find out if the unit uses OpenStreetMap, Tele Atlas or Navtech.
Whether a unit supports speed camera warnings and live traffic information might be of interest to you.

, If you buy a second hand unit, the maps may be neither updated nor able to update. Old units may have buttons rather than a touchscreen. Cheaper ones often have smaller screens too.

, Most large stores, like BestBuy and Circuit City, don't give their employees commission to push a particular model, so you can usually depend on their suggestions and information.

, Have your volunteer verify this by dividing the eight-digit number in his calculator by 137. Any number made by repeating a four-digit number twice will be evenly divisible by 137. In our example, 78,937,893 divided by 137 = 576,189


This works because repeating the digits in a four-digit number twice is equal to multiplying the original four-digit number by 10,001, which is divisible by 137. Try it!

, For instance, in our example, after dividing 78,937,893 by 137 to get 576,189, our volunteer would divide 576,189 by 7,893. If you've followed the directions right, your volunteer should get an answer of 73 every time, no matter which number she started with.


This works because 10,001 is equal to 137 × 73. Dividing your eight-digit number by 137 gets you an answer that is equal to your original four-digit number × 73, so, by dividing by your four-digit number, you'll get 73 as an answer every time.

, Have your friend or volunteer open the folded piece of paper. When your prediction of 73 is revealed, be prepared for your audience to go wild!


Don't reveal the math behind the trick! A good magician knows how to keep his secrets.

Love your calculator.",How to Choose a Calculator," Which functions are you going to be using? If you're going to be using this for an exam, read the specification to find out which calculators are allowed and which aren't.;
, However calculators can be more expensive than you think - an auction website is a good place to look if you want a bargain.

,, If you type the model numbers into Google you can often find complete hardware specifications. Compare the ones you are thinking of buying to see which spec is best for you.

, Search for your model number, and if this doesn't work try adding words like demonstration or demo to your search term.

, Is the calculator you're looking at within your price range? If not you may be able to find one on an auction website.

, Check it works correctly. To guard against case-swapping (placing the body and workings of one calculator in the case of a better one), always check the specification of your calculator immediately. How to do this varies between calculators; it is often found on the Settings, About or Hardware Specifications menus.

, It may not be something you normally do, but many calculators have functions you wouldn't expect in strange places. The best calculators will have huge instruction booklets, so read through a section at a time when you want to use a particular function. Learn the basics first, but a few of the 'coolest' things too when you want to show off to your friends. For example, if you've just bought a TI-89, find out how to do basic calculations, algebra and graphs first so you can use it in lessons, but also find out how to do 3D graphing with animation too. It looks smart even if you don't understand it!

, Take good care of it and it'll be yours for years to come!

Look at academic requirements.,
Evaluate vocational needs.,
Consider the interface.,
Make note of functional setups.",How to Determine Calculator Needs," When selecting a calculator for a course or exam, it's important to consider what features and functions will be needed for the task at hand. For courses, take a look at the syllabus or other instructive documentation. Special tests like the SAT may also have lists of requirements for a test, including whether the test taker is allowed to have a calculator at all.


If the syllabus does not have the required information, contact the teacher, department or test center and ask about exactly what is needed for a math class or test.;
, Some businesses require highly-specialized calculators. For instance, unlike many retails shops where a basic calculator or adding machine may provide for measuring revenues and expenses in cash flows, a lending or housing business may rely on a very different calculator with loan amortization functions.


Be knowledgeable on math needs in your industry. For mortgage calculators and other similar gear, having the right calculator for output is not going to be effective unless the user also knows how to explain amortization to the untrained customer. Build a good loan office setup with a combination of good tools and competent knowledge, and make sure that calculators have the right output function to make the underlying structure of amortized loans clear to a wide spectrum of individuals.

, For some projects that require graphing, having a visual graphing function on a calculator may be very important. For other more basic needs, no graphing is necessary. With graphing calculators, it's helpful for the graphs in the interface to be clearly labeled and scalable.

, Some calculators run off regular household batteries, where others may have lithium ion batteries or a solar power source.


Factor in output needs. Some businesses may have requirements for keeping track of calculations on paper, either for tax purposes or for other more general accounting methods. In these cases, a simple math calculator with a paper feed may be the most useful solution.

Determine the need for more memory for the car navigation system.,
Determine the type of optional memory module needed.,
Select the appropriate size optional memory module.,
Purchase the desired memory module.",How to Buy an Optional Memory Module for Your Car's Navigation System,"


Consult the owner's manual for the car navigation system. Find the listed free memory space of the car navigation system. Note that the owner's manual of the car navigation system may list total memory space. The total memory space is not important to determine because the operating system of the car navigation system will occupy much of that space. The amount of free memory space available in the car navigation system is the relevant number to calculate.
Determine the amount of free memory space that has already been taken by previously installed maps. Each map application should indicate the amount of free memory space in the car navigation system that it will occupy. Subtract each application's memory space from the original free memory space of the car navigation system to determine how much memory is available to store new maps.
Select the maps that you wish to install in the car navigation system. Information will be provided by the map application vendors regarding how much memory space the map or maps will occupy in the car navigation system. If the map memory requirements exceed the available free memory space in your car navigation system, then an optional memory module is needed.;
, Consult the owner's manual of the car navigation system to see what type of memory devices can be physically accepted by the car navigation system. These will be devices of the physically more compact type, such as SD, SDHD and micro SD.

, Optional storage devices come in a variety of memory storage sizes. Choose a memory storage module that will contain the memory needs of your selected maps, or will augment the remaining available free memory space in the car navigation system so it has sufficient memory storage for additional maps.

, Memory module vendors can be found on the Internet. You are not required to use memory modules supplied by the manufacturer of your car navigation system. Any memory module that is compatible with your car navigation system will work.


Price your memory module before buying. The prices will range widely depending on the area covered by the maps. A map of the United States would probably be around $50. Maps covering the majority of the world could be up to about $300. If you plan to buy blank memory devices and program them yourself, blank devices are available at more retail electronics stores with prices ranging from $25 to $40, depending on the type and size of the memory device.

Select the type of GPS navigation kit you want before you start comparing specific models.,
Choose the GPS navigation kit features that you require.,
Decide where to buy your GPS navigation kit: at a retail store, online or straight from the manufacturer.",How to Buy a GPS Navigation Kit,"


Examine your finances and set your personal navigation kit budget. Navigation kit models range in price from approximately $100 to more than $500. Typically the higher the price tag, the better the quality and features. A realistic price range will help to narrow your options and get you started in the right direction.
Determine your frequency of use. Is there more than one driver/car in your household that will need access to the navigator? If so, ease of installation may be an important factor. Do you often rent vehicles, share a common commute with several individuals or fly to new locales? If so, you may prefer a phone-based navigation kit.
Pinpoint your usual driving conditions. If you frequently drive in congested areas you may require a navigation kit with real-time traffic alerts, or alternate route options. If you often drive in unfamiliar areas, route guidance and surrounding road map displays may satisfy your needs.;
, You will need to determine whether you prefer a handheld navigator, which may exist in the form of a smartphone, cell phone or PDA; a portable, plug-and-play navigator; or a professionally mounted dashboard unit.

, Navigators have a full menu of features to choose from. Advanced technology has resulted in a plethora of special features including: Bluetooth hands-free capability, MP3 connection, voice command, live traffic and weather updates, point-of-interest search capability and much more. Determine which features you can or can't live without and confirm that such options exist within your budget.

,


Retail stores provide you with a first-hand look at floor models so you can test your new navigator prior to purchasing. You will also be able to carry out your new item, provided that it is in stock. Also, most retail locations offer professional installation of your device for an additional fee. Unfortunately, you often pay a higher price at a retail location to help cover the overhead of the store's rent, high electric bills and staff of sales people.
Buying online is usually the least expensive alternative, but it is not without its own drawbacks. You will be unable to test the navigator's performance, will usually have to pay for shipping/delivery charges and will have to wait for your navigation kit to be delivered to your house.
You can choose to buy directly from the manufacturer, either online or over the telephone. The straight-from-manufacturer price is usually the highest, but you may receive better extended warranty and/or repair/service options.

, When shopping for GPS navigation units, look for units that fit your established criteria. Write down price, features, GPS brand and GPS model name/number of each navigation unit that fits the criteria that you established for purchasing your new GPS navigation system.

, A major drawback of the in dash GPS navigation system is the lack of an internal compass, accelerometer or a device used to measure the car’s speed. Without this feature, it does not navigate as accurately as a built-in GPS system when there is no GPS signal. If you live in an area where there are a lot of tunnels, high rises, or uses the GPS very frequently, it is important to buy a more sophisticated portable GPS system that has a built-in accelerometer.

, Then purchase the GPS navigation system unit at the store or online retailer.

Visit the following stores in your local area to see if they carry the model you're looking for:


Outdoor/trail shop - Anywhere that sells hiking or camping equipment
Electronics stores - such as Best Buy have a variety of GPS units for all purposes
Hardware store - Many hardware store chains sell GPS units in their hunting/outdoor departments.,
The most important thing to remember about any handheld GPS unit is that the tiniest detail can ruin the experience for you.",How to Choose a GPS Receiver for Recreational Purposes," Believe it or not, GPS units are designed for a variety of uses, and the feature-set of each unit caters to different usage patterns. Some possible uses are:


Vehicle Navigation - Driving on the road
Off-Road Activities - Hiking, hunting, skiing, etc.
Water Activities - Boating, fishing, etc.
Aviation - Flying a plane
Geocaching - Navigating to waypoints for fun treasure-hunting;
, This essentially describes the shape & size of the technology, or how small of a space you want to use GPS functions in. Some possibilities are:


Handheld - A stand-alone unit that generally fits in one hand, with its own screen and buttons
Laptop sensor - A small, plain ""box"" that connects to your laptop, and lets software on your laptop do the rest of the work
PDA integrated - If you have a Palm or Windows Mobile PDA, you can get add-on sensors and software for them to do the same job as a laptop, but have it fit in the palm of your hand.
Marine/Vehicle mount - Something which will stay in your vehicle or boat at all times, and only provide vehicle/craft navigation
Wrist mount - Tiny GPS systems have been integrated into wrist-watch form, ideal for jogging and other outdoor exercise purposes. Some of these units come with built-in fitness sensors, like heart rate monitors.

, Ensure that both your laptop/PDA as well as the GPS unit are Bluetooth enabled if you expect wireless operation between the two. The rest of your functions will be determined by the software you use, which you can acquire independent of your hardware purchase. Despite this, all GPS units of this type will come with a packaged software bundle of some sort.

, that are right for you. Consult your retailer for options. Some marine GPS systems come with built-in fish finder features as well.

, Would you prefer a rechargeable unit?
Electronic compass - telling what direction you are facing while you are standing still. GPS units without this can only report your direction when you are moving.
Barometric altimeter - calculating altitude based on air pressure
Mapping - Displaying your current position on a map, uploading extra/custom maps into your unit
Data entry - Some GPS units only allow you to upload waypoints from a PC, while others allow you to enter them while in the field
Communications - Some GPS receivers have built-in two-way radios (ie: walkie talkies) to allow for communications as well as navigation. These units may provide position-sending functions so that you can locate others in your party
Removable memory cards for maps - Some people prefer to be able to swap maps while in the field, rather than connecting their GPS unit to a laptop. You may purchase a GPS that provides a CompactFlash (CF) or SecureDigital (SD) slot for map cards if this is important to you.

,,
Department store - Stores such as WalMart carry GPS units in their hunting/outdoor departments.
Marine equipment store - Even handheld units can be often be found at boat equipment shops.

, Buttons that are too small, or located in awkward places, or units that are *just* too big to fit in a certain carrier, etc. can all be deal breakers. The best way to deal with these challenges is to be sure that there is a money-back guarantee or return policy if you find that the unit doesn't work for you in a practical environment. To this end, be sure to set aside time as soon as possible to test your new unit out as much as you can before your return policy runs out.

Decide whether choosing a Magellan Roadmate or Maestro GPS is right for you based on whether you are active outdoors.,
Make your decision now from the wide selection of products you have to choose from.",How to Choose a Magellan Navigation System," Use of an available Magellan Roadmate navigation smart- or I-phone app, in some cases, is the only system you need in that case.


You receive all of the same features of the Roadmate Navigation system through the Roadmate app, without the need to carry a separate GPS unit.
The problem, however, occurs if your use of the phone frequently interrupts the GPS operation. That and other uses may be reason enough to purchase a Magellan GPS unit.;
, The Roadmate lets you know of approaching street names without the need to look at the screen.


The Magellan Roadmate family of products offers a wide choice in screen sizes ranging from the familiar 3.5-inch (8.9 cm) screen all the way to the much larger 7-inch (17.8 cm) screen. Combined with reasonable pricing and a history of reliability, this GPS system will work well for you.
They also have the Maestro series in their family arsenal that offers many of the same features as the Roadmate. It also offers Bluetooth capabilities to be synced with wireless phones. Combined with voice commands, it allows the user to make changes and calls on the go.

, Magellan offers the Explorist and Triton series, providing standard street maps with the Explorist, but also expanding with downloadable Terrain or topography maps.


The Triton series begins with a very basic GPS system offering uploadable topography maps compatible with the United States Geographic Service 1:24,000 ratio maps and the National Geographic TOPO state map series. Further features on several of the Triton series units include the ability to download the routes and maps of your recent adventures to your PC. This is ideal for the outdoorsman.
The Explorist is similar to the Maestro series in that it is more durable and offers water resistance for 30 minutes at 1 meter (3.3 feet ) in depth, and an accuracy of 3 meters (10 feet), more than the Roadmate. The Explorist, though, offers built-in street maps on some of its models, the same as the Roadmate series.
An added advantage to the Explorist comes into play if you are an off-roader and download forest roads and trails into the system. The other unique feature of the Explorist is video with sound capabilities allowing you to video geo-cache finds and adventures in the great outdoors.
There is one particular model in the Explorist family that is dedicated to the geo-cache hobbyist - the Explorist GC. The Explorist GC offers a basic unit that is designed to enhance the geo-caching experience and comes preloaded with the most popular locations.

, It all comes down to how you are going to use the Magellan Navigation system.

Look for a wedding ring.,
Search social media.,
Listen to what he does (and doesn't) say.,
Notice where and when you spend time together.,
Check out his car.,
Notice how she behaves on the phone.,
Trust your gut, but don't jump to conclusions.,
Ask the person if they are single.,
Ask around.,
Track down the divorce certificate.,
Check his texts or emails.",How to Find out if Someone Is Divorced," This is the simplest indicator of someone's marital status. A wedding ring is worn on the left ring finger, or the finger next to the pinkie.It's possible a person is divorced and still wearing a ring because he isn't ready to let go. In that case, he's not a good candidate for a new relationship, anyway.


If there is no ring, notice if there is an indentation or a tan line on his ring finger. This may indicate the ring has been temporarily removed, maybe to give you the impression he is single.If the person has a job in food service or working with machinery that might catch on jewelry, he may need to remove the ring for work.
Not everyone chooses to wear a wedding ring, so no ring doesn't guarantee he's single.;
, Most people have some sort of online presence, whether through networking sites like Facebook or Twitter, or picture sharing apps like Instagram and Flickr. A quick search may yield a lot of information--her marital status might be right there in her profile, or she may have posted lot's of pictures of her spouse, even wedding pictures.


If you can't find any sign of this person online, it may be because she doesn't want to get caught cheating--social media can make it very difficult for a person to hide what they've been up to and who they've been seeing., Sometimes a simple conversation about weekend plans can answer your questions. If he says, ""my wife and I went camping,"" you know he's not available.


If you are spending a lot of time together or dating and he never mentions an ex or previous relationships, it may be because he's still in a relationship.If you ask about meeting his friends or seeing where he lives and he comes up with long, drawn-out explanations as to why that's not a good idea, he may be lying. Detailed excuses often signal that the person is actually fibbing., Does she always want to go to a restaurant in the next town over? Does she insist you only spend time at your place? Is she unavailable every weekend? Can she only spend a few hours with you right after work? She may be trying to hide your relationship and not get caught by someone who knows her spouse., If he drives a minivan or a sedan with a baby seat in the back, it's safe to assume he has a family.


Having children doesn't necessarily mean he's still married, but if he's told you he's divorced and has adult or teenage kids, a fam-van doesn't back up his story., Someone you are not dating may signal you to her status, like answering the phone ""Hi, honey"" or closing with ""I love you, see you at home."" But if you suspect your girlfriend is not divorced and is seeing you on the side, she will probably be secretive about who she's talking to, or very specific about when you can call her.If she places a lot of restrictions on how you can contact her--only between the hours of 5 and 8pm, only on her cell phone--or she doesn't answer when you call, only to dial you back a few minutes later, you definitely have reason to be suspicious.If she only calls you from places outside the home, like while running errands or grocery shopping, she may be trying to conceal your relationship from her spouse., Take a moment to consider why you feel you need this information. If it's because you are interested in dating the person, you can make it easy and just ask him his status outright. If it's a significant other you suspect is lying about his divorce, there may be some underlying trust issues in the relationship, even if he is actually telling the truth.


Just because someone doesn't have a facebook profile or blab about past relationships, don't automatically assume it means it's because he's dishonest.
If he's engaging in a lot of these behaviors, or you have a strong feeling that something is off, consider investigating further.

, At worst you may embarrass yourself a little, but being straightforward is generally the best policy. Just ask her if she's seeing anyone. If you know she was married but it looks like her spouse is out of the picture, say something like, ""You haven't mentioned your husband in a while, is everything okay?""


If you don't want to be blunt, you could ask in a less direct manner by saying something like, ""Do you and your husband live in town?""
Watch her body language when she answers. If she looks away or down, touches her nose or covers her mouth, she may be holding back some information.If she says something like ""That's none of your business,"" politely apologize and take the matter no further (unless of course you are already dating. Then her marital status is your business!).

, Try to find out if you have any mutual friends that might know the person's marital status. If you work together, other co-workers may already know the person's situation.


Be aware that it might get back to the person that you were asking about her.
If she never introduces you to friends or is shady about their identities, she may be trying to prevent you from asking around and finding out she's not really divorced., You will need some information in order to do this--at the very least the full names (including the wife's maiden name) of both parties and the state and county where the divorce was filed. Call the state or county Vital Record's office to find out if you can even access these reports. Some states keep vital records private and you may not be able to see them unless you are named or can prove you are a close relative of one of the parties (like a child or parent).Even if you cannot obtain the full divorce record, you may be allowed to see an informal copy of the certificate.Most online databases will charge a fee (even if they advertise as being free). The court clerk's office may allow you to access their records for free or for a small fee.Sometimes a person will claim to be divorced without having finalized anything. This is something he should be up-front about, as he is still considered legally married. Not technically divorced yet means ""still married."", Remember that reading someone's personal messages can be a major violation of trust and may destroy the relationship if your significant other finds out. Do this only as a last resort--consider having a frank conversation with him first. If you still suspect he is lying, you may want to check his phone, email, or facebook messages.Be aware that you might not like what you find. Learning that your partner has been lying to you, whether it's through loving texts sent to his wife or finding pictures of him with his family, could be devastating. Prepare yourself for what you might discover."

But pay attention if he uses pronouns like “we” and “us” when talking about his past weekend or upcoming plans as there may be another girl in the picture. He may also talk a lot about a certain girl without ever explaining that they’re exclusively together.If a guy refuses to flirt back with you it either means that he’s not interested in you or has a girlfriend, or both.
Some guys are notoriously flirty or charming to everyone they meet, even if they have a girlfriend. Don’t get swept up in the fun of flirting until you know a guy is single.
A guy can still be nice and courteous to you even if they have a girlfriend. Don’t mistake niceness and politeness for flirting.;
, Some guys are very physical with everyone they like, but guys with girlfriends will often refrain from being touchy with other girls. He may only hug his guy friends or female relatives. If he avoids your attempts to hug him or sit close to him then he might be taken.Don’t force him to hold your hand, hug you, or do anything physical if you notice that he turns away or back away from you. You don’t want to seem like a home wrecker if he’s in a relationship.
He might give hugs or high fives to everyone, regardless of having a girlfriend so don’t use this as your only gauge for determining if he has a girlfriend.
If you notice that he deliberately avoids being alone with you, it may be that he’s worried about keeping his reputation as a taken guy.

, A guy usually reserves his time and romantic efforts for a girlfriend. If the guy you’re interested in treats you like one of the guys and doesn’t seem to set aside time to hang out with you, he might be taken. For example, a guy will deliberately introduce you as his friend to other people or call you “dude,” “bud,” “pal,” or any other non-committal nickname to label you as just a friend.


Girlfriends usually have the privilege of a guy’s time on weekend nights. If you can never schedule time with the guy it could be because he reserves most of his free time for his girlfriend.He might mention special events or time spent with family that he’s attending without inviting you. It’s possible that he is going with a girlfriend who usually takes priority.

, If you’re dealing with a guy who you suspect is cheating on his girlfriend and you’re the “other woman,” observe him carefully. Changing your name in his phone, giving you shady answers about where he’s been or is going, or restricting when you can call or text him might mean that he’s trying to hide you from a girlfriend.If he hasn’t introduced you to his friends, family, or coworkers, it could be that he doesn’t want anyone to know that you’re in the picture.
It’s may not be your place to alert the girlfriend that this guy is cheating on her. It may backfire on you. Back out of the situation so that you’re not part of the problem.

, Generally a guy will spend the majority of his free time with his girlfriend. However, if hanging out with you or his guy friends takes up most of his schedule, he might not have other priorities. When you ask him what his evening or weekend plans are and he's free, it may be that he doesn't have a steady girlfriend.

, One of the easiest ways to subtly find out if a guy is in a relationship is to check his Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram profiles.See if he mentions hanging out with a specific girl more than usual or posts photos with a certain girl. You can also simply check his profile descriptions to see is he mentions being in a relationship.


Check his friends’ pages as well. Sometimes a guy won’t post photos of a relationship, but you can check his mutual friends and followers’ pages to see if they posted pictures of him with another girl.
Be careful not to ‘like’ or accidentally comment on any old pictures or posts of his. He’ll get a notification that you’re stalking him.
Although its increasingly unusual, it is possible that your guy may not have a social media page, in which case it may be more beneficial to check his friend's pages to see if they posted any information about the guy.

, Guys are just as guilty as girls when it comes to keeping pictures and messages of a special girl in their life. You can ask to borrow his phone and surreptitiously scroll through his photo albums and texts to see if he has a girlfriend.


Say that your phone's battery died and you have to make a call if you're trying to avoid being suspicious.
Don’t abuse his privacy. If you sneak through his phone or log onto his social media profiles without permission, you could get caught. It’s never a good idea to be invasive and stalk someone’s life.

, Guys who are in a relationship rarely pay a whole lot of attention to other women. A faithful boyfriend won’t check out other girls as they walk by or make comments about a woman’s appearance to his friends.On the other hand, if you have evidence that he might have a girlfriend but still hits on other women, he might be a cheater, so be wary.
If he gives out his number to other girls, he may be single. Your only challenge is to catch his attention.

, If your crush seems to flirt with any girl including you, he might be single. But some guys are charming and witty no matter who they're talking to. It can be easy to confuse being nice for flirting. He might have a girlfriend but still treat everyone with individualized attention.


Don't confuse being nice and funny with flirting. The main difference is that flirting usually involves physical touch and subtle hints about something more than friendship.

, Sometimes a guy is just really hard to read or is very private about his life. Find one of his friends and ask them if your crush has a girlfriend. Slip the question into a conversation to be subtle, or just outright message one of his friends if you want to be direct.Try to be subtle when asking. You can say things like, “What does your friend do with all of his time?” or make a joke like, “Oh where’s he going, got a hot date?”
Be aware that your questioning may make it back to the guy you’re interested in. Guys talk among themselves just as much as girls.
However, if your interest is single, tipping him off that you like him and have been talking to his friends is a way to get his attention.

, If you still can’t find out if he is dating another girl, ask him outright. Avoid texting, instant messaging, or anything electronic because it’s important that you’re able to hear how he reacts to your question.

, If you're hanging out with a group of people you shouldn't delve into someone's personal relationship status. Be patient and wait until it's just the two of you to inquire about any girlfriend. You don't want to make him uncomfortable by making his personal life public in front of people.

, Try not to beat around the bush when you ask to avoid making things too awkward. You could say, “I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you have a girlfriend?” As long as you keep your tone casual, he shouldn't feel pressured by your question.


If he doesn’t and has been oblivious that you have a crush on him, he may notice your interest when you ask him about his relationship status.
Don’t worry too much if he says yes. There will always be other guys, not all the good ones are taken.

, It’s not a good sign if he doesn’t answer you with a simple “yes” or “no.” Any hint of caginess or nervousness is not a good sign. If he stumbles over his words or tries to give you an excuse, he’s probably in a complicated situation. It’s best to stay away from a guy who isn’t honest anyways.If he’s outright and honest, then you have a clear answer. But if he hesitates, take that as a red flag that he may be hiding his relationship.

, Finding out that a guy you’re interested in is taken can be a tough blow. But keep cool when he gives you an answer, whether it’s positive or negative.


If he has a girlfriend, don’t have a meltdown in front of him. Or at least wait until you’re alone to be emotional about a missed opportunity so you can save face.
The best news would be if he’s single. Respond with something like, “Oh, well that’s interesting” to maintain your mysteriousness and not reveal your hand that you're interested in him.
No matter how much you like a guy, it’s not worth breaking up a relationship just so you can try and date him.

Put yourself out there by attending social events organized by your friends, by taking classes and chatting with classmates, and by signing up for dating sites, apps, and services. Be adventurous and open minded: try speed dating, for instance.


The most common way to meet a future partner is through mutual friends. Spend time with friends, and ask your friends to introduce you to people they think you'll like.The second is in social spaces. This can include everything from bars, to concerts, poetry readings, and gallery openings, to church gatherings.The third is through work. If you work from home, consider participating in a co-working space. Make visits to the home office and attend conferences when you can. Be slow to ask someone out if you work together regularly, however, as this can potentially complicate your work life.The fourth is through dating websites or apps, and the fifth is social media. Sign up for dating platforms like OkCupid, Tinder, Grindr, and Hinge.;
, If you know someone in real life, ask him or her out in person. Ask directly, so that they know what you're saying and can respond in a straightforward way. To minimize awkwardness, ask on the exit. As you leave a situation, say ""I've really enjoyed talking to you, but I have to go. Would you like to have dinner sometime soon?""


If you are absolutely too shy to ask someone out in person, you can call. You'll have to ask for his or her number, though.
If you found the person you're interested in online, send a friendly message. If you want to get a better sense of the person, message back and forth 2-5 times before you ask him or her out.
If you are asking out a friend, leave plenty of room for a ""no."" Make sure that you ask your friend out before you get so wound up that a rejection would devastate you. When you notice yourself crushing, go for it.
Stay friends if it's not too painful. The person who turns you down might end up introducing you to the person you stay with.

, If you're feeling anxious about finding ""the one,"" you might end up scaring your dates away. Plan dates as you would plan other events: an activity you might enjoy doing with another person, and a friendly commitment to enjoying the meeting. During a date, focus on the date.


Ask open-ended questions, listen actively, and be honest in your answers.
Be genuine. Tell the truth when asked a question. Worry less about being judged and more about seeming phony.
Stay off your phone. Focus on your date!
Don't spend the whole time worrying about ascertaining whether or not your date is a good match. You can't tell something like that on a first date. Rather, focus on the conversation and the activity of the date.
Don't say ""I love you"" or try to talk about long-term commitment on your first few dates.

, If you are dating to find a life partner, show your best self. Don't try to dominate or play mind-games with your date.


Putting your date down, or talking critically of others on a date, will show your date that you are insecure or cruel.Even if you have a sense you might not want to go on a second date, do your best to enjoy the date you're on. Treat your date well! Even if you won't meet again, he or she still deserves your polite and friendly attention.

, Dates don't have to be dinner, wine, and eye contact. Plan something you would feel more comfortable doing. Get coffee and take a walk in a park. Visit an exhibit at a local museum. Meet for breakfast at a diner and sit at the counter.


Invite your date to a party or other social event. If you get nervous in isolation, try hanging out in a group.
Say yes to your date's ideas. If someone asks you out, let that person name the date. Don't assume you won't enjoy a new place or activity.

, Many couples meet in college or graduate school. It's a place where people have things in common, spend time near one another, and get a sense of one another as workers and friends. If you've already gone to school, or are unable to return, try taking extension classes in subjects that interest you: cooking, foreign languages, dance, or business.


Not only is school an excellent place to meet a potential mate, but getting an education can increase the longevity of your future relationship. Couples with college education have lower divorce rates than their less-educated peers., Your mental and physical health influence who is willing to date you, and for how long. Get regular exercise and a full night's sleep each night. Eat regular meals, healthy snacks, and avoid soda and refined sugar. Visit the doctor regularly.


Take particular care of your mental health. If you are too shy, depressed, anxious, or insecure to date, visit a therapist.

, To attract a partner, look your best. Be clean. Shower often, but use shampoo no more than three times a week. Brush your teeth and floss after eating, so that your breath is fresh and your teeth look healthy.


Dress to suit yourself. Fashion choices are going to vary widely depending on your tastes, but in general, wear clothing that fits your body, is clean, and is not very worn out.Wear the colors that flatter you, or wear black and neutrals if you can't figure out what your colors are.

, You won't find someone who loves you if you are unloving of yourself. Pursue the things you want in life: a job you like, friends who treat you well, hobbies you enjoy, and good communication with your family. Take care of your emotional, physical, and financial wellbeing.


Treating yourself well demonstrates emotional stability, an extremely attractive characteristic., Friends are the mostly likely people to introduce you to your life partner.They are also the people who will help you through the rough cycles of dating, who will support you when you find someone you like, and who will be your companions when you are lonely. It's hard to date if you're isolated, and it's hard to come off as confident and attractive if you're lonely and desperate for companionship.


Be good to the friends you have. You don't have to be a social butterfly. Keep the social commitments you make, reciprocate favors, and tell your friends what you appreciate about them.

, Think about the things you most want in life: companionship, children, financial stability, a strong community, artistic success, to live up to your principles, to enjoy yourself. Think of where you would like to be in three years, five years, thirty and fifty years. Don't think ""What do I want in a partner?"" but rather ""What do I want in my life?""


Look at your relationship and see if it supports your life goals. If you find it does not, ask yourself if you are willing to live without things for the sake of the one you are with.
Adapt to what you find. Most people are actually terrible at knowing what they want. If you find someone who supports you in your desire and who expands your horizons—someone you care about enough that they have changed you—you might have found your life partner.

, Romance is not a great predictor of what makes a relationship strong enough to last a lifetime. Rather, truly respecting, enjoying, and caring for your partner will take you through to the end. Don't commit for a lifetime to someone until you have had a chance to become dear friends.


Look for overlapping senses of humor, and the ability to have fun even in mundane or difficult circumstances.
Respect your partner's mind. If you don't enjoy the way your partner thinks, you aren't likely to enjoy talking for the rest of your life.
Have interests in common. You don't have to do everything together, but you should share some preferences for activities and ways of relating to people.
Be equals. Relationships in which one person dominates are unhappy ones. If one of you treats the other in ways that would not be tolerated in the opposite direction, you are headed for trouble.You and your partner should trust, support, and respect one another. If you share these bonds, your relationship is strong.

, Relationships are fragile at the start. Check the impulse to run after the first fight. Fighting can feel like the end of the world, but it is natural, and it's a part of all healthy relationships. Learn to fight better. Start sentences with ""I"" instead of ""you."" Say how you feel instead of laying blame on your partner.


De-escalate your fights. If an argument is growing angry, de-escalate by connecting with your partner. Stop arguing, start listening, and reach out. If you two can touch when you're panicked, try holding hands or hugging. Use humor. Suggest a change of scene.If you are on a date and you have a fight, for instance, reset by asking your partner on another date. Move to a different venue or different seats where you are and greet one another again.Don't avoid speaking your mind or discussing controversial topics out of fear of a break up. Rather, find your calm and ask your partner to do the same.
Unless you have a distinct need for a specific change, avoid bringing up topics of controversy that have provoked previous fights. You are less likely to convince your partner of your point of view and more likely to wear him or her down.Your relationship is more important than winning.
For instance, if you and your partner have fought about a friend who is important to you but who drives your partner crazy, do bring up the topic of him staying in your life.
Don't, however, argue that your partner is wrong that your friend is annoying. Your friend annoys your partner, and the annoyance will deepen if you argue., As you go on more and more dates with someone, you might start feeling a rising need to declare your intentions. You might find yourself constantly wondering what your date feels, whether he or she is as serious as you are. Don't press for answers, but do let your date know that you are having a good time.


After a date, tell her that you had a good time.
After a few dates have passed, tell your date that you are really enjoying the time you spend together.
When you feel ready to date exclusively, check in with your date. Say you like her and you would like to date only her. Ask if she's interested in that.
If she's not ready, give her time. People move at different rates.
Try not to say ""I love you"" on the first few dates. When you feel that you love someone, hold onto that beautiful energy until a month or two have passed.If you are dating someone you really like but they say ""I love you"" before you are ready to hear it, tell them that you aren't ready to say that yet but you might be soon. Say you are serious about continuing to date.

, Marrying young will increase your chance of divorce. So will marrying someone you just started dating. If you are hungry for companionship, invest in your friendships. Date lovingly, not expecting every relationship to last, but respecting and enjoying the people you date.When you find someone you like, date him or her for at least three years before proposing marriage.Getting to know one another over time will increase your likelihood of staying together.

Just lean close to him, put your arms around him, and don't linger too long unless you want to show him that you really like him. You should have a good reason for hugging the guy, like congratulating him on an accomplishment, or greeting him when he walks into a room, if you know him pretty well already.


Move your head to the side so you don't awkwardly bring your face too close to his.;
, Squeezing a guy's shoulder is another way to show him that you care about him. Just reach over and give either his right or left shoulder a quick, gentle squeeze when you're sitting next to or facing the guy. You can do this to calm him down about something, to let him know that everything's okay, or just to show him that you're happy to see him.


Squeeze his shoulder for a quick second -- there's no need to linger.

, When you stand facing the guy, reach out to put your hand on his elbow with an open palm. Just gently touch his elbow to show him affection and to break the touch barrier. If your hand lingers, it'll look more intimate, but a quick pat on the elbow will just show him that you care -- and can lead to something more.

, If you and the guy are sitting down with your hands on a table, or if you're sitting and the guy's hand is on his knees, you can reach over and gently pat the top of his hand for a second. This is a great way to reassure the guy and to make him feel special without getting too intimate. Don't try to hold his hand or linger your hand over the top of his -- that can come later, if you like.

, Patting the guy on the back is another great way to show affection. Just pat the top of his back, just below his shoulder, to show him that you can care. Patting the guy on the back once or twice is a good way to make an exit, or to say hello in that half-hug way without making things too awkward.

, Putting your arm around a guy is another great way to show affection. You can just put your arm around him while you're walking, letting your arm rest just below his shoulders.

Kiss the guy on the cheek.,
Give him a playful smack.,
Kick him under the table.,
Play with his hair.,
Touch his knees with yours.,
Gently brush his cheeks.,
Hold the guy's hand.,
Touch his chest.",How to Touch a Guy2," Kissing a guy on the cheek is a great way to touch him flirtatiously without coming on too strong. This typically happens when you greet or say goodbye to a hug, and you both lean in to give a kiss on opposite cheeks. Just make sure that you know the guy well enough and that the occasion is appropriate -- you shouldn't try this move if you're saying hello in the halls or in a class, but you can try it if you're saying hello or goodbye at the end of a party or when you're out with your friends.


When you kiss the guy on the cheek, let your lips just graze the side of his cheek. Don't give him a wet, sloppy kiss.
Make sure that he's leaning in for the kiss or cheek-to-cheek move, too.

, Another way to be flirtatious is to lightly hit the guy when you're talking. You can gently hit him on his upper arm if you're both standing up, or hit him on the knee if you're both sitting down. This is a move that says, ""Oh, stop it! But really, don't..."" Make sure you do this lightly and don't hit him too hard, or he'll be put off.


When you're being playful like this, it's important that the guy is reciprocating. If you're playfully hitting him from time to time, he should return the gesture.

, This is another low-key but effective way to touch a guy flirtatiously. If you're sitting across from each other and he says something that makes you laugh or which was meant to elicit an ""Ew!"" or ""Gross!"" reaction, then you can playfully kick the top of his foot with your own. If you're feeling bold, you can playfully kick him under the table and then move your feet so that they're just touching his, daring him to move.

, Playing with a guy's hair is a great way to flirt with him. This is a pretty bold move, so you shouldn't over use it and find a good reason to do it. For example, if the guy just got a haircut, you can gently squeeze his hair to tease him. If his hair looks a little messy, you can playfully try to fix it, using it as an excuse to touch him. Just make sure he likes it -- it's a pretty intimate gesture, and not every guy likes to have his hair touched.

, If you and the guy are sitting across from each other, lean in until your knees are almost touching. Then, if he moves closer, or if you're just feeling bold, have the tops of your knees touch, or move your knees so that one is on the outside of his legs and one is between them, so you move closer together. Lean your body toward him to make this happen.

, If you really want to get flirty, wait for the time when the guy has an eyelash or even a bit of food on his cheek. Then, lean over and gently brush it off him, taking care to make light contact with his skin. Linger just enough to get flirty, and move closer to him so he feels you getting more intimate.


Guys usually like being touched on the cheek because it is soft and comfortable.

, Once you've gotten more intimate, you can reach your hand over to hold the guy's hand when you're standing up. You can hold hands while you're walking, or while you're sitting down and talking or watching a movie. If you're sitting across from each other, you can hold hands under the table or with your hands over the table. Give the guy's hand a gentle squeeze from time to time to keep the flirtatious mood going.


Though holding a guy's hand is a great way to flirt with him, you should avoid this move unless you're already ""together"" somewhat -- holding hands in public is a declaration that you're an item, and not all guys may like that.
Also, a lot of guys just don't like to have their hands held, period, whether you're alone or in public, so be cautious when you try this form of affection.

, If you want to be flirtatious with the guy, you can place one hand on his chest as you're talking and moving closer to him. This is especially effective if he's standing with his back to a wall or if you're in a small, enclosed space.

Touch the inside of his ear.,
Touch his feet.,
Touch his skin.",How to Touch a Guy3," If you want to start turning a guy on, then give him a hug from behind. Stand behind him and wrap your arms around his stomach, bringing your bodies closer. You can rest your chin on his shoulder or press your forehead to his back, depending on your height. Let him feel your breath on the back of his neck. It won't take long for him to turn around and start kissing you.

, Kissing the back of a guy's neck is another great way to turn him on. To do this, just move up behind him and wrap your arms around him or just squeeze his shoulders, and start gently kissing the back of his neck, working your way over to the sides of his neck below his ears.


You can also turn around and start kissing the front of his neck, or try kissing the front of his neck when you're kissing in bed and you're both reclined.

, Placing your hand on the small of the guy's back, just above his waistline, is another great way to let him know that you want something more. As you move toward him, place your hand on the small of his back and turn to face him, using your hand to draw him closer to you.

, The back of a guy's head, just above his neck, is another great spot to turn the guy on. Touch the back of his head when you're kissing or just having an intimate conversation where you're leaning in close to each other and talking. You can also massage his scalp a bit or run your fingers through the hair on the back of his head.

, The area behind a guy's ear is another erogenous zone and touching a guy there, whether it's with the tips of your fingers or the tips of your lips, is a great way to send a tingling sensation up and down his spine. You can stroke the area behind his ear with your hands and even move on to gently touch his ear and earlobes.

, This is an intimate move that is guaranteed to drive any guy wild. Touch the inside of the guy's ear with the very tip of your tongue. After you do that, you can gently blow in the guy's ear to drive him crazy. If you're not comfortable with putting your tongue in there, then just blowing on the ear will suffice. You can also just graze the inside of his ear with your lips when you're leaning close to whisper something in his ear., Touching a guy's feet is another guaranteed way to turn him on. Just gently stroke his toes, run your fingers along the pad of his foot to tickle him slightly, and give him a light foot massage by running your hands along the joints in his toes in a circular fashion to make him go wild.Don't do this if he's wearing sneakers and socks -- his feet may be a bit dirty or sweaty at that point. But if you're both in bed with bare feet, go for it.

, Any skin-to-skin contact will turn a guy on. Touch his cheeks, his forearms, the back of his wrists, his forehead, his bare knees, or even graze his lips with your hands.

Find out their ring size.,
Pick a price point.,
Decide if you are also buying a ring for yourself.,
Decide whether or not to talk to your significant other before buying the ring.",How to Buy a Promise Ring1," Promise rings traditionally go on the ring finger of the left hand, and are replaced by the engagement ring if you and your partner get engaged. However, there is a much looser code when it comes to promise rings than there is with engagement or wedding rings. Pick what finger seems right for you and your partner. If you don’t want the promise ring to eventually be replaced by the engagement ring, consider buying the promise ring for a finger other than the ring finger.
Sometimes friends give each other promise rings, though it is not as common as romantic partners. If you are buying a ring for a friend, consider a different finger than the ring finger.
Some people even wear promise rings around their neck. Consider buying a chain for the promise ring also if your friend or partner doesn’t like wearing rings.;
, You will need to know your significant other’s ring size before buying them the promise ring. If the ring is a surprise, do not ask them for their size. There are several ways that you can find it out without spoiling the surprise. Look around for ring boxes in the place they store their jewelry. Some boxes print the ring size on the box.
Print out a ring sizer. You can find ring size charts on the Internet. Make sure to print it out to size, and then place one of your partner’s rings over the circle that best lines up to the diameter of the ring. This will give you their ring size.
Trace the inside of a ring they wear with a pencil onto a piece of paper. If you visit a jewelry store, they will be able to find what size they are from the tracing.
Ask their friends or family. If you know your significant other's friends or family well, consider asking them. Only do this if you trust them not to tell your significant other that you asked.
Ask your partner. If you and your partner have already talked about getting a promise ring, simply ask them what their ring size is.

, You will want to pick a price point before you actually go to purchase the ring. This way you will know exactly what to look for, and you won’t end up buying a ring that you can’t afford. Do some online research and look at typical ring prices. Promise rings are typically cheaper than engagement rings, with prices at mainstream jewelers starting as low as around $200 and going up to $2,000.

, Traditionally, a man buys the promise ring for the woman. However, you may decide that you and your significant other should both wear promise rings as a testament of your love for each other. Or you might be buying a matching ring for yourself and your friend.


You can either buy a ring that matches the one you are giving your significant other, or you can purchase a simpler one.
If you do decide that you want to buy a promise ring, factor the cost of this ring into the overall price point.

, There are pluses and minuses that come with talking to your partner about buying a promise ring.


A plus is that you can ask them what kind of ring they want, and the process of choosing will be much easier.
A drawback is that telling them you are buying the ring will take the surprise out of the moment you give it to them. Decide whether or not it’s worth it to talk to them about the ring beforehand.

Show your support when she's having a tough time.",How to Be Nice to a Girl," Show interest and enthusiasm. Girls are more likely to engage in conversation with you if you are approachable. Give off the impression that you’d like to help, or at least be open to conversation. Use body language that indicates openness. Smile. Maintain good eye contact. Turn and face the girl when talking.
Avoid defaulting to checking your phone, computer or other devices. Show that you’re not too busy to have a conversation with the girl. For example, if a girl talks with you at a party, and you're constantly distracted by your phone, she'll likely think you don't want to talk with her, or aren't friendly.
Avoid tensing up or getting anxious when the girl approaches or engages in conversation. Keep your body loose and avoid fidgeting.;
, Have active listening skills that demonstrate empathy and engagement with what the girl is saying. Avoid making the conversation only about you and your interests. A good conversation is a two-way street.Pay attention when the girl is talking. Avoid distractions.
Summarize or restate what you heard. Repeat it back to her for clarification or to demonstrate that you were listening. For example, “Let me see if I heard what you’re saying…”
Reflect on what was said or provide feedback. For example, “It sounds like you had a tough night after talking with your parents.”
Validate what you’ve heard. For example, “I can totally understand where you’re coming from.”
Allow for pauses and silences for a few seconds. Avoid interrupting until the girl has finished her thoughts.

, While you may not always have the same interests or feelings about a situation, being nice involves showing genuine interest, and being willing to care about what others say and do.Ask question to know more about something that she’s interested in. Find something she likes that you can gravitate towards. For example, if she’s interested in cats and bicycling, and you’re not really into cats but like bikes, focus the questions around bicycling.
Avoid getting distracted or zoning out. When trying to get to know a girl better, it’s important to be engaged and pay attention. If you’re having trouble staying focused, consider excusing yourself politely, and approaching her at a different time when you’re more ready to talk.

, Disagreements or differences of opinion can lead to petty arguments. No matter if you’re talking with a girl or a guy, it’s important to be calm and respectful. Don’t turn a difference of opinion into a big issue. Being nice involves respecting other people’s viewpoints. A girl has a right to her views in the same way that you have right to yours. For example, let's say you're at school and talking with a girl after class about problems with a certain class. She may think highly of the class, while you think it's terrible. Avoid getting into a big argument just because she has a different opinion.
Avoid getting upset with a girl or making her upset. Be aware of the way you act or what you say that could lead to arguments. Take a step back and take a deep breath if you need to avoid confrontation.

, Being chivalrous to a girl remains an important way to have courtesy and respect. You don’t have to bend-over backwards to be courteous. Consider these small gestures as signs of kindness and respect:Make sure to say “please” and “thank you.” Use your words to show appreciation of something she’s done to help you, even if it’s a small thing like picking up a pen that fell on the floor.
Open doors for her. Allow her to walk through first, rather than going ahead of her. Show that you are gentleman.
Help to get things that are possibly out of reach. Let’s say you’re at a store, and the girl is trying to reach something on the top shelf. Help to grab the item for her, or find someone who works at the store to help with getting the item down.

, Whether you’re romantically interested in this girl or not, it can make a girl feel special when you compliment her. Avoid compliment her about certain body parts, that could make you come off as creepy.Compliment her about if she dressed nicely today. It doesn’t have to be too specific, just say, “You look nice today.”
Compliment her about something she’s doing well. Let’s say you’re in a class with her, and she just gave a great class presentation. You could say, “That was a great presentation. It looked effortless.”
Compliment her about things that she does for others. If she has a generous spirit, say something like, “You’re very caring.”

, If there is an event planned or you’re meeting up with a girl, show up on-time. Show that you respect her time, as much as yours, particularly if she’s involved in the event planning.


Being present and showing up is one of the simplest ways to show that you care.
Being nice is also about being considerate of others’ time. The girl is less likely to be anxious or frustrated if you show up when you said you would.

, Show confidence in who you are, and that you have many good things to offer others. Avoid being overly confident by being kind and appreciative of others. Avoid bragging about yourself, or making the conversation all about you when talking to a girl. For example, let's say you just met a girl, and she asks about what work you do. Maybe you want to brag about how much money you make. While this may seem like a good way to impress a girl, it's important to be humble, and instead focus more on what you enjoy about your work.
Avoid being hard or down about yourself. Try to focus the conversation on things that you enjoy doing, rather than what makes you annoyed or unhappy. Avoid making the conversations intense or morbid.
Show that you can be friendly and kind to others, not just to the girl you’re talking to. Learn to be more comfortable around acquaintances or people you don’t know by asking questions about their interests.

, Avoid making her feel dumb, uninteresting, or rude. Be thoughtful in what you say and how you say it. If you think that what you say may come out wrong, or seem hurtful, avoid blurting it out.Think before you speak. Take a few seconds to process what you’ll say. Imagine whether your words could come off as rude, cold, or unfeeling if you were in the girl’s shoes.
Remember that each person is different. One girl may react in one way, and another girl might react differently. Be prepared for the possibility that what you say may not work out as well as you thought.

, Be supportive when someone is feeling down, frustrated, or confused. Showing empathy and concern is a step towards a better relationship.


Offer your help in some way. For example, if she’s had a bad day and she’s carrying lots of stuff, offer to help with carrying some of the items.
Avoid trying to quickly find solutions to her problems. She may just want to have emotional support, rather than advice on what to do.
Offer hugs to help console her. If she’s very sad or tearful, be welcoming, but make sure that it’s appropriate. Ask for her permission, such as, “I’m sorry about what you’re going through. Do you need a hug?”
Treat her as you would like to be treated—with kindness and sincerity.

Consider your partner’s taste in jewelry.,
Choose the right kind of metal based on your price range.,
Decide if you want a symbolic design.,
Choose whether to engrave the ring.",How to Buy a Promise Ring2," Your partner will likely be wearing this ring every day, so you want to make sure to pick out something they will like. Look at their jewelry collection, especially their rings, and consider what styles and metals they prefer. Ask yourself these questions before buying them the promise ring: Does your partner wear small, delicate pieces or larger, statement pieces?
Do they wear pieces that contain precious stones or diamonds, or do they prefer solid metals?
Does your partner wear mostly warm-toned metals like gold and copper? Or do they wear cool-toned metals like silver and titanium?

, You need to keep your partner’s preference in metals in mind, but you also need to consider your price range. You should be able to settle on a ring that satisfies both your partner’s taste and your spending limits. Think about what metal you want before buying the ring. Gold and platinum rings, or rings with diamonds or gems, are on the pricier side.
Titanium and silver are on the cheaper side.

, There are several standard designs for promise rings that symbolize you and your partner’s love and your promise to each other.


A heart design is the most traditional design. The heart symbolizes your love for one another.
A Claddagh ring is a traditional promise ring design that originated in Ireland. The Claddagh design, showing two hands coming from either side to grasp a central crowned heart, symbolizes loyalty and love. It can be really special if your significant other is Irish, as they will recognise the symbol. Explain why you chose the ring and what the symbol means to you. If you are buying this ring, research the meaning and explain it to them. The crown is loyalty, the heart is love and the hands are friendship. Rings containing the infinity symbol are also common promise rings. The infinity symbol represents a love that will last forever.
Three-stone rings are another promise ring design. The three stones represent the past, the present and future that you share with your partner.

, Many choose to engrave their promise ring with a personal message. This makes the ring more personal and emphasizes the reason for giving the ring. You can choose your engraving to be on the inside of the ring, or on the outside so it’s visible when your partner wears it. Engraving both your names, like “Julia and Daniel”, is a sweet way to make the ring more personalized.
You could simply engrave “I love you”.
You could also engrave a date, either your anniversary or the date that you are giving them the promise ring.

Look for jewelers in your area.,
Go to several stores.,
Tell a salesperson what you are looking for.,
Don’t let yourself be pressured.,
Buy a ring online.,
Make sure there is an exchange policy.,
Pay for the ring.",How to Buy a Promise Ring3," Do some research online and find jewelry stores nearby. You will want to go to several stores, so ideally the stores you go to should be close together as opposed to hours apart.


Go online to their sites and look at prices. It’s better to eliminate certain stores from the get go rather than go there and realize they are out of your price range.

, You don’t want to only go to one store when you are buying a promise ring. It puts too much pressure on just one buying experience, and you may come out with a ring that they won’t like. Instead, try to go to at least three different places. Think about going to at least one larger, more well known store, and also to a smaller, boutique-style jeweler.You may find very different offerings between the two.
Think about bringing a friend along who can help you. Also consider bringing someone who knows your significant other well and who knows what they do and don't like.

, Be honest and direct about your price point, material preference, and style of ring you are looking for. The salesperson can direct you to the best rings for you, and it could save you time. You also will be less distracted and won’t leave with a ring that isn’t exactly what you want.

, At some big jewelry stores, salespeople are paid by commission. Don’t feel like you need to leave with a ring that day, and don’t let them try to sell you anything outside your price range. Stand firm in what you want and if in doubt, leave with a business card and decide what ring you want after you have seen all your options. , Buying a promise ring online can save you money. If you are underwhelmed by the rings that you see in jewelry stores, or if you are worried about spending too much, look online. Stick to reputable sites and look up customer reviews of the online stores. Make sure to keep measurements in mind when you are shopping online. Sometimes on a screen a ring can look much smaller or larger than it actually is, so always carefully look at the measurements listed in the description.
If you are considering buying a ring with gems or diamonds, make sure the online site is certified by a trade association like the Jewelers of America, the American Gem Society or the Gemological Institute of America. , Before buying your ring, make sure there is an exchange policy. As hard as you worked to pick a ring that they'll like, there’s the possibility that they will want a different one. Do not buy a ring if there is no way to return it. If you are buying an engraved or personalized ring, make sure the return policy covers your ring.

, If you have the money up front, go ahead and buy the ring! If you don’t have the money, you have a couple options. The best thing to do would be to wait a couple months until you have enough money.


Many jewelers also have payment plans that are interest free for a certain number of months. Keep in mind that you may have to open a retail credit card with the jeweler, and if you fail to pay on time it could affect your credit. "

Pick a special day.,
Plan a special date.,
Wait for the right moment.,
Put the ring on their finger.,
Explain the ring.,
Don’t be upset if they don't like the ring.",How to Buy a Promise Ring4," Waiting for an important day like Valentines Day, their birthday, or your anniversary is a way to make giving them the ring extra special. Think ahead and see if you any of these days are coming up. If you don’t want to wait that long or nothing is coming up, don’t worry. There are other ways to make the occasion special.

, Try to make the day special and romantic even before you give your significant other the ring. Take them to their favorite restaurant or do an activity that you both enjoy. This will make giving them the ring even more special. If you are giving the ring to a friend, do not do anything out of the ordinary, or anything that could be seen as romantic. It could give them the wrong idea about the ring.

, You want the moment you give them the ring to be intimate and special. You don’t want to be interrupted, so make sure that you are in a place with just the two of you.


You could also make giving them the ring a fun challenge by making a scavenger hunt or hiding it in a place that they will find that night, like on the bedside table or underneath their pillow.

, Present them the ring (or wait until they find it) and slip it onto their finger. Look into their eyes as you put it on their finger: this will make it even more romantic. Don’t get down on one knee. You don’t want to do anything that will make them think that this is an engagement ring. This could make them confused or even disappointed!

, Your friend or significant other may not be sure what a promise ring is. First, tell them it's a promise ring, not an engagement ring. Tell them what the ring means to you and why you bought it. Also explain to them what makes them so special to you. Your partner should be incredibly touched and excited after you tell them about the ring and put it on their finger. For example, you could say something like, ""I bought you this promise ring because I wanted to show my commitment to you. I want you to be able to look down and remember exactly how I feel about you.""

, If your partner or friend doesn’t want the ring, don’t be upset. It doesn’t mean that they don't like you or want to be with you. It may just be that they don't like the tradition of the promise ring. You can ask them why they don't want the ring, but try not to sound accusatory.
Remember that your significant other or friend is incredibly important to you. You may feel hurt but try not to do or say anything that could hurt their feelings.

Read ""Histoire de ma vie"" Casanova's autobiography.,
Listen.,
Have fun.,
Love, laugh and live as hard as you can.

,
Don't be afraid of swimming against the tide, but do not hate the people who frown upon your actions.

,
Gamble when you can't afford to lose.,
Seek that which you can't have.,
When you lose it all you'll learn that you didn't need it in the first place.

,
Don't be afraid.,
Feel it rather than think about it.,
Don't listen to people.,
Try everything.,
Get principles to start with.,
Stand by your principles.,
Stay thirsty.",How to Be a Casanova," He wrote the book for one reason alone: I am writing my life to laugh at myself, and I'm succeeding. His book Is over 4,000 pages of outrageously fun stories about a single man's adventures conquering the world through his charm.;
, Actually listening to somebody is the single most important rule you'll ever learn about people -especially women. Listen to what they have to say. All people have dreams, fears, hopes and thoughts. Listening to them will be the greatest gift you can give to anybody, great or small, wise or ignorant, and if you can do that for them, they'll love you in return.

, The only reason to lead a life of adventure is to enjoy it. Power, money, pleasure and excitement will come all in due time but they will be just spices on the main dish. Even the charm and charisma which you'll learn are mere accessories to the ultimate goal of enjoying your freedom to do what you love. Don't be too serious about life. This will project you as more cool and confident person, which are qualities of a Casanova.

,,, This may seem like terrible advice, but you'll never be as creative, as fast and as brave than when losing is not an option.

, Always have the die hard attitude to achieve goals in life which you have desired to have in life and develop abilities to achieve them.

,, Nothing worth remembering has ever came from being afraid. If you get fired from your job, well, you probably didn't like it anyway. If your girl leaves you, there still plenty of fish in the sea. If you get shot in the leg, well, you had it coming anyway.

, A thousand women may fall in love with your dreams, none will love you for your reason.

, Most of them have a way of telling you that the life of a Casanova is full of sin, moral perversion and deviousness. For the most part this is true. But the world needs dreamers too. They may never understand you, but they won't have as much fun either. Trust yourself. Trusting your heart will take you to places that nothing else can. You will make mistakes, of course, but it is not about being right or wrong, it's about living.

, At least once, mostly twice. This means forgetting prejudice, shutting your mouth and actually doing things. If you've always talked about buying a van and driving cross the continent there's no reason to keep putting it off, vans are cheap, food is everywhere; go for it!

, ""Being a nice person"" and ""being honest"" doesn't quite cut it. Your principles should stand for something beyond that, something in the line of ""Freedom, Beauty, Truth & Love"" will do.

, Being a free man doesn't mean you can do anything you want, regard your own principles higher than the actual law, let them be your guide.

, No matter what you achieve, how great your life seems to be, or how tired you become, there's always a new adventure waiting around the corner for the man who is ready to undertake it.

Dress nicely.,
Wear red if you are a woman.,
Smile at your date.",How to Be a Good Date1," Put effort into whatever you wear on your date. You want to feel good about how you look and be confident. Putting effort into how you dress will also show your date that you care about the impression you are trying to make.

Also, dress in a way that is appropriate for the activity. You would not wear a dress to go bowling or wear a suit to the beach.

Your outfit to go get lunch or coffee may be more casual than what you would wear to a dinner date.
If you wear heels, make sure that they are comfortable and you have no problems walking in them. You never know if you will have to do a lot of walking or standing.
Highlight your best features. If you have nice legs, you can wear a dress or a skirt. If a certain color brings out your eyes, wear a shirt that shows them off.;
, Men are more attracted to women who red than women who wear other colors.

Be punctual.,
Be yourself.,
Avoid talking about your ex.,
Do not drink too much alcohol.",How to Be a Good Date2," Time is valuable. If you show up late, you are telling your date that your time is more valuable than his or her time. Being late is sending the wrong message before the date has even started.If you're running late, call ahead to let your date know, or reschedule well in advance.


If you are usually late to things, plan to leave extra early . Also, consider the traffic you may encounter on the way.
If you are going to a place you have never been before, map it out so you can gauge how long it will take you to get there.

, A date is a time for you and your date to get to know one another. Don't do or say things that you would usually wouldn't just to get your date's attention or to get them to like you.

Your goal is to find someone that you are compatible with and likes you for the person you are. The best way to do this is present your true self while you are on the date.

Be truthful about your likes and dislikes and answer questions honestly. There is no need to embellish or make things sound better in an effort to impress your date.
If you snort when you laugh really hard, go ahead and let it happen. It is something that makes you unique.

, It is fine to talk about your last relationship if your date asks, but do not go into too much detail or reveal all of the bad things about your ex. You should focus on the present and the possibility of building something with this new person.Talking about your ex can also give the impression that you may bring baggage into a new relationship and can be a turn off to your date.

, If you are nervous, it may seem like a good idea to have a drink or two to relax. However, drinking too much alcohol may backfire on you.You do not want to say or do something because your inhibitions have been lowered. If you drove yourself to the date, drinking and driving is another reason to limit your alcohol intake.


Do not drink more than two alcoholic drinks on your date and make sure you drink some water.
Also, if you know that you have a low alcohol tolerance, you may want to refrain from drinking alcohol all together.

Be polite and considerate.,
Be attentive to the other person.,
Engage in good conservation.,
Be an active listener.,
Make eye contact.",How to Be a Good Date3," Be polite at all times. Don't expect everything to go your way. When choosing where to go, be prepared to compromise and be open to new things. Also be polite and considerate to any other people you encounter on your date. Being rude to a waiter or a person working at the movie theater will make you look bad.How you treat other people tells your date about the kind of person that you are.

, You and your date will feel more connected to each other if you are focused when he or she is talking.If your date is talking about something, ask questions or make comments that show that you are interested in what is being said. Another way to be attentive is to keep your cell phone turned off. It is distracting and rude to reply to phone calls constantly during a date.


For example if your date mentions a musical artist or a television show that both of you like, let your date know.
If you are expecting an important phone call, let your date know and screen all numbers but the urgent one. Otherwise, turn it off and check your messages later.

, The conversation can make or break a date. You want to share about yourself and learn about the other person as well. Avoid pre-planned jokes and one-liners as they do not go over as well as spontaneous jokes and more natural conversation.Talk about things that reveal good personal qualities (e.g. generosity, kindness), artistic abilities,and cultural experiences.


If you think you are talking about yourself too much, say ""Enough about me, let's talk about you...""
Do not treat your date as if he or she is on a job interview. No one wants to be interrogated. Instead ask questions about likes and dislikes and really get to know the person. This should be a relaxing and fun time., The date isn't all about you. It's about learning more about another person and showing them that you are interested. Listen as the other person is talking and do not interrupt. Try to take in what the other person is saying instead of thinking about what your response will be.Your body language should also say that you are listening. You can nod in agreement or lean forward as the other person is talking.


Paraphrase what the person says and then ask questions to move the conversation forward.Try saying, ""So you're saying..."" and then ask a questions.

, Looking your date in the eyes communicates that you are interested in what he or she is saying and is a sign of respect. However, you do not want to stare at your date too much. Try looking for 7 to 10 seconds and then look elsewhere.You can look across the room, at another part of your date's face, or at the waiter.


Pay attention to how your date responds to the eye contact. If he or she looks uncomfortable or keeps looking away, you may be making too much eye contact.

,
However, do not fake this!",How to Behave Like a Contemporary Gentleman," You don't have to dress ""preppy"" but you should make sure your pants, shirts and shoes are of good quality and in good repair. Gentlemen don't wear things that are scuffed, stained, ripped, ill-fitting, or otherwise in bad shape. Wear only clothes in which you feel confident. But don't try to be something you're not, women can always tell when you're faking it.;
, Make conversation, but let her do at least half the talking. Look her in the eyes. Don't stare at other parts of her body, and don't lean in too close unless you're about to kiss her.

, (Shake hands with your friends until you get this right.) You should reach out, grasp the other person's hand firmly but without crushing their fingers, give two up/down shakes, and then release. Shake hands immediately upon being introduced to someone new, and say ""How do you do?"" which is a greeting and not a question. Never ever say ""Pleased to meet you."" It is very middle/working class manners to say that. This also applies to girls, but do not squeeze their hand. Hold her fingers and gently shake up and down. If someone does not hold out their hand to shake, simply nod your head and proceed as if nothing has happened. Make sure that when you're shaking someone's hand that you look them in the eye. Eye contact shows respect and confidence. 

, A foul mouth is not gentlemanly at all. Try to speak clearly, with your head up, and use correct grammar. Don't use big words if you don't know what they mean. If you don't know much about the subject of conversation, you can keep silent, ask what someone else thinks, or make neutral remarks.

, If someone else brings such a subject up, listen politely but don't say anything. (Of course, there are exceptions depending on how well you know someone, and what they would or wouldn't find offensive and disturbing.)

, Gentlemen can appear at ease without slouching, you know!

, and yourself neat and clean. Don't leave trash lying around or dirty dishes in the sink. Shower daily, wear deodorant (but not too much, cologne or deodorant you can smell from a mile away is off putting) and brush/floss your teeth.

, Don't touch a person until you have gotten to know them well first.

, You can let the girl talk you into splitting the bill in half if you want, but don't let her pay for the entire thing.

, Offer to help wash the dishes.

,, If you're with people you know well, you can have up to two, but don't have more than that. A simple drink of a high-quality liquor is usually better than a mixed drink with cheap ingredients.

,,, Women can always tell if you are secretly a sleazy slime ball hiding behind the appearance of a gentlemen. If all else fails, simply remember this - being gentlemanly is about being courteous and respectful.

"
Let the intimacy of the moment fade gradually.,
Enjoy some time in silence if the conversation feels awkward.,
Keep any conversation candid and casual.,
Tell your partner things that you liked, but be brief.,
Cuddle with a movie, TV, or music if you’re out of things to talk about.,
Consider taking a bath or shower together.,
Treat each other with respect before, during, and after sex.",How to Behave After Sex1," Just because you’ve enjoyed yourselves doesn’t mean that the feeling of intimacy should end when the sex does. Put another way – you use foreplay to gradually ramp up the sexual attraction, and you should use the time afterward to gently return to the “real world.” The biggest mistake people make after sex is getting up and leaving as soon as it is over, destroying all of the intimacy you’ve built together.There is no rule saying you have to talk right after sex. Spooning, cuddling, or even holding hands is a good way to slowly relax back into everyday life.
If you want to put some clothes back on, keep it casual (underwear, sweats, pajamas, etc.) and hop back into bed. You don’t need to stay naked if it makes you feel uncomfortable.
Turn off the phone—no one wants to feel like their partner would rather talk to someone else.
Stay out of the kitchen – it is natural to feel hungry after sex, but that doesn’t mean your first comment should be “I could use some food.”
Stay awake—falling asleep right after sex will make your partner feel disrespected, used, and unloved. ;
, Enjoy the quiet and only speak when you have something to say. There is something incredibly loving about being with someone, enjoying each other’s presence, and not saying a single word. Sex is an intimate act, and a lot of intimacy is unspoken. Try just making eye contact, smiling or laughing, holding hands, or cuddling. When the two of you are ready to talk, you’ll feel conversation bubbling up organically.

, After a moment as intimate as sex, conversation can seem incredibly mundane and difficult. Don’t feel like you need to drop a movie-worthy line – you won’t come up with a good one and it won’t sound nearly as romantic as you think. The most important advice for pillow-talk is to be yourself. Be relaxed, honest, and open and the conversation will feel natural.


Opening up about your day – share a funny story, talk about work, or explain a new project, hobby, or event that you’re excited for.
Asking questions— you don’t need to start an inquisition; simply ask your partner how their day went, if they have any weekend plans, and let the conversation unfold.

, Do not criticize or elaborate at length about the session. However, letting someone know what you enjoyed briefly and respectfully is a great way to keep a connection going and tell your partner your sexual needs. Don’t feel like you need to hear anything back either – asking “did you enjoy that,” puts pressure on someone to get the “right” answer and kills the mood.


Keep it brief, as showering someone with praise on their sexual prowess quickly gets weird: “I really liked it when ....” or “That was great when...” should suffice.
Never criticize, rate, or offer tips afterward. Post-sex is about enjoying each other’s company and feeling relaxed and respectful, not getting a lecture.

, Honestly, spending time together after having sex is more important than any conversation you might have. It is tough to go from an incredibly intimate moment like sex to a conversation about the recycling, so find some lazy, bedside entertainment the two of you can share:


Watch a couple of clips on a laptop.
Share some new music you like.
Do the crossword or puzzles together.
Sit quietly and enjoy a view out the window or just each other’s company.

, Without getting graphic, some people like to wash off after lovemaking. This is perfectly normal, but a good way to prevent your partner from feeling “dirty” is simply to shower together. This is a great way to avoid laying around in bed afterward but still stay intimate., Sex is a natural, organic extension of a relationship, not the end-all-be-all of life. So take a deep breath and just enjoy the company of your partner. The mood will already be relaxed and loving, so go with the flow and be your kind, respectful self.

Don't disappear on someone after hooking up, especially the day after.,
Remain friendly and considerate in public.,
Spend time together outside of the bedroom.,
Communicate your thoughts about the relationship.,
Never use sex as a bargaining chip.,
Don’t change who you are simply because you’ve had sex.",How to Behave After Sex2," Unless you discussed the “no-strings-attached” hook-up before you hooked up, you should never disappear on someone just because you’ve finally had sex. This tells people that you were only in it for the hook-up. Like it or not, word of your habits will get around, and it is not only disrespectful, it is hurtful to your partner.


Don’t ignore calls and texts – respond when you can with a genuine, kind answer.
Being available is not being clingy— while you should make an effort to be open and show that you aren’t running away, 1 quick text, call or conversation is enough., There is little more hurtful than seeing a partner, expecting a hello or hug, and getting the cold shoulder in return. If you are ashamed or embarrassed to be with that person after you’ve hooked up with them, you shouldn’t be hooking up with them in the first place.

, Call your partner and meet for drinks, a walk in the park, or dinner and movie. This doesn’t mean you need to dive right into full-on dating. Rather, you should build a relationship outside of sex that shows you care for and respect them, even if you don’t plan on sleeping together again or want a relationship. Avoiding platonic or non-sexual time makes you look shallow and can make someone feel used.

, All relationships, sexual or not, need proper communication to survive. This doesn’t mean you need to talk on the phone for hours. It simply means you need to be open and upfront about what you are looking for. If you want a serious relationship and your partner is under the assumption that you are just hooking up, one of you is going to be in for a rude awakening. Trying to manipulate, coerce, or change someone’s mind will not work. Honest communication, however, will get you far.


What are you looking for in a relationship?
What are they looking for?
How do you both see things moving forward in your relationship?

, Sex is a natural, organic part of a relationship, not a tool to get what you want.You should only be hooking up because you already love your partner, and you want to be intimate with them. Sex is not about fun only, but about union with another soul and about expressing your own true love for another. Making demands, asking for favors, or expecting new treatment cheapens the intimate act between you and can ruin a relationship.

, Everyone has different ideas about what sex “means.” At the end of the day, however, most sex is simply the growth of a relationship and intimacy, even if only for a moment. No matter what you should be kind, available, and respectful, but you should also take things slowly. Many people, websites, and movies will try and tell you the right timeline, rules, and words to say. But every relationship is different, and there is no “perfect playbook” for how to act after sex. So be kind and considerate. Above all, be yourself.

Let things progress slowly.,
Keep busy with your own interests.,
Try to have fun together.,
Avoid using sex to fuel feelings of intimacy.,
Take a break, if necessary.,
Discuss your feelings with the other person.,
Make a decision about the relationship eventually.",How to Deal With Mixed Feelings in a Relationship1," If you're unsure of how you feel, especially early on in a relationship, have patience. Do not try to push for a premature commitment if you're uncertain how you feel. It's important you let things develop at their own pace in any relationship, especially if feelings are mixed.Maintain your own schedule. If you're not sure how you feel about someone, you should not sacrifice a lot of your own time and needs for that person. While you're figuring out your feelings, keep up with your own hobbies and social obligations.
If you have not yet settled into official relationship status, do not worry. You should not try to push for commitment when you're still unsure of how you feel, and there is no shame in being in a relationship gray area for awhile.
You should also take care of yourself. Eat right, exercise, and get adequate rest. Take care of yourself as you normally would.;
, You want to make sure you can still be yourself with this person. Keep up with your own hobbies and interests. See if this person fits into your world. This can help you assess whether the romance works for you.Make what you value clear. If you like to stay in on Fridays rather than going out, try invite your partner over. See how he or she fits into your world.
Keep up with your own interests. If you go to a book club every other Friday, do not stop going even if your partner invites you somewhere else. Make sure your partner supports your interests, and allows you to pursue your own fun and social life. If he or she does, this is not a good sign this relationship can fit into your life.

, Fun is an important aspect of any romantic relationship. It's hard to stay with someone if you do not have fun together. You and your partner should genuinely enjoy one another's company. Try to do something fun with your partner. See if you feel happier and more secure. If you're struggling to have fun, this may be a bad sign for the relationship longterm.The definition of fun varies from person to person, so pick something you both enjoy doing. For example, if you both love comedy, go see a comedy show together.
You can also try inviting your partner to social events with your friends. See if your partner's presence influences the group in a positive or negative way. Does your partner make social events more fun? Does he or she fit into your world?

, If you're having mixed feelings, you may want to try to quell those feelings. Many people use sex as an attempt to force feelings of intimacy. However, sex will rarely lead to sustainable feelings of emotional intimacy with another person. Do not expect sex to cure your mixed feelings., If you can't figure out how you feel, and you've been with your partner for awhile, a break can help. You may both need to experience personal growth outside the relationship. Eventually, you may find you want to rekindle the romance.If you decide to take a break, set clear boundaries. Make it clear to your partner how often you'll see each other during the break, if at all, and whether you'll be allowed to pursue other relationships and sex during the break. Decide if the break has a set end point, or if you'll leave things somewhat open.
Be careful to assess your feelings before getting back together after a break. Be honest with yourself about how you feel. Do you honestly miss the person? Do you feel sad in their absence? Do you feel like you've grown as a person while they were away. If so, getting back together can be a good idea. However, if you felt freer and happier in your partner's absence, it may be a good idea to move on.

, If you're in a serious relationship, and you're beginning to have mixed feelings, it may be a good idea to be open with your partner. Set aside a time to talk out the problem, and try to find a mutual solution if you want to avoid the relationship ending. Let your partner know ahead of time you want to have a relationship talk. Say something like, ""I've been grappling with some confusing feelings, and I'd like to talk tonight when you get off work.""Try to focus on the present moment as you express yourself. Avoid bringing up things from the past, even things that are driving your confusing feelings. Instead, focus on how you're feeling in the moment. For example, ""I've been having mixed feelings lately about our future. I want to know how you're feeling in regards to this issue.""
Listen as much as you talk. Allow your partner to share his or her feelings with you. Your partner may feel the same way, in which case the two of you will have to assess the relationship's future. Try your best to genuinely understand what your partner is saying. Ask clarifying questions if necessary.
Leave the conversation with an idea of how to move forward. For example, you may decide you want to take a break. You may decide you want to see a therapist together. You may also decide you want to end the relationship altogether.

, After awhile, you'll have to make a decision about where you stand. After weighing in a variety of factors, consider whether your feelings are genuine and, if so, whether you want to continue to pursue this relationship. If you find you are not invested enough, it may be best to try to transition into friendship.


Even in healthy relationships, mixed feelings may occur from time to time. Do not be alarmed by occasional uncertainty if you decide to move forward.

Consider attraction.,
Evaluate whether you feel close.,
Look for common goals.,
Think about whether you're enchanted with the person.",How to Deal With Mixed Feelings in a Relationship2," Attraction is key to most romantic relationships. If you're involved with someone romantically, you'll eventually become intimate physically. Spend some time considering the level of physical attraction you feel for this person.Think about how you feel about the person in a physical sense. Do you feel attraction? Do you think it's mutual? If so, there may be potential for a romantic relationship here.
Keep in mind mutual attraction should not be the deciding factor. Friends often feel mutual attraction towards one another that is sometimes similar to romantic attraction. For example, you may long for and miss a friend when he or she is gone. Try to evaluate whether the attraction you feel for this person is physical as well as romantic.
Do you find yourself laughing and smiling with this person? Do you look forward to dates and get togethers? Do the two of you have similar interests and passions that you pursue together? If so, this could be a good foundation for a romance.
If you're having mixed feelings, however, evaluate whether the fun you have together feels romantic. Friends often make each other laugh and have fun together. If you don't a romantic spark during fun times, this relationship may be better suited for friendship.

, As you spend time with someone, you should begin to feel deeply close to that person. You should be able to share your feelings, thoughts, and concerns with this person openly. If you're struggling to feel close, or the closeness feels more like friendship, this person may not be a suitable romantic partner for you., Common goals are important to a romantic relationship. This is one thing that helps differentiate a romantic relationship from a friendship. Friends do not necessarily have the same goals. A romantic partner, however, should have similar goals to you if the two of you are compatible.Think about longterm goals. Do you and this person have similar ambitions? Do you see a similar kind of future in regards to things like marriage and children? These things are important when it comes to navigating a romantic relationship. If your views differ in these areas, this may be why you're having mixed feelings. You may be better off transitioning this relationship into a friendship.
You should also think about your belief systems. Do you and this person have similar views on politics, religion, moral values? While you can disagree with someone in a romantic relationship, certain shared values are important. If you and this person disagree a lot, this may also be where the mixed feelings are coming from.

, In a romantic relationship, you find yourself fostering intense thoughts about another person. You may put them on a pedestal in your mind and see their faults and quirks as charming. You may also feel they have superior skills, intelligence, and personality. In friendship, you don't generally get as enchanted with a person. If this kind of infatuation is absent, you may be better off being friends with this person."
"
Accept emotions are complicated.,
Examine your own fears and insecurities.,
Identify your own needs and wants.",How to Deal With Mixed Feelings in a Relationship3," Oftentimes, people feel the need to reconcile mixed feelings completely. You may feel you need to have only one feeling towards a person. However, mixed feelings are common. In fact, the majority of relationships you have will come with some degree of mixed feelings.Mixed emotions can actually reflect maturity. Rather than polarizing a person as either good of bad, you're able to see both their good and bad qualities. Sometimes, you love your boyfriend for his spontaneous nature. Other times, you find yourself annoyed that he's so unpredictable.
Try to accept that there will be a degree of mixed feelings in any relationship. If you still want to be with someone, despite mixed feelings, this is actually a good sign. You're willing to acknowledge imperfections and frustrations, but still want to be with another person.

, If you're prone to mixed feelings and uncertainty, there may be reasons for this. If you have a lot of underlying fears or insecurities, you may find you doubt yourself frequently.Have you been rejected in the past by someone important? If so, you may have a chronic fear of rejection. Frequent mixed feelings may be a way to protect yourself from getting invested.
Are you an insecure person? If you're fearful of being abandoned, and do not feel good enough for love or commitment, this will affect almost all your actions. You may have mixed feelings getting into relationships because you're afraid of getting involved.

, In order to assess whether a relationship is right for you, you need to know what you want. Know what you need and want from a romantic partner. Figure out whether this person can provide that.Think about your emotional reactions to events in your life. How can someone best support you emotionally? What do you need from another person?
It can be helpful to make a list of attributes that are important to you in a romantic partner. Consider whether this person will be able to fulfill these romantic attributes for you.

Be confident.,
Be adventurous.,
Develop a sense of humor.,
Be generous.,
Be honest, ethical, and authentic.,
Don't be misogynistic or sexist.,
Don't be gross.,
Don't be a flirt.,
Avoid unnecessary arguments with her.,
Don't be overly cheap.,
Treat everyone around you well.,
Don't be needy.,
Compliment her.,
Show her you care.,
Share your feelings and talk regularly.,
Listen to her.,
Respect her boundaries.,
Get involved in her hobbies.",How to Be the Guy Every Girl Wants," The benefits of being confident are nearly endless: greater happiness in life, freedom from anxiety and reduced stress levels, and greater self worth. People who are around confident people also reap the benefits: their interactions with you will be more relaxed, comfortable, and enjoyable, and they'll be able to trust and respect you more. All other things unchanged, if it's between someone who is confident and someone who is anxious all the time, most women would prefer to be with a guy who's confident.Show confidence by exhibiting good posture--stand up straight, smile, make good eye contact, take more space, don't fidget, and be open with your stance (that is, don't cross your arms or your legs).Remember what makes you great. You do in fact have lots of skills, talents, and points; make a list of these things for your reference and look them over from time to time as a reminder.
If you start to feel negative about yourself, give yourself a pep talk. ""Hey, man. So what if you don't have a six pack. You have an A in Math, you have a nice smile, you're funny, you just got a job as a lifeguard for the summer, you have really good friends and you're a really good shortstop. You have a lot of things going for you!"";
, Girls like guys who can tell them interesting stories about things they've done and seen, and many girls will enjoy getting to experience these things with you. By doing lots of things you'll be enriching yourself as a person, learning new skills and information and the kinds of things you do and don't like. Try new foods, new sports, crafting (like woodworking and welding), programming, sewing--anything that piques your interest.


Don't get caught up in the notion that certain hobbies are for girls or boys only. The idea that certain things are only for one gender or the other is all the result of cultural conditioning, and there's nothing wrong with a boy learning to knit or skydive or whatever he wants to do., Everyone likes being around someone that can make them laugh: laughter does a lot of great things for your body, including reducing stress and blood pressure. It also makes us feel good. Learn how to make people laugh, and learn how to take a joke as well, even if it's at your own expense.Remember that no matter how big or small one's failures, they're just an opportunity to improve yourself and everyone makes mistakes. Don't get hung up on a sense of pride and you'll be able to enjoy your life a lot more.
Remember that so-called mean-hearted jokes made at the expense of others actually aren't funny and can spread hurtful ideas about other people. There are lots of jokes that you can make that have nothing to do with other people and won't hurt anyone's feelings. For example: ""What's made of leather and sounds like a sneeze?"" ""A shoe."", When you interact with people, be generous: share your time and your feelings with others, and take the time to be a pillar of support when they need you. Take the time to give back to the communities and world around you as well and you will become a person more people want to be around.


Volunteer to help drive siblings to and from school functions and sports practices.
Help your friends and classmates on projects when they're struggling.
Donate your time and energy to visiting people in assisted living homes or walking dogs at your local animal shelter.
Participate in fundraising drives like baked sales for charity or canned food drives around the holidays.

, Sometimes people get the idea that there are certain ""types"" of guys that you can easily classify men into, and that by becoming that ""type"" of person you will become appealing. It might be true that if you change yourself to be someone you're not, you could attract a girlfriend. But that relationship would be based on a lie that you will have to continue indefinitely in order to sustain that image. Live your life and conduct your relationships in ways that are genuine, honest, and uniquely you.If you're not into something, like a specific kind of music or a sport, don't lie, even if the girl you're interested in feels differently. Most people will not take it personally if some of your interests are not mutual, and if she does that might be a sign you're not very compatible.

, Women find it unappealing when men are bitter or look down on women. This applies whether it's a personal comment about her, other women you've dated, or women in general. No one is going to want to spend time around someone who treats them disrespectfully and unkindly.For starters, don't make rude comments about women, label them as ""crazy,"" claim they belong in the house, or call them derogatory names.
Women are really just people. Ask yourself how you would want to be treated if you were a woman and use this as a gauge.
Ask the women around you--sisters, mothers, friends, and coworkers--what kinds of behavior they find offensive and be sure to avoid doing these things.
If you have problems with disliking women as a whole, you likely have some personal issues that you need to take some time to address. Try to figure out why you feel this way, and seek counseling to work your way through it.

, Women don't want to date a guy who has no manners and lacks in personal hygiene. It should be obvious, but don't pick your nose, spit, scratch your butt, or clip your nails in public. If you wouldn't want your grandmother to see you doing it, don't do it.

, Some men make the mistake of thinking that being a ladies' man means flirting with all the women they're around, even if their date is present, or bragging about previous girls they've dated. What this really communicates to women is that you don't respect them, particularly not the girl you should actually be trying to charm.At the very least you need to not engage in this sort of behavior in your date's presence, but preferably you should not do it at all.
You should never, ever cat-call a woman (that is, whistle or make inappropriate sexual comments to women on the street). This is not a compliment but a form of sexual harassment., Although there is a lot of talk about two people needing to have some kind of chemistry, being on a date or in a relationship should not feel like being in a debate class. Many people find arguing to be stressful and unpleasant, and you don't want to give the impression that you're judging her. Wait until your relationship has become more established before getting into philosophical debates and instead let things go and switch topics if things become too heated.Brainstorm a number of interesting topics that you two can talk about beforehand, like where she grew up, or what kinds of hobbies you two like, your favorite vacation destinations, that sort of thing.
Telling a woman what to do, how to do, or why to do something, especially when you are ignoring her own life experiences in favor of a man's, is often referred to as ""mansplaining."" It's considered unattractive and disrespectful., Most women will not expect you to spend indiscriminately, but if you take a girl on her first date to your favorite fast food joint or ask her to pay half at a very expensive restaurant that you suggested, she may think less of you for that. Think about it: a date is a chance to show her that you think she's special and to treat her so: if you act cheap, you're communicating that you don't value her or your potential relationship with her.Avoid mentioning words like ""saving"" and ""budget"" for the first few dates.
Plan your dates wisely. You can pick restaurants that you know have a menu in a price range you can afford by looking them up online first or choosing to eat at lunch time instead of dinner. You can also try making dates that might be cheaper overall, like making a romantic picnic in the park or taking her out to a famous local destination for sightseeing instead of eating.

, Whether you're at work, on a date, or at school, be careful that you treat everyone around you with a minimum level of respect. This means don't pick fights, yell, insult people, act egotistical, and in general avoid copping an antagonistic attitude. Women are often watching how you treat other people around you, and not just them, to get a feel for how you might treat them later on or people they care about.This includes people serving you, like waitstaff or salespeople.
If you find yourself in a situation where you're getting upset because something didn't go right (say you waited an hour for your food to come and when it did it was cold), take a few deep and slow breaths before speaking in an even, calm voice. Politely say ""I'd like to speak to a manager."" When they arrive, without blaming anyone, explain the exact problem and why you are so upset before asking them to please do what they can to make it right.

, Although everyone gets down in the dumps every once and awhile, you should avoid being overly insecure and dependent. Particularly at the beginning stages of a relationship, you want to show that you've got things together and you're not a hot mess just waiting to fall apart on her.Don't talk a lot about previous relationships that didn't work out or express deep fears of failure on the first couple of dates. Until you have gotten to know each other better, say after several months of steady dating, this is often considered oversharing.
If you have overwhelming or chronic feelings of anxiety or sadness about your work, friendships, or current or past relationships during the time period before you can share but have no one else you can talk to about it, seek counseling from a licensed therapist to help you work through your problems.

, Everybody likes to hear that they're liked and why someone finds them attractive. It's a good way to boost her self esteem and make her feel special. Be sure that your compliments are specific--instead of saying ""I think you're beautiful,"" which she has probably heard before and is very vague, try saying ""I like your freckles, I think they're cute,"" or ""I love your perfume, it makes you smell so good.""Compliments that take note of both her inner and outer qualities, like ""That dress looks great on you, it really brings out the color of your eyes,"" are especially good. This compliments not just her physical features but also her choice of dress (and therefore her decision making abilities). Women want to be valued for their minds as well their physical bodies.
Avoid comments that are sexual in nature until you are in a much more established relationship: you should wait until after the second or third date at least. Many women will not be comfortable receiving overt sexual attention too early on, and it's better to air on the side of caution than risk offending her.

, Although being told that someone cares is great, women want to be shown that you care too. Although this can mean giving gifts, this can also boil down to displays of affection: kisses, hugs, hand holding, and that sort of thing. The whole point of dating someone is being with them and feeling close to them; if you're too distant and emotionally unattached that's not good.Gifts do not have to be expensive: although many girls do like candy and flowers, something that you have taken the time to make yourself, like a piece of art, a poem, a song, or something you've handcrafted like candles, will also make her happy. It's not the price tag on the gift but the thought that went into it that should matter.

, No one can know what's on your mind unless you say it, so it's important that you communicate effectively. Once you've gotten past your second or third date, a girl is going to want to start to know what you're thinking and feeling: how your day was, the things that trouble you, what made you happy, how you're feeling, etc. Talk about the things that matter to you, like important projects or personal setbacks, and don't be afraid to admit when something matters, even if it feels like it should be too small to be noteworthy.There is no hard and fast rule as to how much communication is too much or too little, especially since each person's or couple's life circumstances may make this vary greatly. If one of you owns your own business or is busy 12 hours of the day working, then you may not be able to talk as much. Talk with her to find out how much you both agree is the right amount: as long as you two are happy, whether you talk or see each other every day or only once a week is fine., Relationships can't survive without good, healthy communication, and women want a man that is both capable of expressing himself and listening to her. Listening to someone is a sign that you respect them as a person and value their thoughts and experiences. If you don't want to listen to the person you're with, chances are that's not the right person for you.Practice good listening skills.Keep eye contact and face her when she's speaking.
Stay relaxed but pay attention and refocus on the conversation if your attention starts to wander.
Keep an open mind and don't be too quick to pass judgments.
Don't interrupt her, particularly not to give solutions. Wait until you're sure she's finished before you begin to speak. Cues in her speech pattern (a long, uninterrupted pause after a completed thought) and tone of voice (the ending high tilt for a question or a low tilt for a statement) will let you know when you can speak.
Ask questions when she pauses to clarify anything you don't understand, and only give advice if it seems like she wants it.
Try to understand her feelings and be empathic by giving good feedback, like ""That really sucks,"" or ""I'm so happy for you,"" depending on what you're being told. Basically, try to be supportive, even if you don't have any advice to give.
Pay attention to any nonverbal cues, particularly those being given through body language and facial expressions, which will help you understand how she is feeling.

, There may be times when the girl you like expresses that she doesn't want to do something, like talk about a sensitive subject (ex: a family member's mental illness) or having sex. It's very important that you respect her if she says no and don't try to force her to do something that she isn't ready to, whether this is talking or acting. This builds trust, and most likely in time she will be ready to share with you whatever she's been holding back.


If you want her to realize that you want to be supportive, or that you still want her to feel comfortable coming to you in the future, try saying something like ""Okay, I understand and respect your feelings. But if you ever change your mind, just let me know. I'm here for you.""

, Being in a relationship means that a girl is looking for someone to spend time with. Especially if you don't have any interests that already overlap, you should try to get to know what she likes to do and get involved too. This could be anything from finding a similar band that you're both into to books that you like or playing video games--girls have interests just as diverse as boys, and she'll be touched that you care enough to find out what she likes and to try it out, too.


Don't assume that you know what she likes based on her looks or other women you know; every person is different. Ask her what kinds of things she enjoys, and pay attention when you have conversations or are hanging out. Likely she will mention things in conversations that she does, like yoga or watching horror movies.

Use your horse’s stable name as the main inspiration.,
Make the stable name more interesting.,
Come up with several variations.,
Consider your horse's abilities.,
Use your horse’s past as inspiration.",How to Think of a Show Name for Your Horse or Pony1," Most horses aren’t called by their show name every day. That is because these names are usually a bit long and impractical. However, you can use the name you typically call your horse by as a good source of inspiration.Think about your horse's stable name and try combining it with descriptive and creative word(s) of your horse's glory in the show ring, your horses personality, or your horse's favorite things to do.
For example, if you have a mare called “Autumn,” you could call her “Autumn Glory,” “Autumn Charm,” or “Autumn's Mischief.”
If you have a gelding called “Blaze,” you could call him “Blaze's Pride,” or “Copyrighted with a Blaze.”;
, You can choose a totally different show name, but still use your horse’s stable name as inspiration. Think about your horse’s name, and then come up with a way of describing that name.


For example, if you owned a filly named “Star,” you could call her “Born to Shine,” “Shine Forever,” “Bright Future,” or “Shining for Life.”

, You don’t have to choose your horse’s name in one day, so spend time coming up with different variations of your horse’s name. Write them all down no matter how good or bad you think they sound at first.


If your horse’s stable name is “Dash” then there are lots of potential show names. For example, “Thunder Dash,” “Slap Dash,” “Mad Dash,” or “Silver Knight.”

, If you want to show your horse, then they may have a skill that they are particularly good at, and this could serve as a good source of inspiration for your horse’s show name.


If your horse is a jumper, you could call him “Jumping at Dawn.”
If your horse prefers classic dressage, you could call her “Just a Classic.”
Most race horses have names that are in some way associated with running (e.g. “Bluegrass Stampede”).

, If your horse has a particularly interesting past then you can include this in their name in some way. For example, if your horse was rescued from a bad situation, then you could combine their stable name with “Second Chance.”


For example, “Risby’s Second Chance.”

"

Name them based on the name of the parents.,
Think about where your horse was bred and born.,
Consider the origins of your horse’s breed.,
Think about your horse’s color, interesting features, and markings.",How to Think of a Show Name for Your Horse or Pony2," It is quite common to choose your horse’s name based on their lineage. If you have access to the information, look for the names of the dam (the female horse) and the sire (the male horse). See if you can combine the names in an interesting way, or if these names inspire you.


For example, if one horse was named “Midnight Lady” and the other was named “Crown Jewel,” you could call your horse “Midnight Jewel” or even “Crown Lady,” if your horse is female.

, If your horse was born in a notable place, then consider using the name of the town or city in their name.For example, if they were bred in Sligo, then why not call them, “Sligo Spot On” or “Sligo’s Star.”

, Many horse breed names refer to where in the world that breed comes from. You can use the breed name or the name of the country as inspiration for your horse’s name.For example, an Arabian could have a name that has something to do with an Arabian sheik or the desert.
A Mustang could have a name like “Wild” or “Heart of America.”
An Andalusian horse could be called something like “Andalusian Surprise” or “Spanish Beauty.”
You can also add a bit of the language of that country to the name. For example, if you have a French bred horse, they could be called something that starts with “Le …” (for a male horse) or “La …” (for a female horse).

, Many horses are named for something that makes them look unique. Spend time thinking about what physical features make your horse interesting. Maybe they have mane that falls in a unique way, or markings that form a shape, or maybe they have a beautifully colored coat.


If using your horse’s coat color as inspiration try to be creative. Rather than choosing a name like, “Chestnut Boy” for your chestnut colored horse, try names like “Firebird” or “Dark Star.”
With markings, you can always use common names of markings (star, snip, blaze, stripe, etc.) to add to your horse's barn name. This is a fairly common practice though, so your horse’s name is unlikely to be especially unique.

"
Look at books.,
Ask friends for help.,
Consider naming your horse after your stable or your sponsor.",How to Think of a Show Name for Your Horse or Pony3," You can go to the library and look through name books or you can purchase books, if you want. You might be able to find books that are specific to horse names, but it is not uncommon to give a horse a human name so don’t forget to skim through some baby name books.Don't be afraid to use a unique name that isn't used nowadays.
Looking through library books will save you money. Unless you have a lot of horses, you probably will only use the book once, so the library is a good option.

, Some people are great at coming up with cool names. Friends will probably have a fresh perspective, so don’t be afraid to ask for suggestions.


If a friend gives you a suggestion, write it down on your list, and say, “Thank you!” Don’t suggest that you’re going to go with the name just to be polite. They may feel offended if they think you’re going to use their suggestion, and then find out you’ve chosen something else.

, If you live on a ranch or farm that has a name, and you bred your horse yourself, you can name your horse after that. If you keep your horse at a stable, you can include the name of stables. If you are sponsored by someone, you might consider including that person’s name, the name of their ranch/farm/stables, or the name of their business as part of the show name.For example, if you keep your horse at a stable called, “Winter Creek” you could call your horse “Winter Creek’s Surprise.”

Choose a style of riding you like or want to try.,
Choose a colour.,
Test driving, or ""Trialing"", a horse is a great way to find out if you like the horse and if it suits you.,
Select a Discipline you want to compete in.,
Choose a breed of horse.",How to Choose the Right Breed of Horse for You," Perhaps you like English with all the fancy English Breeches and Hunt Jackets, or you might like Western Pleasure with the glitzy belts and ultra slimming caps. Whatever it is you like, learn as much about it as you can. Each discipline is different, and requires a different style of horse. Everyone says that the discipline or style they do is the best. Choose a style that suits you. If you think you will look great in Jodhpurs, GREAT! go for an English style horse. The most important thing when choosing a breed for a style of riding is that you want to do it.;
, Colours are not as important unless you plan on showing your horse. Performance matters more than colour. Despite this, all horse owners tend to go for a colour they like. Some prefer Paints, others like Chestnuts or Bays, and some prefer Appaloosas or Buckskins. Whatever you like, try to look for a breed that comes in the colour you like. When choosing a horse, temperament and soundness always come first; colour should be secondary. However, if you do not like the colour of a horse, there is a greater chance that you will not approach a horse of that colouring. If someone doesn't like Appaloosas, they won't go near one, it is the same with any other colour. A good horse enthusiast doesn't choose a colour, but chooses a colour of choice. This is not the single colour they like, but the colour they most prefer.

, This is probably the best way to choose a breed of horse. As many breeds of horses may be interpreted differently by many different views. My friend had a Palomino and it was crazy or My sister had an Appaloosa and it was ugly. Different people have different views so it is best to try it for yourself. Some horses can be ugly, and some can be bad-tempered, rude or naughty. Others can be really pretty, handsome and can be well-mannered and quite intelligent and striking. As a rider becomes more advanced in Horsemanship they begin to learn more about horses in general and begin to learn what they want out of a horse. Most beginners want a horse that is the same gender as them, and that has a personality they like. Most boys want a horse that is tough and handsome, whereas Girls want a pretty girl horse or a really handsome boy horse.

, You have selected a style of riding, for example English. The style of riding has many events and disciplines. For English there is:- Dressage, Showjumping, 3 Day Eventing, Hack, Hunt Seat, Equitation, Show Riding etc. In Western the Disciplines also vary from:- Western Pleasure, Western Horsemanship and Equitation, Trail, Reining, Western Riding, Showmanship and Western Halter. There are also other disciplines which are their own style. Cross Country is neither English nor is it any other style except for really a Jump style. You may also enjoy Vaulting (Gymnastics on Horseback), Polo and Polo Cross, Gymkhana Riding, Mounted Games, Sporting...the list goes on. If you are interested in Dressage for example, then a horse that is best for Dressage would be a Galloway or a Hack horse with training in this field, if you decide upon a Jumping Discipline, (3 Day Event incorporates Dressage, Showjumping and Cross Country - so you need a horse that can do all three) such as Showjumping, then you will need a horse with balance, stamina and that is well mannered and of course...that can jump. Some people like to compete in Carriage Classes or Harness Work. This is a class that caters for Draft, Heavy Horses and light Carriage horses and ponies. The best breeds for these classes are the typical Carriage style breeds such as Welsh Ponies, Drafts and Clydesdale's. However, many breeds can do Harness work, they however need to be trained in it.

Let your new horses settle in This means no riding or work over the first few days.,
Bond with your horse by grooming as stated above, as well as just walking up to him or her and talking to it or giving it a pat.,
Prepare for the night by giving your horse some biscuits of hay or a scoop of grain or a small mixed feed.",How to Settle a Horse Into New Surroundings," Give him or her a good amount of attention by means of hugs, kisses and pats.;
, Ensure there is sufficient water in the stall or paddock as horses can drink upwards of 20 liters (5.3 US gal) of water a day, more when it is warmer.

, This time should be spent giving lots of attention and giving good quality grooming sessions. This gives you the opportunity to bond with your horse.

, Go to its paddock with a book and read, or listen to some music or draw. This will give your horse time to adjust to you and he or she will become interested in what you are doing and he may even want to join in.

, Don't give too much as he or she will already be stressed by the transition, a big feed can cause an upset in their gut.

Determine the age of the animal.,
Determine the size of the animal.,
Determine if a small equine is a miniature horse.,
Consider the breed.,
Assess the proportions of the animal's body.,
Inspect the animal's coat and mane.,
Determine the temperament of the animal.,
Determine the animal's strengths.",How to Tell a Horse from a Pony," A horse that is very young, and thus small, may be mistaken as pony. However, a pony is not simply a young horse. Instead, it is a different type of equine.


A horse is usually fully grown once it is five to seven years old. However, it will grow very rapidly in its first year, reaching about 90% of its fully grown height in that year.The age of a horse is usually determined by inspecting its teeth. To definitively determine the age of a horse, take it to a veterinarian. Your veterinarian will inspect the horse's teeth and determine its age.;
, The biggest difference between a horse and a pony is the size. Equine animals are measured from their withers down to the ground. Horses and ponies are measured in hands. Each hand is the equivalent to 4 inches (10.2 cm), which is the approximate size of a grown man's hand. The abbreviation for a hand is ""hh."" It stands for ""hands high.""Technically, a horse has to be 14.2hh or higher when it's full grown to be considered a horse. Anything below that is a pony.To measure an equine, place the end of a tape measure on the ground next to your horse or pony. Extend the tape measure up to the level of the withers. Once you get a measurement from the tape measure, you should divide it by 4. This will give you the number of ""hands high"" your horse or pony is.
The withers is the point on a horse or a pony where the neck and the back join.

, Some small horse breeds are exceptions to the rule about horse size versus pony size. A good example are miniature horses. Miniature horses were originally bred as pets and, while very small, they are still categorized as horses. A miniature horse is no taller than 34 inches from the ground to the base of the last hairs of the mane.They come in either an Arabian build or a stockier quarter horse build.


In addition, they come in a wide variety of colors, such as appaloosas and pintos, just as non-miniature horses do., Usually, if you know what breed the equine is, you can tell whether it's a pony or a horse. Some breeds have the word ""pony"" in the name, for instance a Shetland pony. This means that all equines in that breed are ponies, even if a few happen to be a bit taller than 14.2hh.


Quarter horses are all horses, even though some of them are shorter than a horse should be.
Finding out the breed of a horse may be as easy as asking its caretaker what breed it is. You can also ask the animal's veterinarian what breed it is.

, A pony's body tends to be stockier than a horse's body. Stockier proportions usually mean ponies have better endurance for work tasks.Their bones are thicker, their necks are shorter and thicker, and they have thick heads with broad foreheads., Ponies usually have thicker coats than horses. Thicker coats make ponies more resistant to cold weather.In addition, a horse's mane is usually smooth and relatively thin, while a pony's mane and tail are usually thick and course.

, Spend some time with the animal, either walking it around or petting and brushing it. Ponies tend to be calmer than horses. They are also very smart, just as horses are. Perhaps this combination of calmness and intelligence is why they are so good with children., Horses and ponies also differ in what they are good at doing. Ponies, because of their strength, hardiness, and tough build, are good at working on a farm. They can pull twice their weight, while a horse can usually only pull half of its weight.Horses, on the other hand, can work on a farm but their strength lies more in carrying people. They are not as strong as a pony but they have good stamina and can be more skillful animals.

Is he sound, and does he have a history of lameness? (Sound means he isn't lame.)
What's his health history? (Verify this with the horse's veterinarian.)
Does he spook or shy?
Why are you selling him? (This should not be because of behavior or health issues.)

, Watch him carefully - does he spook, nip, or seem high-strung? Ask the owner if the horse has any ticklish places.

, Again, watch carefully for spooking or a high-strung nature. Does he throw his feet up high? Does the owner look uncomfortable? Look for a horse that quietly walks, trots, canters, and gallops, and who doesn't spook. Once the owner has rode the horse, your child can. Ask her if she feels comfortable and safe on the horse. If she doesn't, don't buy him.

, It's also possible that the owner will want to lease the horse to you. If you aren't experienced with horses, bring along someone who is to make sure the deal is fair.

, It's also wise to bring along your child's riding instructor, if she has one. Have the veterinarian give the horse an examination to check for health, and the instructor watch your child riding the horse to ensure a good match.

Prepare the pasture for your horse.,
Prepare a nice treat for your new arrival.,
Do a safety check of the stable.,
Organise your supplies, such as grooming supplies, a lead, a halter, and buckets for feed and water.,
Decide on your horse's feed.,
Wait for the horse's arrival.",How to Prepare For the Arrival of a Horse," Make sure the pasture is safe for your horse by removing any dangerous objects such as exposed wire, sharp edges, nails, glass, and other hazardous objects. Also check for poisonous plants that they may eat. Make sure there is a large water source available. If there is no stream running through the paddock, you may need to invest in an old bathtub, or if you need water immediately, try using a 20-litre (5-gallon) bucket until you get a larger trough. Make sure you maintain the water in the bucket all through the day. If you are renting from a boarding stable, the paddock should be safe, though it is always best to double check; if you do not, there is a possibility of your new horse (or another horse) being injured.


All purchased horses should go through at least 30 days of quarantine before being introduced to other horses.;
, When a new horse comes to an unfamiliar surrounding, it is best to leave them for at least a couple of days until they settle in. To help the process along, why not make up a yummy treat? You will want to keep the horse on the diet he was on before you bought him, or at least similar to it, so he doesn't get sick from a sudden change in food; but feel free to make a treat! Many horses love molasses or applesauce. You can also purchase horse treats in stores.

, If you plan on keeping your new horse in a stable, whether at night, most of the day or just an hour or two, you need to make sure it is safe.

Make sure there is a sufficient water source. A large bucket will do if only stabled for a few hours. If stabled at night or all day, invest in a water trough or automatic waterer. Provide adequate bedding such as hay or wood shavings. Keep in mind that the bedding should be an approved horse bedding, as some by-products of woods and timber can be toxic to horses. Sawdust is too fine and can get in the horse's eyes; straw may cause impaction if the horse eats it.







, Also make sure you have equipment to clean the paddock. This includes a spade or a shovel and a rake if your horse is stabled. When replacing the bedding, you will need either a bucket for transporting the bedding or a wheelbarrow.

, Depending on whether the horse is a hard keeper (needs a lot of food) or an easy keeper (needs less food), you and your vet will need to decide on a diet to maintain his body condition. If a horse is underweight, he need more food to put the weight on; if they are overweight, they need less feed. The basic components of a horse's diet include:-


Hay - Horses eat roughage to keep them warm. When buying hay, look at the quality. You want something that is nutritious but is not going to pass right through the horse. Try to get grass hay. If you get lucerne hay, try to get a second or, even better, third cut; the hay will be more stalky and will not be too rich.
Chaff - Some horses, particularly those at pasture with light or no work, will do fine on grass or hay. However, some horses require extra feeding every day, twice a day or every second day, depending on the horse. The best mixture of chaff is lucerne and oaten or Wheat (known as white chaff); however, be careful feeding oaten hay if your horse is prone to laminitis. The lucerne chaff will provide phosphorus for your horse, and the white chaff will provide a source of bulk food. Chaff is often used to prevent bolting feed; in other words, to prevent the horse from eating feed too quickly.
Pellets and Grain are good ways to put on weight and maintain it. They are also handy when you require a boost of energy for a show or your horse needs a pick-me-up. Boiled Grains are best for hard keepers. Whole grains need to be broken prior to consumption, as they expand when contact with moisture has been made. Research different feeds until you find one that you think would suit your horse. Make sure to run everything by your vet. After a while you can try different products until you find the perfect fit. Make all adjustments slowly.
Don't forget supplements! These depend on your horse. Mares may need a calming supplement; horses recovering after being on stall rest may need a supplement designed for them.

, Though hard sometimes, the above steps will keep you amused until he arrives. When he arrives, put the horse in his paddock and give him his feed. Wait a day or two until you ride him so he can settle into his new surroundings and meet any animals on neighboring fences.

Teach your horse to turn on the forehand.",How to Raise Horses," Depending on how you will be using your horse (work or leisure), he could end up spending a good amount of time in his stall. It is very important that his stall is dry, safe, and comfortable.For example, his stall should be in an area of the barn that is well-ventilated.Good ventilation prevents water and dust accumulation that could affect your horse’s health.Comfortable bedding options for the stall include dust-free wood shavings, hemp, and straw. Rubber matting topped with straw or wood shavings is another good option.You can also create a multi-layered floor, consisting of a subfloor made of natural materials (e.g., crushed rock) that is paved over with concrete or asphalt, and a top floor made of either rubber or plastic.This option is time consuming to install and could be expensive.
You will need to ‘muck’ out your horse’s stall daily.Mucking means cleaning out your horse’s manure with a shovel and wheelbarrow. You should also refresh the bedding and make sure it is spread evenly.;
, When your horse is outside grazing, he should have a place to go where he can to protect himself from the elements. A sturdy, three-sided box stall can provide this kind of shelter. The box stall should have a waterproof roof and be positioned such that the back wall faces the wind.Your horse should be able to stand comfortably in the stall without bumping his head against its ceiling.If you have multiple horses, they should all be able to fit in the stall comfortably at the same time.The box stall is especially important during the summer to give your horse relief from the shade and biting insects.Clean the box stall daily.
Consider talking with other horse owners or visiting your local home improvement store for assistance and guidance on constructing a box stall.

, Even if you use your horse more for leisure than work, it is essential that you give him time outside of his stall to graze and stroll around in a paddock or pasture.This outside time gives your horse a chance to exercise.In general, about one acre of pasture is needed per horse.The paddock or pasture should be enclosed by a sturdy fence,such as a wire fence secured with strong wooden posts.White fences, while visually appealing, are costly to construct and maintain.Do not use barbed wire fencing.Your horse could seriously injure himself on barbed wire.
There can be many hazards in your horse’s paddock or pasture, including poisonous plants (e.g., yew, foxglove, buttercups, oak leaves and acorns), trash, and holes in the fencing.Check for these hazards at least once a week, and remove any that you see.

, Feeding a healthy, balanced diet is key to raising a horse. Grass and hay are staples of a horse’s diet.Your horse’s digestive system, although sensitive,can handle large quantities of water and fiber that come from grass and hay.Grazing out in the pasture or paddock will meet your horse’s need for grass consumption.


The hay should be free of dust and mold.Dusty or moldy hay can damage your horse’s lungs and upset his stomach.Common types of hay include clover, alfalfa, timothy, and fescue.The type of hay you feed your horse can depend on his life stage and use.For example, an older horse who is living out his golden years will probably not need the same type of hay as a young, racing thoroughbred. Consult with your veterinarian throughout your horse’s life to ensure your horse is eating the ideal type and amount of hay.
Your horse should have access to hay all day. To keep him from wasting too much hay as he is eating, consider placing the hay in a hay feeder.Covering the hay and storing it in your barn can help prevent mold development and infestation of small vermin like rats or mice.The average horse should eat about two to four percent of his body weight in hay or other feeds per day., Grain is another component of a horse’s diet. Examples of good grains to feed your horse include oats, wheat bran, and ground ear corn.Horses tend to prefer eating mixed grains, so provide a variety of grains to your horse.Be aware that grain is high in carbohydrates and cause serious health problems (colic, muscle disorders, joint problems in foals) if your horse eats too much of it.A good rule of thumb is to start your horse on one-half pound of grain per 100 pounds (45 kilograms) body weight.From there, you can work with your veterinarian to determine how much grain your horse will need, based on his age and activity level.
Always feed your horse hay before grain. This will keep him from not only eating too much grain, but eating it too quickly.Split the grain feeding into three to four small feedings per day.You may have heard that you should feed your horse more grain in the winter to keep him warm. In actuality, hay produces more heat than hay does when digested., Your horse will enjoy receiving treats from you. In fact, giving him treats on a daily basis is an important part of his overall care.However, giving him too many treats could mess up his diet and potentially cause him to want the treats more than his normal food.


The treats you give your horse should be healthy. Examples of healthy treats include apples, maple syrup, and honey.Treats are useful when given as rewards during training.
Be aware that hand-feeding treats to your horse may cause him to start nipping at you., Your horse’s nutritional needs will change as he gets older. It is important that you know how to make nutritional adjustments to maintain your horse’s good health throughout his life. If your horse is young, he will need a high amount of protein, vitamins and minerals in his diet.A young horse will also need a higher ratio of concentrates to forage than older horses. The hindgut of a young horse is still developing and cannot handle the large amounts of fiber and water from grass and hay.Talk with your veterinarian about how to balance the ratio of concentrates to forage in your young horse.
Even though a young horse cannot eat as much grass or hay as an older horse, he should still have 24-hour access to a paddock or pasture. This will allow him to eat at his leisure and get exercise that is necessary for healthy bone development.An older horse needs more phosphorus and protein in his diet to maintain good health and body condition. These nutrients should be given in an easily digestible form.Talk with your veterinarian about how best to add more of these nutrients to your older horse’s diet.

, The average horse will consume about eight gallons of water per day.The water should be fresh and clean.Place a large bucket in your horse’s stall and fill it with water. To keep the bucket from tipping over when your horse drinks from it, consider placing it inside of an old tire.Check the bucket’s water level throughout the day and refill when necessary.

, Maintaining a schedule of routine care for your horse is another important component of raising him and keeping him healthy. If your horse’s hooves do not get trimmed down naturally by his daily activities, then they should be trimmed once every six to eight weeks.Farriers (specialists in equine hoof care) are trained to trim hooves.


If you want to save some money, you can learn how to trim your horse’s hooves on your own. However, you should first have a farrier or equine veterinarian show you how to do this properly and safely.On a daily basis, you should pick out each of your horse’s hooves to remove materials (e.g., rock, dirt, debris) that could get lodged in the hooves and cause pain and discomfort.Ask your farrier or veterinarian if you are unsure how to do this.
Most horses need shoes, which your farrier can either nail or glue to the bottom of your horse’s hooves.Shoes can prevent injury to your horse’s leg muscles, bones, and tendons.Most horse shoes are made of aluminum or rubber.Different shoes are needed for different purposes. Your farrier or veterinarian can recommend what type of shoe would work best for your horse., A healthy mouth is crucial to your horse’s overall health. Your horse’s teeth grow continually and can become uneven over time.This unevenness can lead to sharp points on your horse’s teeth that can make it very painful and difficult for him to eat.The sharp points are smoothed down in a process called ‘floating,’ which is done by either an equine veterinarian or equine dentist.Your horse’s teeth should be floated once, but ideally twice, a year.Teeth floating is hard work and requires that your horse be sedated. Do not attempt to float your horse’s teeth on your own.
Poor dental care can lead to such health problems as colic, choke, and weight loss due to your horse’s inability to adequately chew his food. Uneven teeth can also cause ‘quidding’—food falling out of your horse’s mouth.The angle of a horse’s teeth can change as he grows older. If you have an older horse, you should regularly check his teeth for unevenness., Regular vaccinations and deworming, performed by your veterinarian, are essential to keeping your horse healthy as you raise him. All horses should receive a tetanus vaccination.Depending on your location, your horse might need other vaccinations, such as rabies, equine influenza, and West Nile virus.Your equine veterinarian will be able to tell you which other vaccinations your horse will need.Regular deworming is important to keeping your horse’s worm burden as low as possible. Over time, a heavy worm burden can negatively affect your horse’s digestive system,, cause weight loss, and worsen your horse’s coat condition.Work with your veterinarian to set up a regular deworming schedule.
In addition to deworming, you can do several things on your property to decrease the environmental worm burden: rotating which pastures your horse grazes in and regularly picking up his feces.Talk with your equine veterinarian about how to do pasture rotation.
If you have multiple horses, make sure that you do not overcrowd any one pasture area with horses., Grooming your horse not only keeps his coat clean and healthy as he ages, but also gives you time to bond with him and check his body for any abnormalities (lumps, bumps, injuries).You will need a number of supplies to groom your horse—make the investment to purchase good quality grooming supplies and replace them as needed. There are several types of brushes (e.g, dandy, body) and combs (e.g., curry, mane and tail) that you will need.Dandy brushes are stiff bristled and are good for flicking dust off your horse’s coat.Body brushes, which are soft bristled, are used to brush over your horse’s body.Curry combs are rubber or metal. Rubber curry combs are for raising dust and dirt from your horse’s coat. The metal comb should not be used on your horse’s body—it is used to clean your other brushes.Mane and tail combs are usually wide-toothed to glide through your horse’s mane and tail more smoothly.A plain towel is good for giving your horse a final wipe down to remove any remaining dust or dirt after you’ve finished grooming him.During the warmer months, it would be good to spray fly repellent on your horse after grooming.Organize all of your supplies in a container, such as a bucket., During your daily grooming sessions, groom your horse in the same way each time.This will prevent you from forgetting to groom a certain part of his body. Many horse owners prefer to start at their horse’s head and groom back to the tail,but you can choose whichever direction you’d like—just be consistent about it.


Which brush and comb you use first will depend on how much dirt and dust is on your horse’s coat. If he is particular dirty, you’ll probably need to use a dandy brush and rubber curry comb first to remove the dirt and dust.
Pay attention to your horse as you groom him. He may have areas on his body that he is not comfortable with you grooming. If he begins to tense up or step back, he is telling you that he doesn’t like where you are touching him. Leave that spot and move on to another part of his body.

, In addition to becoming comfortable with grooming objects, your horse should also become accustomed to being touched with other objects, such as saddles, ropes, and bridles.Be gentle when touching and rubbing him with these different objects. It may take some time before he is comfortable with how they feel against his coat.
He should be comfortable with whichever objects you use with him, or put on him, on a regular basis.

, Raising your horse would not be complete without incorporating training into his overall care. When done properly, training your horse helps him trust and respect you, and feel safe with you.Leading your horse is one way to train him.


To lead your horse, you will need snug-fitting halter, a dressage whip (91 to 112 cm long),and a lead rope (two to three meters long).Leading your horse from his side is the customary position from which to lead.It is also safer than leading him from the lead (in front of the horse) or drive (behind the withers) positions.Stand about 12 inches (30 cm) away from your horse and hold the lead rope in your right hand (without wrapping it around your hand).As you walk with him, establish and maintain your chosen distance from him.
Leading your horse will teach him how to respect your personal space when you walk with him.

, Training your horse to yield to pressure, either direct or indirect, also teaches him to respect your personal space. With direct pressure, you touch your horse with your hands. Indirect pressures involves the use of other driving aids, like a lead rope.Be gentle yet firm when applying direct pressure. Pick a particular part of his body, such as the shoulder, muzzle, or legs.Apply steady pressure to that area, then release the pressure immediately when your horse moves away from it.The direct pressure should be just enough to be uncomfortable to your horse.
With indirect pressure, you will stand about three feet (one meter) in front of your horse with the lead rope attached to his halter. Point your index finger towards him and begin to wiggle the rope. Wiggle the rope with increasing force until your horse starts to move back, then stop.It may take your horse a few tries before he understands how he is supposed to respond to pressure. The release of pressure is the reward, but you can also give him verbal praise and treats when he responds correctly.

, Once your horse is comfortable with some of the more basic training, you can move forward with more advanced training, like turning on the forehand. Turning on the forehand requires your horse to shift his center of gravity to his back half and move his body to the side.This movement serves a few purposes: it allows your horse to stretch his muscles and gives you more control over his body.Learning this skill may be easier for your horse than for you.
Training your horse to turn on the forehand involves you applying pressure with your legs to guide the movement of your horse’s hind legs while using the reins to control the movement of the front half of his body.
It is important that you have just the right coordination between your legs and hands to control your horse’s movements. You will also need to make sure that you are sitting balanced on top of your horse.

Choosing your riding discipline.,
Gain experience in your discipline.,
Start looking at horses.,
Lease a horse before you buy one.,
See the horse in person before you buy it.,
Have a vet check out the horse.,
Buy everything you'll need to care for the horse.,
Once you have your horse, take it to the arranged place.",How to Pick the Ideal Horse for You," There are many different riding disciplines which require different skills from both horse and rider, so the discipline you choose will be extremely important in helping you decide on your perfect horse. For example, show jumpers need to be able to pick up their front legs, so it helps to have their shoulders at a tighter angle. In contrast, dressage horses stick to the flat, and so shoulders set farther back will give the rider more control.For both these disciplines, horses should be built slightly uphill, whereas western and pleasure horses should be level or even downhill.


Consider the conformation, temperament, athleticism, and training required for your discipline and use this to guide your choice of breed and horse.;
, Take lessons to learn basic riding and horse care skills before you even consider buying a horse. Compete in shows if you want to test your skills, or simply ride for pleasure. Also, watch videos of experts, read, and research the discipline you've chosen. This will help you get a feeling of what skills and qualities your horse will need to have.

, Search online on several websites that list horses for sale, or on more general sites like Craigslist. Talk to your instructor and other horse owners where you ride, and ask about horses for sale. You can also put ads in the paper or put flyers up around barns in your area. Consider adopting horses from rescues like the RSPCA in the UK, Thoroughbred rescues, or other charitable organizations. Remember that buying a horse from a rescue has many inherent risks that might not become evident until well after you buy the horse, so think carefully before doing this.

, Leasing a horse is essentially renting it for a month or several months at a time. Depending on your leasing agreement with the horse's owner, you will have to pay and care for the horse while you're leasing it. This is a great way for you to test out your skills and to confirm that you have the time and money to devote to your very own horse.

, This is absolutely necessary - you should never, ever, ever buy a horse sight unseen. The horse may have bad manners, vices, conformation problems, or injuries/sicknesses that the current owner did not mention. Try riding the horse on the flat and in whatever discipline you will be participating in - if you plan to use the horse for show jumping, take it over a couple jumps before you make your decision. If the owner won't let you ride before you buy, there's probably a reason for that - stay away from any horses or owners that make you suspicious.


Watch for things like: Does the head pop up when one leg hits the ground? Does the pony look badly groomed or cared for? Is it too skinny or too fat? Are their feet overgrown? These are signs of bad management which could mean that the horse has other problems or fears.







, Get a vet you trust to look at any horse you consider and confirm that it's healthy and in good shape. Make sure you know about any health or conformation problems before you buy, especially those that will impact the horse's long-term health and soundness. Only buy the horse once you're sure it's healthy.

, This will include tack (saddle, bridle, girth, saddle pad, and any other specialized tack for your discipline), grooming supplies such as brushes and hoof picks, polo wraps, spurs or whips if necessary, a helmet, boots, and riding clothes for you, and anything else that will help you keep you and your horse safe and happy. Make sure all tack, especially the saddle, fits your horse before you buy it.

, Make sure you do things that will build up your horse's trust in you. A horse that does not trust you is not a happy horse.

"
"
Make sure you have a hat (to the correct standard) and all other safety gear you will need for the level of riding you will be doing.
,
Ensure that you have appropriate accommodation for your animal.,
Buy or acquire tools needed to clean up after your animal such as a sweeping brush, shavings fork and wheelbarrow.,
Get all the cleaning equipment for your horse that you need.,
Get all the rugs you will need for your horse.,
Although you may be getting tack, head collars, boots etc.,
You may find that over the course of owning a horse you start to pick up odds and ends.,
Acquire hay nets and separate buckets for food and water for your animal.,
Buy feed for your horse that is good quality.,
Get a first aid kit.,
Check that you have access to emergency numbers for a vet and farrier.",How to Prepare for a New Pony,", Remember that different horses live in different conditions e.g. some may live outside all year round and others need permanent stabling. A horse needs between one and one and a half acres of space in a field. Horses are also herd animals and should have company at all times.


Remember that irrespective of the accommodation all animals need a plentiful supply of clean water and food.
It is best to find a stable yard in your area with people who can help you and this will provide company for your horse.

, These should be in good condition as they will hopefully last a long time.

, Brushes, combs, plaiting gear, shampoos, fly sprays, and so on. It is also useful to get grooming boxes so that everything is accessible and easy to carry., Even if they are un-clipped and live in a stable 24/7 they will still need warm rugs for cold weather., from the previous owner, it may be useful to get spares, or anything you think you need but don't have., Lunging gear, traveling gear (although your new horse should come with some), fancy training items, lots of supplements, competition gear, etc. Most of this stuff is not needed right away but if you keep the horse you WILL need it in the future., Remember to get spares since horses can stand on or chew anything left with them overnight.

, You should begin with what your horse's previous owners used to use and only gradually swap over to something else if you need to.


The feed your horse will require is dependent on the horse's weight and the type and amount of work that they do so always check the bag of feed or supplier for more information.

, An equine first aid kit is essential and although other people may have one on hand for emergencies it's best to be prepared!,


Contact the farrier beforehand to check prices etc. as any horse will need to see a farrier approx. once every 4-6 weeks regardless of whether it is shod.

It will be located above other information, in larger fonts, separated from the body of the text by a line., This will be located on the left hand side of the header, in large font. Because most tracks run several races per day, this is used to distinguish between different races. It will typically be a number from one to ten., This will be in particularly large and bolded print, above all of the other information in the header, excluding the race number which will be to its left.

, Underneath the track name there will approximately three lines worth of description. This will begin with the length of the race, the track record, the purse that goes to the winner. It will also list conditions that were necessary for the horses to qualify for the race.


Race participants will often be limited by specifying the horses’ gender, age, and record. These class specifications will be listed in the race conditions.
Alternatively, you will see a alpha-numeric code to the right of track name and above the race conditions. These codes are used to convey most of the information included in the race description. That makes it possible for experts to quickly scan the header for race information.

, On the far right hand side of the header you can find a picture of the course. This can be a meaningful tool, because some horses perform better on specific types of races., Directly under the track information you’ll find three columns of data about the horse. This includes identifying information for the race, pedigree, and average performance history.

, You will find the horse’s race number in large print to the left of the body of the text. The first row of text will tell you the horses name and the second will tell you the owner’s name. The third row indicates the color of the “silks” the horse will wear during the race. The final line is the name of the horse’s jockey.


Underneath the horse’s race number are the morning line odds, the standing odds prior to the race. For example, if the line odds are read 3 – 1, a successful bet of $1 will earn you $3.
Adjacent to the jockey’s name you will find his statistics in parenthesis. The first number is the Jockey’s total number of starts for the meet, followed by first, second, and third place finishes. The final number in parenthesis is the jockey’s win percentage. Next to this you will find in a separate pair of parenthesis the jockey’s races, first place finishes, and win percentage during the past year., The first row is composed of an initial indicating color, a second initial indicating gender, and a third indicating age. The second low lists the horses sire, his sire’s sire, and how much, the owner charges to stud the sire. The third line lists the mother of the horse and the horse’s maternal grandfather. The fourth line provides the name of the breeder. The final line includes the trainer’s name, with his win percentage formatted the same way fashion as the jockey.The initials used to indicate color in the first line of the column are B for bay, Blk for black, Ch for chestnut, Dkb for dark bay, Br for brown, Gry for gray, and RA for roan.
The color initial will be followed with a second indicating the gender of the horse. These are as follows: C for colt, F for filly, G for gelding, M for mare, and R for ridgling.The final element in the first line is the horses age. An example of how this I formatted is “4 (May),” where 4 is the age of the horse and May is the month in which the horse is born. The age of a horse is measured not by the number of their birthdays, but rather by how many New Year’s Days they have seen. A horse born on December 31st will be consider one year old on January 1st.

, To the left on the column will find in large print a letter and a number, indicating any medications the horse might be on and any weight that it might be carrying. You will find the rows formatted to display the horse’s career statistics. The first number indicates total career starts, followed by first place, second, and third place finishes. To the right of this you will see career earnings and the horses best Beyer Speed.


There are a handful of rows formatted in this fashion to indicate the horse’s performance under different circumstances. The first row, beginning on the upper left, is the horse’s career record. The three indicate this horse’s performance this year, the prior year, and historically at this track. From the top right down the rows represent the horse’s record on a dirt fast track, wet track, synthetic track, turf record, and the horses’ record with surfaces and distances similar to that of the race in question.The Beyer speed is a measure of a horses’ average speed relative to the average speed of the tracks it has run. For a $25,000 race average Beyer numbers would be in the low 90s, mid 80s for a $10,000 race, and 57 for a $2,500 race. Top horses might have Bayer numbers in the 120’s.Next to the wet, turf, and distance symbols you will find a number in parenthesis known as the “Tomlinson Rating.” This indicates how well a horse performs on those types of tracks. A rating of 320 or more for wet turf or distance suggests that the horse will likely run particular well on a wet track. For turf a ranking of 280 or more indicates that the horse has an advantage in the race., Underneath the general horse information you can find a list of the horse’s performances in earlier races. Each of these rows will begin with a date, identifying the race, followed by detailed and extensive information.

, At the beginning of the row you will find the date of the race, an abbreviation indicating the track and the race number for that day. This will follow with an abbreviation indicating the condition of the track. The final piece of information before fractional times the distance measured in furlongs.Track condition abbreviations include: fr for frozen, fst for fast, gd for good, hy for heavy, my for muddy, sl for slow, sly for sloppy, and wf. For wet-fast., These give you a sense for how the horse paces itself through a race. The first number is the horses time at a quarter of the distance of the course, the second at a half-mile, the third at three-fourths of a mile and the last number the horse’s final time.


Times are formatted like “2:04 3” where “2” is a measure of minutes, “04” a measure of seconds, and “3” a measure of fifths of a second., After the times you’ll find a number indicating the horse’s Beyer’s speed. This is followed by the horse’s position at post, first call, second call, third call, stretch call, and finish.


The exponent for the number indicates how many lengths (an approximate measure of the length of a horse) the horse was behind the race leader.On the far right off the page you will find a number that represents the number of starters. This is important when considering how favorable the horse’s position is. If there are only 4 starters, a third place position won’t can't for much.
Read comments. On the far right just before the number of starts you will find a comment line. Though short, this will usually give some information about the horses performance that might be hard to ascertain just from the numbers., When a horse if favored to win, the odds will be set up so that any bets on that horse won’t payout as much. Thus, you shouldn’t see yourself as betting for a horse, so much as you are betting against the odds makers. Use the Racing Form to try to predict when a horse is likely to do better than the odd makers believe.

, A high Beyer Speed Figure, especially in recent races, is the standard measure for calculating a horses odds. However, if your objective is to beat the odds, you should be especially careful to observe reasons why the Beyer Speed Figure might be flawed. Did track conditions cause the horse to perform unusually poorly in a recent race? If so, the odds makers may very well be underestimating its chances., A good trainer might be able to take a horse with a mediocre past and encourage it to perform better. Studying the trainer is a good way to determine when a horse might outperform the odds., Below the horse's name in bold type is the name of its rider. The jockey's statistics cover the same time frame as the trainer's statistics.

, Historically, some horses have only performed well on specific courses. Review the horse’s performance at the track to see if it might have an advantage there. Also, consider whether the horse has performed well on similar types of courses and distances in the past., Horses treated with Lasix for the first time often perform better than expected. This will be indicated by a large “L” next to the left of the horse’s average Beyer Speed Numbers. A horse that has just taken it for the first time (as opposed to one that has been on it) will be indicated with a white “L” in a black circle.

, One of the most complicated features of horse betting is ascertaining how a horse interacts with other horses. Does it want to try to stay in front or break out toward the end? Study the horse’s position relative to other horses on the track to ascertain its type and then consider how it might interact with the other types of horses in the race that day., ""The Closer Look"" section in the Racing Form is a brief narrative on each horse written by a professional handicapper. It often contains important pedigree data, clues on workout patterns, and insights on previous races.

Determine if the breakup was recent.,
See if your friends and family are shocked about your new relationship.,
Ask yourself if love is coming too easily.,
Slow your sex-drive.",How to Know if You're in a Rebound Relationship1," If the breakup was just a few days or weeks ago, there may not have been ample time to mourn or get used to being single. Consider the length of the relationship, and ensure the grieving period is similar in length. The longer the relationship, the more time you'll likely need to recover.;
, If your closest friends and family, who know you better than anyone, have huge eyes and open mouths when they find out you have a new love interest, it’s probably a sign you moved on fairly quickly. It may also be a sign they think you’re most likely still reeling from the breakup, and you aren’t ready for a new relationship. , Are you feeling deep love right away? Do you feel like you skipped the “like-stage” of relationships? If you feel like you’re madly in love with your new partner after only a date or two, it may be a rebound situation.


You feel the urge to say, “I love you” right away.
Every email and note has the “Love” as your closing line.
You commit to loving your new partner before learning about them. , If the attraction is primarily sexual, and there is little to no other content to the new relationship, it’s a possible sign of a rebound. Intimacy is often used as a method to get over a breakup. Look for a few of the following sexual signs that may point to a rebound relationship:


Sex is frequent. While it’s possible to have a healthy relationship with plenty of sex, rebound relationships often focus primarily on the sexual aspects of a relationship.
Sex is used as distraction. If sex with your new partner is the outcome whenever the pain of the previous breakup is on your mind, the sign of a rebound relationship is there. Sex is used as an emotional crutch. Many people in rebound relationships use sex as a way to avoid the emotional feelings they harbor. Deep discussions and emotions are brought up, and summarily avoided in favor of sex. "

Check your bitterness.,
Stop comparing your new partner to your ex.,
Judge whether or not the breakup shocked you.,
Stop fixating on your ex.,
See if you’re still friends with your ex.",How to Know if You're in a Rebound Relationship2," Comments about your ex while with your new partner are a good sign of an incomplete breakup. Negative energy related to your ex, or constant comparisons to your ex, means you are upset about the breakup, and focusing more on it than the new relationship.


Constant comments about your ex, like derogatory gripes about the entire sex, are a good sign you haven’t let go. Aggressively bitter comments about your ex are an even clearer sign you’re not over the past. Your new relationship isn’t getting an even share of attention. , When you look for your ex in your new partner, it’s a sure sign you have looked for a replacement rather than a new love. Constant thoughts or comments of the attributes that drew you to your ex show, an unwillingness to embrace the new partner’s qualities. A few examples follow:


”Your hair looks just like my ex’s hair. It’s the same style and color.”
”I can’t believe you like the cooking shows. My ex likes the same ones.”
”I’m so glad you don’t have a cat. The cat my ex had was so ugly.”, If the end of your last relationship was completely out of the blue, caught you completely by surprise, then your current relationship may be a rebound.


Relationships that are troubled for longer periods have more time to wind down. Abrupt breakups often require longer periods before new relationships are healthy.
Sudden breakups require more time to mourn, because the shock is difficult to accept.
Commitment is more difficult in a new relationship when the previous breakup was unforeseen. , Everyone has met the recently broken up person who can steer any conversation or topic into their previous relationship, the former love of their life. That person is generally irritating, and if in a new relationship, likely on the rebound.


If you constantly talk about the pain of the past relationship with your current partner, it’s likely a rebound relationship.
Using your new partner’s shoulder to cry into is not a great sign for the current relationship.
When you’re spending more time talking about the problems with your ex, and figuring out how to fix your broken heart, the new partner is nothing more than a sounding board rebound relationship. , Plain and simple, if you’re still real good friends with your ex, it’s likely you don’t want to let go of the ex, and the new partner is a rebound. Check a few of the following items to determine whether or not you’ve officially made the separation:


Being friends on social media, or still officially “in a relationship,” are sure-fire signs you’re not over the previous relationship. Pictures of you and your ex all over your house are constant reminders of the previous relationship, and a hope that you’ll reconnect with your ex.Do you have your ex’s favorite movie? Are you wearing his old sweatshirt? Do you keep her old perfume bottle in the medicine cabinet? If the answer is ‘yes’ to any of these questions, or those related, you’ve likely not let go."

Make a list of common interests.,
Determine if you’re keeping it casual.,
Don't act like a comfortable old couple.",How to Know if You're in a Rebound Relationship3," Successful relationships should have multiple common interests between partners. You may not have everything in common, but it’s difficult to grow a relationship when interests are dissimilar.If you can't find many common interests, you may be more eager to be in a relationship than you are excited about the new partner. If the relationship itself is the connection, that's a rebound sign.If one of your common interest check-marks isn't attraction, be cautious. Rebound relationships often stem from a fear of being alone, rather than actual attraction. If you’re not really into the other person, the relationship may just be a comforting technique. , Casual relationships are missing the true connection and depth of a meaningful relationship. If you feel like you are genuinely using the new partner instead of actually forming a relationship, it’s very probable you don’t want to risk new heartbreak, and the relationship is casual. Oftentimes, a rebound relationship is used as a bridge to get over emotional issues, and to make it from one serious relationship to another. , If you and your partner are in a routine like a couple that has been together for years, you may be attempting to replace the normalcy of your previous relationship. You want to do some of the common things you and your previous partner did instead of the normal dating process. A few potential activities of established relationships are as follows: Binge-watching a series on Netflix
Talking about the ideal home together
Discussing future, mutual finances"

Check your moodiness.,
Analyze if you’re avoiding discussing deeper feelings.,
Determine if you’re newly commitment-phobic.",How to Know if You're in a Rebound Relationship4," If you are constantly hot and cold, it could be a sign of lingering feelings for your past relationship. It could also be a sign of commitment issues. Either way, constant attitude changes, or out of nowhere outbursts, point towards a possible avoidance of emotional connection., When the discussion with your new partner turns towards something other than the trivial, do you do whatever you can to avoid the conversation? If emotion is constantly being dismissed or misdirected, you may be in a rebound relationship. , When leaving a relationship, and jumping into another one, there could be cautiousness about committing too quickly. Being commitment-phobic may just be a way of getting used to being single, or keeping options open."

Keep your daily routine consistent.,
Steady your attitude and behavior.,
Avoid dating your best friend.",How to Know if You're in a Rebound Relationship5," If you are finding your new schedule is ever-changing, and nothing is familiar, then you may be adjusting your life around your new partner. Look for a few of the following tell-tale signs:


You haven’t talked to your best friend in a long time. If you don’t know what your best friend is up to, what their latest news is, you’re definitely placing the new partner first.
Normal hobbies are being put on the back burner. Did you miss poker night or ladies night? Ask yourself if your time with friends has been sacrificed.
If you’ve skipped a family meal or get together for a new flame, chances are you’re altering your daily life for them. , If you have been really moody lately, or have been easily upset, it’s understandable after a breakup. If this has affected your daily life, however, enough that everyone is noticing, then you’ve likely changed emotionally. Create some alone-time in your schedule. Find time to just relax and steady your nerves. If you can't change your attitude and be happy about your new partner, that's not a good relationship sign.
Repeat positive affirmations daily. Each day you tell yourself why you are happy with your partner. If convincing yourself proves difficult, the relationship may just be a rebound.

, No matter what sappy romance movies tell you about the great love that’s been sitting under your nose the entire time, jumping straight out of a breakup into a relationship with a very good friend is a likely sign of a rebound relationship. Immediately reaching out to date your best friend is not the best solution, it's just the easiest.


You run the additional risk of ruining the friendship if the relationship doesn't work out.
Dating a good friend allows the uncomfortable stage of a relationship to be skipped.
Romance and intimacy happens more quickly when the friendship is already established."

Be a confident and solid rider.,
Begin slowly.,
Attempt a ride.,
Walk around calmly once the horse accepts you on its back.,
Add in some rein work once your horse is responsive.",How to Ride an Ex‐Racehorse," A beginner rider should not be the first one riding an ex-racehorse. If you don't know how to ride, have someone more experienced train the ex-racehorse first, until it is proven calm and safe enough for a beginner rider.
, Check to see whether your ex racer knows what an English/western saddle feels like. If it doesn't, then you'll need to get a trainer in. Alternatively, if you are experienced and confident, you can try to put the saddle on slowly:

Put on a saddle blanket first. Walk the horse around with this on for a time.
Put the saddle on if the horse is fine with this sitting on its back. Then walk it around. If the horse isn't fine with it, then keep trying to put it on over time. If the horse gets fidgety, take it off and put it back on later. Talk gently to the horse each time.
Do up the girth. Don't make it tight thought and undo it if the horse gets upset. Do it up once the horse is happy walk it around again.
Keep doing the girth up and walking the horse around. If the horse starts getting fidgety, take the girth down a hole and walk around, then do it a hole up once the horse is used to the prior hole level.

, Once you have got the saddle on with success and you're confident that the ex-racer is okay with it, try to hop on. If the horse is fine with this, then ask a friend to walk you around.

If the horse isn't fine, then hop off walk it around before attempting to hop back on.

, If it gets upset, take a step back., Try trotting, do some figure eights or something similar. Make sure that you can slow to a walk easily. Try cantering as well. Teach your horse things like leg yielding and even fancy dressage moves. If your horse is good at control, then it is possible that you can ride jumps too."

Maybe he coincidentally only has time for you when you have an invitation to a cool party. Start paying close attention to when he wants to see you, because this can say a lot about his intentions., If he only wants to be in the bedroom, that's a huge red flag. If he never wants to take you around his friends, but would rather always be alone in his home, that may mean he isn't interested in making you a public and ""official"" part of his life., Think about the details of each. Consider things like how often he says or does something that bothers you, or makes you uneasy. Making a list is a great way to gather your thoughts and voice the concerns that may have only been brewing in your head up until now.Is this a repeated behavior, or are you holding a grudge over something he did once, six months ago? While you should look out for yourself and stand your ground, there are also times when you have to be willing to forgive and forget if he's said sorry.
Forgetting to call you when he said he would is annoying. Blowing you off on your birthday because he had something else to do is unacceptable. Go down the list and be honest about how bad his actions are, and how down they make you feel.

, Sometimes people around you can see things that you can’t. Rumors, warnings, and advice from people can all be useful when you’re feeling conflicted. Keep in mind, however, that only you and your boyfriend are in the relationship.


Don’t air out the dirty laundry of your relationship to anyone and everyone who will listen. This can create more problems. Only consult trustworthy and well-intentioned people.

, If you've examined the situation, spoken to people you trust, and decided your suspicion is silly, decide how to move on. Maybe you have some confidence issues you need to address to feel secure in the relationship. If you are certain that there are valid reasons to be uneasy, then you'll need to figure out how to confront the situation with your boyfriend head on.

, In other words, think about whatever you think he is using you for, and get rid of it completely. Then, observe his reaction. In a healthy relationship, there should be several things that make your partner feel happy and fulfilled. If the relationship suffers greatly because of one change, this might be a problem.

, If he only wants to hang out in the bedroom at night, tell him you’d rather start going out during the daytime. When he initiates physical intimacy, remind him that you aren't interested right now. Ask him to respect your boundaries.If you aren't sure what to say to him, say, ""I want to focus on our emotional connection, so let's hold off on the physical stuff for now."" His reaction will let you know if he's using you or not. If he cares about furthering the relationship without sex, he will stick around. If he doesn't want to be with you if he isn't getting the physical intimacy he wants, ditch him.
Remember, it is your body. The most important thing is that when you say ""No,"" your boyfriend respects that.

, Tell him that you don’t feel comfortable spending money anymore, and give an excuse if you need to. It’s completely understandable if your boyfriend doesn't have the money to spoil you, but it’s not OK if he demands that you spoil him. If the interest is gone when your money is gone, that’s bad.


Tell your boyfriend, ""I really need to start saving my money, so I am going to cut back my spending a lot."" Then, if he asks you for money or to pay for something, you can remind him of this. Again, his reaction will tell you what you need to know.
The same approach can be taken with any other thing your boyfriend might be using you for, such as popularity, gifts, etc. It may seem tough at first, but a quality boyfriend will stick it out if he thinks the relationship is worth it.

, When you feel like you’re blissfully in love, you may not notice if your boyfriend isn’t doing anything for you. It’s easy to be so infatuated with someone that you make excuses for them. However, start paying attention to the things he does, or doesn't do, for you. This doesn’t necessarily mean bouquets of roses and fancy dinners— this just means basic ways of showing he cares.

, If he tells you he loves your sense of humor and wants to listen to your problems, he probably genuinely cares. If he raves about your beauty right before asking for a favor, watch out.Take special note of the things he does when he gets no benefit in return. If he does nice things simply to make you feel good, that’s a great sign.

, You don’t have to make a big announcement to your boyfriend that you need a “break,” but find a way to get away for a little bit. It can be easy to accept bad behavior or ignore warning signs when you are in the presence of your boyfriend. Whether you’re blinded by love or intimidated by the thought of refusing him something, you may not be able to think clearly when you’re with him.When you’re away from him, reflect on the relationship. Are you getting from him the same amount that you give to him? Healthy relationships are mutually beneficial.
By giving him space, you also will be able to see how he does on his own, without whatever he might be using you for.

, It’s important to let him know you’d like to have an important discussion, otherwise he may get defensive and upset with the abrupt ambush.This will give him some time to reflect on your relationship and prepare for a thoughtful conversation. By planning to talk, you also have time to calm down, gather your thoughts, and figure out how you will address him.


It is crucial to enter the conversation calmly and with a level head. Even if you feel hurt or angry, the conversation will not be productive if you spend it crying and cursing at him.

, Be blunt, but do not attack him. Don’t minimize how you’ve felt, or sweep any of your feelings under the rug. Your emotions are valid, and you shouldn’t shy away from expressing yourself just because it may be uncomfortable. By laying your feelings out on the table, you allow him to give an explanation, to comfort you, to ‘fess up, or to improve his behavior.


Start your sentences with ""I"" instead of ""you"" so he doesn't think you are attacking him. Saying something like, ""I feel sad when we only spend time together at night"" will sound better to your boyfriend than, ""You only call at night and I hate it."", Even if you are absolutely certain that your fears are warranted and he has been using you, it will give you closure if you let him explain himself. Avoid interrupting him, as this will only increase the tension of the situation.If you disagree with something he is saying, wait until he is finished speaking to address it. By giving him the floor, you can analyze his reaction after you've placed your concerns on the table. Is he remorseful and apologetic, or defensive and rude?


Remember, your feelings are valid. Even if your boyfriend believes he has done nothing wrong, don't let him make you feel guilty for feeling the way you do.

, Once you’ve addressed what has been on your mind and your boyfriend has heard how you’ve been feeling, decide how you’ll proceed. If he doesn’t offer an explanation and apology that provides comfort and optimism about the future of your relationship, perhaps it’s time to end the relationship.


If you plan on staying with your boyfriend and are satisfied that he is in it for the right reasons, make sure that you create a plan with him. If your feelings are being hurt and you’ve felt like you’re giving more than you’re getting, you need to figure out how to correct these issues. Otherwise, you’ll end up back in the exact same situation.

, By recognizing things that make you uneasy, standing your ground, confronting the situation, and moving on, you invaluable information. You recognize what you will and will not accept in situations, you how to handle conflict, and you hone your conflict resolution skills. It is painful to be used, but it gives you the opportunity to demand respect and better treatment in the future."

After the date, there can be some additional signs that signal the pointlessness of seeking a second date.,
Get used to noticing the signs and looking after your own needs.",How to Decide to Avoid a Second Date," Your feelings are important--the heart knows best. Do you feel like there is a connection, that there is a spark to be nurtured? Or do you feel flat, uncomfortable and fairly disinterested? Trust your feelings.;
, There are a lot of tell-tale signs that indicate the probability of it not being worth asking for a second date:


Your date did nothing but talk about themselves all night - if you felt like the audience all date, this isn't a good start.
Your date did nothing but preen themselves all night.
Your date told you all their problems and had nothing positive to say.
Your date discussed ex's.
Your date kept answering the cell phone to talk to other people; even worse if your date behaves very mysteriously about who is calling, or keeps nicking off to talk.
Your date disappeared for a while, with no explanation, or your date spent most of their time with his friends, avoiding you.
Your date turned up drunk, or got drunk during the date.
Your date criticized you.
Your date cursed constantly.

Your date orders for you without asking you what you'd like.
You find out your date is in the middle of a messy break up but keeps going back to his ex.
You discover that your date is married, is dating someone else, or wants an ""open relationship"".

, These can include:


No return phone calls, texts, emails, whatever (face it, their just not that into you).
There was no mention of a wish for a second date from either of you.
Your date hurries the occasion (for example, rushes to get the bill, hurries out of the cinema and hails a cab home immediately, etc.).
A date is arranged but your date fails to show. This is a big sign that it's not worth trying again.

, The right person shouldn't be a mountain of effort, elusive, challenging, bossy, or mean. The right person will meet you halfway. If this isn't the case, don't waste your time and get on with your life.


Don't judge yourself by a failed first date. Romantic chemistry often takes a number of dates to build, and it's not possible to judge yourself as having done something wrong from a failed first date. If the chemistry isn't there, or the date isn't with you on the same mental plane, that's as simple an issue as it gets. It's not about your worth.
Don't assume that not wanting to date a person a second time is wrong. If it doesn't feel right, the sooner you finish it, the better and you can continue searching for the person who clicks with you.

Stay positive. Dates that end in a fizzer are simply paths meandering off the main road to your true love. You're learning, your dates are learning, and you'll get there soon enough.

You should fix all the things you dislike about yourself first before you try to make yourself attractive to others, because you won't be confident! Confidence is the key.;
, Studies show that women prefer a clean-shaven man or at least one who keeps his facial hair tidy. So if you have a bushy knee-length beard and you're wondering why the women aren't all over you... statistics suggest shaving it off. This also goes for eyebrows. If you have the dreaded monobrow or extremely bushy eyebrows, don't fear going to a waxing specialist to get them cleaned up, it'll be worth it.

, There are many different attractive hairstyles for men. If you don't know which one to choose, try flipping through a magazine or Googling some actors to give you an idea. Or if you're really in doubt, ask your hairdresser what kind of hairstyle they think would look good on you. And if you're balding, there are many new products on the market at the moment which advertise hair growth.

, Do you think your unfashionable trousers and Hawaiian shirt are suitable day-wear? Think again. Customize your new look. It should be moderately comfortable, fashionable and appropriate. Perhaps even have an idol, like a famous male actor. If you're really hopeless with clothing, get a friend to help until you get the hang of realizing what's acceptable to wear out and what's not.

Give things that don’t cost money. If you know that he is interested in a certain type of music, for example, make him a playlist or send him a music video. Thoughtful gifts will show him that you really know and care for him as a person.
