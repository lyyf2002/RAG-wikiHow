Even if you’ve already said it once, it doesn’t hurt repeat yourself when you feel the urge to do so. Look him in the eye and tell him how you feel., Spending time with your boyfriend can be exciting, to say the least. Still, it is important to have time apart. You don’t need to spend every moment with him to show that you love him. Keep doing the activities you love to do, and let him do the same.Remember that you both had separate lives before you met. He probably fell in love with you because of who you are as an individual. Keep developing into the person you want to be.

Always have fresh, clean water available for your horse.,
Feed small, frequent meals throughout the day.,
If possible, pasture your horse at least once a day.,
Always use fly protection.,
Prepare and take caution before riding.,
In her stall, install a durable fan with proper equipment built for stables.,
Check up on your horse often.",How to Care for Your Horse in the Summer," If you have automatic waterers, make sure to check your horse's gums to check his water intake. For horses with buckets, make sure that there are no shavings or hay in his water, as this can deter some horses from drinking. If there are more than one horse in a pasture, check to see that one horse is not hogging the water tank from the others.;
, Although you should do this all year, it's especially important in the summer to prevent stomach ulcers and to let your horse eat the more natural way. Also, consider buying lower grade hay, as horses can eat more of it without over eating (this is also good to do in the winter so horses can keep their body temperature up). In her stall, hang a toy that she can play with to entertain her. Make sure to supply a mineral or salt block so she can get all her nutritional needs met. If she licks the salt block, her water intake will go up, so this is always good for the summer time.

, This is more natural, and is much better for your horse than sitting in a stall all day. Jut make sure to adjust the amount of hay she receives to coordinate with her grass intake. Never leave her halter on when she is left in the pasture or in her stall, as she can get snagged and injured.

, Blanket her with a nylon fly sheet, a neck covering, and a fly mask with ear coverings if she is going to be outside. Never put her tail up in a bag, as this keeps her from swatting at flies. If you are going riding, use a natural, water-based fly spray that not just kills flies when they land on your horse, but prevents them from coming to land.  Muck stalls at least twice daily, and even three or four times to keep fly larvae away. Make sure to also muck pastures at least twice a week to keep flies away from there as well. Fly predators are also a good investment. Also, try adding garlic or a packaged supplement into your horse's grain or water to help protect her from flies.

, If you are riding your horse, make sure that you use fly protection, proper tack and support mechanisms, and that you ave looked into the weather. Avoid riding on days hotter that 85 °F (29 °C) to prevent heat stress, and if you do have to ride, do slow work and pay attention to your horse's breathing, sweating, and temperature. Stop and walk your horse in the middle of your ride to let it cool down, if necessary. If you have a choice, perhaps ride English, as this is less to carry and is more comfortable for the horse.

, This will make your horse much, much more comfortable, is not extremely expensive, and has a high value.

, Make sure to see your horse at least every other day if you are boarding, and if you have you own stable, make sure to spend quality time with your horse daily. You can groom her, free lunge, muck her stall, teach her tricks, or work on natural horsemanship if you don't have time to ride. This will make your horse happy and will strengthen the bond between horse and rider.

A Wet Horse Can Get Cold.,
Keep Muscles Warm.,
Dress in Layers.,

Avoid Hazards.,
Warm the Bit.,
Bring a Snack.,
One of the more comfortable ways to ride in winter is going bareback.,
Grooming.",How to Ride a Horse in the Winter," If you plan to ride, and the ground is slippery ask your farrier about shoes with pads and ice caulks. Pads will prevent snow balls and may help prevent ice bruising on their soles. You can also use hoof-oil or petroleum jelly on the sole of the horse's feet as this also helps stop snow balling in them.;
, When riding in the snow remember that it is harder work for the horse. Plan your time in the saddle and your speed accordingly. Think of what it's like for you to flounder through the snow--deep snow can be similar for your horse.

, Plan to school or work at a slower pace so your horse does not sweat as much. Cooling down can take much longer, and chilled muscles take longer to warm up. Horses sometimes need time to adjust to the footing in an arena if they're used to walking on frozen, uneven ground and their gaits may feel a bit stilted until they learn they can step out with confidence.

, Plan extra time to cool down after your ride. Don't put a sweating horse out in the cold, wind or damp. Rug them up so that moisture wicks away from your horse's coat, and change the blanket if it becomes damp. When the horse is dry to the skin, you can turn it out.

, If your horse is used to being stabled and rugged consider using a ‘rump rug’ or ‘quarter sheet’ to keep his muscles from getting chilled while riding. Try the rump rug before you get on however, so your horse gets used to the feel of it. You don't want it spooking at the strange blanket over its haunches when you're in the saddle.

, Dress yourself in layers that can be removed easily if you get warm while working your horse. Fabric that wicks sweat away and dries quickly is best for any athletic winter activity. There is a variety of under and outerwear made especially for riders. Ear warmers can be worn under your helmet, or hoods can be put over your helmet.

, You may want to wear warmer boots while riding in the winter. Be sure they are not so bulky as to get wedged into your stirrups. They should still slide out easily if you take a spill.

, When riding out, make sure you stay away from areas where holes, branches, poles or other hazards might be hidden under the snow. Injury to you and your horse could occur if the horse trips or falls over a something hidden under the snow cover.

, A frosty cold bit can be uncomfortable for your horse. Keep bridles in the house, warm the bit with your hands, or put a warm (not hot) gel pack around the bit before putting it in your horse's mouth. The Bit Blanket is a great tool for warming a bit in a cold barn.

, Pack a granola bar and a vacuum flask of hot cider or chocolate to warm you up after your ride. Working hard in cold dry weather can be dehydrating so don’t forget to drink water or Pack along a bottle of water or sport drink too.

, The horse’s back, not the rider’s. A horse with a broad enough back can be lovely to sit on in winter. They are natural seat warmers. A narrower horse, while still warm, isn’t as cushion-y to sit upon.

, A thorough daily brushing will help his circulation and bring dirt that can cause irritation to the surface, especially in a long, winter coat. Curry the horse thoroughly, then use a soft brush to remove dust and dirt. Fluff his coat. You can also put a blanket on your horse in the winter."

Condition score the horse.,
Use a weight tape.,
Have the horse weighed.",How to Monitor a Horse's Weight in Winter1," Condition scoring is a process in which you assess the amount of fat the horse has on it. Condition scoring requires that you look at and feel the horse's body and assess the amount of fat it is carrying in specific areas. With condition scoring, you can evaluate whether the horse is in ideal condition or not.Once you look at and feel an area, you will write down your assessment in a chart made specifically for condition scoring.
Condition scoring can take some instruction and practice, so you may want to consult with your veterinarian for some guidance on the procedure.
A horse needs some fat to get it through the winter but it shouldn't have so much fat on it that it becomes obese.;
, A weight tape is a tool used to approximate a horse's weight. It is a measuring tape that is wrapped around a horse's back and chest and the measurement markings are in pounds or kilograms.Using a weight tape will not give you a completely accurate measurement. It is only an estimate. It is best used for assessing change over time.

, If you are bringing your horse to a veterinary clinic or a center that has a horse scale, then you can have the horse actually weighed. However, this is not usually available to horse owners on a regular basis.Using a scale is the most accurate way to weigh a horse.

"
"
Measure the horse's weight regularly.,
Take the horse's winter coat into consideration.,
Record your horse's weight over time.",How to Monitor a Horse's Weight in Winter2," In order to get an accurate understanding of changes to the horse's weight over time, you will need to measure it on a regular basis. If you are very concerned about a horse's weight, this can be every week. If you think the horse is maintaining weight fine, then every couple of weeks should be fine.Use the same type of weight measurement every time you measure the horse. This is the only way to really assess changes in weight over time.

, When a horse is in the cold during the winter, it can grow a thick winter coat. This can interfere with weight tape measurements and condition scoring. With this coat change in mind, try to be consistent with the pressure and placement of weight tape and how you feel the horse's body when condition scoring.If you focus on consistency, any changes you document will usually signal a real trend in weight change.
Be sure to remove a horse’s blanket daily to assess weight gain or loss.

, To track the horse's weight, you will need to know what its weight was before the winter. Then, you will need to keep a record of its weight throughout the winter.


Be sure that you measure the horse's weight the same way every time. For instance, if you use a horse tape to measure the weight in the Fall, then use it to make subsequent measurements.

Get professional help.,
Identify the signs of an emergency.,
Help your horse regain weight.",How to Monitor a Horse's Weight in Winter3," If you are unsure if your horse's weight loss is of concern or you are unsure how to help your horse gain weight, you should get some professional advice. Talk to your veterinarian about what and how much you should be feeding your horse to fatten it up.Your veterinarian will also be able to recommend further bloodwork and diagnostics if they suspect that something else, such as parasites or disease, may be causing your horse’s weight loss.
Weight loss, if at all, should be gradual. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice extreme changes in your horse’s weight over a short period of time.

, If your horse has lost too much weight it can be an emergency that requires immediate veterinary care. Assess your horse's vital signs. Make sure that it is breathing regularly and that it has a strong pulse. A horse with irregular breathing or a weak pulse, or that is weak and unable to move, is in desperate need of emergency veterinary care.


If any of its vital signs are not strong, you should call a veterinarian immediately.

, Horses should eat 2 - 2.5% of their body weight in good quality bulky foods, such as grass or hay, during winter. For the average 1,000 pound horse, this would mean eating 25 pounds. Make sure that your horse is getting enough. Getting your horse to gain weight requires that you feed it more calories every day than you have been. Discuss making one of the following changes to your horse’s diet with your veterinarian:


Give the horse unrestricted access to hay around the clock.
Change to a higher grade of hay.Add in a complete feed.
Add 4 to 8 ounces of corn or cocosoya oil to a small amount of grain.
Add beet pulp, sweet feed, or concentrates to your horse’s diet.

Give the correct information.",How to Sell a Horse Quickly," It should be reasonable depending on the situation, training involved, age, conformation, skill, personality, color, breeding, weight and height, etc. If you can, ask another person that once sold a horse and see what their price was. Just sell it for a little less because no one will buy it if you sell it for a high price.;
, A picture really says 1000 words. It should show the horse's full conformation and build. It also shouldn't cover up any markings, cuts, injuries, or scars. Another picture with the horse in action also helps.

, The potential buyer will know what they can fix in the horse and know you as an honest person, giving you a good reputation if you sell other horses.

, Magazines, newspapers, on-line, anything you can find(This may cost a small fee, some on-line ads are free) Get your horse out there. You can also go to shows and list your horse as for sale. That way potential buyers can see the way your horse acts and performs.

, Online videos will sell your horse a lot faster, especially if you don't mind selling out of state, same goes for online ads try some of the top sites like horseclicks.com, equinenow.com, perfectsteed.com, dreamhorse.com and UK-based horseboard.co.uk.

, Lots of potential buyers like to look at a horse when you least expect it in order to see if you're hiding something. This also gives a good first impression.

, Muscle sells better and you don't want your horse to not behave or be gasping for air when the potential owner rides it.

, Kid-safe, bomb-prof, man's horse, lady's horse, etc.

Decide whether to bring the horse in or not.,
Provide the correct outdoor environment for the horse.,
Prepare the stable.,
Give your horse plenty of outdoor time even when stabling during winter.,
Use the appropriate blankets for the conditions.,
Don’t overheat your horse.,
Be aware of possible winter ailments.,
Spend time with your horse during winter.",How to Care for Your Horse In the Winter1," Deciding whether to stable your horse or not on a particular night depends on a number of factors, including the age of the horse and the weather. Sick or older horses should always be stabled on nights when severe frosts are forecasted. A healthy, rugged pony, on the other hand, might be okay staying out on a colder night with the correct rug.


Your horse will likely need to come in at night at some point over the winter in order to protect him from temperature extremes, harsh wind, and snow. You will find it helpful to develop a routine where the horse goes out during daylight hours and comes back in at night. This allows him to stretch his legs and have a change of scenery, so he is less likely to become bored when stabled.;
, For the times when you do leave the horse outdoors, you need to provide a proper setting to care for the horse. This includes making sure he has access to shelter to get out of wind and rain. This could be a lean-to, a shed, or barn to which the horse has free access and can wander in and out at will.


Make sure he has drinking water available at all times as well. In freezing temperatures, this means ensuring the water trough has a heater or a no-freeze device, so the water never freezes over.

, When preparing the stable or barn for winter, ensure that the horse's quarters are clean, warm, well ventilated, and free from drafts. Clean bedding is a priority, so you should prioritize regular changes of the bedding. Remove anything that might injure or tempt the horse, such as low-hanging lights, nails sticking out, toxic cleaning substances, etc.


Bank your horse's bedding up against any doors that lead out to the pasture so drafts don't chill him.
Read How to Winterize a Livestock Barn for more information on this topic.

, This will help keep your horse healthier because he can breathe fresh air and adjust to the temperature changes on a regular basis.


Encourage lots of movement and exercise to keep warm. This is how horses keep warm in the wild.

, Blankets (also known as rugs) come in different weights. There are three main types of blanket for horses: stable blankets, turnout blankets, and sheets.


Stable Blankets are lightweight and not waterproof. Never put a stable blanket on a horse that is going out in the rain as it will act as a towel and soak up all the rain. Stable blankets are ideal for a clipped horse to wear in a stable during the winter to keep the chill off.
Turnout blankets are made of tougher fabrics than stable blankets and are waterproof. They are designed to have better insulation and keep the horse warmer. They also help keep the rain out.
Horse sheets are not as relevant during winter. They are a lightweight cover to keep the horse clean after grooming, such as prior to attending a show.

, When you touch a horse with your bare hands in winter, it will feel cold to you. In reality, the horse's coat and body heat do a wonderful job of insulating the horse and keeping the warmth directed into the horse. Some experts recommend that blankets only be used on horses with special needs, such as clipped horses, old horses, sick horses, thin horses, rescued horses, horses which seem cold by nature, and horses without shelter. However, this should be balanced against the severity of the weather. In snow and ice, any horse will need to be given a blanket or preferably be brought indoors.


If you do use a blanket, keep using it. The horse adapts its temperature regulation to wearing a blanket.
Keep in mind that your idea of cold is not your horse's idea of cold. Don’t add too heavy a blanket or too many. Follow the recommended uses of the blanket by the manufacturer according to its weight.
Wet cold is worse than dry cold for horses. A good quality waterproof rug is a great investment. This helps to keep your horse dry and reduces heat loss. It is possible to have a rug re-waterproofed, so be sure to keep your equipment maintained and in the best order.

, Horses can easily become sick during winter just like humans. It’s important to know what to look for and how to manage the problems that human intervention can cause.


Horses are susceptible to respiratory illnesses during winter. The ammonia buildup, mold, and dust inside barns and stables can bring on a variety of respiratory illnesses. Do your best to prevent this by ensuring adequate ventilation. You also want to clean out the stalls regularly. Give your horse plenty of outdoor opportunities to breathe in fresh air as well.
Horses are also susceptible to skin conditions during winter, such as rain-rot, bed itch, ringworm, lice, and infected scratches. Keep the horse clean, groomed, and medicated appropriately. Be careful not to blanket a wet horse. Use breathable blankets that do not cause moisture buildup. See your vet promptly for treatment of skin ailments.
Mud fever and rain scald are other specific skin conditions. Rain scald tends to affect the horse's back and rump (where the rain hits) wheres mud fever affects the legs (where the horse stands in mud). The softened skin allows bacteria to invade and set up infection. Crusts, scabs, and swelling develop, and the hair starts to fall out in clumps. You can treat the conditions by washing with a common disinfectant, such as Hibiscrub. However, the horse also needs to be kept in out of the weather for this to be successful.

, Even when the weather is foul and bleak, be sure to sit with your horse in the shelter and talk to him, groom him, and just be with him. He'll appreciate your company, and it keeps the two of you connected. It will also help you to look forward to the better winter riding days, and the warmer days to come.


Keep a regular grooming time in place during winter, no matter what the weather.
If you can't get to your horse as often as you'd like because of winter conditions on roads, etc., have someone else check in on your horse regularly to make sure he's fine.

Use good quality hay as the bulk of the horse’s feed.,
Don’t overfeed your horse.,
Add mineral supplements to your horse’s feed.",How to Care for Your Horse In the Winter2," Since your horse’s natural forage—grass—is unavailable, stick with good quality hay as the bulk feed source.In addition you can supplement this with high fiber foods such as sugar beet or alfalfa. These foods take a lot of chewing, which helps keep the horse occupied during the long dark hours of winter.


An older horse with poor teeth may struggle with certain food sources. Try feeding older horses on haylage, or you can soak hay cubes to make them easier to chew., Horses normally burn some reserves of body fat in order to keep warm over winter. If you try to avoid this by feeding energy-dense foods (such as nuts or pellets), they may become over-stimulated and buzzy. This can lead to pent up energy and possible accidents in the stable., With hay as the main food source for your horse over the winter, you may want to add vitamin or mineral supplements in order to keep the horse healthy without overfeeding.This will provide the horse with everything it needs nutritionally without adding the extra calories or too many nuts or mixes.


Consult your veterinarian and the recommended servings for supplements based on what you add to your horse’s diet.

This is especially important if you're a competition rider or want to ensure that young horses get used to the work required of them., Generally speaking, if the conditions aren’t safe for you to ride in winter, then they won’t be safe for your horse either. There is no temperature bar to riding a horse, provided that it’s not too cold for you and that your horse has adapted to the temperature, which requires regular outings. This means avoid riding during fierce cold winds, severe thunderstorms, or blizzards.


Winter means longer driving times, longer preparation times, and shorter days. Be aware of the time constraints affecting your ability to ride your horse and care for him and plan accordingly.
Always remember to take a fully charged cell phone and try to stick within a signal area, so you can easily call for help. Remember, in winter, hypothermia can set in very quickly.

, Mud buildup in the hooves can cause serious thrush infections. Well-trimmed hooves additionally have a better grip on icy surfaces than neglected hooves do.


If your area necessitates it, you should also invest in a hoof pick to take with you on rides. This tool allows you to remove ice and snow packed into your horse’s hooves as necessary.

, Even before you get your horse ready for riding, check the terrain and pasture where you plan to ride your horse. Look for ice or deep mud hazards that could cause your horse to slip or trip and make plans to avoid those areas. Add de-icing agents, such as salt or sawdust, to slippery zones around the stable, tacking areas, gateways, doorways, etc.

, Run hot water over your horse’s bit or use a non-toxic hand warmer gel. If you don't have access to either, remove the bit from the bridle and put it in your pocket close to your skin as you prepare everything else. You can also breathe on the bit to warm it.


Another alternative is to use a sweet iron bit. This isn't as harsh and doesn't become as cold as normal steel.

, In addition to packing a hoof pick, add a layer of non-stick cooking spray or petroleum jelly to your horse's hooves. This will prevent balls of ice and snow from forming in the hooves.

, This is not only good for warming the horse's muscles, but serves as an excellent warm-up workout for you too., This is especially important for a clipped or thin-skinned horse, or a horse that as been restricted to a stable. Use it while tacking up as well as riding.

, Find a clear, clean spot to tack up. Avoid muddy or icy spots and find an area that has good footing. The same requirements apply to the riding area itself.

, Pitfalls for riding during winter are varied depending on whether you're riding in snow or in more temperate muddy, cold temperatures. Things to watch out for include:


Deep snow, especially where it conceals holes, tree wells, and crevices where your horse could slip down.
Ice. Any ice is potentially dangerous as your horse has no grip or traction.

Mud. While a little mud is fine, a lot of mud can cause the horse to become bogged or to trip. Mud can also conceal objects that might harm your horse. Large areas of mud are best avoided.
Wet slopes. Take care riding a horse down a wet slope, as it is easy to lose grip, especially when going fast, and moving over wet stony or rocky areas.
Never canter or gallop your horse in snowy, muddy, icy, or slick terrain.

, This is a time when the horse can get a chill, moving from being very hot and sweaty to being cold. You want to cool the horse down as well as taking other precautions before stabling him.This is also a good time to groom the horse again. This also helps his muscles to cool down more slowly in addition to removing mud from his legs, which can cause irritation and mud rash.
Feel your horse’s ears as you cool him down. If they’re still hot, then you should continue walking the horse for a few more minutes. They should be cool, not cold nor hot. Cold ears mean a cold horse.

, Any snow that has attached to your horse (especially his legs) should be brushed off. Try to do this outside to prevent taking it indoors where it can melt and become slippery.

, Clean the hooves out the same as you did before the ride, and apply another layer of non-stick cooking spray or petroleum jelly to the hooves. This helps protect the hooves for any time the horse walks around between rides.

, You should dry a wet horse after riding in winter. There can be snow, rain, and sweat combining to make for a very wet horse. Take a towel in each hand and rub the towels over his coat in circular motions. Roughing the hair up will help dry it faster.


If your horse is used to a blow dryer, you might consider using this as well.

, This will separate the hairs and help to keep him warm, as body heat warms the air between the coat and skin.

, Ensure that there is adequate food and water. Give him hay to eat, as eating roughage warms him quickly, releasing heat as it's digested.


If blanketing your horse, ensure that the animal is completely dry before doing so.
Be sure to check that the drinking water supplied is not frozen. Horses will drink more water if it is warmed, reducing their risk of colic brought on by dehydration."

Give a potential buyer as much information as possible about the qualities, shortcomings, and characteristics of your horse. If you aren't completely honest now, you may have an angry buyer on your hands after the sale. Consider the following qualities when selling a horse:


Basic stats. The breed, gender, name, and bloodline are all important. Ribbons and awards can also tell you a lot about the quality of a horse. Think of these qualities like the make and model of a car: They are the first things that a potential buyer will notice, and they are the primary qualifiers that buyers will weigh in their decision to investigate the horse further. Many buyers are looking for a specific breed or gender, and an impressive name, bloodline, or showing history might catch the eye.
Personality. How does the horse behave? What spooks it? How does it react to surprises? Is it kind and loving, or does it like to make you really work to get it to work for you? Describe its temperament on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being wild and 1 being calm.
How it rides. How does this horse move? Is he short and choppy, long and smooth, or quick and bumpy? Does he listen to your leg, or does he neck rein? Is he easy to get into a trot, canter/lope, or does he put up a fight?
Skills. Can this horse rope, is he good with cows, did he come from the racetrack, has he even been under saddle? What is your horse trained in? This could make or break a sale, so be truthful and open about what your horse knows and doesn't know. Many buyers look for off-the-track thoroughbreds (OTTBs) that have never been raced, because they can versatile enough for the jumper ring or hunter ring. Some areas have shows just for them.
Past injuries, immunizations, or experiences. The most important thing to include is whether your horse is sound or not. If a buyer is looking for a horse to ride in the hills, and your horse has had a severe injury that prevents him from carrying riders, you need to let the buyer know. Tell the buyers everything about the horse's health, even if a condition doesn't directly affect the horse's ability to perform certain tasks. If you are selling a broodmare, also put in the time to research their foals' competitive history for proven breeding success.;
, Many buyers want a specific breed, but sometimes they look more broadly for a horse with a certain temperament. Categorize your horse as hot-blooded, warm-blooded, or cold-blooded according to its energy level, speed, strength, and obedience. These categories tend to accompany certain breeds, but this is not always true.


Some breeds (such as thoroughbreds, Arabians, and the Spanish Barb) are known as hot-blooded horses. This means that they are very high-energy, and it can also mean that they require more work to ride. These types of horses are normally seen on the race track or in three-day eventing. They have tons of energy, and they might be too much for some people to handle.
Quarter Horses, Fox Trotters, and Paso Finos are known as warm-blooded horses. These horses have speed and energy, but it is easier to get them to slow down and think. These horses might be seen alongside hot-blooded horses in three-day eventing, but they are most popular in dressage events, show jumping, reining, and cattle work. These horses are very hard workers and they enjoy a good challenge.
Cold-blooded horses are going to be your draft horses, the heavy-working, low-energy horses that have a whole lot of strength. Examples would be Frisians, Shires, Clydesdales, and Persians. These horses are used mostly as working horses, pulling plows or wagons or stagecoaches. Some, like the Frisian, have been introduced into the showing world and are used as dressage and jumping horses, however.

, Consider showing potential buyers pictures and video clips of the horse. If the horse is registered, keep its bloodline papers on hand. Consider inviting buyers to see the horse in person. Include any of the following information:


Pictures of the horse. The most recent, the better. It is not helpful for the buyer to see a picture of the horse as a colt. Take a variety of pictures of people riding the horse, as well as pictures of the horse on its own, so that a buyer can see how the horse looks both ways.
Video. If at all possible, get videos of the horse in action, both with and without a rider, as well as with different riders. This shows off how the horse moves, and how it acts under saddle with different people. This will make the process much easier for a buyer.
Papers. If the horse is registered include a copy of the horses bloodline papers. In the show world, bloodlines are extremely important, and someone who's into showing will know which bloodlines they like and which they don't.

, If the horse is registered and it has a show name, it is much more likely to sell. Register as much information as possible. Your state, your country, the horse's breed, and the horse's discipline need to be included. Give your horse an impressive show name, and people may be even more likely to buy your horse.

, What is the horse really worth? A horse should go down for $500 right away, especially if it's a thoroughbred. A horse with a very good pedigree is worth at least another $500. Charge an extra $200 for each show that the horse has been in. If the horse is strikingly beautiful, consider adding another $500. As with all horse for sport, price increases with training. The more capable the horse, the more value.


Compare your horse with other horses on the market. If the horse can hold a frame in all three paces and has lateral movements established, look at the prices of similar horses. From here you can begin to think about setting a price. For example, if horses of similar experience sell for $2000, don't try to sell for $8000.
No one is going to seriously look at a horse being sold for $10,000 if the horse is 8 years old, has no papers, and is not even saddle-broken. However, your $10,000 asking price might be more reasonable if a horse is four years old, with very good bloodlines, and fully trained.
Keep the economy in mind when selling. If money is tight, you might have trouble finding a buyer even if that horse really is worth the asking price.

, Consignors may have the horse examined by veterinarians, and a radiograph can be placed in a repository for potential buyers and veterinarians to view. Each sale has its own guidelines as to how long before the sale you radiographs can be taken. Generally speaking, the most popular views are the various angles of all of the four ankles, knees, hocks, and stifles.

, Make flyers and post them around town. Post to local websites like Craigslist, Facebook, or a local horse forum, and consider posting your ad to large-scale horse-selling websites. Tell your friends, your family, and your community of horse enthusiasts to spread the word that you're selling.


You want to get your ad out there as much as possible. The more people who see your ad, the more potential buyers you have. Be sure to list your name, your number, and your email address alongside any information about your horse.
Consider why you are selling him. You will need to include this in your advertisement to ensure that he is going to the best of suitable homes.
There are many horse-sale websites. You usually need to make an account to buy and sell. Some are free to use, and some require membership fees. Consider the following: dreamhorse.com, equinenow.com, myhorseforsale.com, horseclicks.com.
Take your cues from other sellers. Look at other ads online and see which information other sellers are listing. Consider which types of horses are selling, and which are not.
If you're having a hard time selling the horse, sweeten the deal with something free. The horse's blanket or saddle, or even a pair of polo wraps or a bag of treats can help make the sale. The word ""free"" catches people's eyes, and when they see a good horse offered alongside some free stuff, they may be more likely to buy it.

, He came to me free to good home after having been starved for 3 months. He was originally trialled as a racehorse but proved to be far to slow, apparently trotting out of the gates as a three year old. He began his show jumping career at the age of four but was not properly educated, rather taught to rush at the jump leaving his rider to hang on. He is now rising seven and his rushing has improved over his past 6 months of education with me. He collects in all three paces, working from behind into your hands. He requires soft hands as he will try to throw you off if you yank on him. He genuinely tries his hardest, but can take some coercion to do what you want. He bucks coming back into work, and is at his best when in full work. Jumps 1.25m in a course, 1.30m is his max height. He suffers from mild stifle lock in his left hip, which does not affect his work. Due to his being jumped so early he does show early signs of arthritis in his knees and receives pentosan injections every few months for this. Is a loving horse, lives for cuddles and grooming time. High in the pecking order in the herd, although not a bully. Occasionally bolts in new surroundings or when he dislodges his rider. Fully responsive to vocal cues, great on the lunge, at the beach, on trails, looks for jumps in the arena. Self loads onto the float, good for farrier, barefoot, some difficulty worming. Two hard feeds a day, constant pasture/ hay roll. Suited to an experienced home only, preferably competition home, someone who can get the best out of him. Selling only due to lack of time with studies this year. Sad sale, asking $4500.

, Talk about your horse, why they want to buy, and where they will be keeping it. Make a date for them to visit and try out your horse.


Be prepared for people to waste your time messaging you. You just have to weed through the photo collectors to find those who genuinely want to buy your horse. They will ask to arrange a visit, perhaps multiple visits, to come and see him. Don't be afraid to ask for references, and consider asking for pictures of the sort of home your horse will be going to. Any genuine buyer will be okay with this.
Many buyers will request a trial, maybe a week or two, to see if the horse is a good fit. Determine a fee for this, with a credit against a sale, or consider asking the potential buyer to get insurance for the trial.

, The sales preparation process for any horse should begin at least 60 days prior to the date of the sale. One must focus on the horses proper feeding, health care, grooming, and exercise to bring a horse to its peak at the time of the sale.


A horse consigned to the sale should be bathed daily and groomed throughout the showing so that the horse will be at its best for potential buyers. It is important to note that buyers are extremely attracted to a horse that walks well, and this can have a very big impact on the horse's value price.
When the horse walks into the ring, this is the time when some consignors pay special attention to details. Consider using talc powder on some white spots or shoe polish to cover insignificant blemishes. Using baby oil around the eyes and muzzle can also help enhance the horses appearance. Some consignors even suggest that you braid the manes and tails.

, Before they arrive, set up the arena and prepare the riding equipment for your horse. Make sure that you have groomed, fed, and tied up your horse. Most buyers will want to ride the horse. If not, offer to ride the thoroughbred for them, and give information on what the best way to ride the horse is. Thoroughbreds are usually very sensitive, so help the potential buyer try to understand your horse. Answer any questions they have, be as open as possible, and make sure to give as much information as possible.


Do not drug your horse before showing it! People want to know exactly how the horse would act if they bought it.
When potential buyers ride the horse, be sure not to have any other horses in the ring, as this can sometimes cause stress or anxiety to the horse you're selling. The horse may already be anxious because he or she is carrying a new rider.
If the rider thinks that the horse is a good match, there's a good chance that he or she will call back within a week.

, Think about the people who visit your horse and how they are suitable for the horse. Consider the way they rode, and whether they seem like they will treat your horse well. Consider how much various buyers are willing to pay, compared to the price you want. A seller should have the horses best interest first. Be sure that the buyer is capable of handling the horse along with its future care, stabling, and vet costs.

, Write up a contract to seal the deal in writing. You should receive a deposit, at least, and sign a contract of sale when handing him to the new owner. They may pay the rest in installments, or you may ask for payment in full.


In the contract, make sure to list out all the pros and cons of the sale. Make sure to include whether the buyer is receiving tack, or any other equipment, along with the horse.

, You may keep in contact with the new owners to get updates on your old horse and see how he is doing. If you find that miss the horse, ask the new owners if you can come visit the horse's new home, but be careful to respect the owners.

Introduce yourself and smile.,
Start a conversation.,
Keep the chemistry going.,
Do favors and help them out.,
Bypass boredom.,
Ask to be friends.,
Keep distance, but keep contact.,
Milk the cow for all it's worth.",How to Pretend To Be Interested in Someone You Don't Like," With a kind approach, that person will feel you are approachable and may come to like you or help you out. Being friends with someone like this can seem annoying and stupid, but they could help you:


Improve at work/school
Do things you don't want to (like an intern; the special word that means a person who does everything you don't want to...)
Become more sociable, reliable and charismatic
Impress bosses, teachers and upperclassmen.;
, This sounds like the simplest and easiest step - but it could in fact be the hardest. Start the conversation coolly, calmly, casually and friendly. If things really don't work out - at least they'll know your name. To start a conversation, you should first try to ask them about their likes, dislikes, family, friends, pastimes, pets, job, alma mater (school, college or education) and any significant others. But beware: if the subject becomes annoyed, uncomfortable or offended - drop it and apologize. Not only will making this person angry ruin any chance of friendship, but they could talk about you in a bad way to other coworkers/teachers/classmates.

, Make eye contact, say hello every time you see that person and act as positively and as friendly as you can. But, saying this, don't come on too strong - especially to people who are shy and may not like to have attention directed at themselves. The more you can learn about this person, the more they will be inclined to help you out and say kind words about you.

, This is about being kind. Would you like a new friend to get you a coffee in the morning? Or take notes from school while you're sick? Try to be as helpful and compassionate as possible.

, If this person is really boring and uninteresting the only thing you have to do is 'look' interested. Nod and smile, make small noises like ""Ah!"",""Oh!"" and ""I see..."" to make it sound like your interested. Have a little input, too. Try saying ""That's great to hear!"", ""I never knew that"", ""You seem really into that stuff. It's really admirable/"", and ""I didn't even know that existed!"". But again, beware! Notice in none of the examples you don't say ""That's cool"", ""I'd be interested in trying that"" or anything similar. If you do this, they will try to talk to you about it more - and at worst, ask if you want to join them or learn more about it. Be careful not to lie, too. Don't say you've done something you haven't, don't say you know anyone you don't. White lies may be acceptable, but misleading a person is a big mistake!

, Embarrassing for you? Yes. Nice to hear from someone? Yes. Be empathetic - put yourself in that persons shoes.

, Now that you're friends you have two options: actually be good friends with this person or keep them as an acquaintance/work friend. Still say hello occasionally and help them out - but not as much. If you remove yourself completely it will just ruin everything you have worked for and could reverse the good you have done.

, Reap in your earned rewards and the rest is up to you! Good luck!

Talk about abstinence at the appropriate time.You may not want or need to tell someone that you are abstinent on the first date.,
Define what abstinence means for you.,
Explain your choice to practice abstinence.,
Communicate abstinence with your body language.",How to Practice Abstinence While Dating1," It is the first date, after all. But, if you continue dating, you will probably need to let the other person know that you are practicing abstinence before you become too intimate.You could try saying, “Before we go any further in our relationship, I think we should talk about sex. I’m practicing abstinence.”
Or, you might say, “Our relationship is getting more serious and I want to let you know that I’m abstinent and talk about it with you.”;
, It is generally accepted that abstinence means not having sex, but some people have different opinions of what sex includes. It will be easier for you to practice abstinence while dating if you are clear about what you mean by abstinent. In other words, define what exactly you are abstaining from.


Tell your partner what sexual acts, if any, you are comfortable with. Or, if you aren’t comfortable doing anything sexually, then say that.
For example, you might say, “I’m abstaining from intercourse, but I’m okay with other sexual contact.”
Or, you could try, “I’m abstinent. So that I don’t get tempted, I choose not to have any type of sexual contact.”

, Tell the person you’re dating why you are practicing abstinence so that they can understand your decision, and you, better.Once they know the reasons for your choice, it may be easier for them to understand.


Try saying, “I don’t want to have children yet, and this is the best way to make sure that I don’t.”
Or, if you have religious reasons, you might say, “I’m abstinent because my religion and beliefs say that it is right to wait for marriage.”
Or even, “I don’t want to complicate my life with sex right now, so I’m choosing to wait to have sex again.”

, Don’t be a tease by doing things that you know will get the person you’re dating sexually aroused. It can be confusing and frustrating if you say that you’re abstinent, but purposely do things that are sexually arousing or go along with it when they do.For example, if you say you don’t want any type of sexual contact, then don’t touch your date in a sexual way.
Or, for instance, if you say you are only okay with touching with clothes on, then don’t take your shirt off.

"
"
Hang out with a group.It will be easier to practice abstinence while dating if some, or even most, of your dates are in group settings.The more people there are around, the harder it will be for you to be tempted by sex.,
Volunteer in the community.,
Do something active together.,
Explore other ways to be intimate.",How to Practice Abstinence While Dating2,"


Go on double dates with other couples. For example, you could go on a double date to a museum with a friend and his girlfriend.
Attend sporting events or concerts. Being in a group setting like this will be exciting without the sexual tension.

, This is a great way to spend time together without having sex while also supporting a good cause.


Volunteer together as mentors at a local community center or youth organization.
Spend time together attending a community event that promotes a cause you believe in.

, Physical activity is a great way to be healthy and to spend time together. It won’t be as hard for you to practice abstinence if you plan dates where you are out doing something active.


Play a competitive sport together like tennis, ice hockey, table tennis, or flag football.
Take walks, bike rides, hike, skate, skateboard, or jog together.

, Remember that sex is only one way to show each other that you care. Take advantage of all the other ways you can show your date that you care that don’t interfere with your abstinence.You might try holding hands, hugging, or cuddling as ways to be intimate without taking it too far.
Or, you may want to spend time together just talking and getting to know each other better.

"
"
Encourage yourself.,
Take a break from intimacy.If you are on a date and things starting getting a little too intimate, then take a break from the date for a minute or two.This gives you time to remind yourself why you are abstinent.,
Talk to someone close to you.,
Avoid drugs and alcohol.",How to Practice Abstinence While Dating3," It will not always be easy to practice abstinence while dating. Take the time to remind yourself why you are practicing abstinence and to encourage yourself to keep it up.Tell yourself, “I’m abstinent for a good reason. Even when it’s hard, I know that I can practice abstinence while I’m dating.”
Make a list of reasons why you are practicing abstinence and keep it somewhere you can see as a reminder.

, It also gives you and your date time to calm down a bit.


Go to the bathroom and splash some water on your face. Look in the mirror and remind yourself that you can be abstinent and you are.
Even just moving a few inches away from your date can give you enough of a break to stop things from going too far.

, Sharing your challenges and successes with a close family member or friend can help you stick to your decision to practice abstinence.They can encourage you when it is difficult and celebrate with you when you handle a situation well.


For example, you could talk to your best friend about how to handle going on a date to see a movie with lots of sex scenes.
Or, you might share with your mom how you dealt with your date’s friends pressuring you guys to have sex.
There may even be support groups in your community for people that are practicing abstinence.

, It will be much easier to practice abstinence while dating if you aren’t under the influence of anything that could impair your judgment. Avoiding drugs and alcohol will make it easier for you to avoid situations that could make it hard for you to remain abstinent."

Give yourself plenty of time to get ready!,
BATHE.,
Dry your hair, and find something to wear.,
Do your finger and toenails.,
Style your hair (if you didn't already while it was wet.),
MAKE-UP (if you wear it) Some guys love make-up, while others prefer their women to be more natural-looking.,
Put on any every-day jewelry you wear.,
BRUSH YOUR TEETH!,
Perfume.,
Make sure wherever you guys will be together in your house is CLEAN, and smells good.

,
Try lighting some scented candles 45 minutes-1hour before he comes over.",How to Prepare Before Your Boyfriend Comes Over," This avoids having to rush around at the last minute and gives you time to relax before he arrives. Some will give themselves as much as 3 hours, but the ballpark is anywhere from 1-2 hours.;
, The most important thing is to be CLEAN! Every guy can appreciate a woman with good hygiene.


Wash your hair and use a good conditioner, studies show guys are more attracted to women with healthy-looking hair.
Give your whole body (yes..everywhere!!) a good pass with some good-smelling soap, and rinse thoroughly.
Don't forget to get those feet clean!
Shave your legs and armpits. Guys love smooth skin! And shave anywhere else you normally do. Even ""down there"" if you choose. (But if you DO, make sure you rinse out any stray shaved hairs that might not rinse off very easily..)
LOTION. Rub some lotion all over your body, it makes your skin smell amazing and feel smooth.
 Remember to clean the insides of your ears with a Q-tip!

, What type of clothes does your man think is sexy? Think carefully, he might have told you, or made a comment about a specific outfit you've worn in the past. Clothing preferences are different among guys so try to pick something you know he personally likes, but DON'T GO OVERBOARD.


Guys very often like the colors red, blue, and black on a woman.
Always wear things that show off the parts of your body you are most proud of, and/or parts of your body he has complimented often.

, When your nails are painted, it shows a guy that you care about your appearance. Go with a color that matches the outfit you have picked. Or, if he has mentioned a color he likes on a girl's nails, use that. And wait for them to dry to avoid smudging.

, Do it however you feel you look the best and that you know he likes on you. Don't try something new, because if it doesn't come out right, you may not have enough time to fix it before he shows up!


Try not to let your hair be really hair from too much hairspray or gel. Hard/sticky hair isn't very touchable!
Most guys prefer when women wear their hair DOWN.

, It's important to know what your guy thinks. Do your makeup however you feel the most attractive, and again, don't try anything new here. Don't go overboard with crazy eyeshadow unless that is how you usually do it.


A simple, thin, application of eyeliner on either the top, bottom, or both lids usually does the trick.
Guys like mascara.
Maybe throw on some chapstick? Guys LOVE smooth lips.

, And if he's mentioned something he really really likes, don't forget to put that one on to!

,  No guy likes bad-smelling breath. And to avoid your mouth being overly minty when he shows, try drinking a glass or two of water after you brush them, right before he's supposed to come over.

, Put on a small amount of good-smelling perfume. Again, something you know he likes. Don't put on too much though, or it'll be overkill to his nostrils.


Studies show that cinnamon, vanilla, and jasmine are psychologically a turn-on to a guy. So if you have any of these perfumes, it'd be a good idea to spritz a little on yourself.
Don't put it anywhere where you think his mouth will be! PERFUME TASTES AWFUL. (Trust me.)

,, They can really help set the mood.


Pumpkin, vanilla, cinnamon, jasmine, and any scents related to food are proven to help make a guy more turned on

Realize that not everyone is looking at you.,
Don’t worry about fitting in or pleasing guys.,
Focus on your breath.,
Stay in the moment.,
Practice having social interactions.",How to Overcome Shyness Around Guys1," This can be the hardest part about talking to a guy, is that it can feel like everyone is watching you. Most often, this isn’t true. People are most often too absorbed in their own lives and preoccupations to notice whether you’re nervous or doing something weird.However, most of the time when people are shy, the shyness isn’t visible to others.Taking time to be in the moment can help with this. Focus on your breathing, and do your best to focus on the task at hand.;
, While this is easy to say, it is hard to do, especially when you’re young. It can seem that if you don’t fit in generally, you won’t have friends, or you won’t have the “best” friends. However, your real friends will like you for who you are. Worthwhile guys will like you for who you are. They will like your quirks and your passions—the things that make you you.A worthwhile guy might say, ""I think it's cool that you're not afraid to be yourself."" Even so, that opinion shouldn't be needed to validate your choices. You make your choices for a reason.

, Breathing is a natural way to calm you down. Breathing deeply can help calm the heart and lower your stress response. No one will notice you breathing a little deeper, and you’ll feel better for doing so., Instead of worrying about what others think about you or what could go wrong, or any other anxiety that pops into your head, focus on the moment. Listen to what people say. Watch their facial expressions. It helps to keep eye contact if you can. By focusing on the moment, you have less time to worry about what’s worrying you., Simply talking to guys can make it easier. If you have a negative reaction, or they act in a bullying manner, avoid them, and find other guys to talk to. Not all of the success of a social interaction rests with you. Remember, you can only control what you bring to the conversation.Say something about something you noticed about them. For instance, you could say, ""I noticed that you wear skater shoes. Do you like to skateboard?"" or ""That was a cool drawing you did in art class. Where'd you get that idea?"" Getting them talking about something they like can be a good way to give yourself time to get more comfortable in the social situation.

"
"
Speak up for yourself.,
Try new things.,
Dress the way you want.",How to Overcome Shyness Around Guys2," If you are constantly deferring to other people, or letting people walk all over you in a conversation, you need to speak up. It’s not that you have to be confrontational. It’s more that you express yourself confidently. You don’t have to agree with other people’s opinions or plans for them to like you. If a guy bails because you speak up for yourself, he’s probably not the kind of guy you want around anyway.For instance, if you aren't comfortable with a situation, staying out past curfew for example, you can say, ""I'm not going to stay out late. I'll be grounded for sure, and I really want to be able to hang out again soon."" This can let them know that you aren't willing to get in trouble for them, but that you are interested in hanging out again.

, Often, people are shy because they think they aren’t interesting enough for a guy to notice. They hide themselves away rather than do what they think would embarrass them. However, the people who exude the most confidence are often people who are willing to try new things, whether they’re in front of people or not. You can always start small (talking to people you admire), or jump right in (go bungee jumping). Either way, once you’ve started, it get easier to make it a habit., This doesn’t mean letting it all go (unless you are comfortable doing this). However, if you are constantly wondering if people care what you’re wearing, then you might want to reconsider your outfits. Don’t worry about others’ opinions, but wear what makes you feel good. People, especially guys, will notice your confidence rather than your outfit, when you love what you wear."
"
Recognize your self-worth.,
Stop worrying about being perfect.,
Be yourself.",How to Overcome Shyness Around Guys3," This may be the most important aspect of overcoming shyness around guys. You are worth a lot just because you’re you. You don’t need guys’ approval for that to be so. If you believe in your self-worth and believe that you don’t need anyone else’s approval, you will find that you feel more confident around guys.Look at your accomplishments, your friendships, what makes you unique. This can help you gain a perspective on what's awesome about you.
Don't compare yourself to others. This can only hurt whether by making you feel superior to others or by making feel like you don't measure up.

, No one is perfect. In fact, often when you ask perfectionists what being perfect would mean, they don’t have a clear idea themselves, or the image is someone they’ve idealized beyond reality. In any case, perfection is unattainable. You can, however, be the best 'you' you can be.When you think about being perfect, instead ask yourself what it is you really want. Often it's external influences that want us to be perfect, and you may find that being perfect gets in the way of what you really want, such as happiness, writing a book, or anything else that you might have a goal.

, This can be hard to do, when you’re nervous, but it is important to realize that just because you don’t act exactly the same in every situation does not mean you aren’t being yourself. You wouldn’t ask your boss for something the same way you’d ask your parents for something. Expressing your confidence around guys may look different than expressing your confidence in school or in writing.If you are embarrassed about something in your life (where you live, the car you drive, etc.), you may need to stop and take stock of why you feel that way. Is it others' expectations?
When someone doesn't like something you like, say, ""That's cool, but I like what I like."" They can make fun of you or bully you for it, but they can't make you not like it.

Dealing with the Environment: public transport is a tough environment.,
The check out: wow!,
Positioning: no!,
Props: it's useful to have a newspaper, book or magazine in your hands, as it gives you something to pretend to look at, instead of awkwardly glancing around or staring off into space.,
Eye contact: this is the best way to tell if someone finds you physically attractive.,
Smile: when you catch their eye for the second time, you might feel that a smile is appropriate; it'll make you seem friendly and approachable.,
Body language: body language is a great give-away for how someone feels about you.,
Speaking up: now it's time to start a conversation.,
However, do expect them to look surprised that you've spoken up, and be prepared to repeat the question if they are startled.,
Plan B: if your nerves have got the better of you, or you're unsure if they find you attractive- there's another alternative.",How to Pick Someone up on Public Transport," Nobody really wants to be there, and most people don't like any intrusion into their privacy, preferring to focus on getting to work or getting home. To chat someone up successfully on public transport you need to be quick-thinking and decisive without being aggressive. It's a difficult thing to pull off, but just remember- it might be your soul mate that is escaping... never to be seen again.;
, Check them out! You've seen someone you fancy, but you must act quickly as they may be getting off at the next stop. No time to lose....but wait- are they with someone? If so, does this person look like their other half? Chatting up someone's other half is inadvisable, and may end in tears.

, They are on their own! All systems go! Your positioning is critical. If you're waiting on a tube platform, let them get on first. You can check out where they decide to sit/stand, and position yourself in their line of sight. If they sit down, then sitting opposite is a good move. This is far better than being side by side as there is more chance of making eye contact. If the train is busy then you're likely to be standing. so get close, but not too close! If they're sitting and you're standing, try to avoid positioning your crotch in their face.

, If you have an mp3 player, be sure to take your headphones off, or you will look inapproachable. If you already have headphones on when you spot your target, casually take them off. If they are wearing headphones, then starting a conversation is going to be very difficult and you may want to consider Plan B, which is outlined later in the film.

, Begin by glancing up at him/her, catching their eye and holding it for a second or two. Then look away. Thirty seconds or so later, look up again, if he or she looks back again, this is a sign that they are interested. You may wish to repeat this move before you speak up as it is easy to misread these signals. If they don't look back at you the second time the chances are they're not interested, and you proceed at your peril.

, If they smile back, it's likely that you're on to a winner. However, too much smiling can look odd, so be careful not to overdo it.

, After you've caught their eye and they have smiled, check out their body language. If they've angled themselves towards you this is a good sign. Make sure your own body language is positive. Don't cross your arms, your legs, or hunch your shoulders; these are negative signals. Instead, angle your body toward them. You can also employ the technique of 'mirroring' where you subtly copy their body movements. If they shift positions in their seat, make a similar shift a few seconds later. If they brush their hair away from their face, do the same shortly afterwards. Done well, this can have the effect of making them feel in tune with you

, Most people don't have the nerve for this, but you must seize the day! You're on a timescale - they might have to get off at the next stop, so it's best to act quickly. Reassure yourself that you've got nothing to lose; if you are knocked back you won't see them, or anyone else in the carriage again. try to ask a question that requires more than a 'yes' or 'no' answer. Don't ask ""does this train stop at Victoria?"" as they can simply say ""yes"", and end the conversation. Instead, ask an ""open question"" like ""how do you get to Victoria?"" as they will have to reply with a more detailed answer which will help you get a conversation going.

, If they're genuinely interested in you they will be happy to start chatting. You'll be able to tell if they are not interested. If it is going badly, and you feel embarrassed, just get off at the next stop!

, Write your name and phone number on a piece of paper, wait until they move to get off or your stop comes up- hand them the paper, make eye contact, smile and exit. It's quite simple. You leave it completely up to them. If they don't call then forget about it, you won't see them again. If they do call, arrange somewhere to meet and make sure you tell a friend where you're going. Good luck!

, Mini golfing is exciting, cheap, and fun. You can always have a competition with mini golf, and the atmosphere is always adventurous.

, The zoo or aquarium is entertaining. All the animals are different than ones you see everyday, and have special things to them that make them different and fun to see.

, During the spring, summer, or fall when it is still warm out, having a picnic is a great idea. Being outside is enjoyable all the time, and you can go on to do other things in the park, like throwing a Frisbee, playing fetch with your dog, or taking a walk.

, Bowling is similar to miniature golfing in that you can compete with your date. Trying to get a higher score or who can get the most strikes or spares can be exciting.

, Live music is always pleasant to listen to and local bands usually have great music.

, Although it can be a little embarrassing sometimes, karaoke can be fun at the same time. You can show your date you're not scared to do out of the ordinary things by trying karaoke.

, Riding a bike with your date gives you the chance to talk and get some exercise.

, Seeing a movie can sometimes lead to inappropriate things, but going to a premiere can prevent you from being tempted because of the other people.

Some 59% of Americans now believe online dating is a good way to meet people, and more than one in ten people use online dating platforms.Look in the mirror and calmly tell yourself, “There is no stigma to online dating. It is a safe and common way to meet others.”;
, Help build your self-worth by creating a list of things you like about yourself, or that make you worth-while. Include things you like about your life, your job, your personality, and your appearance.If you are body-conscious, try to find at least one thing you like about your appearance. Tell yourself, ""I have amazing eyes,"" and try to focus on that feature that you like rather than what you dislike.
If you are not currently happy with the course of your life or your career, remind yourself that there is still good in what you do. Tell yourself, ""I can pay my bills and I can find the humor in small things, and that makes my life worth while, just as it is.""
When you are feeling less than confident, look over your list and remind yourself of your good traits. Eventually, the positive thinking becomes inherent.

, The biggest fear in online dating is the biggest fear people have when dating in general: getting rejected. Remind yourself that if you do not hear back from a potential match, or if your match expresses that they are not interested in you, try not to dwell on the rejection.Don’t continue to message someone who stopped talking to you or harass someone that never made contact with you. This could get you blocked or your account suspended.
Remind yourself, “If I’m not what they were looking for, they probably aren’t the kind of person I’m looking for, either.” Remind yourself that you can do better than someone who won’t respond or stops communicating without a reason.
If someone you’ve been talking to suddenly disappears, make up a reason for yourself. Tell yourself, “Maybe they decided to get serious with someone they already met.”
Reach out to someone else. The best way to get past rejection is to meet someone new. Send a message to someone else and work on finding a connection elsewhere.

, It's alright to have some apprehensions about online dating, just as it is with any form of dating. The challenge is not to eliminate your fear, but to acknowledge it and find ways to work through it.Make a list of reasons why you are afraid to start dating online. For each reason, write out a worst-case-scenario. For example, you might be afraid of rejection, and the worst case may be that a match ridicules you for thinking you had a chance with them.
For each negative scenario, find a way to overcome it. Let yourself know that someone who ridicules you for approaching them is not worth your time or love, and that you are better off not inviting that kind of negativity into your life.

, Dating, by its very nature, can involve a lot of emotions very quickly. To avoid becoming swept up in something emotional but not right for you, set goals from the beginning. Decide if you are looking for a serious or casual relationship, and whether you want monogamy or would like to date around.Use these goals as a guideline when you start to date. If you meet a great person who wants a serious relationship while you are looking for something casual, don't assume you can change them. Stick to your goals and move on.
Avoid making your goals too rigid. Use them as a guideline for what you want overall, but try to avoid goals like, ""I would like to be married within two years."" Being too strict could close you off to potentially fulfilling relationships.

, You are more likely to feel good about getting involved with someone else when you feel good about your relationship with yourself. Practice daily self-care, which can include anything from exercise to time to meditate.Set aside time each day to do the things that are important to you. This may include daily exercise, cooking healthy or satisfying meals, seeing friends or family, or anything else that makes you feel like you are doing the best possible things for you.
Take some time to indulge, as well. If you have had a particularly difficult day, for example, rather than letting the stress follow you home, take time to relax and pamper yourself that evening. This helps let you know that you are worth-it.

, If the thought of thousands of people having access to your profile makes you nervous, look for a compatibility-based site. These sites use algorithms to match you with compatible members, and only those members can see your profile.These sites, including eHarmony, are often behind a paywall, but offer a greater sense of security and comfort for some.
Niche dating websites don’t work on an algorithm, but are catered toward people that share a common interest, such as religion, alma mater, or a profession such as farming.

, Online dating offers you the unique opportunity to get to know someone before you actually meet them. Don’t be afraid to be specific in your profile regarding who you are and what you are looking for. That way, you can help ensure that you’re only getting the best matches.Let people know what you want from online dating. If you’re ultimately looking for a relationship, don’t be afraid to say that you only want to date people interested in eventual commitment. If you prefer to keep things casual, let others know that you’re not looking for something serious.
Highlight your personality. Think about those first-date facts, the details you would use to set you apart when you first meet someone, and put them in your profile.
Instead of, “I’m a working professional looking to meet someone in my area,” try, “I’m a geologist who is passionate about their job and loves to take guitar lessons on the weekends. I’m looking for someone to explore the city with me.”

, There’s a fear with online dating that posting pictures gives others access to your likeness for unknown purposes. This is no more true than posting your image to social media, but if putting your face on an online dating site makes you nervous, start by posting just one photo of yourself.Profiles with photos tend to get many more responses than those without. If you’re nervous, try posting a single image of yourself. That way, you aren’t giving people too much access, but you aren’t isolating potential matches, either.
Try to avoid pictures where your face is obstructed. If posting a group photo makes you feel more comfortable, be sure to clarify which person you are in your profile or in a caption.

, Before you meet in person, move your communication off of the dating website. You may opt to video chat, text, or exchange calls before the date, but moving your communication to a new platform can help you feel more secure before meeting this person.When someone asks you on a date online, politely suggest that you exchange phone numbers. This gives you a way to communicate to plan the date, as well as check up on their contact information.

, If you are worried that things aren’t going to go well on your date, opt for a casual activity that is easy to excuse yourself from, such as getting coffee on a Sunday afternoon or drinks after work. Avoid meals or activities like movies that happen for a fixed period of time.It’s also advisable that the activity be something where you have the chance to talk and get to know one another. Avoid loud venues or activities that will keep you too occupied to chat.
If you are greatly enjoying the date, you can stay for another cup or drink, or transition the date into a new activity such as dinner or a walk. If you are not enjoying yourself, politely excuse yourself when you’re done with your drink.

, If you’re afraid of meeting a stranger, take steps to keep yourself safe. Arrange to meet in a public place such as a popular coffee shop or bar. Have a friend walk you to the date and ask them to stay until you’ve made contact and sat down with your match.If your match suggests meeting in public but often uncrowded location, politely suggest an alternative spot.
If your match asks you meet in private or at their house, refuse completely. Let them know that you are only comfortable meeting in public for a first date.
Have a signal such as a text you can send to a friend to let them know if you feel unsafe or want their help exiting the date.
Don’t let your date drive you home on the first date. Give it a couple meetings before you let them know where you live.

Act like a lady.",How to Marry a Millionaire," You know the one: the beautiful (silicon-augmented) girl who spends all day shopping or sitting by the pool. You don't want your millionaire to want you only because you fulfill a specific picture, because that makes you very easy to replace. It doesn't set you apart. It's easy to find plenty of girls who fit that image. It's hard to find one that excites him and can match him in the things he enjoys or wants for his life.


Another part of the cliché, of course, is that you only love him for his money. It's fine to want a guy that can provide for you, but you should choose a guy that can provide for you and that you also love and have a deep connect with. He doesn't want an obvious gold digger, because he knows that will just cause his peers to judge and pity him. He wants to feel loved.;
, Most men, rich guys included, want a woman who respects herself. Why should he like you if you don't act like you think you're likable? Show him you're worth it by taking care of your body and appearance (eat healthy, exercise, dress for success, and practice good hygiene).

, Usually, rich men don't want a total bimbo. They're usually pretty smart themselves, and they want someone that can keep up with them. It's more interesting for them! Study hard in school and stay interested in learning once you're out of school. Go to college if you can, and if you can't, attend free online courses from services like Coursera and keep up on the latest TEDTalks.

, Rich guys usually partake in at least some cultural events and you need to be able to enjoy and fit in with that environment. Have a developed interest in music, art, literature, and film. Understand and explore foreign cultures, history, and politics too (since rich guys are often world travelers).

, No one wants to be with someone who's completely shallow, just an empty shell that never does anything. That's boring! Get out there and do things with your life. Have hobbies and dreams for the future (that you actively pursue, don't just sit around thinking about how much you'd like to be the next big star). This will add complexity to your character and make you seem like a fuller person.

, Talent is always sexy and makes you more interesting. Learn a skill or build one that you already have. The easiest route to go is to become a great cook (very much a learned skill), but you could also learn to draw or paint or play an instrument.

, Be a passionate lover but also be passionate in how you live your life. When we're with someone that's really enjoying their life and pursues what they love, that inspires us to do the same. This is why passion is so sexy! Pursue your interests. If you've always wanted to do something, do it. Once you find your millionaire, they'll be very impressed.

, Frequent the bars and cafes around major medical and tech universities. This will help you meet guys that are well on their way to being doctors and IT overlords. If you meet him when he is still young, he'll be more likely to be single and less worried that a woman is after him for his money. You'll have to deal with the intense schedule of a grad student, but that's just a mark in your favor. You'll show him that you're with him through thick and thin.

, Generally go to places where rich men are likely to be. Skip the cliché of the country club in favor of lunch at cafes and restaurants around major business districts. Try bars in upscale areas at night.

, Rich people usually develop expensive hobbies and collecting rare stuff is one of those hobbies. Rich guys will often collect vintage cars, vintage toys, comic books, or old signs. Develop your interest in and knowledge of these things and then check out upscale auction houses when these items are on the block.

, Charity events are also commonly attended by the wealthy. Don't go in unprepared though. Learn about the issue that the event is for and the work that the organization does. When you go, be prepared to talk to people you don't know. Even making friends in the right places can help you meet someone worth marrying.


You don't have to donate to the charity you're attending the event for but donating something is probably a good idea. Putting on such events is expensive and these organizations rely on getting donations to make it worth it.

, Did you know that about 22% of married couples met their spouse through work?Get a job at a major tech company or other very profitable, stable company and see who you meet!

, You can use many of these tactics to just make friends who are wealthy. Eventually, through them, you may meet your elusive future spouse. If you become very good friends, you can even ask them to set you up! This is a good route to take, because you will be less likely to come across as just another gold digger.

, There are lots of dating services, both online and in real life, that are specifically geared towards helping you meet a rich partner. Pick a reputable one and see where it leads. These services still focus on matching people for compatibility, so remember to do those earlier steps about working on yourself as a person.

, Your future spouse needs to understand that you're not just in it for the money. They need to see that you do really love them...and you should really love them! Relationships are hard, and they only really work when you're truly bonded to that person. Don't bring up money in conversations (especially early on) and try to be fairly frugal. If they want a pre-nup, don't fight them on it. You can even suggest one if you want to make them more comfortable.

, Because it is so common for rich people to be taken advantage of, it's more common for them to have trust issues. You need to create an environment of trust. This will set you apart from all those other people and show them that you're the one they should marry. Be someone that they can confide in, never judge them, and be open with them about your own secrets and insecurities.

, Don't be the kind of date that just lets everything happen to you. Take an active role in your date! You should take them places, even if the place isn't very nice. Be flexible and handle yourself well when things don't go according to plan. Ask them about things you know they'll want to talk about.

, Everyone wants to marry the person that they believe is going to make their life better. When you're rich, you don't have to worry about finding someone that can provide for you. Instead, they're worried about meeting a spouse that can make their life interesting and fun. If you want them to propose, be that person. Get them out of their shell. Get them doing fun, amazing stuff that they never would have done otherwise. Always be positive and avoid complaining at all costs. They won't be able to get enough of you!

, Be a master in the art of love. Not the sex part (although that won't hurt): be good at actually loving them and help them to fall in love with you. Be completely unselfish in your relationship. Work to bring them happiness. Surprise them with acts of love every now and again. Be cheesy. It's a good thing.

, Don't give everything up all at once. You can sleep with them if you want to, but don't sleep with them often or spend all your time with them right away. Why should they marry you if having you as a girlfriend or mistress gets them what they want?

, It is easier. Give it a chance if you are young. Stay in school and understand what new fields are opening up. Invest money every month in a savings account - no matter how small - just start saving. If you are working, try to be the best in your job.

, If you are average looking, slow-witted with a dull personality, forget it. Write down a list of what needs to be improved, then do it. You need to look just as rich and powerful as the man you're trying to catch, but don't forget your personality and personal style.

, Do not talk about how much money they have or how much they make. If they bring it up, be polite but ask no questions. Make it not important in the conversation.

, Avoid swearing, drinking, drugs, laughing loudly, aggressive behavior, and flashy outfits. Work on a more elegant style. Think classy and understated, not ""labels"". You want to be the girlfriend then wife, not the mistress.

Take it slow when making a physical first move.",How to Make the First Move," It's the old but true cliché: actions always speak louder than words. Only 7% of our daily communication is verbal. 55% of our communication comes from body language.Before initiating any kind of move, look for body language clues such as prolonged eye contact and positive facial expressions to help you work out whether you'll get a positive response.


A woman may expose certain areas of her body like her neck or wrists, and may play with her hair.She may touch you or lean against you, or maybe she will turn towards you with her arms open and uncrossed.A man may exhibit more obvious and bold signals. These may include resting an arm on the back of your chair, engaging in strong eye contact, and sitting or leaning close to you.;
, Be sure that you are sending the right signals as well as receiving them. Your body language can give the object of your desire hints that you are interested.


Smiling can be a strong indicator that someone is interested. Make sure you also are smiling to communicate your interest to the other person.
You may notice that you are 'mirroring', which is the subconscious copying of the actions of the other person's body positions. When someone smiles at you, you tend to smile back. Flirting is a way of mirroring each other's actions. Try to see if you're on the same wavelength by doing an action. If the other person mirrors you, great. If she doesn’t, go back to mirroring her to create a bond., While there are physical ways to flirt, talking and chatting can also be a great way to get to know someone and possibly take the relationship to the next level. Displaying good listening and communication skills indicates confidence, one of the most attractive qualities in a person. While men are more motivated by action, women tend to value meaningful words from their partners.Regardless of gender, most individuals appreciate a good one on one chat. Some general tips for creating good conversation include:

, When talking to your beloved, skip observations about the weather, or questions that can be answered with one word (and result in awkward silences). Open ended questions about current events, your personal backgrounds, common interests and hobbies, can steer the conversation in the right direction.
Prompts like, ""What books are you reading these days? Seen any great movies lately? What is your favorite part of the city/town/neighborhood you live in?"" are good ways to keep the conversation going.
Follow up questions like, ""What was your favorite character in that book? What did you think of the end of that movie? Why do you like that part of the city so much?"" illustrate you are paying attention to your partner's answers and reacting to him in an interested way.

, While sweet talk and light banter can create some fun conversations, honesty also goes a long way. This doesn't mean you have to spill all the personal details of your private life in one conversation, but being direct and straightforward about what you look for in a partner, your outlook on life, etc, illustrates self assurance and self knowledge. It also allows your partner to understand where you're coming from, and feel comfortable sharing his point of view as well., Speaking positively helps you to keep a light tone, an interested posture, a bright facial expression. Negativity will make you seem guarded, and it could be a turn off. If you want to talk about negative things, spin it in a positive, humorous way. You want to share and be honest, but you always want to keep things at this early stage light and enjoyable., Plan a simple romantic date, ahead of time, in a private, intimate space. Maybe instead of the movies or dinner out, cook dinner at your apartment or invite your date up for a drink. The idea is to create a safe, comfortable atmosphere that still feels spontaneous and romantic.

, If a romantic setting isn't the right move for you or the person you're interested in, try something more casual.


Give the person your number. You can do this in a subtle way. Recommend your favorite movie or book, then say, ""Let me give you my number so you can let me know what you think!""
Send a casual message on social media. Comment on his picture on Instagram, send a Facebook message, or Tweet him. You can always use her updates to start a conversation, and then open an opportunity to ask her out casually., Making the first move doesn't have to be the obvious and potentially awkward question, ""Will you go on a date with me?"" If you both like pizza, suggest going to your favorite place on Friday. If the other person likes movies, tell her that you two should go see one soon. If the other person expresses interest, be sure to turn the interest into an actual plan. For example, instead of leaving it at “yeah, we should go to a movie sometime,” you should say “Casablanca is playing at the independent cinema at 7:00PM on Thursday; would you like to go see it?”

, If you went to dinner or a movie, send the person a text to let her know you enjoyed your time. This shows that you are still interested.


Think about mentioning a specific thing that happened during the date, like a joke or a food you both ate. That can open up the lines of communication for both of you., Sometimes the straightforward approach is the best one. If the signs from the other person point to mutual interest, then just go for it and ask her out.


Don't be pushy or aggressive. You can be direct while still being casual. If you seem too pushy, you may scare the person away.

, If you're still shy, you can ask him out to a group setting. This can be dinner, pub trivia night, a sporting event, or a party. It could give you both a chance to talk and hang out, but takes off some of the pressure., This doesn't necessarily have to be a verbal confirmation. Your partner will usually use physical cues to indicate that she is willing to go further. Every person's response will vary, but body language like touching your face and parts of your body tend to mean you are good to keep going. Pay attention to your partner's reactions, and adjust your actions accordingly.


You should both be giving your consent to the first move in either a verbal or physical way. It doesn't matter what the other person said or did earlier; consent is always about that exact moment.You should both be in a state that enables cohesive decision making: this means that you should both be sober, particularly if this is the first time you are becoming physical.

, Just like asking someone out, it takes guts to go after a kiss from someone for the first time! Relax and be confident but not overly aggressive. Maintain eye contact, lean in and pause when your faces are close before you go any further to make sure your partner is also interested in a kiss. From kissing, slowly lead into something more physical.

, So, you've started kissing, but you want to take it a bit further. Go slow to ensure the other person is on the same page as you. Light touches and closer body contact will not only make your intentions clear, but can give you an idea of the other person's interest.


Make sure to go slow enough to give the other person time to say no. You want to have a fun, consensual, and safe time with each other. This includes making the person feel comfortable. If the person isn't ready to take it as far as you are, then respect her wishes.
Make sure you have protection. This one seems like a no brainer, but if you're preparing for a first move, always have condoms on hand (regardless of your gender, women should bring their own, too!). Part of having an enjoyable time together is ensuring you're both safe and comfortable, so always use protection.

Get to know your man's moods.,
Encourage him.,
Let him know how much you like him -- without going overboard.,
Don't be too clingy.,
Learn to compromise.,
Don't pick fights.,
Don't ask him if he's mad at you if he's just in a bad mood.,
Remember to have fun.","How to Make Your Man Happy, Emotionally/Sexually in a Relationship1"," Just like women, men can be moody creatures. If you want to make your man happy emotionally, then you need to get to know his moods and know what to do depending on how he's feeling. The more time you spend with your man, the better you'll get to know his moods and the more quickly you'll know how to react. Here are some things to keep in mind as you get to know your man's moods:


You should know when he's brooding and wants to be left alone, or when he's upset and wants to be comforted and to open up to you -- if you mix up the two moods, you'll either suffocate or alienate him.
If he's feeling irritated, after driving in traffic or having a less-than-stellar basketball game, just take it easy on him. It's not the time to start cuddling up to him or to start gossiping about your friends.
If you want to have a ""serious talk"" with your man, then wait until he's in a good mood. If you try to bring up a serious subject when he's stressed and has a lot on his plate, then you won't get the results you want.;
, To make your man happy emotionally, you need to know how to encourage him -- and mean it. You can encourage him by telling him how amazing, talented, or hilarious he is, and to help him pursue his dreams and goals. Don't encourage him if you don't really mean it -- you need to be sincere when you help him move forward in life.


If he has a big basketball game coming up, bake him cookies or call him the night before to let him know you care.
If he has a big test, interview, or important event coming up, praise him and let him know how special he is so he feels positive.

, To make a man emotionally happy, you should let him know how you feel about him -- whether you love him, or just like him a whole lot. When you say goodbye to your man, let him know that you love him or that he's great, and find at least one reason to compliment him every time you hang out. You can let him know how special he is without smothering him or going overboard.


You don't have to send him twenty texts a day telling him how hot he is or how you can't wait to see him -- this will make him a bit too overwhelmed.
Make sure that your affection is mutual. If you always tell him how great he is but get nothing in response, then you may have a problem.

, If you want to make your man happy emotionally, then you have to know how to be there for him when he needs you and how to back off and give him space when he needs it. Being clingy means wanting to hang out with him 24/7, not giving him time to see his boys, and checking in every fifteen seconds when he's not around. Now who likes that? No one.


No matter how serious your relationship is, you shouldn't have to spend every night together. Have a good time going out with your girls and let him go out with his boys without a problem.
If you're not hanging out that day, you can check in once or twice, but don't call him every hour, especially when you know he's with his friends, or he'll start to get annoyed.
If you really want to stop being clingy, then you have to be able to pursue your own interests, to have your own passions, and to be your own person without the man's help. You should enjoy your time with your man, but your life shouldn't revolve around him.

, To make your man happy emotionally, you have to be able to compromise when you have a disagreement. You should know that both of you should be able to get what you want, or to find a middle ground where each of you gets something that makes you happy. Learning to compromise means knowing how to factor in your interests as well as your man's whenever you make a decision.


You can also take turns getting what you want -- maybe you get to pick the restaurant for date night, and he gets to pick the movie.
Don't be one of those girls who always gets her way because her man thinks it's easier to give you what you want than to put up a fight.
In a good relationship, both people should be willing to compromise.
Learn to have even-toned discussions instead of yelling when you have a disagreement.

, There's nothing a man hates more than having to fight, bicker, or argue with his girl for no reason. If you have something important to discuss, then pick a reasonable time and place where both of you can focus on the conversation; don't start yelling at him in public and expect him to engage with you. Learn to keep your voice calm when you disagree instead of raising it.


If you have the urge to pick a fight, ask yourself why you want to pick the fight, and what you're really angry about. Find a way to discuss this subject in a mature fashion.

, This is a common mistake many women make. If your man is obviously grumpy and you're not sure why -- or even if you know why -- and you know you can't fix it, then you may tend to ask, ""Are you mad at me? Is it something I said?"" If there's no reason for the guy to be mad at you and he's already in a bad mood, this will only make him feel worse.


You need to know that there are some situations that you just can't control. If he's having a bad day, he's just having a bad day -- his world doesn't revolve around you.

, Some women are so obsessed with trying to have a perfect relationship that they forget to relax, kick back, and just have fun with their man. Though relationships are about building a strong, nurturing bond, they're also about being able to laugh, be goofy, and to have an amazing time without trying so hard. If you and your man aren't laughing on the regular, then he can't be happy emotionally.


Don't worry so much about planning the perfect date or the perfect romantic activity. You can have the most fun renting a goofy movie, hanging out at the mall, or taking an impromptu trip to the beach.

Hook up in new places.,
Be adventurous.,
Be bold.,
Be raunchy.","How to Make Your Man Happy, Emotionally/Sexually in a Relationship2"," If you want to be able to make your man happy sexually, then you have to know how to touch him to turn him on. Each man is different, but there are a lot of places where almost any man would like to be touched to get him in the mood. Here are a few love locations to try:


Touch him behind his ear or whisper into his ear, letting your lips graze his inner ear.
Kiss the front and back of his neck, nibbling on it just the tiniest bit.
Give him a sensual shoulder massage and see if it leads to something more.
Gently caress the back of his head when you're kissing.
Place a hand on the small of his back when you're talking.
Plant a hand firmly on his chest.

, If you want to make your man happy sexually, then you can't do the same old thing every time. You should be willing to experiment and to try new positions -- as long as you feel comfortable doing it. If you're always kissing in the same position, with him on top of you, try switching it around so you're the one on the bottom -- and the same goes for sex.


Not every new thing you try will feel great -- but be open to the process. You can go back to your old favorite positions and try new things in the middle.
Let him lead the way. He may have an idea of what he wants. If not, you can try something new first.

, If you want to keep your man happy, then you shouldn't just hook up in the same part of your bed every time. Instead, try moving around your home or apartment and exploring every nook and cranny with your bodies. Don't be afraid to try hooking up outside the home, whether you check into a hotel in your town or take a romantic vacation.


Don't underestimate the good old movie theatre make out. Kissing in the car is another old favorite.
Get frisky in public. Find a deserted and romantic location and have fun with your man.

, To please your man sexually, you have to be adventurous. This means being unafraid to go new places and to try new things whenever the mood strikes you. To be adventurous, you should be willing to try new things, from skinny dipping to kissing on the beach, or even to settling in for a long night of love making on a weekend hike.


Don't think of reasons not to try something new -- instead, think of all the reasons why it would be fun.
Take an unexpected weekend vacation. Point your finger on the map and drive to the place you've chosen. Have fun exploring the new spot -- and each other's bodies.

, Being bold is another way to make your man happy sexually. To be bold, you have to let your man know what you want when you want it. Take charge for a night and drag your man into the bedroom, telling him exactly what to do. Or turn to him in the middle of a party or crowded bar and whisper ""I want you,"" in his ear, telling him that it's time to go home and hook up pronto.


Your man will appreciate your audacity and frankness and it'll turn him on even more.
If you're in the mood, just go for it. If you get that loving feeling when your man is in the shower, just sneak in there and join him for a soap session.

, Your man will love it if you're raunchy from time to time. To be raunchy, you can't be afraid to push the limits of your sexuality. Here are a few ways that you can be raunchy:


Go to a sex store and pick up some whips, sex toys, and sexy clothing, no matter how ridiculous it may be.
Invest in some incredibly sexy see-through lingerie.
Have fun talking dirty over the phone or text to make your man think of you when you're not there. He'll love it.

Keep your relationship fresh.,
Don't get jealous.,
Don't try to change him.,
Give him space.,
Make sure you're happy.","How to Make Your Man Happy, Emotionally/Sexually in a Relationship3"," If you want to keep your man happy emotionally and sexually, then you can't just settle into the same old routine, even if you've been together for years. You have to make an effort to keep things fresh or both of you will lose interest. Here are some ways to do it:


Do something that you've never done before together at least once a month. It could be rock climbing, biking, or playing beach volleyball.
Take a dance class together. Learning to salsa or ballroom dance will help you keep your bodies in sync as you explore new horizons.
Find a new way to compliment your man every week. You can always think of more things that you love about him.
Play hard to get once in a while. He shouldn't feel like he can have you whenever he wants.
Know that the chase is never over. He should be working as hard to pursue you as he did the day you met.

, The easiest way to blow a great relationship is to start to get consumed by jealousy for no reason at all. If you're jealous, that will only make your man annoyed and frustrated and will make him feel like you're not secure enough in the relationship to trust that he won't cheat on you. If you can't stand it when your man talks to or even mentions another girl, even if it's completely harmless, then you need to work on keeping your jealousy in check and on making your man feel secure.


If you always gossip or say negative things about other girls in your orbit, your man will not be impressed.
Part of being in a healthy relationship means knowing that there are a lot of other appealing members of the opposite sex out there and recognizing that you won't pursue them. If you think your man can't be around a pretty girl without hitting on her, then you have a problem.

, If you don't like your man the way he is -- to a degree -- then why bother with him? It's okay to want your man to step it up a bit, whether it's by not showing up late to your dates or by taking less than three hours to return one of your calls, but it's not okay to try to change the way your man looks, dresses, thinks, and talks to suit your idea of what the ""perfect man"" should be like. This will only make your man feel annoyed, like he can't be himself, and like you don't like him for who he really is.


If your man is exhibiting less-than-desirable behavior, then it's fine to point it out. But if you point out every little problem, from the way he chews his food to how he ties his shoes, then he'll feel like you're constantly nagging him.
Nobody's perfect. You should recognize that there are things about you that your man may not find ideal -- but that's okay.

, Even if your relationship has been going on for years, you should always remember to give your man some space -- even if you share the same home and bed. You and your man should be able to spend some time apart so that your relationship can grow even stronger when you return to each other, and so you can continue to gain an appreciation of how special your significant others are.


Being able to let your man do his own thing on the weekend sometimes, to go to happy hour with his coworkers without you by his side every time, or to take a weekend trip to see his family without you is a sign of maturity and trust.
If you feel like you constantly have to be by his side or you can't enjoy yourself, then you won't be able to keep your man happy for long.

, Though it's important for you to make your man happy emotionally and sexually, it's equally important that you're feeling emotionally and sexually fulfilled in the relationship. It's not the woman's job to tip-toe around the man, making sure that his needs are met -- a strong relationship is forged by mutual love, encouragement, and acceptance. If you feel like you spend all of your time thinking about what your man wants instead of being attentive to your own needs, then you have a problem.


Though it's impossible for you and your man to be happy emotionally and sexually 100% of the time, you should both be happy the majority of the time for the relationship to thrive.

You've got to put a bit more effort into it to show her that you really care and that you're aware of the things that make her really unique. You can compliment her looks, an aspect of her personality, or just something about her. Just remember not to force it; if you're complimenting her just to get her to like you more, she'll be able to tell. Here are some examples of great compliments you can give that sound natural:


Compliment an aspect of her personality. Say, ""I love how you're so good at keeping your cool in a stressful situation. I need to learn how to do that.""
Compliment her looks. Say, ""I just love the color of your hair. It's so pretty and unique.""
Compliment something else about her. Say, ""You have so many friends who really care about you. You're so good at maintaining your friendships."";
, If you want to make your girlfriend really feel special, then it's about more than just telling her the color of her eyes reminds you of the ocean. You have to show a real interest in who she is as a person, what she does on a daily basis, and her worries and fears. She has to feel that you don't just see her as your girlfriend, but as a human being with her own worries, interests, and ideas. Though you shouldn't interrogate her, you should ask questions naturally throughout your time together. Here are some things you can ask her about:


Her childhood
Her day
Her goals for the future
Her friendships
Her relationship with her family
Her fears
Her hobbies
The things that make her happiest

, You don't want your girlfriend to feel like an object. You want her to feel like you actually respect her intelligence and value her opinion about a variety of subjects. Let her see that you really do care about her thoughts and opinions and that you value what she has to say when you make a big decision. Here are some things you can ask her opinion about:


Books
Life decisions you're making
Current political issues and situations
A movie or concert you both saw

, It's important not only to say the right things, but to listen in the right way. If all you're doing is talking and talking and worrying about saying the right thing, chances are that you're not taking the time to really listen to your girlfriend. You have to make eye contact, give her your full attention, and make sure that she feels like you really care about what she has to say instead of just waiting for her to stop talking so you can say what's on your mind.


Don't interrupt her. Let her finish what she has to say before you say anything.
You can nod and squeeze her hand from time to time to let her know that you're really listening.
Part of really listening is remembering what she tells you. So, if she's telling you about a fight she got into with her sister, you can ask her how things are going with her least favorite sibling when you see her next.

, It's hard for guys to know what to say when a girl is upset. Sometimes, you may feel like anything you say will only make things worse and will end up making her even more upset. While there are no perfect words you can say to make every girl feel better, you have to get to know your girlfriend to see if she's the type who feels better just from telling you everything on her mind or if she needs you to comfort her and tell her a million things to make her feel better. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Don't try to ""solve"" her problem right away. She may just need to vent for a little while before you two can talk about what she should do next.
Don't say things like, ""I know exactly how you feel"" and then compare her situation to your own experiences when she's trying to tell you something. This will make her feel like you only care about yourself.
Know if she needs to be left alone. If everything you're saying is making her feel worse, then she may just need some time to herself. Don't force her to talk about her problems if she's not ready.

, If you want your girlfriend to feel really special, then you have to encourage her to achieve her dreams, feel good about herself, and to go about her life in a positive, fulfilling way. Let her know that she's awesome before her big tennis match; tell her she's the smartest person you know before she takes a big test or goes in for an interview; make her feel important when she's feeling like nothing is going right for her. Though you don't want to give her false confidence, you should make it clear how awesome you think she is so that she always feels special and ready to face whatever comes her way.


Say things like, ""I know you're the right person for the job. You're so smart, talented, and great with people.""
Say, ""Don't let the other team intimidate you. They know you're the one who's a real force to be reckoned with.""

, If you want to make your girlfriend feel special and like you really care about her, then you can't just go MIA if you're not together. While you don't want to smother her by calling her every five seconds, you should check in with her every once in a while if you're spending some time apart. If you're apart for a day or two, just one phone call or a few cute texts each day should do the trick.


It's okay if you're not a phone person. You don't have to force yourself to have long conversations when you'd rather just talk in person. However, if she does like to talk on the phone when you're apart, take a few minutes to let her know you care and to see how she's doing.

, You don't have to be Prince William to sweep your girlfriend off her feet. Just follow a few gentlemanly rules and your girlfriend will be feeling special in no time. Being a gentleman is about treating your girlfriend like a lady and paying attention to her needs and wants. And, of course, about making her feel special. Here are some things you can do:


Hold doors open for her
Pull out her chair before she sits down
Offer her your coat when she's cold
Let her order first
Check in to see that she's feeling happy
Avoid being overly vulgar
Have good manners

, Don't just take her to Papa John's and bowling every Friday night. Make an effort to plan regular date nights that are special, fun, and exciting. Though you can't go skydiving during every date (unless you're on The Bachelor), you can make an effort to keep your relationship feeling fresh and exciting by doing new things while also making time to do the things you love to do most together. Here are some great date night ideas:


Inviting her over and cooking a meal for her or cooking a meal together
Taking a stroll through your town and window shopping on a nice evening
Eating a type of cuisine she's never had before
Seeing a romantic movie and going mini-golfing
Taking a painting class together
Going for a run together
Picnicking
Mini-golfing

, You don't have to try to do everything perfectly in order to make your girlfriend feel special. In fact, if you're so obsessed with planning the perfect date nights and being the perfect gentleman, your girlfriend may even get bored or feel like you're not being yourself. While it's great to make your girlfriend feel special, if you try too hard, she may feel like you're putting on an act.


It's okay to make mistakes sometimes. If you do, though, just make sure to apologize. Nobody's perfect, and it's better to apologize than to try to act like nothing went wrong.

, To make your girlfriend feel special, you have to be there for her, and not just during the fun times. You have to be there to help her with her homework, give her rides if her car breaks down, or to bring in the groceries if she needs a hand. Though, like many women, your girlfriend may be strong and independent, there will be times when she needs your help (just like you will need hers), and you have to be there to deliver.


You also have to be able to tell when she means it when she says she'll be fine on or her own, or if she's just too proud to ask for help.

, There's a difference between making your girlfriend feel special and in making her feel like she can't breathe. Make sure to give your girlfriend space to hang out with her friends, pursue her own interests, and to do her own thing while maintaining your relationship. Sure, sending her flowers every week will make her feel special, but so will recognizing that she's her own person and letting her do what she wants without feeling threatened or jealous.


If you know she's having a girl's night, don't text her every five seconds to see if she's having a good time. You don't want to sound needy and this is likely to make her feel annoyed, not special.

, Giving your girlfriend love and affection will definitely make her feel special. Give her passionate kisses on the lips, or softer, sweeter kisses on her forehead or cheeks. Put your arm around her, hold her hand, or just take the time to cuddle or snuggle with her when you're alone. You don't have to be all over her to let her know that she's special to you with some physical affection. Not everyone is into holding hands or kissing in public, but you have to figure out what level of affection will make your girlfriend feel special.


If you really hate holding hands, link arms with her when you're walking.
Brush her hair out of her face or gently run your fingers through it.
Put your hand on the small of her back if you're walking into a place together.

, Think you've found the perfect formula to make your girlfriend feel special? Then think again. If you want to keep making her feel special, then you have to keep mixing things up and make your relationship feel fresh. Even if you've found the perfect date night scenario, you have to keep trying new combinations so your girlfriend doesn't feel like you're getting bored and complacent. Here are some great ways to keep things spontaneous:


Plan a surprise trip or date when she doesn't expect it.
Write her a sweet love note on a random Tuesday.
Serenade her in public.
Send her a text message that makes her laugh in the middle of a stressful day.
Don't be afraid to act like a little kid sometimes. If you feel like running around a park or jumping into the ocean, go for it! (As long as you're staying safe.)

, Though finding a routine that works for your relationship is great, you can also make your girlfriend feel special by continuing to find new activities that can define and reinvent your relationship. Here are some great things you can do together:


Start a book club for two
Take a dancing class
Learn to cook one new recipe a month together
Teach yourselves a foreign language
Train for a half-marathon together
Volunteer in your community together

, Another great way to make your girlfriend feel special is to check out some new places together. You don't have to have the budget of a sultan to explore something new together. You can start by checking out a new restaurant, and then work your way up to going to a museum you've both had your sights on, and then take weekend trips to other cities or even plan an exciting vacation to get out of your usual routines. Make an effort to travel together as much as you can and you'll see that your girlfriend feels special because you continue making an effort.


Make a dream bucket list of places that the two of you want to go to. Cross them off together, one by one, even if it takes years!

, Another way to make your girlfriend feel special is to always make her feel like she's a priority. That means that you should always make time for date nights, for conversation, and just for decompressing together. Once you stop making time for each other, the love and fun will stop, too.


If both or one of you is having a really busy week or month, talk about making that sacred couple time in advance.
When you are together, give her your full attention. Don't check your phone, zone out, or invite other friends to join you if you're really trying to connect with your girl.

, Don't take her for granted and think that things are going great in your relationship so you don't have to keep trying so hard. A relationship is never either ""great"" or ""not great,"" and you need to always keep working on it, even if you feel like everything is perfect. Always remember to compliment your girlfriend, to tell her how special she is, and just to keep the love going no matter what.


When you see her, notice her appearance and compliment her. Don't make her think you don't pay attention to her looks any more.
Continue to check in and ask her about how her day, her job, her classes, etc, are going. Don't just assume that she'll bring it up if something is bothering her.
Check in about her feelings. Make sure she's happy and talk about it if she's not.

, If you want to make your girlfriend feel special, then you have to keep things romantic, whether you've been together for five months or five years. Dress up for date nights. Always be a gentleman. Light some candles when you're cooking dinner for her. Keep the chase going -- play hard to get sometimes. Don't just settle in to your relationship once it's obvious that you both like each other, but work to keep her hooked and make her do the same.


Keep the romance alive by trying new things, being adventurous together, and always having something to look forward to as a couple. If there's something romantic or sexy on the horizon, then your girlfriend will always feel special in her relationship, and you will always feel satisfied.

Use your body language to your advantage.,
Ask him a few questions.,

Talk about your plans.,
Casually let him know you like hanging out with him.,
Pull out your phone.,
Leave when the conversation is getting good.",How to Make a Guy Ask You for Your Phone Number," Being playful is a form of begin flirtatious. Sometimes, a guy will be too afraid to ask for your phone number because he won't think you're into him. It's up to you to let him know that you're interested and would love to see him again and to give him your number. To be playful, just tease him a bit, lightly pat him on the arm, and just show that you don't take yourself too seriously.


If you're out, you can even dance with him without getting all serious and making intense eye contact. Keep things light and fun.;
, Don't be afraid to flirt a little bit without coming on too strong. To flirt with the guy, you can twist your hair a bit, touch his arm, and laugh a little bit more than you normally would. Just don't overdo it or he may feel overwhelmed or like you like him a little bit too much. Here are some other ways to flirt with the guy:


Give him a subtle compliment. Tell him you like his shoes or that he has a great smile. Keep it subtle. Obviously saying ""OMG you're the hottest guy I've ever seen!!!"" will turn him off.
Lower your voice. Speaking more softly will make you sound more mysterious, and will have the bonus effect of having the guy lean closer to talk to you.
Keep it light. Flirt with him, and then pull back a bit. You don't want it to get too serious too fast.

, Another way to let the guy know that you're interested is to give him subtle clues with your body. The way you carry yourself and the way you look at him can give him the indication that you're really into him. This will make him much more likely to ask for your number. Here's what you can do:


Make eye contact. Look him in the eyes when you talk to him so he knows that he has your full attention. If it gets too intense, look away for a little while.
Lick your lips occasionally. This will help him see what's on your mind.
Lean toward him. Position your body, shoulders, and legs toward him, so he sees that you really like him. If you're turned away, then he'll think you're looking for something better to do.
Touch him occasionally. This will also clue him in to the fact that you'd like to see him again. Just a playful touch on his knee or forearm will do the trick.

, Show that you care about his life and what's on his mind. Obviously, if you're out at a club, it's not the time to ask if he believes in life after death or what his deepest fears are. But wherever you are, there are ways that you can show you like him just by being interested in who he is and how he thinks. Here are some things you can ask him about:


His hobbies and interests
His favorite bands or movies
His favorite sports teams
What he does for fun on the weekends
His opinion about something that matters to you.

, If you want the guy to ask you out, then one thing you can do is to bring up some things you both like. That way, he has more of an opportunity to ask you for your number because he can think of an excuse to do it. Here are some ways you can mention the things you like in order to get the guy to feel more comfortable about asking for your number:


Mention a movie that's playing in theaters. If you think it's something you both may like, he might ask you to go with him.
Bring up a band you both like. If you're both talking about music, you can use it as an opportunity to mention a band that's playing in town. Saying, ""Have you heard of Animal Collective? They're actually coming to town at the end of the month"" can plant a seed in the guy's mind.
Talk sports. If you're the kind of girl who likes sports, then you can say something like, ""I've been watching the As for a few years now, but I still haven't gone to a game."" This can make it easier for the guy to ask you to come along.
Bring up your favorite foods. Maybe you both love Mexican food or Ethiopian food. If a new restaurant opened in town, or if you've been dying to try the food at a certain place, bring it up and see if he bites.

, Bringing up something you're doing in the near future can make the guy more likely to ask for your number because he'd like to come along. Find a way to casually bring up something you're doing in the middle of the conversation and see if he expresses an interest in joining. If he does, then he'll have almost no choice but to ask for your phone number. Here are some things you can say:


Mention a party you're going to that weekend. He may want to come along.
Talk about an awesome class you're taking, whether it's a kickboxing or rock climbing class. He may want to try it.
If you and a bunch of your mutual friends are going on a weekend trip, talk about it casually and see if he wants to come along.

, You don't have to say, ""Please please ask for my phone number!"" for him to get the picture. If you're spending a bit of time together, whether you're just hanging out after school or taking a long lunch together during work, you can make some subtle comments that could lead him to want to spend even more time with you. Here are some things you can say:


""I always have so much fun talking to you.""
""This has been such a crazy conversation. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard.""
""It's always really easy to talk to you.""

You can also find a way to make it pretty clear that you don't have a boyfriend. He may be afraid to ask for your number because he may think you're dating someone else.



, Though you shouldn't be rude and text your friends or answer the phone while you're talking, at some point in the conversation, if you want to hint that you want him to ask for your number, you should take out your phone for a second or two. Maybe you'll do it to see who is texting you. Maybe you'll take out your phone to show him a picture of your cat or something else you were talking about.


Just pulling out your phone for a second will make him realize that hey, you're a cute girl with a phone, and that he should probably get your number.
Make sure you don't flash your phone for long, though. He may think you're not that interested in him if you do this.

, If you want the guy to ask for your number, then you can't linger around until you both have nothing to say, or he won't want to hang out again. Instead, wait until the conversation is really going somewhere, and before there's a lull, excuse yourself, saying that you really have to go but that you loved talking to him. If it works, then he'll say something like, ""I'd love to pick up this conversation soon"" or ""I'd like to spend more time with you.""


If the guy gets the message, he will ask for your digits. And if he doesn't, have patience -- it sometimes takes time for a guy to work up the courage to ask for your number.
And hey, if you're pretty sure that the guy likes you but he's proven too shy to ask for your number, what's stopping you from taking the initiative and asking for his digits?

Explain the feelings that are preventing you from coming.,
Be honest about your level of interest.,
Create a conflict.",How to Make a Reasonable Excuse to Miss a Date1," If you are trying to make an excuse, you must have a reason. If it's a reason the person you are supposed to meet will understand, offer it.If your reason is about you, it might not offend. If you are too tired, too sick, too overworked, or too depressed to meet up, say so.
You might say, ""I'm so sorry to cancel, but I've been feeling really down and I don't think I'm up to spending time with anyone.""
If your reason is about the person, you might offend them if you offer this as a reason to miss the date. Avoid saying things like ""I'm not in the mood to see you,"" or ""last time we hung out it took forever and I was bored.""
If you just don't want to date them, however, you should tell them instead of just canceling the date.;
, If you have a romantic date with someone you aren't actually interested in, tell them. If you don't like someone who likes you, you will have to tell them eventually. Canceling on them repeatedly until they get the idea is not the kindest way.


If you realize you want to cancel a date because you aren't interested, call the person and say so.
You might say, ""I think you're great, but I'm just not emotionally available to date you right now.""
If you're interested in someone else, say, ""I have feelings for someone else, and I can't really see past those at this time.""
If you just aren't dating at the moment, tell them this. ""I'm not up for dating right now. I'm just spending time with friends.""

, If you don't want to keep a date with someone, create a conflict that will prevent you from going. For instance, you might schedule a doctor's appointment for that time. You can then contact your date and tell the truth without going into too much detail.


You might say, ""I have a doctor's appointment when we were supposed to meet up. I'm sorry! Can we make a new plan?""
You will have to suggest a make-up date if this is your technique. Only create a conflict if you are willing to meet up later.

Keep your arms relaxed and not crossed or tense.Don’t hide your hands when you talk to him. Exposing your hands and wrists to him so he can see the soft skin on your arms is actually proven to be very attractive to men.;
, Head tilting shows you are interested and engaged in him. Avoid looking over his head, around the room, or down at your phone. This will only show him you aren’t interested., Leaning towards him is a nonverbal way of telling him you are engaged. This works well if you are in a group of people, but you want to single him out to let him know you’re interested in him.


Leaning towards him will also subconsciously pull him towards you.

, When we are attracted to someone, blood will flow to our face, causing our cheeks to turn red. This is actually an evolutionary way that your body tries to attract the opposite sex. So blushing in front of the guy will let him know you are attracted to him and send him a signal he will definitely recognize., The positioning of your feet reflect your attitude towards someone. So if your feet are pointed towards him, this is a sign of attraction. If your feet are pointed towards the exit, this may be a sign to him that you are not interested., How you hold your purse when you are with a guy can actually be a form of nonverbal communication. For example, if you are clutching your purse tightly or placing it in front of your body, this shows you are uncomfortable and nervous. But holding your purse loosely at your side or not at all shows you are attracted to him and are relaxed in his presence."

You can claim to have a cold, a sore throat, a flare up of a condition you really have, a sudden stomachache, or a general sense of unwellness.Don't give too much detail. Just say, ""I have to cancel our plans today, I'm afraid. I have a sore throat and I am not feeling well.""

, Claim to have forgotten that you made another plan at the same time. Say it's something you can't get out of. It could be a date with a friend, a medical appointment, or a work meeting.For example, say: ""I made plans with my dad ages ago, and I just forgot to put them in my calendar. I can't really change on him, so I have to ask you to let me give you a rain check for today!""

, You can say you have to stay late, go in early, have a meeting, or work from home. Cite the time of year if it is a busy one.You could tell them, ""I'm so sorry to change our plans, but this is our busy season and I have to do catch up all weekend.""
Remember to stick to your lie! Don't head out on the town that night if you canceled on someone--they might see you.

Suggest a make-up date.,
Admit fault.,
Avoid lying when you can.,
Don't involve others in your lie.,
Never cancel twice.,
Cancel with lead time.",How to Make a Reasonable Excuse to Miss a Date3," When you cancel on someone you like, it's best to suggest a new time for you to meet. Unless you are trying to permanently distance yourself from your date, you should suggest the soonest possible opportunity to meet again.You might suggest trying again at the same time next week, or perhaps meeting the next day.

, If you cancel on someone, you may be privileging your needs over those of the other person, and you are certainly letting them down in a small way. Make excuses, but apologize as well.


Apologize by saying, ""I'm so sorry to cancel. I hate to ask you to move your schedule around when we already had plans.""
If you forgot a date, apologize profusely.

, An occasional small social lie can spare everyone's feelings, but generally it's best to not tell lies, especially with friends and loved ones. Little lies can lead to big lies. If you get caught doing something that isn't what you said you were up to, you'll lose the respect of the person you were supposed to meet., Lying only works if you keep it simple and believable. If you say you were with someone else, you risk them spilling the beans. Instead, tell a simple lie without many details.


Don't say, ""Carly was feeling sad so I have to spend the day with her!""
Say, ""I am not feeling good, so I'm going to stay home.""

, If you cancel twice on a new acquaintance, you are unlikely to hear from them again. When you miss one appointment, make sure to make the next one for a time you can absolutely attend.

, Don't cancel the same day if you can avoid it. Give your friend or acquaintance time to make new plans. Never cancel after the person you are seeing is likely to have already started heading toward your meeting point."

Contact your lawyer or the court.,
Get evidence.,
Present yourself if you've already missed a date.",How to Make a Reasonable Excuse to Miss a Date4," If you know you need to miss a court date, contact your lawyer and ask them to get your date adjourned (put off) or rescheduled for an earlier time. Do this as soon as you can.

Ask your doctor or an emergency room attendant for a certificate or a medical report. Ask for it to be verifiable: for instance, it should be signed by your doctor, or printed on official stationary. The date should be included.


Present this to your lawyer or to the judge. Another acceptable excuse is that you got into a car accident or there was some sort of natural disaster. You'll need to provide evidence that this was indeed the case.

, If you missed a date, there may be a warrant out for your arrest. Go to the local police station or go directly to the court where you missed your date. Present yourself in court with verifiable evidence that you were unable to attend, such as a medical certificate or medical report from the date in question.If you are a charged with an offense for having failed to attend, get legal help before making your plea.

Remember that appearance is not everything, but ALL ATTRACTION IS PHYSICAL ON SOME LEVEL!,
Find an excuse to talk to him- even if its going out of your way and puts you at risk of looking a little foolish- truth is guys are going to acknowledge your genuine effort and find it cute.,
Grab his Attention & make it effortless.,
Keep it up and build excuses to talk to him and get his attention- if after two encounters- you're not picking up vibes that he's interested- surrender, because this should be quick and seamless.",How to Win Him Over and Get Him to Like You," It's chemistry- basic 101 of attraction, even when you find yourself seeing a guy more attractive as a result of his personality- the truth is is that there are physical qualities that your brain admires of his- and likewise x20 for him- because guys depend more on attraction and chemistry to determine his interest in you. Luckily chemistry breaks down into two parts- the physical magnetism and the flow energy, ""that spark"", between two people- AND I HAVE STEPS AND TIPS TO HELP YOU WITH BOTH!!!;
, CUTE is definitely something you want to come across as- guys instinctively want to think of girls as smaller... cuter... in need of protection... hold you in my arms- soft, gentle appeal of females. (That's why some girls naturally try to raise their vocals and use a baby voice- it is an instinctive tactic. Although truth is its more attractive when girls use their actual voice so AVOID this. A raspy voice is actually sexier and guys generally are always more apt to unique charm)

, Conversation is the best way to grab hold of a guys attention and allow mutual energy flow. But if just starting up a long get to know you conversation is too difficult- which often it can be- Sometimes just talking to him can be hard enough- bump into him. Yep, the ONLY way for chemistry and vibes to truly flow is to be in a room with him. So, find out where he's going to be- sounds stalkerish, but you are not the only girl doing this- I PROMISE!!! Once you know where he'll be- GO THERE! If simply being there and running into him isn't enough to get his attention and start up a conversation- literally bump into him- walk past and gently brush him or back up into him- GENTLY... GENTLY! Seriously, spilling his drink or stepping on him or making him bump into someone else is gonna make him think ""watch where you're going!"" or ""what a linebacker!""- just a gentle brush by, where you can flash a smile and say ""ooo eh sorry (laugh a little then if you know him: ""hey, ________. How's it going"" if you don't know him like that, just ""Hey (hold a staring smile and break it) sorry I thought I knew you from somewhere for a sec). Either way brush his arm for sec. DO NOT BREAK YOUR TOOTHY SMILE.

, Love and connection and chemistry should be seamless. Attraction- especially with guys is decided quickly and instinctively!

Be willing to share details about yourself with him.,
Find things you both love to talk about.,
Don’t be shy about voicing your opinion.",How to Make a Guy Want to Be With You2," Revealing details about yourself beyond run of the mill small talk can create a more intimate bond between the two of you. This could be something as simple as telling him how many siblings you have, that you come from a small town, or that you love jazz music. Disclosing personal details shows you are starting to trust him. If he responds with intimate details of his own, you are both clearly working toward building a more serious relationship.Be careful not to reveal too much too soon. Telling him more about yourself over a period of time or over several dates can help to grow your mutual attraction to each other.
Deeper questions like, ""How's your relationship with your mother?"" Or ""what do you think about kids?"" should only be asked after several dates and once you have built up trust and mutual understanding.

, A good conversation can be a big turn on for a guy, especially if you both talk about things you enjoy or can agree on. The rule of no talk of religion, politics, or money during a date may be outdated. But focusing on topics like your favorite travel destinations or your favorite television shows can be good ways to keep the conversation going and make it enjoyable for both of you.Finding common ground also shows him you are interested enough to try to find ways to connect with his tastes and preferences. Though you may not agree all the time, working towards a mutual understanding can strengthen your relationship.
If you know he is a big sports fan and you are also into sports, ask him: ""So, what did you think of last night's game?"" Or if you are more interested in pop culture, bring up the latest show you're obsessed with on Netflix, or share your celebrity crushes.

, Avoid being passive in the conversation or saying “yes” to everything he says. Voicing your opinion shows you have the intelligence to think for yourself and aren’t afraid to be honest. A smart woman who knows what she wants and how to get it will attract men everywhere she goes.If he asks you a direct question, like ""What is your favorite place you've ever traveled to?"" or ""What do you look for in a person?"" Give him an honest answer and then ask him the same question. This will show you are interested in keeping the conversation going. It will also show you have a straight forward and honest attitude, a big turn on for most guys.

Show off your sense of style.,
Do activities together that make you feel confident and strong.,
Try to bring out the best in each other.",How to Make a Guy Want to Be With You3," Though its important to maintain a certain level of hygiene (brush your teeth and your hair, shower regularly), its even more important to dress in a way that makes you feel confident and strong. This could mean a tight dress and heels or jeans and a t-shirt. Displaying your sense of style through your clothing, your makeup (or lack thereof) and your overall look will show him you are not afraid to be yourself.Most men are interested in women who dress based on what they think is sexy, rather than based on what men think is sexy.

, Rather than spend time with him doing things you may not find interesting or stimulating, suggest activities that you enjoy and feel great doing. This could be rock climbing together or sharing an intimate meal. Sharing things that you enjoy with him can also bring you both closer to each other and make your relationship stronger., Do this by encouraging his passions and being supportive of his goals, and expect that he will do the same for you. As your relationship gets stronger, remember to always try to bring out the positive sides of each other. This will ensure you both feel good around each other and will want to stay together for the long haul."

Compliment her.,
Learn about her interests.,
Give her your complete attention.,
Make eye contact with her.",How to Make a Girl Weak in the Knees1," Girls love to hear compliments. It reassures them that you like them and that they are attractive.Give her compliments that are specific to her rather than generic compliments like “you’re pretty”.
Compliment her abilities like how well she plays a sport or musical instrument. These kinds of compliments show her that you care about her interests.
Be genuine with your compliments. Most girls have the insight to tell when someone isn’t being genuine so make sure the compliments you say come from a true place.;
, Ask the girl about the things she’s interested in to get her talking to you. Find common interests you share to create a bond with her, or take the time to learn more about something she is interested in. Use questions that will encourage her to share with you.""What is your most treasured memory?""
""What would be your perfect day?""

, One thing most girls want from their partner is their undivided attention. This conveys that you will be there for her and that she will be your number one.Listen to her when she talks and validate her by acknowledging what she said. This needs to be more than just an “uh-huh” or “yes, sweetie”.
Be an active listener by rephrasing what said and repeating it back with a follow up question., Eye contact is an important part of communicating and flirting with a girl. Good eye contact can make her feel a connected to you and not be able to get you off of her mind.Lock eyes with her while she talks to you and gaze lovingly into her eyes.
Periodically catch her eye when you are across the room from her, and hold her eye contact for a few seconds before looking away.
Smile when you look into her eyes.

Remind him what you're worth.,
Don't talk about the relationship.,
Have fun.",How to Make a Player Fall in Love," If you've fallen for a player it's likely that he's already talked to you and made you feel special. That's what players do, and chances are you are not the only girl he's talking to.A player will try to impress you with his outward appearance, his ego, and his money. Take some time to try and get to know him on a more personal level.;
, Whether you are at a coffee shop or a bar, try sending a drink to his table. Make sure he knows you sent the drink over. The idea is to get him to approach you.When he walks over to thank you for the drink, use the opportunity to strike up a conversation.Don't let him make the conversation about sex. Try to talk to him about his friends, or what he likes to do. Pay attention to what he says, and be wary if he starts to lead the conversation in the wrong direction., Rather than asking questions, speak in sentences. Tell him what you should do. Don't ask him if he wants to join you, tell him what you should do together.If you know he is free on a certain night of the week, make a suggestion that the two of you go out. Try telling him something like, ""We should go get a bite to eat, or maybe grab a drink."" Keep it casual, and take the pressure off the situation., Buy two tickets to a concert or a movie, and mention it when you talk to him. Say something like, ""I was supposed to go see this band on Saturday with my friend, but she can't go anymore. You interested?""


Be careful taking a player into crowded spaces, especially bars. Just because he came with you doesn't mean he won't be talking to other women.

, If you're just not up to the task of asking him out, drop a few hints to let him know you'd like to spend more time together. Mention a movie you've been wanting to see, or a club you've been wanting to go to.Don't be too obvious about it. Let him think it was his idea all along.

, When a player calls to make plans, don't drop everything you're doing just for him. If you have plans, don't cancel them.Let him know that you've got a life outside of him, and that you're going to spend time with your friends. If you cancel on your friends to hang out with him, he'll feel like he already has you, and he may soon lose interest., A player will want to get you to the bedroom sooner rather than later. For him, interacting with women is about one thing, and one thing only. Don't give him what he wants if you want him to stick around. Make him work for it.If you're making out, and he says wants to take things further, don't let him. Tell him something like, ""I'm not going to sleep with you tonight, but I had fun with you. Call me sometime."" Then, give him a smile, or a wink, and just walk away. Leave him wanting only you.Don't sleep with him until you are completely sure you are ready to take that step with him. Keep in mind that even if you make him wait, he may see you as just another sexual conquest. Players are not likely to quit being players until they are ready., If you want a player to think you have value, then you need to believe you have value. Respect yourself and let him know you're worth it.Don't just hang out with him late at night when he calls. The next time he calls you late at night, tell him he'd have better luck if he called you during the day. When he calls you during the day, keep your word., If you've spent a few nights in a row together, take a break from hanging out. You may not want to. You may feel like things are going to work out for the best if you just keep spending time together. This is rarely the case. You want him to miss you when you aren't around.Don't become so focused on spending time with him that you stop paying attention to the rest of your life.
You don't have to start ignoring him, but you should give him something to look forward to., This may sound dangerous, given the reputation players have, but it's necessary. You might feel like you need to frequently check up on a player to make sure he isn't going behind your back. Ignore that urge.If you start calling him a lot, or trying to occupy every minute of his time, you will only succeed in pushing him away. He'll start to view you as ""clingy"" or ""needy."" If you want him to chase you, you have to give him the space to do so., Some guys, especially those labeled as players, don't want to feel pressured into commitment. Don't try to convince your guy to take things to the next level.Pressuring your guy to commit puts you in a vulnerable position and gives him all the power in the relationship. If you want him to settle down, there needs to be a balance of power., If you haven't met his friends, you need to. Plan a party and ask your player to invite his friends. If his friends show up, respect them. If they don't show up, your player probably isn't thinking about getting into a long term relationship with you.Take the time to get to know his friends. Keep an open mind and show an interest in them.If you find out you don't like his friends, but he insists on spending all his time with them, drop a hint that you need some attention. Don't force him to make a choice, but be clear with your needs., If you want your guy to settle down with you, he needs to want to settle down with you. He should genuinely enjoy spending time with you, and should want to be around you. And you should do what you can to make him feel this way.This doesn't mean you need to spend all your time and energy trying to please him. But you should put your best foot forward and make him realize how good you are., Talking about the status of the relationship may actually ruin it. Instead of worrying about whether he will commit to you, focus on having fun together.Keep doing the things you did when you first started hanging out. Don't assume that once you've asked him out, you're finished. Keep trying to entertain each other. The more positive experiences you can create, the more likely it is he'll want to stick around., Rather than focus on ways to get a player to settle down, focus on making new, positive experiences. Do things together. Go to shows, play games, and goof off. Don't make everything serious. Show him what it's like to be in a fulfilling relationship, and maybe he'll want to stay.Don't plan everything in advance. Try to be spontaneous with your activities. If something comes up and you both want to do it, then go do it. You'll both have fun, and he'll see that he can still have an exciting life without having to be a player."

Practice old fashioned gestures.,
Make her feel safe.,
Use good table manners.,
Be respectful to others in front of her.,
Return phone calls and texts in a timely manner.",How to Make a Girl Weak in the Knees2," Girls like to feel special, so taking the time to do a few simple old fashioned gestures will go a long way when trying to win a girl’s heart. Observe her reactions to your gestures, and make sure she appreciates you going the extra mile. If she wants a more equal relationship, these may seem condescending.Open doors for her when you are with her. Take the time to open the car door for her when you arrive and leave from places. Hold doors open for her and any others around when you enter a building.
Offer her your coat on a cold night. This act of chivalry shows her that you care about her by making her comfortable.
Meet her friends and family. Ask her if you can introduce yourself to her friends or parents because you want to meet the people she loves.

, Creating a feeling of safety and security will help a girl trust and open up to you. Simple actions of kindness can help make her feel safe in your arms.Hold her hand when you are walking with her. Having her hand in yours shows her that you are proud to be with her and makes her feel as though you will keep her safe.
Stand close to her, or pull her close to you. Standing within a close proximity to her when you are out with friends will ensure her that she is your one and only.
Put your arm around her. Try putting your arm around her shoulders when you are watching a movie or hanging out with friends. She will like the feeling of comfort in your arms, and it should make her feel like you’re strong.
Be there for her when she is feeling down. A girl needs to feel safe and secure emotionally. Listen to her when she talks about a problem, and reassure her that she will be alright. Let her know that you are there for her in any way she needs, and if she needs help solving the problem, you are happy to help.

, Present yourself as being cultured and respectful by using proper manners when you eat.


Chew with your mouth closed, and don't talk while you have food in your mouth.
Use your knife to guide food on your fork, not your fingers.
Wipe you face and hands with a napkin rather than your clothes.
Keep your phone put away during dinner.

, When you treat people with respect in front of a girl, it shows her that you are going to treat her with the utmost of respect.Show love to your mom or sister in front of the girl to let her see that you understand what real love looks like.
Be helpful to elderly ladies by opening doors for them or helping them with their groceries when you are out with a girl. She will see how compassionate you are and know that you’ll be this compassionate with her.

, While a little suspense can make her excited to hear from you, make sure that you don't leave her waiting too long.

Buy her flowers.,
Take her somewhere memorable.,
Use your talents to surprise her.,
Pay attention to her love language.",How to Make a Girl Weak in the Knees3," The gift of flowers is a great gesture to show a girl you care. Flowers are beautiful and can have an enticing aroma that will make a girl feel special.Buy her a few of her favorite flowers or a few exotic flowers instead of a generic bouquet. This is more personal and will make a girl feel like you took the time to pick them out for her.

, Creating a memory with a girl by taking her somewhere special will help her make a connection with you. Take her somewhere unique that she isn’t used to going, or plan a fun filled day with interesting activities for her.Take her to a field or up a mountain to go stargazing one night. Bring a couple of blankets to sit on and stay warm with. You can also bring a small picnic to share.
Plan a day volunteering at an animal shelter. Shelters are always looking for volunteers to play with the dogs, so show her your compassionate side by volunteering. There’s nothing sweeter than playing with a puppy.

, Using your individual talents to surprise a girl will show her why you are a catch. She should appreciate the time you took to create something special for her.Write a song for her and perform it, or handwrite the lyrics on nice paper for her.
Choreograph a dance to perform for her, or take dancing lessons and take her out to show off your skills.
If comedy is your thing, invite her to an open mic night. Get on stage and perform a stand up set. Just make sure you don’t make her part of any of the jokes.

Ask her for advice and take it.,
Really know her.,
Become a great person to talk to.,
Be a fun date.,
Master making out.,
Learn how to turn her on.,
Cultivate your sense of humor.",How to Win a Woman's Heart," Stop dressing and acting like you're hot stuff. You know the guy: the one that looks like he just stepped out from doing his test shots with a cheesy modeling agency, the one who gives The Look to every hot girl that walks by. Don't be that guy. Yes, women are initially attracted to this. But eventually they think that you're more interested in attracting women, in general, instead of attracting them.


Don't dress overly flashy and try to focus on wearing things that you know she likes, rather than trying to think about looking how you think women like.
You should similarly save the flirting and close conversations for her and not use them with other women.;
, Taking care of yourself shows her that you can also take care of her if she ever wants to be taken care of. Practice good hygiene and exercise. You don't need to worry about losing weight, but you should feel healthy and in shape. Similarly, eat a healthy diet!

, Dressing poorly by wearing clothes that don't fit or have stains or holes show a woman that you don't respect yourself (which doesn't work in your favor!). Dressing in clothes that are out of date (too old fashioned), usually shows that you are mentally stuck in that time and cannot move forward. In order to show a woman that her heart is safe with you, dress in modern clothes that look good on your body, fit, and are clean.

, Women love someone who smells great. Shower regularly, use deodorant, brush your teeth, and you might even want to consider using a cologne or body spray. Citrus scents usually make for a clean scent that isn't overpowering, so they are a good place to start if you're not sure.

, Confidence is sexy to everyone! Show her how confident you are by taking initiative, never talking poorly of yourself, and speaking up for yourself (with other people too, not just around her).

, Remember: you are at your best when you are yourself. If a woman truly loves you, she will love you for who you are. When we act like someone we are not, sooner or later we're not able to keep it up. Even if she would have loved you for who you really are, if she finds out you were faking she will feel lied to and may not love you anymore.


Being yourself also helps you maintain your own happiness!

, You probably know that you should respect her in order to win her heart (if you didn't, now you know!), but remember that it's also important to respect other people too. She'll always worry if she sees you treating others poorly that you'll treat her just as badly if she does something that makes you unhappy or does something else ""wrong"".


Respect her and others by allowing them to speak and be heard, acknowledging their opinions, never belittling them or treating them as anything other than your equal, never lie to them, and never saying cruel things about or to them. Basically, be nice and polite!

, You should be passionate in your relationship, but you should also be passionate in your life. Being around someone passionate helps us to be more passionate and engaged in our own life, so we are naturally drawn to people like this and want them in our life more. Be passionate in your life by exploring and celebrating the things that make you happy and unique, without worrying about what others think.

, Similarly to how we look for passionate people in our lives, we also like being with someone who makes our life more fun. If you can bring the fun into her life by finding great things to do and new avenues to explore, then she'll be completely in love.

, Women have it a bit harder in life than guys. Most social systems put women at a disadvantage (they make less money than men, for example), and so they need a life partner that can help them in life, not make things even harder. If you want to win her heart, show her you're not going to be a burden. Have a strong work ethic, help her out when you can, and show her that you value her over other women.


One good way to show her that she is your number one priority is to not be bashful about letting people know that she's with you and that you love her!
Another way to show her that she is your priority is to make sure that you actually spend time with her! Don't make her feel guilty about taking up your time and show her how much fun you're having while you're with her.
Be financially stable and maintain a job. It doesn't have to be a good one. Women will overlook a bad paycheck if they know they can rely on you and don't have to worry about what you do with that paycheck.

, Show her that you care. Man up and let your feelings show. Society tells men that they cannot show feeling and women are trained to think that showing feeling just scares men away so no one ever shows any feeling and we all feel terrible! Break the cycle! Let her know what you think and don't be afraid to show her how much you love her.


Do nice things for her. Listen to her when she needs to talk about her problems. Work together as a team to deal with life's challenges. Encourage and help her achieve her dreams. Be unselfish in your relationship with her and showing her that you care will become a breeze.

, Yes, gifts are a good way to win a woman's heart, but not just any gift will do. Gifts should show that you care and that you specifically care for her. You don't want to give a gift that could be just as nice for your ex-girlfriend or your sister. Give a gift that is significant to her.


Try giving her something in her favorite color, something she said she wanted or needed, or (best of all) something that reminds you of significant moments that you've had together or inside jokes that you share.

, If she calls or texts you and mentions that her day is not going very well, bring her some flowers on your lunch break or when you get home. If she tells you at the end of the day, have the flowers sent to her first thing in the morning with a note like ""I hope these help today go better than yesterday.""


Bonus points if the flowers are unique, such as giving her a tiny Christmas tree during a tough holiday season or a ""bouquet"" of stuffed kittens.

, Leave her a series of notes, each one telling her something you love about her and a clue to the next location. End the scavenger hunt with dinner and a gift.

, Use your creative skills to make something for her. It doesn't have to be fancy or perfect. It just has to show that you think she's worth the time and effort. You can make her a card on nice paper, make her a necklace pendant, or make hr a sculpture for her desk (check your local art store for polymer clay).

, When you've had a hard day, the last thing you want to do is add insult to injury by having to slave over the stove for half an hour, right? When you know she's stressed (or even when she isn't), help her out by cooking her a nice dinner.

, Write her letters as often as you can manage. You don't even have to talk about anything interesting, but it is a very useful time to talk about your feelings. This vintage touch will show her just how much you care, and charm your way into her heart.

, Make a cd/tape/USB stick with songs that are significant to your relationship or remind you of her. Try to tell the story of your love (how you felt before you had her in your life, how you met her, what you first thought, etc) through the songs that you choose.

, Women, like anyone, want to feel useful. They want to feel like they serve a purpose, especially to people that they care about. Let her be and feel useful by asking her for advice about problems that you have in your life. Importantly, you should take her advice and let her see that you've taken her advice.

, Know her for who she really is, not just who you want her to be or the face that she puts on for everyday life. Talk to her about things that matter and find ways to show her that you get her. For example, buy tickets to a play that you don't care about but that you know she really wants to see.

, Women love someone that they can really talk to in a significant way. Someone they can talk to and have it feel natural and not awkward. Be that person and her heart is yours.

, You want to be someone that's fun to date. Don't just sit around, complain the whole time, or make her make all the decisions. Be active in the things you do together and help her to have a great time.

, Good kissing skills, while not the most important, are certainly important enough that you'll want to consider working on your skills. Remember, practice makes perfect!

, Be good at knowing how to stoke her fires. This shows her how much you care about her own pleasure, not just your own! Pay attention to what makes her feel good and spend more time focusing on her.

, Everyone loves to laugh, so show her that you can bring laughter and joy to her life by learning how to make her laugh better and more often. Avoid the cheap shots at others expense in favor of clever comments, as this type of humor tends to appeal to women more.

",How to Think of Cute Names for Your Girlfriend," Some girlfriends like cute names, others don't, so know your girlfriend's preferences before trying this out on her!;
, For example, Baby girl.

, For example, if their name's Sally, saying something like Sally Wally is just sad.

, That's too gross.

, For example: ""Jennifer"" she probably gets Jen, Jenny or J from other people, so call her something cute like Jinny, or FerFer, or play off her last name. Anything that other people she knows aren't doing.

, For example, ""Hey fairycakes"". It's a sweet food, sweet fairy, and a sweet name.

, It's really romantic and it will make her feel special (plus not embarrassed).


Don't go crazy and make loads of different names for her, a few is fine.

, Its very important your girlfriend approves of it and likes being call by that name.

Be firm.",How to Turn Down a Second Date," One way to let a person down easy is to lead into the rejection by telling them something positive. That way, they hear something good about themselves before they realize you're saying you don't want a second date.For example, you could say, ""You're fun to be around,"" or ""You have a great sense of humor."";
, When you do offer a reason for rejecting the person, keep it focused on you or the feelings between the two of you. That way, you're not actually rejecting the person. Rather, you're saying that you two just aren't a good mix together.For example, you could say, ""I don't think we had much chemistry,"" or ""My feelings for you are purely platonic.""

, Once you've said you don't want another date, you can move on to wishing the person well in some form. You'll be starting on a high note, moving to a more negative note (rejection), and then ending on a high note.For instance, you could say, ""I wish you the best,"" ""I hope you find someone that makes you happy.""

, Even if you've been on a date with someone, you don't have to offer a reason why you don't want to go on a second date. The key is to be polite and to the point. You don't want to draw it out if you're saying no this way.If someone asks you on a second date, you can simply say, ""No, but I appreciate you asking me.""

, One way to help you figure out what to say is think about what you'd want to hear. For instance, most people would rather be told outright than just ignored for the next few days or weeks., You don't want to lead the person on, so you need to make sure you say ""no"" in some form; however, you don't need to be mean about it. Don't attack the person, but rather, bring up what you did like about them.Avoid saying things like ""maybe"" or ""I don't think so"" or anything that suggests you might change your mind or could be persuaded to go out with them again.
Remember the compliment sandwich: Start with a positive, tell them you're not interested, then end on a positive note. Something like: ""You're a great person, but I don't feel a romantic connection with you. I know you'll be really happy with the right person.""

, While it may seem easier and maybe even kinder in the moment to fib about why you don't want to go on a second date, making something up has the potential to seriously backfire. You may also be tempted to ghost the person — never contact them again and stop responding to their texts and calls, but this is unfair and can be more hurtful than just telling the person you're not interested.


Saying ""no"" should be enough without having to make up an excuse.
Don't say ""yes"" and then pretend you're busy whenever the person calls you, or promise yo call and follow up and then ignore them.
If you make up an excuse, it's very possible you might get caught in your lie. Pretending to be sick, that you're getting serious with someone else, that you have to work, etc. — all of these excuses may seem appealing, but the other person could easily find out that you are lying, especially if you have mutual friends.

, Email and texting are convenient and might make it a little easier to turn someone down since they are not right there in front of you, but it's also very difficult to convey your tone. It can be very easy for the other person to misinterpret what you are saying if they can't hear your voice or see your face and body language.


If the question comes up at the end of the fist date, this is a good time to tell them in person. Or if they ask you face-to-face for a second date. You don't necessarily have to set up a special time to meet up just to tell them ""no.""
If the person texts or emails you about a second date, you might write back, ""Can I call you?"" and let them down over the phone.

, If you're worried you can't say ""no"" to a second date, you may need to do some work on being more assertive. This doesn't mean being aggressive or nasty — it means you can comfortably state your opinion and how you feel while being respectful of the other person. Remember that it's okay to say ""no"" — it's your right to turn someone down and you don't need to apologize or even explain yourself. This can be very difficult for some people to do, because they worry this means they are not nice or they are afraid of confrontation. Working on becoming more assertive can help you see that it's okay to say ""No thanks.""


Remember that being assertive is a skill and that you can develop it with practice.
Try developing a mantra to combat guilt. If you find yourself thinking ""I'm a jerk because this person really likes me and I'm going to hurt their feelings,"" say instead, ""I deserve to go out with someone I like, and they deserve to go out with someone who likes them. I'm not going to waste their time and lead them on."", One way to keep the focus off the rejection is to focus on what you're thinking or feeling rather than using ""you."" If you use you-statements, the person you're talking to tends to feel like they are being blamed for the situation.For instance, you should say, ""I'm not feeling the chemistry between us,"" instead of, ""You're not right for me.""

, You don't want to come across as condescending or mean. Try to keep your tone as polite and even as possible. If you start raising your voice or using sarcasm, you're only going to hurt the person more., Just like tone, your body language can give a lot away. Of course, you can't completely control your body language, but make sure you aren't smirking and try to look the person in the eye as you tell them. Try to make eye contact and keep your arms and legs uncrossed for a more open posture. Keep your body as relaxed as possible.

, If the person keeps pushing, make it absolutely clear that you don't want a second date. You may need to say it more loudly, block their number if they're trying to call, or block them on social media if they keep trying to contact you. Remember that your safety is the most important thing, and if someone is making you feel threatened, it's more important to protect yourself than try to be polite or tactful.


You could say ""I may not have made this clear in my last message, but I am not interested in a second date. Don't contact me again.""
If you find that someone is making you feel unsafe, talk to security or call the police.
If someone is coming by your house when you've asked them not to, definitely call the police.

Show him that you think you're worthy by respecting yourself. Speak up for yourself, think for yourself, take control of situations when necessary, and take care of yourself.;
, When we don't take good care of our bodies, it tells others that we don't think we're worth taking care of or loving (even when we actually feel really good about ourselves). To help show him that you think you're worthwhile, take good care of your body. Practice good hygiene, eat a healthy diet, and exercise to keep your body strong and in good condition.

, Dressing poorly usually shows others that you don't think they're worth extra effort, that you don't want to impress them. But of course you want to impress him so dress to impress! Wear clothes that aren't horribly out of date, fit and flatter your body, and are clean and free of stains or holes.

, Smell is incredibly powerful when it comes to attraction. Not so much in terms of smelling good (though it can help a little), but smelling bad is a HUGE turn-off. Set a good foundation by showering regularly and using deodorant. If you really want to smell amazing, add in a little body spray or perfume.


Choose a smell that you want him to associate with your personality (citrusy for playful, floral for feminine, musky for sensual, etc).
Try not to go crazy with lots of different scents: work towards one ""signature"" smell that he can associate with you.

, Confidence is sexy to just about anyone. You don't have to actually be confident, but make him think that you are. Act confident by standing up straight, looking him (and everyone else!) in the eye, speaking up for yourself, and occasionally taking control in situations (deciding what to do on a date, etc).

, A lot of the time, guys are reluctant to date because they worry that they'll lose their freedom or their identity because this is something that our society tends to teach. Show him he doesn't have to worry about that with you by helping him to feel free. Encourage and help him to pursue his dreams, help him set up fun activities with his friends, don't hog his free time, etc.

, When we look for someone that we really want to get serious with, we're looking for someone who makes our life better, right? So of course your guy is looking for someone who makes his life (not necessarily exciting) but at least fun. Be the source of fun in his life. Go on fun dates, encourage him to try new things, and join in and encourage his passions in life.

, One real turn off for guys is the drama queen. You know the girl who constantly gossips, starts arguments and fights with other people, and generally complains and looks for flaws in everything? Don't be that. Stay away from drama and definitely try to minimize the drama that he's exposed to.


Having an actual problem that he can help with is one thing, picking a fight with him about something petty is another thing altogether.

, Guys like to feel useful. They like to feel like they're your hero....so make them feel like they are! Let him help you with things from time to time. Ask for and take his advice with real or even just minor problems. He'll love the place that he has in your life because it will give him a sense of purpose that he might not feel anywhere or with anyone else.

, You should be passionate in your relationship of course, but you should also be passionate in your day-to-day life. Find enjoyment in what you do and pursue things that are important to you. Enthusiasm and joy in life are catching, and we tend to look for and stay with people who help us feel those feelings, so be that person for him by loving your own life.

, Most importantly, you should be you. Don't try to be the person you think he wants. When we try to pretend to be someone else, eventually the mask begins to crack and who we really are shines through. Even if he would have loved you for who you are, he may be hurt and resentful that you lied to him and you'll lose him anyway. Honesty is the best policy!

, Sometimes a nice gesture can help secure his feelings for you. One good option is to make him something yourself, from scratch. Try to focus on things that he would actually like, not things that scream out ""I'm only wearing this because a girl I like gave it to me"". You can try making him an embossed leather cuff, a ""beach boy"" anklet, a sculpture he can put on his desk at home, or a keychain.

, Find out his favorite book and track down a signed copy. You may even be able to get one signed just for him, if the author is still alive. This can be an incredibly meaningful gift, if the book is very important to him.

, They say that the way to a man's heart is through is stomach and that is usually true. Cooking is a skill that's easy to acquire, even if you've never cooked before. A little practice and you'll be making him happy and full before you know it.

, Sometimes, a nice massage can really help melt away a stressful day. A lot of the time, this is what we're really looking for when we decide who we want to be with in our life, so help him see that you are a great way to relax.

, Depending on what your guy is in to, you can get more specific with your gesture of affection. If he's old-fashioned or a bit of a car enthusiast, you can rent him some time riding around in a classic car. This is a very unique experience and shows him how much you stand out.

, If he's a bit of a nerd or generally really enjoys comic books or comic book movies, you could try going to a comics convention. Really, no matter what he's really passionate about there's probably a convention for it, so just find one that screams him and take him!

, A good kisser is a sign of a keeper, so improve your kissing skills if you really want to blow his mind.

, Being someone that's just great to talk to is also important, so get comfortable with talking and making those conversations memorable and significant.

, This is an important part of dating and really sets you apart from the other people in his life. Don't be afraid to be the one planning dates: he'll be a little turned on that you're taking charge.

, If all he wanted was someone he could have fun with and talk to, you'd be his best friend and nothing more. Set yourself apart by giving him something that no one else can.

, If you've never cooked before in your life, don't panic! It's easier than it looks. Practice and effort and you'll be worthy of your own show before you know it.

Avoid strong perfumes and perfumes with an ""old lady"" scent.
Make sure you apply the perfume correctly.;
, Use your body language to put ideas in his head. Sensually lick an ice cream while you're out on a date. Run your hand up and down the top of your thigh while you're sitting together on the couch. Lean in close to talk to him. Bend over dramatically to pick something up off the ground. There are lots of ways to make him start thinking sexual thoughts, so just take advantage of whatever situation you find yourself in.

, It should be a little flirty, a little dirty, and a whole lot of tempting. The husky voice and the closeness of your lips as you whisper something slowly, and sensually will have him begging to take you to bed.


""So now what do you want to do?"", ""You are such a tease."", ""What do you want me to do to you?"", etc. You get the gist.

, Step 1, wear brightly colored underwear that are not granny-panties; Step 2, have just a bit of it peek out over the top of your jeans when you bend over; Step 3, profit. Or he'll profit. It's mutual profit.

, If he knows you're turned on, that's going to turn him on more than anything else. If he touches you in just the right way or says something that drives you wild, tell him. You can also send him texts or let him know in other ways as well.


Try, ""God, I want you right now."" or ""I cannot stop thinking about what I want you to do to me.""

, Congratulations: now he's thinking about your lips. It's as easy as that. Just a little bit of this paired with looking up at him through your lashes will tell him you're about ready to devour him, you're just to polite to say it.

, Whether it's a light touch on the arm, or running your hand up and down his thigh while you're watching that movie on the couch, you're going to make him want you touching him all over his body before you know it. Just remember to use light touches and firm touches appropriately and try to stick to sensitive areas (back of the neck, jawline, arms, upper chest, lower back, etc).

, Tell him to take off his shirt, oil him up, and start rubbing. Wear as little clothing yourself as you rub. A massage will get the blood flowing and between your hands being all over him and everything already being so...slippery....he's just not going to be able to help himself.

, Guys get really turned on when girls are spontaneous, confident, and do things that are unexpected. You don't have to go out dancing, but put on some music and home, grab him and make him slow dance with you, and then just move your body in as basic a way as you can handle. Move in ways that feel natural and give you the opportunity to rub against him. Believe us, it'll be enough.

, Taking charge of the situation will really turn him on. Take his hands and place them on your bum as you give him an alluring look or whisper something in his ear. Putting his hands where you want them to go tells him that you're turned on and you want him: something he'll find very sexy.

, A little nibble on the ear, a long lick down his neck: show him that you want to just eat him up. The sensations will turn him on and get him thinking about where else he'd like you to be licking and tasting.

, This can be a huge turn-on. Once you've got his shirt off and you're kissing his chest, for example, lick a long line with your tongue and then blow on it. The heat followed by the cold will give his body a lot of sensation to focus on and will really rev up his engines.


Don't forget the oldie but goldie ice cube!

, You don't need to have skills that rival the girls in that club downtown. Just a little sexy music (try CéU's ""Cangote"") and some body movement as you slowly remove your clothing will drive him up the wall.

, This can be fun for everyone and will help you let loose and both get a little more out of your physical relationship. Give him the chance to choose a fantasy to play out or surprise him with a fully prepared scenario, costumes and all.


Try to choose something that appeals to him. Comic books, movies, school-related fantasies, video games: you know your man best.

, A little kink never hurt anyone: as long as they remember their safe words! All joking aside, a little kink can really spice up a relationship and it doesn't have to get too weird. Only do things you're comfortable with and make sure that everyone is on the same page. Handcuffs, anyone?


Letting him choose a kink he wants to explore can be a huge turn-on for him. Don't be judgmental and be open to what he wants to try; this will show him that he doesn't have to be ashamed or uncomfortable around you, which will really turn him on.

, If all you're doing is missionary, he might end up getting a little bored. You might too for that matter! Turn each other on and add new life into your relationship by trying some new positions in bed. While there are obvious downsides to the 69, the 77 is nice and accessible and guys love it when a girl gets on top.

, There's warm water and soap and everything is so slick and slippery...it's a great way to turn him on and try something new. Wash him, let him wash you, and see where things go from there.

, Vibrators are not just the realm of lonely women and happy lesbians: sex toys are great for partners to use together. If you're new to using toys, get just a small, cordless vibrator (a really basic one, usually about the size of an egg). Run it around his testicles during intercourse and he'll just about explode.

End on a good note.",How to Turn On Your Girlfriend," To turn your girl on, you'll have to act sexy right from the beginning. You can be sexy while you're taking a long walk on the beach or in less sexy-fied locations like your local bowling alley. To be sexy, you have to have swagger, be comfortable with who you are and how you look, and to walk with your head high, full of confidence that you're an amazing guy to be with.


Look into your girlfriend's eyes when you talk to her. This will show her that you're confident.
Master the half-smile. This coy smile is very sexy and will get your girl in the mood.
Lean in when you talk to your girl. If you lean a little closer than normal to your girlfriend, she'll want to kiss you and to be closer to you.
Clean up nice. You should always be freshly showered and groomed before you hang out with your girl. A guy who pays attention to his hygiene is very sexy.;
, Let your girlfriend know that she's beautiful and that she looks good. If she has a new haircut or is obviously wearing a new outfit, you should complement her even more. Don't be afraid to tell her that she looks sexy, that her legs look great in her new skirt, or that you love her new eyeshadow.


Complement her enough to make her feel special and sexy, and to let her know that you're paying attention.
Don't overdo it. If you complement every little thing she does, then you'll start to look insincere.

, Before you can invite your girl over and start hooking up, you should set a sexy mood by taking her on an intimate and sexy date. You two may love going to the zoo or splurging at the Pancake House, but this is not the time. Take her out to a nice dinner with dim lights, and make sure that you're sitting in a place that gives you lots of privacy.


After dinner, go out for a nice walk. Hold her hand. Rub her hand gently with yours to start giving her that loving feeling.
Give her a taste of what's to come. Throughout the date, you should gently rub her knee, graze her shoulder, or even give her a sensual kiss from time to time to make her want more. Don't be too generous with her touches -- touch her just enough to keep her interested so you can invite her to a more private setting.

, If you want to turn on your girlfriend, you'll need to create an atmosphere that makes her want to hook up. If your date is going well and she clearly seems into you and wants to keep hanging out, you should invite her over to your place so you can have some more alone time. But before you do that, you need to invite her over and make sure that the sounds, lighting, and scents at your place get your girl in the mood. Plan in advance -- nothing will kill the mood like a messy room or a roommate who won't stop playing video games.


Play some sexy music. Put on some R&B to get your girl in the right mood, or play some jazz in the background. Put it on softly, and don't even act like you had to turn the music on -- it was just always there.
Dim the lights. Make sure the lights in your room are dim and soft. You can even light a few candles if it doesn't violate a fire code. There should be enough lights so you two can see each other, but they shouldn't be so bright that your girl feels self-conscious or vulnerable.
Keep it fresh. Make sure your room smells nice and clean. Keep your window open the day you know your girlfriend will come over so the room won't smell musty. You can even light incense or a scented candle before her arrival.
Keep it clean. Make sure there aren't any dirty clothes or fast food wrappers around -- if your place isn't clean, your girlfriend will be too grossed out to be turned on.

, When your girl comes over, you'll need to be prepared to wow her and to continue to turn her on. You should stock up on a few key items that will prolong your good time and will make your girl want to stay up all night with you. Here are some things that you should have:


Wine or other beverages. Unless you and your girlfriend are too young to drink, you should be prepared with some red and white wine, or any other beverages that your lady likes. If you've come back from drinking on your dinner date, you'll want to keep the buzz going. Have some shiny stemmed glasses that make the wine look even more appealing.
Snacks. This doesn't mean you should stock up on Funyuns and Cheez-its to impress your girl. Instead, be prepared with a bar of chocolate, some cheese and crackers, and some sexy fruits like strawberries or raspberries.
Fresh sheets for your bed. Your bed should be made with fresh sheets, so it's appealing as possible for your girlfriend. If your bed is messy and unmade, your girlfriend won't even want to come near it.

, Once she's stepped into your place or room and is impressed by the sexy atmosphere you've created, you should make her feel right at home. Even if she's been to your place before, you should still try to make her feel as comfortable as possible. To do this, you'll have to be a true gentleman. Here's how to do it:


Ask to take her coat. Hang it up in the closet like a pro.
Tell her she can take off her shoes. This will make her feel more at ease.
If you two drink, offer her some wine. Don't force it -- but if she does want something to sip on, she'll feel better.
Tell her what an amazing night you had. Let her know that your date was just perfect -- you can even mention one thing that really stuck out to you, like, ""That chocolate cake was incredible,"" or ""The stars looked amazing over the water tonight.""
Have a seat. You and your girlfriend should sit down on your couch or near each other so that you feel comfortable. If she's standing, she'll be more likely to distance herself from you or to fidget with things in your apartment.

, Once your girlfriend is feeling comfortable in your apartment and is ready to get more intimate, you can start touching her gently to let her know that you want her. If you're already sitting next to each other, you can just move closer and let your legs touch. You can run a hand down her knee or even put your arm around her if you're feeling bold. Here are some other ways to start turning her on:


If your arm is around her, you can start gently playing with her hair.
If she's wearing a necklace or earrings that dangle, you can play with them and say how much you like the jewelry so you can get even closer to her.
You can even give her a short and sexy massage. Massage her shoulders, her lower back, and even her neck or the back of her head. Just start by using your fingers gently, and apply more pressure if she responds to you.

, Once you've touched your girlfriend, she'll already start to be turned on, and you should find the right time to kiss her. If she turns toward you, looks into your eyes, licks her lips, and leans in, then it's time to start a kissing session. If you want to turn her on, then your kisses have to leave her wanting more. Here's how you should kiss your special lady:


Don't use your tongue at first. Even if you've been kissing your girlfriend for a while, you shouldn't move right in with a French kiss or you'll come off as too aggressive.
Lightly graze your girlfriend's lips and then slowly touch the tip of her tongue with yours. If she likes it, then you can move into a full-on French kiss.
Take breaks. Don't just kiss her for five minutes straight -- take a break every minute or two to gaze into her eyes and to make her want you even more.
You can also brush back her hair or caress her body as you're kissing her.
Experiment. She'll be turned on if you move away from her lips and try to kiss her neck, her earlobes, or even her shoulders.

, Now that you're kissing, you can be a bit more assertive with your touches. Move your hands up and down your girlfriend's body to gently touch her waist, her shoulders, and to move toward her inner thighs and breasts. Just make sure she's comfortable with your new moves.


Every girl is different. As you get more comfortable with your girlfriend, you'll have a better sense of what turns her on the most. It could be kisses on the neck, it could be a gentle touch to her wrist, or it can be something else.

, If you're really getting into the kissing, then you can start removing some layers so you and your girlfriend can get more frisky. But if you want to turn on your girlfriend, you'll have to remove your clothes the right way. Here's how to do it:


Decide whether you want to take off your shirt first, or your girlfriend's. It depends on the girl -- either she'll feel better if you've removed some layers first, or she'll think you're too forward. Feel out the situation to see what she wants.
Take off your girlfriend's shirt. Put your hands under her shirt and caress her breasts before you unbutton the shirt or slip it over her head.
Take off your own shirt. Don't do more than that or she'll be freaked out, not turned on. You don't want to look too eager or she'll take it the wrong way.
Take off your girlfriend's pants or skirt. Gently touch the girl over her underwear -- the key word is gently.

Once you've carefully removed the pants or skirt, or have let her help you do it, you can take off your pants or have your girlfriend help you do it if she's comfortable with it.
Now that you're both just in your underwear, you may take things to the next level -- sex. But this is only if your girlfriend is ready.

, Though you may want to jump right into bed when you see your girlfriend in her underwear, you have to make absolutely sure that your girlfriend is ready to take it to the next level. You should be clear and ask, ""Do you want to?"" or ""Are you ready for this?"" Ask it in a non-aggressive tone, making eye contact and slowing down to let her know that you're waiting for a response.

, If she does want to have sex, then it's time to make her feel more aroused before you sleep together. You may be ready for more, but you'll need to spend more time turning your girl on. Here's what you can do:


Kiss her all over her body. Kiss her neck, her shoulders, her breasts, her belly, and even the insides of her thighs.
Tell her how sexy she is. While you're hooking up, complement your favorite parts of her body or let her know that you like what she's doing.
Touch her genitals very gently. Remove her underwear and touch her lightly with just one or two fingers. You can move your hand and then put it back to tease her a bit. Wait for her to tell you she's ready. And if she's not ready for sex, then don't go there. Wait until you're both ready -- if you're not willing to wait, then your girlfriend will think you're not the one for her.

, If you do decide to have sex, then you can turn your girlfriend on in a variety of ways when you're doing it. You should try not to stick to just one position but mix things up from time to time -- though not so much that she can't get comfortable and you don't have time to settle into a rhythm. Here are some other things to try:


Start on top. Get comfortable, and after a few minutes, ask your girlfriend to get on top of you. She may be feeling too shy to do this, so if she doesn't want to, that's okay too.
Find your sexual styles. If she's more gentle, slow down. If she's more aggressive, speed things up.
Kick things up a notch by lightly biting her neck or her ears.
Don't forget her breasts. Some men get so excited by sex that they ignore other parts of a girl's body -- don't forget to caress or kiss your girlfriend's breasts from time to time.
Don't obsess over your own orgasm. Make sure your girlfriend has an orgasm too -- or at least try to give her one. If you lose interest after you orgasm, she won't be impressed.

, After you've had sex with your girlfriend, or just hooked up a bit, you should finish strong so that she wants to come back for more. After you're done hooking up, spend some time cuddling or caressing in bed with your girlfriend, so she feels loved and appreciated. Tell her how sexy she is and what an amazing time you had.


Some time after she leaves, you can text or call her and say something sly to remind her of what a great time you had -- and how turned on she was.
Keep it sexy. The possibility to hook up and get turned on is always there, so the next time you see your girlfriend, look your best, touch her gently, and let her know how sexy she is. If you keep it up, she'll be turned on again in no time.

Remember that once you tell your friend that you like them, your friendship will be changed forever.For instance, if you want to date them just because you feel happy around them, this may not be the best reason to pursue a relationship.
However, if your heart skips a beat when you see them or if it makes you jealous to see them date other people, your feelings may be worth exploring.;
, Before talking to your friend about your feelings, consult someone you trust like a friend or a parent. They have probably experienced something similar in their life and will be able to give you good advice and insight about how to proceed with your feelings.


Your mutual friends will be able to help you out especially because they are familiar with the two of you and they will be able to be more objective.

, Though you cannot immediately transition into being in a relationship, you can begin to set the tone for your wishes. Flirt with them slightly sometimes. Gauge their reaction to your flirtation and if they respond positively or flirt back, this is an indication that they are also interested in you., You can also begin throwing out hints here and there in regards to the two of you deepening your relationship. This is another way to gauge their interest in you to either encourage you to proceed or prevent you from moving too fast.


You might say something like “My mom asked me if we were dating last night. I told her no, not right now.” Your friend will be intrigued by your answer and their answer will help you determine how they feel.

, When you see them, try to look your best. Make sure you are well groomed and clean and that you are well dressed. If you know they like a certain color or smell, try to wear that shade or fragrance more. Though relationships are about much more than looks, the initial attraction is important in establishing a spark. Looking your best can help to get the person to notice you and help them to see you in a new light.

, This is a great way to let someone know you like them without actually having to tell them. Most people enjoy receiving compliments and your friend is likely no exception. If they look particularly attractive one day, let them know. If they do well on a school project or an assignment at work, let them know that you admire their intelligence and work ethic.Don’t overdo the compliments, however. Too much of a good thing can sometimes be a bad thing. Stick to once or twice daily for a while.

, Flirtation and expressing affection for someone is about much more than just words. Your body can also express your feelings. Use your body language to make gestures that indicate that you like them.


Lean into them slightly when they talk.
Look softly at them in their eyes when they speak.
Smile brightly at them when you see them or when they say something cute.
Laugh at their jokes.
Touch them in slight, small ways. Put your hand on their shoulder briefly when you laugh at them or touch their knee briefly when you sit side by side and are speaking to them.
You can also hug them when you see them and when you are about to leave.

, After planting the initial seeds indicating that you like your friend, plan out what you want to say to them. Make sure to tell them that you value their friendship but see potential for something new and different. Though they may respond positively, know that they also may just want to be friends, which is okay, too.


You may find that writing your thoughts out will help you organize them better.

, Your friendship will be forever changed after this moment, whether they decide to date you or not. Take sometime to be alone and to think critically about your decision before proceeding.

, Reach out to your friend and let them know that you have something to tell them and that you want to meet up to talk. Assure them that it’s nothing at all to worry about, just an idea that you want to share with them to see how they feel.


Meet in a quiet place that you both enjoy, like a park or a coffee shop.
If you are very nervous about meeting, you can also have this conversation over the phone. It will be less pressure on both parties.
If over the phone still feels like too much pressure, consider writing a letter to your friend expressing your thoughts.

, This is the time to tell your friend exactly how you feel. They may feel the same ways as you but have felt too scared to share their feelings. Open up your heart to them and tell them how much you love being their friend but you can’t help but feel something more for them.You might begin by saying something like “We have been friends for a while and I have loved every minute of it. I’ve loved it so much, in fact, that I find myself thinking about you quite a lot and looking forward to the time we have together. I wanted you to know that I like you, more than just as a friend. And if you don’t like me back, well I won’t exactly be happy, but I’ll understand. I just couldn’t keep this to myself any longer without seeing if you feel the same.”

, After you have expressed yourself to your friend, being as honest and open as possible, take some time to listen to their response. Listen to them without waiting to respond, but simply to understand. Though this is an exciting time and you will likely be very nervous, try to focus as much as possible.


You might want to say something like “Well, I’ve done quite a bit of talking and I’d like to know what you think now. Please be honest with me.”
Answer any questions that they might have. They might ask you the moment you knew you felt something more, so take some time to think about that beforehand.

, You may have shocked them with your words or they may have known it was coming. Either way, it is a lot of information to take in and you need to respect them enough to give them the time to process their feelings. Tell them that you don’t need an answer right away unless they are prepared to give you one on the spot.If they feel the same way as you, then that's great! If not, that will be okay, too and life will go on.

, Don’t jump into being in a relationship right away; this typically is unsuccessful in creating a long lasting and meaningful partnership. Instead, take your time to get to know your friend in this new and different way.


Things will be and feel different now that your relationship has become beyond friendly. Enjoy this but be patient as well. Don’t rush or hurry love.

, If the two of you typically see each other in groups or with mutual friends, start setting aside time to be alone together more. Relationships can often deepen and develop when fostered apart from others.


Don’t abandon your friends for your newfound relationship, however. Still spend time with them, just take time to also spend alone with your new sweetheart.

, The more things progress, the time will come for the two of you to go on a proper date. Set aside some time to go out to dinner with one another or to a movie. Dates really set a tone of romance in a relationship and will further move you two away from friendship and into love.


There are also other options for dates like a picnic in the park or going horseback riding.

, Though this newfound love may be very exciting and fun, keep it cool for a while when it comes to showing physical affection. Even though your dynamic has already changed, it will change even further when you decide to move your relationship forward physically.Be careful and wait for the right time.

, To further solidify your newfound love for this person, do something romantic for them. Love is grown out of mutual adoration and care for two people and it is often fed when you do nice or sweet things for them. Take some time to think up something cute that you can do for them.


Send flowers or write a love letter.
Buy them a small, but thoughtful gift.

, If they are your friend, you likely already loved them before your relationship changed. However, the space you are now entering into is new and exciting and significantly different from your platonic friendship. Enjoy this new love and go forth and be happy!

Figure out who to tell first.,
Pick a good time.,

Identify what you're feeling.,

Talk about why you feel you are ready to date.,
Be willing to negotiate.,
Discuss the person.,
Don't try to hide it.",How to Tell Your Parents You Have a Boyfriend1," You might have a parent you feel closer to or maybe one of your parents tends to be more lenient than the other. Oftentimes, breaking the news to a parent who is easier to talk to can clear the way for talking to the other parent.For instance, if you grew up as a ""daddy's girl,"" meaning you can now wrap him around your little finger, you might start with your dad. On the other hand, if your dad tends to be overprotective, you might start with your mother instead.
This approach can be an especially helpful idea if you are a teenager with your first boyfriend.
On the other hand, if you think both of your parents will take it equally well (or badly), just rip off the bandaid and tell them both at the same time.;
, You don't want to tell your parents when they are busy with something else or when they aren't in a good mood. If you want, you can ask them when a good time to talk would be. Try to choose a time when the house is calm, and your parents are not stressed or distracted by something else.However, don't use picking a good time as a way to continually put off telling them. You will need to tell them eventually, so you might as well get it over with.

, If you're afraid you'll get flustered, it's perfectly fine to write out what you think you'll say. Then practice saying it in front of a mirror. That way, when the time comes, you'll be able to get it out without stopping., You are hesitating about telling your parents for a reason. Do you think that your parents will be mad because you're dating? Maybe you think they won't approve of the person you're dating. On the other hand, maybe you just prefer to keep your personal life private. Knowing what you're feeling is important because you can use that in the discussion.For instance, if you think that your parents think that you aren't ready to date, you could say, ""Mom and Dad, I need to talk to you about something. I've been a little hesitant to tell you that I have a boyfriend because I think you think that I'm not old enough.""

, Once you sit down, you just need to get the conversation over with. Don't beat around the bush. However, you can soften the blow with qualifiers. For instance, you could say, ""I really love you two, and I don't want to make you mad. Also, I really want to be honest with you about my life. I want to tell you about the boy that I've started dating.""

, If you are trying to make a case for dating, lay out the reasons why you think you should be able to. For instance, maybe you think that you should be able to date because you are in high school, and most people your age are allowed to date. Be reasonable, and don't get angry if your parents don't agree.Your parents probably won't respond well to ""But everyone else is doing it!"" However, you can pull statistics off the internet about the average age that people start dating, and you can bring up points about how you've shown your maturity in the last year.

, If you're parents don't want you to date and you're asking them to let you, you need to be willing to compromise. Maybe you can suggest that you only see your boyfriend at school or that you only go on group dates with other people. Your parents just want to protect you, so you have to be willing to give up some of your freedom., Tell your parents about your boyfriend. Talk to them about his family and what you like about him. Highlight his good qualities so they get a sense of who he is. It's also helpful to have a photo for them to see.Your parents will probably have many, many questions. It is advisable to answer every question as honestly and fully as possible to reassure them about your new relationship. If you try to hide or lie about something, your parents may become suspicious and anxious.
If your boyfriend has a good relationship with his family, make sure your parents know. This trait is a major plus for many parents because it lets them know that this new guy in your life knows how to value others and can appreciate the tight ties of family.

, One of the most important things to do if you want your parents to accept your boyfriend is to be the one to tell them about your relationship. If they find out about your relationship from someone else, they may assume that you were trying to hide it because you felt you were doing something wrong.You should tell your parents about your boyfriend even if you do not plan to make any formal introductions any time soon. As a general rule, the sooner you own up to the relationship, the better. Avoiding the conversation will only make it harder to have eventually and will increase the odds that your parents may find out from another source.
Once you get older and have already moved out of the house, you do not necessarily need to bring up every date or every boyfriend you have. Wait until a guy comes along that you can exclusively and seriously commit to before getting everyone worked up.

Find a guy whom you're interested in, and would like to understand.,
Talk to him in various situations.,
See how he responds to different conversation topics.,
Don't pester or consistently nag him.,
Take the initiative!,
Share some of your own thoughts with him.,
Don't be clingy.",How to Understand How a Guy Thinks," This can be your boyfriend, a crush, even your husband or simply a good friend.;
, Guys can (and often will) think and act differently depending on who they're talking to. If you see him with a bunch of guys talking about hot girls, sex, and performing seemingly stupid actions, then don't assume this is how he naturally thinks. Watch him when he's with a bunch of girls. If you see him being polite, complimentary, and inoffensive, he may just be trying to impress them. While this is most likely how he behaves, he may just be inflating things a little bit to show off.. Talk to him in mixed company, or even on the phone and he'll probably act more like his true self. Also, become good enough friends with him and talk to him in private, and he'll more than likely reveal his true self.

, If all you see him as is some rowdy boy, then bring up a topic about social issues or something serious. You may find he's deeper than you gave him credit for. If all you see him as is some nerdy egghead, bring up music or popular culture, you may find that he's interested in more than just science and math.

, If a guy keeps repeating something you asked him not to do, he most likely sees you as a nagging person even though he pretends to be listening. If you want to know if he is listening just ask him what he thinks of what you just said. This is also a great way to make him participate in the conversation.

, if you think he doesn't like you, and want to see if he really likes you as a friend, don't be afraid to start the conversation. Most guys would actually prefer to participate in a conversation than to initiate it themselves. Being straightforward and confident works wonders!

, This will most likely end up with him unknowingly yet subtly telling you what opinions he has about different things and how he thinks about them. You may also find that you two share a lot more in common than meets the eye!

, A good chat a day works well. Long conversations should only be made with the guys that you know very well or who are close to you. Guys don't and won't really ask for space, but they definitely want it. Constantly asking about what he thinks or how he feels about stuff is only going to make him lash out eventually, at which point you will most likely form the wrong opinion about him.

Wait on the negatives.,
Understand your parents may be upset.,
Give it time.",How to Tell Your Parents You Have a Boyfriend2," If you know something about your boyfriend is going to bother your parents, don't start out the conversation with that. Instead, wait until the middle or end of the conversation to talk about it. For instance, if your boyfriend is older than you, you might want to hold off on that bit of news until near the end of the conversation., If you're going against your parents expectations of you, they are probably going to be upset. You're just going to have to deal with their anger and even tears, until you can get them to see reason., It may take a little while for your parents to get used to the idea. If they get upset while you are talking to them and tell you ""no,"" they might change their minds later when they've cooled down a bit. Either way, you need to respect the fact that you still need to have a relationship with them, meaning you can't just write them off as evil because they told you no."
"
Wait until the time is right.,
Do a practice run.,
Present them with the facts.,
Give them time.,
Understand when it's not a good idea.",How to Tell Your Parents You Have a Boyfriend3," This kind of discussion is a difficult one, especially if you aren't sure how your parents will react. Wait until you feel comfortable having the discussion. It can be hard if you're questioning your sexuality, as your parents may try to convince you're actually not gay.If you show any hesitation about your sexuality, your parents are likely to ask questions such as ""Are you sure?"" It's okay to discuss your feelings and reservations with them. – Just realize that they may want to ask if you're positive about your feelings. If you're not 100% sure, it's okay. You can have feelings for another guy now, yet decide later that you prefer women. Sexuality can change over time., While coming out to anybody is difficult, try coming out to someone who you know is sympathetic first. For instance, if you have a gay friend or know someone who is a gay ally, talk to him or her about your sexuality before addressing it with your parents. It's very hard to say the first time, so trying it out on someone else first can make it slightly easier on you when you do go to your parents. Plus, the person may be able to give you some tips if he or she is gay. Just be sure you completely trust the person first., If you need to convince your parents, try presenting them with facts about homosexuality.You can find many good resources out there about homosexuality, such as Planned Parenthood's website on the LGBTQ community.It's also good to have materials to give them or websites they can visit to read more about it., Many parents need time to adjust to this announcement. Because most parents expect their kids to be straight, they have to change their own thinking about who you are. Let them know it's okay to take time to adjust.For instance, you could say, ""I know this announcement is a big one, and I understand if you need some time to adjust to the idea. I know I did.""

, If you know your parents will react very badly because of their beliefs, you may want to rethink coming out to your parents. That is, if you think your parents may kick you out or even be physically violent with you, it's best to wait until you are able to support yourself.You may also not want to tell them if you are emotionally insecure, and you know they would come down very harshly on you."
"
Listen to their concerns.,
Understand their role.,
Determine whether or not to keep the relationship going.,
Keep talking.,
Discuss the matter with your boyfriend.,
Ask his parents for help.",How to Tell Your Parents You Have a Boyfriend4," Love can blind us. Your parents might be overreacting to the fact that you have a boyfriend. On the other hand, they probably have some legitimate concerns that you should take into consideration.Calmly and politely ask your parents why they do not approve of your boyfriend. Maybe a trait of his makes them feel anxious, and that anxiety could very well have validity and be something you should think more deeply about. Even if the reasons they give do not seem significant, listening to their doubts and fears will give you an idea of what you need to do to convince them that the relationship is okay after all.

, Good parents take the job of protecting their children very seriously, so it is only natural that they may have to struggle to accept the fact that you are growing up. Try having a little compassion for them.Along with being compassionate, you should also be respectful. No matter how the conversation goes, you should treat your parents with respect. If you can disagree with them about something in a respectful way, your parents are likely to feel less upset and may eventually be persuaded to change their minds.

, Figure out how much the relationship with your boyfriend means to you and how drastically your relationship with your parents might be strained if you continue dating. Weigh the pros and cons of all sides to reach a conclusion about what to do. Yes, of course you love your boyfriend, but your parents will be your parents for life., If you are unwilling to stop seeing your boyfriend, keep bringing the topic up to your parents. The more you talk things through, the better both sides will be able to understand each other. You may even get your parents to relent.You should also provide more opportunities for your parents to get to know your boyfriend. The more time they spend with him, the more accurate their perception of him will be. If he really is a good guy, they might eventually drop their guard long enough to see that.

, A good guy will understand that winning the approval of your parents is an important step in your relationship. Together, the two of you might be able to figure out some way of convincing your parents to confer their blessing upon you.If your parents have never met the guy, he might offer to introduce himself to them as a way of easing their minds.
If your parents offered specific reasons for why they do not approve of your boyfriend, letting him know about these reasons may prompt him to try to fix whatever behavior or condition has them feeling anxious.

, Discuss your relationship with your boyfriend's parents, and seek their approval. If they approve, they might be willing to talk to your parents and try to persuade them, too.This step can be especially beneficial if you are a teen, and he is your first boyfriend. Adults tend to relate to each other better than they relate to teenagers, so if two respectable adults approach your parents and defend your relationship, offering their assurances about their son in the process, your parents might be willing to take this new evidence into careful consideration.

Make yourself scarce.,
Be Honest.,
Avoid telling him/her that you're ""just not ready"" for a relationship right now unless it is the honest truth.,
Also avoid saying you're in a relationship if you're not.,
If you are in a relationship, make sure this person knows that.,
Respect his/her privacy and dignity.,
Keep it real at all times.,
Get a wingman/woman.,
Be prepared to cut off contact.",How to Tell Someone You're Not Interested," This is not the most straightforward way to do it, and it can take a while for the other person to figure out that you're not interested, but a lot of people handle it this way. Say nothing to anyone else - don't ditch that person while telling all your mutual friends, ""I can't come this weekend. Brad's crushing on me and I don't want to feed the fire."" That would not be cool.;
, Just say ""I appreciate your feelings for me, but I don't share them. I like you as a friend, but that's as far as it goes."" You don't have to whip out a laundry list of reasons why. If the feeling isn't there, it just isn't there. Be prepared to repeat this a few different times - sometimes it takes repetition to get through when a person doesn't want to hear the truth, and this truth is probably painful to your Crusher.

, People usually say this when they're not interested in a relationship with that person, but you'd probably be ""ready for a relationship"" if someone you were really interested in was interested in you! So, it's kind of a lie, and it can really hurt the other person because it leads him/her to believe time is all you need, and that if s/he bides his/her time, you could ultimately be won. Plus, there's a good chance your lie will be exposed if do you get in a relationship and this person finds out.

, For the same reasons as above: While most of us back down when we hear a crush has a sweetie already, some persistent people may decide to hold out for the break-up. And again, there's the risk of your admirer finding out s/he's been had when s/he sees you flirting up a storm at the singles bar.

, Most reasonable people will back off when they hear that a crush is taken, and so your work here is done. But some people make it a bit harder. If you've got one of those, then you want to make sure to drop your significant other into conversation as much as possible. For example, if the Crusher asks whether you've seen that new movie everyone's talking about, you could say ""I'm taking my girlfriend to see it next weekend"" or ""I haven't, but my boyfriend really loved it and we have similar tastes."" If s/he asks about your job, mention what your sweetie does for a living, too. This tells the Crusher that your relationship is on solid ground, so you're not likely to cheat or end it for him/her. Just make sure to keep things simple and positive. Any negative details will just cause the Crusher to start hoping for the break-up, even if it's something small or silly.

, When you discover that someone has a crush on you and the feeling is not mutual, you have the power to protect or destroy that person. It's generally better to protect people, so in the interest of being kind and decent, don't just stomp on him or her in front of others. If s/he says inappropriate things in front of others, such as, ""Wait till I get you alone!"" (even if this is said in jest), just laugh it off for the moment. When you find an appropriate moment, such as both finding yourselves heading toward the kitchen and arriving there alone together, waste no time. Say, ""Hey, listen, I didn't want to embarrass you out there, but I'm not comfortable with jokes of that kind."" When s/he replies, ""Come on, that was harmless..."" you should respond with, ""No, really. It's not okay with me. It implies that there's something going on between us other than friendship, and there isn't. I don't want to make you feel bad in front of others, please return that courtesy to me by not joking in that way.""

, If, despite your effort to be kind and discreet, s/he continues inappropriate remarks, touching, etc., even if in front of others, nip it in the bud, immediately. This falls under the heading of ""I care about you as much as you care about me."" If you have privately and respectfully asked him or her to refrain from these things and s/he ignores that request, then all is fair. You can simply correct him/her: ""Wait. That implies there's something going on between us, and there isn't. Just want to make that clear."" Look straight at that person when you say it. Keep your expression mild, but firm if possible. This lets everyone know you're not joking, and lets The Crusher know that you won't be supporting his/her fantasy, in public or in private. If you're at work or school, let the Crusher know you'll be going to your teacher or boss if the behavior doesn't stop (and then make good on your threat).

, When you go places where The Crusher is likely to be, don't go solo. Get a friend to come with you and run buffer. In other words, you can soften the impact of being in the same place at the same time by simply showing up with someone else. Your wingman can help you feel more comfortable, and that can keep you from making too much of the situation. It's not really your problem in the end - the problem is the other person's feelings, not yours.

, Sometimes, someone else's feelings for you can become too intense for that person to control, and s/he may do or say things impulsively which embarrass you, or which make you uncomfortable. If this becomes the case, and you find it too difficult to spend time with that person, as you are constantly aware of the underlying crush, then you may need to refrain from activities where The Crusher is likely to attend.

Particularly if you were the person who was dumped, you are under no obligation to explain yourself.Keep it short and sweet. Simply say, “I’m sorry, but I don’t actually want to be friends with you,” or, “No. Being friends isn’t going to work for me.”
Don’t make promises or offers for the future. Sure, you might end up being friends again at some point, but there’s no reason to promise that now. Don’t say anything like, “Let’s check back in in six months,” or, “I’ll let you know when I’m ready.” Statements like this keep you tied to the person and can prevent you from moving on.
If you were the person who initiated the breakup, you can say something like, “I know this is hard, but I don’t think trying to be friends would be good for either of us,” or, “I can understand wanting to be friends, but I can’t do that.”
If you're afraid that your ex might themselves or you, you can suggest resources that could help them. You may want to give them the number of a grief counselor or therapy center. You can say, ""I can't help you through this, but here are the numbers of professionals who can."" You can also alert their friends or family that they may need the extra support right now.;
, Sometimes, a relationship ends and you feel that you’ve gotten whatever kind of closure you need. However, in some situations, you may still feel that you have unanswered questions, or unresolved feelings. Having a final conversation can sometimes help clarify feelings, and make saying no to a friendship easier.With closure, you may find that you no longer feel the need for a friendship. That’s because you’re no longer using the promise of friendship as a way to get the answers you feel you need.
The other person may not be interested in a conversation. In this case, you may need to talk to a counselor or to close friends in order to process your feelings and move on.
Have the conversation in a place and time where you can have privacy and not be rushed. Exchanging thoughts and feelings via e-mail or letters can also be helpful.

, It’s likely not enough to simply say, “I don’t want to be friends.” You need to also be clear about what your new boundaries will be. This will vary depending on how intertwined your lives are.Remember that it’s okay to make strong demands. For example, you can say, “I don’t want you attending any party or event where you know I will be.” Your ex may not be willing to accept your terms, but you should begin the negotiation by at least being clear about what your ideal situation is.
If you live together, one of you should move out as soon as possible. Continuing to live together perpetuates unhealthy dynamics and prevents both of you from moving on. You don’t want to be friends with your ex, so why would you want to live with them?
If your ex is dependent on you financially, you may need to reach out to their friends or family and ask them to help support your ex right now. If you're able to, you may offer your ex a nominal sum of money to help them support themselves for a short period, provide care for your children, or pay for a temporary place to live. In marriages with prenuptial agreements, the details of an arrangement like this will have already been settled.

, If you have children or pets together, work together, or share a social circle, there will likely be times that contact is unavoidable. Make a clear plan that you can both agree to for how to handle those times.Take control of the situation by clearly stating your needs. Keep in mind though, that you may need to negotiate. For example, you may never want to see your ex again, but if you work together, you may need to say something like, “I understand that you need to keep working here, so we’ll have to interact occasionally. I can do that, but I won’t be engaging with you socially at work, and please don’t visit my department unless it’s unavoidable.”
If you have children together, you’ll need to establish boundaries around custody, holidays, milestones (such as graduations), and family gatherings. If you feel strongly averse to interacting with your ex at all, you may need to seek the help of a family counselor or lawyer.
Write down the guidelines you’ve both established so you have something to reference if there’s a misunderstanding later.

, This may be difficult, particularly if you still don’t feel closure, or if you’re deeply heartbroken. It’s natural to want to reach out or to find reasons to contact your ex. However, do your best to cut off all contact until you’ve had time to heal.It can help to delete their number from your phone. This can help prevent impulsive calling or texting.
If you feel the need to contact them, spend some time writing in a journal instead. You can write them an imaginary letter, or write out out how you’re feeling. This can help you process feelings without actually reaching out to them.
If you feel the urge to contact your ex, call a friend instead and tell them how you’re feeling.
Avoid going to places you know you might run into them. Stay away from the bars and coffee shops they frequent, even if it means changing your usual routine. Don’t walk home using the route that goes right by their house.

, Your ex may reach out to you, even if you’ve explicitly asked them not to. They may even send flirtatious messages or indicate that they’re still interested in you. Do not respond to this. It’s disrespectful of the boundaries you’ve established and to your healing process.Your ex may use flirtation as a way to manipulate you to reestablish contact. Unless they have explicitly said that they want try to get back together on terms that you could agree to, do not respond to their messages.
If you're afraid that your ex might stalk, harass, or threaten you, seek support from a domestic violence shelter. You also may want to contact law enforcement or file a restraining order.
Remember that “friends with benefits” has the word “friends” in it.

, Seeing their latest posts will only bring up old feelings and remind you of your ex’s existence. You may need to unfollow them, or even block them, if necessary.

Even if you think that seeing them on social media is no big deal, consider how you’ll feel if they begin posting photos of them with their new date.
Some people find it useful to get off of social media completely following a breakup. You may choose to do a “social media fast” for a week, a month, or more. This can help you focus on your own life and accomplishments without worrying about seeing pictures or mentions of your ex.

, Now that the relationship is over, you likely have more time to do things that you enjoy on your own or with friends. Get back to hobbies that you haven’t had time for recently. Call up a friend you haven’t seen in a while and do something fun together.Exercise, time outdoors, and time spent doing something you love are great ways to reconnect with yourself. It can feel lonely at first to spend time by yourself, but it’s important to get back to feeling good being on your own.
Spend time with loved ones and close friends. When we spend time with people who care about us, it helps us reconnect with who we are separate from a previous relationship.

, This might take a long time, depending on how long and how serious the relationship was. Make sure to wait until you’re really ready, but when you are, it’s good to take steps toward finding a new relationship that’s right for you.


Online dating apps can help you find other people who are looking for something similar. For example, if your last relationship was a long and serious one, you may just be looking for short-term, casual dating right now. Many apps can help you find others looking for that, too.
If your last relationship ended because you were looking for marriage and a family and your partner wasn’t ready, online apps can help you identify other people who are also looking for something serious.
Be honest with people you date about what you’re going through. You don’t need to burden them with too much information, but you can say something like, “I got out of a serious relationship fairly recently. I’m still doing some processing about that, but I’m also really excited to be dating again.”

"
Express that you are flattered but not interested.,
Pause for a beat before you say no.,
Say as little as possible.,
Fib skillfully.,
Use “I” statements.,
End the conversation gracefully.,
Keep the matter private.",How to Tell Someone You Don't Want to Date Them Without Hurting Them1," Whether you are interested in the person or not, being asked out is always a compliment. That person thinks you are worth risking possible rejection and embarrassment for, and although they could have chosen literally anyone in the world to be interested in, they picked you. It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there like that.


Smile and say thank you. Express gratitude that the other person thought of you in that way, but clearly state that although you appreciate it, you aren’t interested.For example, try saying something simple like, ""Thanks, I'm really flattered that you asked me out, but I'm not interested in you in that way."";
, If you are put on the spot, at least pause for a moment before verbally shutting the person down. This shows them that you actually considered their question – even if you didn’t. Saying “no” without a trace of hesitation can definitely hurt someone’s feelings., When it comes to turning someone down, less is usually more. Lengthy rejections and rambling explanations can open the conversation up to debate and misinterpretation.You don’t need to elaborate at length, so keep your rejection short and sweet.


The more you say, the more false it will feel to the other person, and the more it prolongs an already awkward conversation.

, If you’re going to make up an excuse, at least make sure to use something that is believable and doesn’t have a loophole. For instance, “I have a girlfriend/boyfriend” is much stronger than “I’m really busy this week” or “I’m just not ready to date right now.”, Instead of using language describing why you don’t want them, try putting the focus on yourself instead. Simple statements such as, “I don’t see you that way, I’m sorry” and “I really like you as a person, but I don’t feel a connection between us” are easier to digest than “You aren’t my type.""

, Both of you are probably feeling awkward and uncomfortable at this point, but try to end the conversation on a positive or lighthearted note.


If it seems appropriate, try using a little humor. At the very least, offer a sincere smile and excuse yourself.
Make a quick exit. Continuing the conversation or hanging around after the deed is done can be confusing and unpleasant for the other person.You might want to keep the conversation going in an effort to try to act normal and make the other person feel better about the rejection, but the kindest thing to do is end the encounter as soon as possible.

, There is no reason to discuss the matter at all with co-workers or at length with your friends. Be respectful of the other person’s feelings. Being rejected is difficult enough without having to navigate the additional problem of feeling ashamed about it in front of other people.

This is especially important if you have just received the diagnosis or are in the middle of treatment. While it's completely understandable that you'd want to continue living your normal life, clarifying your motivations is a great first step.

What made you decide to start dating now?
If you were dating someone before receiving your diagnosis, what makes you worry about telling them?
What concerns do you have about sharing your diagnosis?;
, If you belong to a support group for cancer survivors, ask them how they’ve coped with dating after their diagnosis. Ask them what their experiences have been like, how they’ve disclosed, and when they’ve disclosed. It can be helpful to get advice and feedback from others who have endured similar experiences.If you don’t belong to a support group, consider joining one or engaging in an online support group and posting the question. Many people are happy to share their experiences with you and encourage you.

, If you’re nervous to disclose your cancer to a date, practice your disclosure ahead of time with someone you trust.While you cannot control someone’s reaction, you can control how you deliver the news. Decide in advance what you’d like to say and how you want to say it.Creating a plan can help to calm your nerves and make you more comfortable in your words.


Keep it short and simple. It might be overwhelming for your date to get the full story of your cancer diagnosis, treatment, and care. Consider practicing a response no longer than a minute and a half. You can always go into more detail later.

, Having cancer can make you feel less confident than before your diagnosis and dating can be a daunting task. Remind yourself of your positive qualities and what traits you have to offer a potential partner. If you did hobbies before your diagnosis, go back to them or try new ones to start feeling like yourself again.Don't let the cancer define you. Focus on your talents, interests, and accomplishments outside of the cancer.
If you struggle in accepting your body image or have difficulty coping with the emotional impacts of cancer, consider seeing a mental health therapist. You can discuss your feelings, think more positively, and learn how to cope with stress more effectively.

, Think about what it might be like to receive news that a potential love interest has had cancer. If the person is anxious to get married, start a family, and grow old with a partner, they might feel threatened by the chance of relapse, potential problems with childbearing, or passing cancer on to a child. Remember that these may be valid concerns for someone, and they might respond with these fears.While you might feel hurt by their response, remember that everyone is entitled to their own feelings and desires for the future.
Knowing why you want to start dating now can help you discuss these fears and concerns with them.

, You may not want to disclose your cancer on the first or second date. After all, do you want to share personal information about yourself with someone you don’t know, don’t trust, and may not see again? Some say wait until the fourth date. By this point, you may be genuinely interested in seeing the person, yet not terribly disappointed if the person decides they cannot see a future with a cancer survivor.However, the choice is entirely up to you.


Some people tend to be more outspoken and may want to disclose earlier than others. You might feel like you’re keeping a secret, which can be uncomfortable.

, Some people want to be serious in their disclosure while others want to be more lighthearted about their cancer. You might want to talk about your experience or treatment or show your scars associated with surgeries. If that sounds too stuffy for you, you may want to approach cancer through humor. Whatever you choose, make sure you feel comfortable.You might want to have a specific date or time in mind to bring it up, or you might casually mention it in a text. Think about what works best for you.
For example, you can choose to bring it up on your next date, or bring it up out of the blue.

, When bringing up cancer with a date, think about what questions they may have and what you want to disclose. Some possible considerations may include the possibility of recurrence and any physical limitations you have. You may also want to talk about your feelings about dating or starting a relationship.You can say, “Cancer hasn’t been easy on me, and I’ve had one recurrence. I’ve been hesitant to date, but I’m feeling healthy now and feel like I’m ready to explore the possibility of love.”
Depending on where you are in your recovery, be aware of how they may be affected by your treatment. Prepare to discuss their concerns and what you'd expect from them.

, Cancer doesn’t typically just come up in normal conversation, so it’s likely you’ll need to bring it up. Before having the conversation, think about how you want to talk about it and how you will introduce it. Announce the conversation and talk about your feelings.For example, say, “I need to tell you something that’s difficult for me to talk about. I had cancer, and it felt like it was important for you to know this.”

, By now, you recognize that your cancer affects both you and those around you. Your date has a right to know the truth about your cancer and how it affects you. If your cancer is serious, don’t hide this fact. If your partner chooses to be in a relationship with you, they should know how your cancer may affect their life.For example, say, “I had cancer when I was a teenager. I’ve been lucky and have lived cancer-free for seven years now, but I thought you should know.”
You can also say, “I’m in remission from cancer right now, but I still have regular medical appointments.”

, Some people may be full of questions or ask you for lots of details. You should feel comfortable talking about cancer, and if you start to feel uncomfortable, think of a response to show your boundary. For example, you can say, “I’d rather not discuss the details right now” or, “I don’t want to get into the personal details of my health.”When you’re disclosing something about your health, remember that you’re in control of what you say and how much you want to tell.

, When you disclose your diagnosis, your date could worry that they'll be forced to take on the role of caretaker. While you want to acknowledge any caregiver activities that they may one day do, make sure that they know that you are wanting a relationship. Tell them how you will enhance their life, reassuring them that you are interested in a romantic partnership.

Say, ""I don't want you to take care of me. My doctors and family are already doing that. I'm interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with you.""
Explain, ""While I am tired a lot, I'm still an excellent cook and can play the guitar. All of my friends ask me to play for them, and I'd be happy to give you a private concert.""

, If you need to or want to talk about sex, now might be a good time. If cancer has affected you sexually, it’s best to talk about this before becoming sexually intimate with your date. Talking about sex is never easy and there’s never a perfect time to bring it up. Be honest and tell your partner any problems you have. Let them know what you enjoy, what feels good, and what would be best to avoid. Guide your partner to the most pleasurable positions and activities with the least amount of discomfort.You might want to have a few small conversations about sex instead of one big one.
Cancer can sometimes affect sexual functioning and desire. If you struggle with body confidence or sexual problems, consider seeing an expert such as a psychologist, urologist, or gynecologist to address these problems.

, Even if your date feels uncomfortable or does not take the news well, don’t give up hope. Frustration and rejection are common in dating whether you’ve had cancer or not. Remember that relationships are about finding caring compatibility with someone who shares values and interests with you, and this shouldn’t change just because you’ve had cancer.Remember that if you’re rejected, you’re not the first one to experience this. Keep trying.

Confront the issue.,
Give them a firm answer as soon as possible.Avoid waiting for “the right time” because there usually is no “right time."",
Avoid “ghosting."",
Respond to strangers and acquaintances via text.,
Respond to friends and co-workers in person.",How to Tell Someone You Don't Want to Date Them Without Hurting Them2," Rejecting someone is usually extremely awkward for both parties involved and it can be tempting to ignore the situation entirely. If you pretend it’s not happening it will magically go away, right? Unfortunately, allowing silence to be your answer and hoping the other person will eventually “get the hint” is both cruel and a poor strategy that often backfires., The longer you wait, the harder and more awkward the rejection will be for both of you.It can make it difficult for the other person to move on if they don’t receive a firm and clear “no” from you, so the kindest thing you can do is provide that to them.It may sting a little at first, but in the long run you’ll both be happier for it.

, Ghosting is a relatively new term to describe an age-old way of rejecting someone – by disappearing completely after an initial encounter, whether that’s one date or several.Rather than confronting the issue, the initiator permanently withdraws completely with no explanation – ever. Vanishing completely without ever addressing the issue is doing exactly what you are trying to avoid – hurting that person’s feelings.


In a 2012 study, researchers identified seven breakup strategies and then asked people to rate them from most to least ideal. “Ghosting” was overwhelmingly identified as the least ideal way to break it off with someone., Unless you’ve known this person for a long time or have already been dating them for several months, letting them down gently via text is not only acceptable but also preferable.


The blow of rejection is softened by the neutrality of a text and allows the person to nurse their momentarily bruised ego in private. There is no reason to make physical contact with someone you don’t know well just to turn them down.In some cases, such as when it comes to being approached online or by someone you work with that you rarely see and hardly know, even an email will suffice as a rejection.

, Anyone that you know personally or see every day, such as a friend or co-worker, deserves a face to face response. This will also make inevitable future encounters far less awkward.


Delivering the news in person allows the other person to see your facial expressions/body language and hear the tone of your voice."
"
Be firm and absolute.,
Speak kindly and directly.,
Don’t offer false hope.,
Move on.,
Avoid the friend-zone – unless you actually mean it.",How to Tell Someone You Don't Want to Date Them Without Hurting Them3," Avoid wavering and appearing indecisive, which can confuse the other person. If you're firm when you turn them down the first time, you probably won’t have to have the conversation twice.An ambiguous reaction from you could make the person feel like they still have a chance, which wastes their time and isn’t fair to them.
It also increases the likelihood that you’ll need to repeat this awkward conversation with them in the future.

, Approach them with a smile and keep your demeanor as calm and relaxed as possible. Use positive body language, such as sitting or standing up straight and looking the other person directly in the eye, to convey that you are serious.Negative body language, like slumping or not looking them in the eye, indicates a lack of confidence in your own words. , If you truly aren’t interested in dating this person, make that fact clear. Statements like “I’m too busy with work right now” or “I just got out of a long term relationship” may seem like kind responses, but to the other person this could sound more like, “Ask me again in a few weeks.”Avoid making it sound like there is a possibility for a future date, especially if you know there isn’t.

, Don’t continue to stay in contact with a person that you have zero plans to ever actually date. Sometimes it can feel good being around someone who you know really likes you, but unless you are serious about returning the sentiment, you are simply feeding your own ego by doing it.


Don’t re-initiate communication unless you’re really interested. It can be tempting to reach out to someone who you’ve turned down in the past, especially if you are going through a rough patch yourself.
Unless you are truly interested in the person, there is no need to call, text, or even be Facebook friends with them.
The infamous drunk dial (or text) is a common way people end up re-initiating contact. A momentary lapse of judgement on your end can cause a lot of confusion and despair for someone else. You’ll also be putting yourself in the position to have to reject them again.

, Do you really want to be friends, or are you just trying to spare the other person’s feelings by saying so? If it’s the latter, just don’t say it.If you truly do want to remain friends, give the person some space after you reject them.Give them a chance to get past their bruised ego and embarrassment.
It’s possible that the other person may not feel capable of being friends because of their romantic feelings for you. If that’s the case, you will have to respect that.

Recognize that it’s okay to say no.,
Stop feeling guilty.,
Trust your gut.,
Don’t apologize.",How to Tell Someone You Don't Want to Date Them Without Hurting Them4," No one enjoys hurting another person, but turning someone down doesn’t make you a jerk or a bad person. It’s completely normal and okay for you to say no. If you aren’t attracted to someone in that way, you can’t help that. Saying anything other than “no” is disrespectful to both of you., You aren’t obligated to please everyone, and you should never agree to date someone because you feel guilty. Respect your own feelings about the situation and don’t question yourself.


Expressing guilt openly can really confuse the other person. If you are giving them an honest answer, apologies aren't necessary.

, Maybe you aren’t even sure why you are turning the person down, you just have a bad feeling about it or them. Trust that feeling. If something feels weird or off, it probably is.

, It’s okay to say no and you have absolutely nothing to apologize for.You may even genuinely feel sorry, but expressing that out loud translates as pity and that you’ve somehow done something wrong by turning them down.

Don't become involved with men or women who you know are married.,

Hire a pro.",How to Tell if Your Date Is Married," This should be obvious, but there are all kinds of ways for married people to explain their situation. For example, a man may tell you that he's separated from his wife, or a woman may say that the divorce is almost final. Almost doesn't count. Inviting these people into your life is like inviting heartbreak-and possibly bodily injury.;
, If you have a feeling that something is wrong, don't ignore it. Where there is smoke, there is usually fire.

, OK, the wedding ring should clear up your doubts right away. Assuming the person is smart enough to take his or her ring off, though, there may still be a tan line on the ring finger. What about the pictures of that woman in his wallet or the photo of that man on her desk? Obvious clues should raise legitimate concerns, and you should ask about them and maybe do some investigating.

, If the person won't give you his or her phone number, but rather insists only on calling you, that should be a red light. The same can be said if they'll only give you their cell phone or work number. If your meetings always have to be prearranged and have strict time frames, that's another bad sign. When you go out, do you always have to go someplace far away (another town or neighborhood, for example), or does the person always want to stay in? That should set off an alarm. Have you ever seen his or her house, or does the person always want to go to your house? Do you even know where he or she lives? In a normal dating relationship, you shouldn't have these constraints, so if you do, there's probably something wrong.

, If your date's cell phone rings at the restaurant and he or she has to urgently flee your table to answer it, you may be tempted to wonder why. Give in to that temptation. It could be an important work call, but then again, it could be his or her spouse, and the latter possibility becomes increasingly plausible if it seems to happen time and time again. You also should think it strange if he or she sees someone and tries to avoid them.

, Usually these things come up in the course of conversation, but if you're suspicious, you may want to tactfully bring them up. If the person seems uncomfortable talking about such subjects, or if their body language indicates that they may be lying, your suspicions may be warranted.

, Consider this a red flag because they may be avoiding these areas so they aren't seen by anyone they know that could tell their spouse about what's going on.

, At some point, usually early, in a relationship, you should probably have occasion to meet some of the person's friends. If you don't, he or she may be hiding you from them. The same could be true if you meet one or two of the person's friends, but only those one or two every time.

, If you ask the person about something strange that's happening, make sure you believe what he or she says. If you have lingering doubts, it may be time to end the relationship or at least to do a little investigating. Telling lies isn't a big deal for someone who is cheating on his or her spouse, so don't be blinded by love into accepting whatever answer you're given.

, This assumes you know where the person lives, and it also assumes that you believe you have reason to be suspicious. Usually a visit to the house will quickly tell you if the person is married.

, A simple internet search for the person's name may turn up some interesting information, such as photos of him and his wife at a party or their names appearing together on a club's membership roster. If you want to get a little bit more involved, you can do a public records search and look for things like joint home ownership. A person's car can also provide you some clues. Does the registration in the glove box list two names, for example, or somebody else's name? Is their lipstick in your man's car?

, Relationships are built on trust, and it's hard to remain trustworthy yourself when you're hiring a private investigator, but if you really need answers it may be the way to go.

Check your body language to see if you mirror his actions when you're hanging out.",How to Tell if You Like a Guy1," The poets were right--when you see someone you like, your pulse will start racing and you might feel like your heart is about to jump out of your chest. Being near that certain someone causes an adrenaline rush, almost like you've been running sprints.A higher heart-rate might make someone you're not that into seem more attractive, too. If you think you're crushing on that guy in 5th period gym but you don't know why, it might be because the adrenaline rush and not the guy.;
, If you like him your tummy may get a fluttery, nervous feeling. You may even feel sick! That's because your body is releasing tons of hormones that shrink the blood vessels in your stomach. The lack of blood in your vessels can make you feel queasy., The same chemicals that get your heart racing will also throw your sweat glands into overdrive, even if you're in an air-conditioned room. Your palms and underarms especially will start to sweat. It might be a little embarrassing, but it's a sure sign you really like someone.Guys may have this problem even worse than girls, so if you notice him sweating around you or if he touches you and his palm is sweaty, don't be grossed out! It probably means he likes you.

, If your words come out as a squeak when you try to talk to him, or if every time you're chatting with your friends and he walks by your voice suddenly becomes super high-pitched, it might be a sign you're crushing., You don't do it consciously, but when you are attracted to someone, you will often copy what they're doing. So, when he touches his cheek, you touch your cheek; when he runs his hand through his hair, you do the same.Mirroring someone's actions can actually make you seem more attractive in their eyes. So don't worry too much about being a copy cat--it works in your favor!

The more you get to know them, the more you can tell if you see them as a friend or something more. Talking and doing fun activities with the person will reveal this more and more.


How do they act when things go right? Do they brag and enjoy winning at the expense of others, or do they appreciate other's efforts as well?
How do they respond when things go wrong? Do they shout-n-pout, or do they figure out how to make it right again?;
, What makes them stand out from the others? There are many physically attractive and smart people out there. But if you see something beyond looks and smarts that really catches your attention, you've marked this person as unique and probably like them.


The most attractive person might be thoroughly ugly on the inside, whereas a plain person in the crowd could have the personality that's most compatible with yours.

, If you find yourself thinking about this person several times a day, and they are happy thoughts and maybe your heart beats a little faster, then you are most definitely in like.

, When you like someone, you will find yourself laughing at things even if they aren't that funny. This is a natural attempt to make them feel appreciated.

, If you've had one conversation between you and this person who is stuck in your head and you can't stop telling people about it, this means it was important to you, and you probably like the person.

, If you've planned your walking speed to catch a glimpse of him or her as many times of the day as possible, there is a good reason for that. Could it be that you like them?

, Do you get butterflies when you see them? You know, that nice but funny feeling in your stomach? You probably like them already, because they make you feel good without even talking. Go ask them out!

, Think about how you feel if you touch him or her, by accident or on purpose, and if you're still thinking about brushing shoulders several hours ago in school, then that is a special thought and you probably like him or her.

, Do something you really like doing, like biking or snowboarding, and you are still thinking about him or her, you probably like him or her.

, If you feel you're ready for a relationship, and are confident enough for a positive response, then just go ahead and ask them out. If you're unsure of their feelings for you, ask! Be patient with their response, and always try to understand them from their point of view.

You have every right to choose when, where, how, and with whom that takes place.If you decide to have sex, determine and analyze your reasons. Make sure they don't include pleasing others while disregarding your own comfort with the decision.


Respect your needs and insist that others respect your needs too.
Having sex is a decision that you and your partner should make together.;
, No matter what your social group or media messages say, if you want to wait before having sex, trust those feelings. Knowing yourself gives you self-confidence and the ability to stand your ground against peer pressure. Although your peers will tell you that everyone is having sex, don't believe them. Your body belongs to you, not your peers, so the decision to have sex belongs to you, not your peers.


Some tips for countering peer pressure include spending time with friends who are like-minded when it comes to sex and always having a backup plan should you find yourself in a situation where you feel pressured., “Ready” isn’t just about the first time you have sex in your life, and it isn’t just about the first time with a particular person. It is always an active choice, and it's always your choice. Never forget that you can change your mind at any time. , Make sure you're ready. Be patient, and don’t put pressure on yourself. Having sex is a big decision, and rushing it without thinking it through or to only please someone else can cause regret afterward. Trust that having sex will happen in its own time. , Write down your reasons on a piece of paper and rehearse them ahead of time in front of a mirror, to your friends, or to yourself. Then when your partner asks, you'll have a ready answer. The following are some reasons you may want to include:


Preventing pregnancy.Possessing religious reasons.Going against personal beliefs.Ensuring legality.Preventing a STI (sexually transmitted infection).Needing more emotional connection.Wanting a committed relationship.Making sure each person is monogamous.Knowing that all partners are STI-free.Needing to build safety and trust.Feeling that it’s not the right time for you.Not wanting to have sex with someone., If your partner brings up a reason why you should have sex, have a response waiting for him. Your partner can sound convincing, so remember your reasons. Keep in mind that his reasons are a form of manipulation and need to be handled as such.


If he says, ""If you loved me, you would."" A good response to this would be ""If you loved me, you wouldn't want me to do something I'm not ready to do.""
If he says, ""Everyone else is doing it,"" you can say, ""I'm part of everybody, and I'm not having sex.""
Learn the common lines people use to try to get sex.Be prepared with statements you can make to counter them., Period. You have the final and only vote as to when you will have sex. Don't get defensive with your decision. You don’t need a good reason not to want to have sex just like you don’t need a good reason not to eat ice cream.

, That way your partner can clearly understand your boundaries and why you’re making your choice. If you're getting physically intimate and feel things are going too far, you may want to say, ""Things are going too fast. Let's slow down. I'm not ready for this.""


If you're together but not physically intimate, you can say, ""I really like being with you. See, we don't need to have sex for our time together to be special. I'm not ready for sex, and I like things just the way they are.""
If you're talking on the phone, you could say, ""I don't want to have sex now. I'm not ready. I don't need to have sex with you to show you that I care for you. Sex doesn't necessarily mean no to other kinds of intimacy. There are other ways to show you I care."", That way, he's not left guessing why you don’t want to have sex. Practicing good communication fosters intimacy and emotional safety.Be open and honest with your partner unless doing so would put you in danger. If you don't feel comfortable enough talking with him about sex, then that's a clear sign that you shouldn't be engaging in it.


Tell him what you do want as well as what you don't want. This helps him know the ways you want to be close to him.
Although you will have several reasons as to why you don't want to have sex, such as fear of pregnancy or not wanting to betray your moral and/or religious beliefs, don't underestimate simply saying, ""I'm not ready.""

, Listen to what he says because you'll understand him more, his feelings, and his motives. You may want to wait until after your conversation to think about what he says and does. You'll then have more time to process your own feelings about it.

, Someone who really respects you will also respect your boundaries about sex and as well as other preferences. However, if his responses are unacceptable, then consider rethinking the relationship and possibly leaving him. Sex is powerful, but it doesn't always bring emotional intimacy. The foundation of emotional intimacy is trust, respect, and good communication. If a person responds positively and respectfully to you saying what you want and don't want to do, then that’s a good sign. You're on the road to having a healthy relationship with that person.
On the other hand, if he is disrespectful, if he tries to manipulate you, or if he keeps pressuring you to have sex, then this is a sign that he's more interested in getting his own needs met than he is about engaging in a balanced, healthy relationship.
It's important to learn more about what to look for in a partner.It's also just as important to know what healthy relationships look like., Don’t let yourself be cornered, bullied, or manipulated. If you sense the person might violate your boundaries or harm you in any way, leave the situation and go to a safe place immediately. Trust your instinct. If you feel unsafe with your partner, then some tips are:


Only meet him in public.
Make sure you're not being followed.
Ask trusted friends or family to help.
Have a safety plan., A healthy relationship respects each other's boundaries. Your partner will listen to you without criticism, and he will support you. On the other hand, pressure to have sex can be one sign of an abusive relationship. Your partner may tell you what to do without consideration to your feelings. Read about the warning signs of abuse so that you can determine whether you're in an unsafe or abusive situation., Closeness comes from respect, and respect comes from honoring each other's boundaries whether or not we agree with them. Keep in mind that you always get to choose what you share with your partner. Only stay in relationships where your boundaries are respected, and make sure you’re in a relationship that always practices consentThere are many people out there who will also respect your needs and boundaries and with whom you can find intimacy. Those are the relationships worth having., If you’re worried that your partner might become angry, violent, or abusive, then you may want to consider breaking up over the phone or via email or a text. This may seem unfeeling, but it may be the only way in a potentially abusive situation. Your priority should be your safety. If you have to talk to him face to face, then make sure you're in a public place., There are lots of ways to be close to someone, and sex is only one of them. Sex can wait and be engaged in only when it's the right time for you. Celebrate your choice to wait, and enjoy those activities you do choose, knowing that it’s always your decision when to have sex.

Pay attention to their eyes.,
Notice extremes.,
Watch for differences.,
Don’t mistake other emotions for hatred.,
Notice how open they are with you.",How to Tell if Someone Hates You1," A lot of things that are considered too rude to be said are often communicated using eyes. In fact, some of our emotions are written in the size of our pupils, something humans can't control. If someone is frustrated by having to talk to you, you can often find out by watching their eyes.


Looking up and to the right is a sign of boredom.
Pupils dilate (get bigger) when a person is interested, and will often decrease in size when someone becomes bored.Avoiding eye contact probably means they’re hiding something from you, that they don’t trust you, or are scared of you.;
, Any extreme emotion can be a sign that something is wrong with your relationship. However, you should pay attention to extremes as compared to how this person usually behaves, not what you consider normal for yourself or your friends. Pay attention to:


Tension and stiffness, especially in the shoulders
Boredom and disinterest
Being over the top or melodramatic
The tone of their voice
How quickly or slowly they respond , People behave differently depending on how they feel about what they are saying or doing, and there are many subtle (and often subconscious) cues that can help differentiate how people feel about something they’re unwilling to discuss or will lie about. The basic idea of a polygraph test, also known as a lie detector, is in finding the tiny differences in how someone responds when they’re telling the truth as compared to when they’re lying.Even if you can't use a machine to monitor the differences in someone's behavior, some easy cues that can help you tell if they hate you are:


Anything that might suggest that they are lying or trying to mislead you. Look out for any sign of them trying to hide an emotion, as people often get emotional when they lie, and try to hide it.How this person communicates with you vs. how they communicate with other people.
How they act when you’re talking about something they need to pay attention to (for example work, if they are a co-worker) and when you bring up things that they don’t need to talk about with you.
How they act when you have something they want vs. how they act the rest of the time. For example, if you are a good student in school, are they nice to you when they want help and mean the rest of the time? If this is the case, they probably don't like you.
How they behave in different situations. If someone hates you, they will probably behave similarly towards you in most situations, unless there is another factor that forces them to pretend to like you. If they behave differently in different situations, perhaps there is another contributing factor, and their behavior has nothing to do with how they feel about you.

, It can sometimes be hard to tell the difference between things like jealousy, shyness, fear and hatred. Some things to consider when deciding this are:


Is the person quiet or shy in general?
Do you have a position or possession they might want and be jealous of?
Do you sometimes act pushy or demanding? Could they be scared of you or your reaction?

, While everyone is different regarding how much about their personal life they share in various circumstances, if someone regularly withholds information from you that has to do with what you are doing together, then there is probably some issue between you.It might not be hatred, and it might be as simple as forgetfulness on their part, but it is probably worth investigating why they aren’t being more forthright. Some things that should probably be shared are:


Anything regarding a project you are working on together
Information that clearly would help you do your job, or be happier
Messages that someone else asked them to pass on to you

Consider how much time you spend thinking about him.,
Spend some time apart and notice if you're counting the minutes to when you'll see him again.,
See how you react when he spends time with another girl.,
Notice if you idealize him as the perfect person.",How to Tell if You Like a Guy2," If you like a guy, he's always on your mind--you're constantly gazing at his Facebook, you're doodling his name on your homework, you might even be dreaming about him. When you're attracted to someone, your brain has lower levels of a hormone called serotonin, which is common in people with obsessive compulsive disorder. So it's no surprise that if you like a guy, you have trouble concentrating on anything else.When you've got a crush, your brain will also release oxytocin, which can make you extra forgetful. This makes it even harder to focus on homework, sports, friends--anything other than your crush!If you can't stop thinking about him, you may also find you can't stop talking about him. If your friends call you out on always finding a way to work his name into a conversation, it may be a sign you've got a crush.

, After spending time with a guy you like, you'll just want more--you suddenly can't wait to get to school every day, you change your path through the halls to pass his locker--anything just to get a little more time together. Being around him activates the reward center of your brain, and you may begin craving that experience over and over again.Though you might be craving time with him, don't let this feeling lead you to do things that might cross the line from cute to scary. Don't show up at his house uninvited or start playing hockey just because he's the goalie. Just know that if you are always excited to see him, it means you really like him.

, If you notice another girl flirting with him and your blood starts to boil--why is he talking to her? does he like her? did she just touch his arm?!--your feelings of jealousy may mean you like him. But if you only notice him when he's with someone else, then you may just be feeling competitive, and be more interested in winning than actually dating him.Take your jealousy as a sign that you like this guy and don't let it go any further. If you get in another girl's face for talking to him, it makes you seem possessive and insecure.

, When you're into a guy, everything he does starts to seem amazing. He's nice, funny, smart, handsome--there's nothing wrong with this guy! Experts call this the ""halo effect""--because to you, he's pretty much an angel. If you think he's cute, you're probably going to think everything else about him is great, too.If you laugh at all his jokes or think everything he says is genius, or you think he's an amazing guitar player (even though he only started playing last week), it's a sign you really like him.

"

Ask a trusted friend what they think.,
Back off if he's already taken.,
Think about whether or not you are really compatible.,
Trust your instincts and don't overthink it.",How to Tell if You Like a Guy3," Find that person you know will be real with you, and ask their opinion. Often when we're in crush-mode we can't get a good perspective on the situation. Your friend may be seeing something you don't, and could save you a lot of heartache, or she could give you the extra push you need to make a move and ask him out.

, Guys who are already in relationships are sometimes extra attractive to single girls. It may be because one girl has already given him her approval as boyfriend material, so you know he probably has good qualities.You may feel competitive with the other girl, or you may get a temporary self-esteem boost from stealing someone else's guy.
Let their relationship run its course and only pursue the guy when he's single.

, Does he spend all weekend in a dark room playing video games while you prefer to be out hiking and camping in your free time? Do you have similar values? Being different doesn't have to be a deal breaker--you may end up really complimenting each other and learning about things you never knew you liked.Consider if your differences can be worked through. If part of his personality is that he's a huge flirt and that makes you uncomfortable, it might lead to major problems down the road.

, Ultimately, it's up to you to figure out whether or not you like this guy--you know yourself better than anyone else. Don't make yourself crazy or miserable trying to figure it out.


When you feel something as intense as a crush, it can seem like the most important thing in the world. But remember there's more to life than this one guy--don't forget about your friends, your schoolwork, your family, or that there are tons of other guys out there!

You may need to plan when you’d like to talk about your infertility and how you want to bring it up. Your fertility is your personal information, so you may not want to share it with someone early on in dating. Yet, if you’re feeling like you and your partner may eventually have a long-term relationship, you might want to disclose sooner than later. It’s completely up to your discretion when you want to disclose.There’s never a “right” time to talk about difficult issues, especially fertility. Choose a time that you feel comfortable disclosing.;
, Don’t decide to bring up infertility issues in a loud, busy, or crowded setting. Choose a time when both of you are relaxed and not about to rush off to something else. You may want to choose a private setting so that you don’t feel embarrassed to show emotion.Don’t bring up your infertility around your date’s family members or friends. Make sure the two of you are alone and in private.

, If you’re nervous that you might jumble your words or chicken out of the discussion, practice what you might say ahead of time.Get together with a friend or family member who can help you rehearse what to say and how to say it. This can give you a boost in feeling more prepared to talk to your date.


You may wish to choose what type of vocabulary to use, for example, you may wish to say, “I am infertile” or, “It’s going to be very difficult for me to have a baby.”

, Don’t bring up your infertility when your date is distracted, in the middle of something, or in an altered state (such as after consuming alcohol). When you do bring it up, make sure you have their complete attention.It can be difficult and invalidating to bring up and discuss infertility if your date is distracted or more interested in something else.

, It’s totally normal to feel nervous or anxious when sharing deeply personal information with someone. Accept that you feel anxious and do something to relieve your nerves. If you start worrying about the person’s reaction, remind yourself that it’s not up to you how they respond. If you start to feel uneasy, do something to help ease your mind.Take some deep breaths until you begin to feel calmer.

, It’s up to you how you want to bring it up. You may want to casually bring it up or preface the conversation. Whatever you decide, take a moment to open the discussion. You may want to have something prepared ahead time, as opening lines for a fertility conversation may not come easily to you in the moment.For example, if your date brings up a story about their nephew, use the opportunity to continue talking about children. You might say, “I love seeing little children play and be cute. I really hope I can raise a family one day, even though it will be more difficult for me.”
You can also start the conversation cold by saying, “It’s hard for me to bring this up, but I hope you’ll be understanding. After getting cancer treatments, they left me with some medical problems, one of them being infertility.”

, It’s completely up to you how in-depths you want to go. To start, it may be best to keep it simple and to the point and allow the person to ask questions. For example, instead of giving a medical diagnosis, you may want to say, “I have some problems which affect my ability to have a baby.”Share only what you want to share. If your date asks you questions that make you feel uncomfortable, you are not obligated to answer them. Say, “I don’t feel comfortable responding to that.”
Be mindful about oversharing. Your date may not want a long, drawn-out narrative about your struggles, pain, heartbreak, and previous experiences.

, Most people who don’t deal with infertility likely have minimal information as to what infertility is, how it can affect you, and what it looks like in a relationship. For example, many people are surprised to find out that infertility affects one out of every eight couples.You may want to discuss options available for the type of infertility you have, or clearly explain that it is highly unlikely that you will ever have children.

, Be aware of what you are communicating through your body. For example, watch yourself if you’re crossing your arms or legs, looking down, avoiding eye contact, or facing away from your date. This can show that you are embarrassed, ashamed, uncomfortable, or avoidant. Try to appear open and available without closing out your partner. Pay attention to the nonverbal communication you are sending.Your body language may communicate that you are cut off from discussing this further with your date, which may abruptly end the discussion when they may actually want to ask questions or gain clarity on something.

, If you are infertile and do not want to have children, this may be an easier discussion for you. However, if you are infertile and you deeply desire to have a family, this can make the discussion much more difficult. Share with your date how your infertility affects you and how you feel. Use “I” statements and focus on how it affects you.For example, say, “Being infertile makes me quite sad because I’d really like to have a family one day.”
You can also say, “I’m infertile, but part of me is thankful because I’m not sure I’d ever be prepared to have a family of my own.”

, At some point or another, couples tend to bring up marriage and having a family. After you tell your date, talk about how your infertility may affect the relationship and what it means for you two moving forward. Your date may be supportive or they may want some time to digest and think about what you’ve told them. Be accepting of your date’s questions, concerns, and need to think.


You don’t need to decide the fate of your relationship in this moment.

, Some people are not interested in adopting, in-vitro fertilization (IVF), surrogates, or having children at all. If this is true of your date, don’t try to change their mind or convince them otherwise. Accept whatever thoughts, opinions, or beliefs they share with you and recognize that this may be a difference that you need to consider.If you know at some point you want to try to conceive or adopt, it’s best to know if your date is open to this.

, If you dread the conversation being too heavy or having too much attention drawn to yourself, end the conversation with something light, positive or funny. You might begin to feel depressed or sad about disclosing your infertility, so try to refocus the energy toward something more positive at the end.You may want to express gratitude for the person’s listening or understanding, or you may wish to make a joke or suggest getting dessert.

Avoid using ""You"" statements.,
Keep the lines of communication open.,
Pick your battles.,
Realize that it’s okay to have a different opinion.,
Attack the disagreement, not the person.,
Use compassionate words and tone of voice.,
Compromise.,
Evaluate the importance of the issue.,
Be aware of your core values.Being able to confidently and effectively assert yourself requires self-knowledge.,
Accept differences in background, culture, and experience.,
Practice using your voice beyond disagreements.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Disagree," When you disagree with someone, you may be quick to remark impulsively and offend the other person. Saying ""Yeah, I hate (Whatever you disagree on) because it's stupid and ugly"" is reason for the other person to get offended. It might be better to think hard about an intelligent reason that you disagree before sharing.;
, Don’t expect your boyfriend to read your mind if you disagree. Be upfront about how you feel by using direct language. Speak on behalf of your own thoughts and feeling without criticizing the other person or speaking on behalf of him.For example, “I feel hurt when you don’t ask my opinion before making an important decision. I think it would have been nice to talk about moving before you made the choice on your own.”

, ""You"" statements tend to cause the other person to become defensive since they seem to place the fault in someone outside yourself. Take ownership for your opinions by using ""I"" statements. Such statements minimize the possibility of your boyfriend feeling attacked or offended.You could say ""I feel blindsided by the fact that you're going to take the job and move to California. I'm worried about what that means for our relationship.""

, One way to get under another person’s skin is by disclaiming your opinion by opening with the words ""I disagree."" This tends to get a person riled up. Instead take the time to share what you do agree with before voicing a disagreement.For instance, if your boyfriend decided to take a job in another state, you might say “I’m thrilled that you were offered this job. It shows that you have highly marketable skills in your field. I’m concerned, however, about where our relationship stands if you move to a different state…”

, Just because you disagree with something your boyfriend said or did, it is not necessary to comment. Of course, being able to use your voice in your relationship is important, but you don’t have to use it for every single thing. Don’t sweat the small stuff.


If it’s a slight disagreement about something trivial, let it slide to maintain harmony in your relationship. However, if the issue matters to you or makes you feel uncomfortable in any way, speak up., Just because you like broccoli, doesn't mean everyone has to like it. And just because your boyfriend thinks it’s disgusting, it shouldn’t stop you from enjoying it as much as you’d like. Don't allow minor differences to create distance in your relationship. Opinions are just as unique as the individuals who hold them. They are neither wrong nor right.

, Disagreeing with your significant other is absolutely fine as long as the two of you are able to separate the disagreement from the individuals. Couples can be quick to start attacking one another when defenses are up during an argument. Resist the temptation to criticize the person.Let’s say your boyfriend forgot to call his mom for her birthday. It would be more helpful and less offensive if you said “Hey, babe, you need to work on keeping track of important dates. I know your mom must be hurt that you forgot her birthday.” rather than saying “You’re a terrible son. How could you forget your own mother’s birthday?”

, Your words can have a major impact on the course of an argument—whether it explodes out of control or ends on a lighter note. Take a few moments during an argument to collect yourself and cool off. Remind yourself to speak from a place of compassion and caring, not ridicule. This keeps the two of you striving for harmony and remembering that you’re on the same side.


Speak in a gentle, comforting voice using words that demonstrate kindness like “sweetie” or “babe.” Validate the other person by saying things like “I’m glad you’re willing to talk to me about this.”, Whenever possible, the goal for resolving any disagreement should be through compromise. Aim to solve the problem between you and your partner by searching for middle ground. How can you both leave the argument feeling relatively satisfied?


A common point of contention in relationships is choosing a place to eat. If your partner never has the opportunity to choose the restaurant, you could say ""How about you choose the restaurant tonight? I'll pick next time we go out."", Even the healthiest couples can find themselves arguing and forgetting the actual point of the disagreement. To avoid this, consider beforehand whether the issue being discussed is truly significant enough to get upset about.Ask yourselves whether the current topic will change the way you feel about each other? Will it matter in a year or two? If not, you can agree to drop it without allowing it to get too heated.
On the other hand, does the issue at hand require that you make a major sacrifice or compromise your personal values? If so, this may be an issue that requires a pause to let you calm down and come back to at a later date before reaching a decision.

, This is not referring to basic likes and dislikes—it goes deeper to include your needs, beliefs, ideas, and values. When you have knowledge of what’s most important to you, it becomes easier to identify on which issues you should use your voice and on which you can overlook.


Values are the traits that make you feel most happy and fulfilled in life. When you have them, you are satisfied. When they are missing, you may feel incomplete. Try to jot down a list of your personal values. You can also ask a friend or family member to describe you in a few words. If they know you well enough, chances are, they will probably use your values as descriptions.

, Both you and your boyfriend have different ideas about how life should be lived based on where each of you comes from. Practice acceptance by remembering that you are bound to disagree and that having these disagreements gives you the opportunity to enhance your bond.Try to view certain situations from your boyfriend’s point-of-view, considering how he may have come to a particular opinion from experience. Doing so can help you to address the problem or the behavior as opposed to attacking him personally.

, Communication is essential to a healthy relationship, which means that it is vital that you start learning to express yourself in everyday life.When you feel comfortable upholding your values and stating your opinions on a regular basis, you won’t see disagreements as such a big deal.

Don’t take things personally.,
Look for trends.,
Don’t confuse thoughtlessness for hatred.,
Pay attention to sources.,
Watch your own behavior.",How to Tell if Someone Hates You2," Keep an eye out, and see if this person is rude or seems bored with everyone they interact with. It might not be you at all, but just how they behave with everyone.

, If someone has only met you once, or doesn’t usually act like they don’t like you, it’s probably nothing. Everyone has bad days, and bad days can make people grumpy and act mean. In order to be sure someone hates you, you should pay attention to how they behave over the long run rather than focusing on one or two individual events.

, Especially if the person you’re thinking about isn’t someone who knows you well, they might not be aware that what they are doing or saying is very upsetting to you. Some people have a great deal of difficulty understanding social cues, and may not understand your negative reaction to their behavior. Similarly, many people’s mouths are sometimes ahead of their brains, and this causes them to often say things which they later regret. An indicator of either of these is that they say hurtful things to many people. This isn’t a sign of hatred for you, it’s a sign that they have a social difficulty.

, If you've heard that someone hates you from someone else, consider how accurate their information might be. Ask them why they think the person hates you, and consider the reliability of their reasons. If they are known for gossiping and spreading discord, consider whether they might be telling you this to provoke excitement or whether they are trying to make things easier for everyone.

, If the person you think hates you acts mean only when you do something specific, consider that it might be your behavior and not you that they hate. Some things that might irritate or anger people are:


Certain topics of conversation
Language or symbols they might find offensive
Humor that they might consider inappropriate
Requests that they do or change something
How you interact with others, especially their close friends or significant others
Level of physical intimacy – for example, many people hug everyone they know, and others reserve this for a select few. They may be uncomfortable with how often or little you touch them.

Ask questions.,
Try to see things from their point of view.,
Don’t get angry.,
Be aware of being victimized.,
Apologize, if you've done something to anger or upset someone.",How to Tell if Someone Hates You3," If you’ve noticed that someone acts annoyed or angry when you interact with them, try kindly and gently asking them what it is that you’re doing to upset them. Making it clear that you’re just asking them for information and not asking them to change how they’re behaving helps avoid a confrontation. If you don't want to confront them personally, a note or a voice message can give them time to think about how they want to respond rather than reacting instinctively, which might be to defend themselves rather than solve the problem. Remember that even if you ask perfectly, they might still lash out at you, and there’s nothing you can do about that. Some example questions are:


""You seem really down all the time, is there anything I can do to cheer you up/make things easier for you?”
""I feel like you treat me differently than everyone else around here, why is that?”
“I’ve noticed that you seem angry when _______, is there anything I can do to make your happier?”
""Have I done anything to irritate you? I feel like you're angry with me and I don't understand why.""

, Consider how you would react if someone treated you the way you treat them. Some possibilities to consider are:


Might they feel like you are giving them an unfair workload?
Do you express when you are annoyed with them more than you express it when you're happy?
Do you disagree with a lot of the things they say? Even if you try to hide your disagreement, they may still be picking up on the fact that you're hiding an emotion and not trust you.

, Yelling or being rude never makes a bad situation go away. Keep your cool, and try to come to a compromise that you can both live with. Remember that you can’t make the other person talk to you in a reasonable way, and if they aren’t willing to work out your disagreement, there’s not much you can do apart from avoid them.

, Some people who are unhappy take out their anger on people who might be totally unrelated to the source of their unhappiness. It can be very difficult to tell whether someone hates you or is using you to vent their frustration, but in either case, it can help to stand up for yourself, and not be an easy target. When you are put down, keep your tone of voice neutral and say something like:


""That's a really mean thing to say.""
""Why would you say that?""
""I'm sorry you don't like this dress, it happens to be my favorite."" (or get really serious with something like ""This was my mom's favorite dress. She died last year."")
""I'm sorry that's upsetting to you, I didn't mean to annoy you.""

, If you started the conflict, then they probably think it's your job to end it. Even if it was a long time ago, it's never too late to try to make up.

Notice how she flirts.,
See if she wants to be alone with him.,
See if she texts or calls him frequently.",How to Tell if a Girl Is Trying to Steal Your Boyfriend1," Just because she flirts with your boyfriend does not mean she’s trying to steal him. She might flirt with him to build up her own self-esteem or because she wants to be friends with him. Does she flirt with everyone, or just with your boyfriend specifically? If she generally comes off as flirty, it’s doubtful that your boyfriend is a special case. If she makes special effort to flirt with your boyfriend, she might have a crush on him.

Here are some flirty behaviors to watch for:

She puts her hand on his arm or touches him frequently.
She makes eye contact with him.She laughs at all of his jokes.
She moves her body so that she faces him.She initiates conversation with him.;
, If the girl wants to be alone with your boyfriend, it demonstrates that her flirting is not just for social power and self-esteem. Make note of when they spend time alone together.

Look out for the following things:

She invites him for outings where it will be just the two of them, such as the movies or lunch at a coffee shop.
She asks him to do her favors (such as change a lightbulb) where he would go somewhere alone with her.
She asks him to go on walks with her.
When he says he’s going to do something, such as get a glass of water in the next room, she invites herself and goes with him.

, Is your boyfriend secretive about his texts with her? Does she call or text him more than you would with a platonic friend? Although this communication does not mean that she wants to be more than friends, it can be a red flag.If you see your boyfriend texting someone frequently, ask him who it is. If he is dodgy or defensive about it, it might be her.
Going through your boyfriend’s texts might be an invasion of privacy. If he seems as though he is lying, have a conversation with him about trust.

Acknowledge your jealousy.,
Know that you don’t have to act on jealous feelings.,
Think about your own positive traits.Write down three things you like about yourself everyday.",How to Tell if a Girl Is Trying to Steal Your Boyfriend2," Naming your jealousy is the first step to overcoming it.Let yourself feel your jealous emotions for a little bit. Jealousy in small doses can be a positive thing for a relationship because it reminds you that you want to be in a monogamous relationship.However, do not let your jealousy consume you. Name it as jealousy and try to mentally separate it from the rest of your life.

, Jealous feelings are only feelings, after all. Understand that what you think and what occurs in reality may not be identical. Accept your jealous feelings as jealous feelings, but do not mistake them for what is actually happening.These jealous feelings are separate from your feelings for and your relationship with your boyfriend., For every time you give yourself a put down, give yourself a compliment, too. Improving your own self-esteem and focusing on your own positive qualities will remind you that you are an awesome person to date.

Make a list of what makes you uncomfortable.,
Wait a day.,
Talk to your boyfriend in a quiet, calm setting.,
Set boundaries for the relationship.,
Speak from the “I” perspective.,
End on a positive note.",How to Tell if a Girl Is Trying to Steal Your Boyfriend3," Think about what specifically makes you uneasy in this situation. Is it that you feel that your boyfriend is paying more attention to her than to you? Do you wish that your boyfriend would spend less time with his friends and more time with just you? Try to pinpoint what exactly makes you uncomfortable. Here are some examples of specific situations that might make you uneasy:


The girl touches your boyfriend in what you think is an inappropriate way.
On weekends, your boyfriend spends more time with her than he does with you.
Your boyfriend texts or calls her when you two are spending quality time together.
They flirt in front of you.

, Let your thoughts sit while your jealousy simmers down a little bit. Make sure that the issues you address in your list are really what is bothering you. Look again at your list the next day and revise it.

, Designate a time to have a conversation just the two of you. Don’t talk to him when you are initially upset. Instead, address the issue when you are both feeling calm and rational. Here are some ways to begin the conversation:


“I’ve been feeling that you’ve been spending more time with her than with me the past couple of weeks, and it’s been making me feel insecure.”
“I love that you’re happy with your friendship with her, but the way she interacts with you sometimes makes me uncomfortable.”
“I am happy with our relationship, but I think there are ways that I could feel more valued and respected.”

, Each couple has their own ""rule book"" — some couples would seeing going to the movies with another girl as highly inappropriate, whereas other couples would consider this and other intimate contact ok. Having an open conversation about what each partner expects is key to guiding acceptable behaviors. Be clear about your needs — your boyfriend may have no idea his friendship or flirtation with this other girl upsets you.Work on defining these expectations with your boyfriend. You might say something like, ""I don't want you to give up your friendships with other girls, but I would appreciate it if your focus is on me when we spend time together, and not on texting her.""
Don't set boundaries that are vague or manipulative. Something like, ""I want to spend more time with you"" isn't specific enough. Try saying, “I want to spend more time together just the two of us. Could we designate a date night?”
Let your boyfriend know what is and is not acceptable to you. If you are not comfortable with him giving another girl a back massage, let him know that feels disrespectful to your relationship.
Be open to listening to your boyfriend's perspective and his boundaries as well.

, Address the concerns you have about your boyfriend’s relationship with the other girl calmly. Do not accuse him of infidelity. Focus on constructive ways to improve your relationship. Use specific language to ask him to change certain things about the way he interacts with the girl. Here are some examples of what you could say:


“I feel really uncomfortable when you choose to go to the movies alone with her on Friday night. I would like to go with you or would prefer you go in a group with other people, too.”
“I feel hurt when we're spending time together and you spend that time texting with her and laughing at your inside jokes.”

, Finish your conversation by giving your boyfriend a compliment or by showing affection for him.

If you’re working through the problems in your relationship, that’s a positive thing! Here are some examples of good compliments:

""I really enjoy when we spend quality time together.""
""I feel that you really listen to me when I'm having a problem.""
""You make me feel happy and supported.""

Do new things together.Sharing experiences and making new memories together will strengthen the bond of your relationship.,
Designate “quality time” every week.,
Ask the right questions.",How to Tell if a Girl Is Trying to Steal Your Boyfriend4," Here are some things you could try together:


Take a Zumba class.
Make an elaborate dinner together.
Go away to a new place for the weekend.
Drive a couple hours to an especially beautiful hike.
Learn to surf.
Volunteer at an animal shelter.
Take a photography class.

, Designate a period of time (it doesn’t matter how long or short it is!) when you and your boyfriend promise to focus only on each other. Cook dinner together, watch a movie, or just talk about your day at school or work. Making time for one another is an important way of strengthening your relationship.

, Make your partner feel loved and respected. Effective communication is key to any good relationship. Here are a few questions you can ask that will create productive conversations for you and your partner:


""How can I help you?""
""What do you love about our relationship?""
""What 'little things' can I do to show you I love you?"""

Know your adversary.,
Gauge their game playing strategy.,
Match their dating style.,
Be coy .,
Stay detached.,
Titillate their senses.,
Challenge them in ways they aren't used to being challenged.,
Put the ball in their court.,
Surprise them.,
Take it all in stride.",How to Successfully Play Dating Games," It's important to go into a game well versed in the ways of your opponent. Dating history, likes, dislikes, or even just a basic knowledge of what they're like will help you gain the upper hand.;
, Because your initial objective is to become romantically involved with this lucky person, you want to make sure that your strategy is corresponding with theirs.

, If they are initially very open and forthcoming, then there is no cause for the hardcore style of dating games. Match their degree of openness. Being similar in this style will lead to more cooperative efforts. You'll know in this step of the game if this interest is something you want to continue to pursue.

, Again, ensuring that you are keeping pace with their dating style, flirt and encourage their attentions in whatever ways would be most effective for them. (More in tips.)

, This step may be hard to do, so at the very least pretend detachment. This step isn't meant to make you play hard to get. In fact, it allows you a little bit of room to make strategic moves that you otherwise couldn't if you let yourself fall too hard too fast.

, The trick to making someone like you is to convince them that when they're around you they're happier! So, when you get the chance to spend some time with them, use it wisely. Titillate each of their five senses to create that sense of happiness when you're around.

, By challenging them,you're accomplishing two extremely important points in a dating game. You are foremost arousing their passions by challenging them. They feel excited and worked up, which is good when you're wanting to play with their minds. You're also providing the segue way for the next step!

, Essential. Repeat. Essential. This can be accomplished by challenging them, speaking up about your feelings, or anything else that tells them that it's their turn to make the next move. What fun is a game of cards if you're the only one playing?

, Predictability is when the games end and when the winners are chosen, so when they begin to predict or corner you in a game, throw them a curve ball. This is not to say start listening to rock if you hate rock, but do something out of the norm for you. If you never call him until he calls you, make the first move. Spicing things up will ensure you the upper hand.

, Remember that in the end, these are just games people use to test the waters and get a feel for the other person. Things could be very different when a solid relationship is built, so it's important to continue to be yourself and honest throughout the whole game process. Just because you're playing doesn't mean you have to fake it.

Watch his eyes.,
Observe his posture.,
Notice any touching.,
Look for facial cues like blushing and smiling.,
Detect any instances of mirroring.",How to Tell if a Boy Loves You1," A boy who is interested in you will likely show it with his eyes. Some of the behavior cues may seem contradictory, but they are dependent on his personality.


A boy who is interested in you will likely try to make frequent eye contact.He will look into your eyes while you are speaking, and you may catch him looking at you from across the room.
A shy boy may avoid eye contact because he is nervous talking to you. If he seems to be awkwardly looking around like he’s not sure where to look, this may be a signal that he likes you. If he is simply looking at his phone or at someone else, he may not be interested.
Men’s pupils tend to dilate when they are aroused.If his pupils have dilated (the black part is larger than usual), then he may be interested in you.;
, Male humans, like many mammals, change their physical stature when they are trying to impress a female of the same species. He won’t have his arms or legs crossed. Crossed arms and legs are body language for “no, stay away!”
He may lean in towards you while talking to you.
He will likely stand straight and tall with square shoulders to seem taller and more impressive.He might even seem to be thrusting his pelvis out slightly. Alternately, some men subconsciously (or consciously) adjust their genitals when speaking with someone they are interested in., One of the surest signs of interest is if he finds reasons to touch you. If you are talking and he touches your arm or your hand, he is likely testing the waters to see how you will react to his touching you.


Encourage the touching by doing it back. Touch or squeeze his arm lightly and look straight into his eyes while you are talking to him. You should be able to tell from his response if he is interested.
Note that you should compare his touching with you to his normal behavior. If he seems to hug everyone who walks up to him, it may not mean anything if he hugs you.

, A boy who is interested in you will likely spend a lot of time smiling at you and laughing at your stories, even if they are not very funny.If a boy is shy, he will likely blush when you talk to him. Look for any redness on his cheeks or signs of sweaty palms (he may rub his palms on his clothing or fidget with his hands).He may be more likely to say something awkward or embarrassing and then blush if he is nervous. Try to make him feel comfortable.
Nervousness can be a sure sign of interest. Do your best to make him feel comfortable by being kind and encouraging him to talk to you.

, Men and women will both unintentionally mirror a person whom they are interested in.This means that they copy the person’s mannerisms in order to send the message that the two people are similar and thus compatible.


You can test this by doing something you don’t normally do, like putting your hand up to your mouth or stretching. See if he does the same thing.

Understand your shyness.,
Think about what the worst thing that could happen might be.,
Think positively.,
Spend a little time around this guy before spilling the beans on your feelings.,
Talk to this guy generally.,
Be wary of only getting to know this guy through his friends.,
Be his friend.,
Dress for the occasion.,
Psych yourself up.,
Choose a moment when is by himself.,
Get to the point.,
Wait for his response.,
Respond as required.",How to Tell a Guy You Like Him if You're Shy," In the case of being shy to ask someone out or to tell them you like them, it is usually the fear of rejection that underlies the shyness. And underlying that fear of rejection is your own insecurities about being good enough, about being likable. Many people have this deep-seated fear but it is important to face it and to tell yourself that you are worth it, that you are good enough and that you are likable. Do not turn rejection into an excuse to retreat further into yourself; everyone experiences rejection from time to time, and learning to bounce back from setbacks is an important part of building your resilience.;
, He might laugh at you and embarrass you. Is that likely though? And if that does happen, how does that make him look in the eyes of other people? A pretty unfeeling and uncool guy and his reputation would be sullied for such unkind behavior. The more likely ""bad"" thing that might happen is that he says thanks, but no thanks, politely but with no intention of returning your feelings. And that's just something you have to be prepared for, not be scared of, as you cannot make another person like you. Look at this way––if he rejects you, it's an answer too, just not the one you want. It is an answer that he's not the right guy for you at this point in time.


Practice your responses to a possible rejection so that you can remove yourself from the situation with grace. Just as you must visualize a good outcome, it is also important to be prepared for the one you didn't want. If you're ready to respond to either a positive or a negative response from this guy, you'll feel a lot more confident! Some responses to a negative outcome could include:

""Okay, thanks for letting me down gently. I wanted to share my feelings and I am glad I did so. Thanks for being understanding.""
""Yeah, no worries, I just thought I'd share how I felt, I understand totally this is out of the blue and that you don't feel the same way. Friends, eh?""
If he is actually nasty: ""I'm sorry you feel it's appropriate to insult me. I was being nice to you and paying you a compliment."" Then walk off with your dignity intact.



, Okay, so now you've addressed the possible worst case scenario and how it won't end the world for you. Presume the best from this point onward, as you need to put your best foot forward and pluck up the courage to let this guy know your feelings. Visualize the asking and the outcome in a positive way. Rehearse what you want to say to him, to be prepared rather than tongue-tied. You can do this in front of the mirror if you like.

, For starters, does he even know you exist? Get into his circle of friends or be near him in class, during leisure time, at social events, or wherever it is that you know him. Catch his gaze now and then and smile. Don't stare though! See how he responds––does he smile back, look away or just stare vacantly? Try to gauge his level of willingness to interact with you.


If he makes an effort to look back, to keep looking at you, to smile, etc., these are all great signs of possible interest.
You might find it helpful to read: How to hint to someone that you like them.

, There is no need to hang back and then suddenly tell him ""I like you"" without ever having talked before. That's a recipe for disaster, for both of you––he'd be surprised and you might find out he's a bit of a dull lad to talk to after all. Instead, get to know him a little, asking him simple questions such as what he likes, what he does on the weekend, what his hobby is and what sport he plays. If you already know some of these things, ask him questions specific to the hobby, sport, etc. Even when shy, you can ask open-ended questions and let him do all of the talking. If it helps, do this as part of a group, with your friends and his friends present, so that you don't feel singled out and as if the spotlight is on you all the time.


Jokes are good. They break the tension and help you to feel more at ease. Throw a few in when talking generally.

, They will each have different perspectives, which can be interesting and useful in a broad sense but aren't anywhere near as good as talking to the guy himself. Also, it'll start to raise suspicions among his friends if you do nothing but grill them about this guy and it's not a good look to have them tease him about ""this shy girl keeps asking about you"".

, If you can't be friendly around him, then the concept of liking him is a little weird. If he know you as a friend, and appreciates spending time around you, it'll really help things. You don't need to make enormous amounts of conversation or be by his side all the time; you do need to be friendly and upbeat when you are around him. In time, he may well see it coming that you're about to tell him you fancy him.

, Wear something comfortable that makes you feel absolutely fabulous. Clothing can give you an armor of confidence and every boost you give yourself counts! Take a look in the mirror to reassure yourself before you go to do the deed that you look as great as you can today.

, Tell yourself you're going to tell him. Decide on a specific day and time. For example, if there's a party on the weekend that you know he's going to be at, tell yourself, ""All right. I'm going to keep an eye out for him. If I see him, I'm going to wander over to him and bump into him, then I'm going to tell him.""

, No need to have his friends eavesdropping or stirring him about it. You certainly don't need the audience! He will also appreciate your tact and respect for his privacy.

, There is no need to drag it out and make it hard on both of you. Just stick to the script you've rehearsed already (see above) and tell him how you feel toward him. For example, it might go something like this:


You: ""Hey X, have you got a moment? There's something I'd like to say to you.""
X: ""Yeah, sure. What is it?""
You: ""Well, I've been enjoying spending time around you a lot lately. And I just wanted to let you know that I like you––a lot. I was hoping you might feel the same way."" Or, you could say ""I was hoping you might be interested in going to the movies/grab a bit to eat with me this weekend"", in place of the last sentence.

This is just one possible approach. What you say is up to you and there is help elsewhere on wikiHow for what you might say. For example, see: How to tell a guy you like him.



, Avoid babbling or apologizing or doing anything else distracting––keep those nerves under control. Remind yourself that you're prepared for any eventuality, either a yes, or a no. And that you have an answer for both!

, If you followed the suggested rehearsal above, you've already decided how to behave graciously if he doesn't feel the same way. If he does agree, it's usually pretty easy to show excitement and reply confidently with something such as ""Great! I am so happy! Let's make a date for next weekend then!"".


Whatever he says, keep yourself poised, confident and strong. Even if you feel crushed, act as if you're okay and walk away with dignity. This is a learning experience, not a reason to feel bad about yourself.

If you look back and notice her looking back to meet your eyes, she's likely interested in talking. If she completely avoids eye contact with you, she's probably not interested or is too busy or distracted to notice you.


If she's talking to another guy, back off, unless you're really feeling bold.
If she's with a group of girls, then your chances may be better if you go talk to her with a group of your own friends.;
, If she's looking at books, go look at books near her. If she's at the bar, go order a drink next to her. Find any excuse you can to casually bring yourself close to her. In some situations, though, this will be difficult (such as if she's absorbed in her laptop at a coffee shop, or talking with a friend). In that case, it's probably better not to interrupt her unless she seems obviously intrigued by you (i.e. she can't seem to stop looking at you).


Don't wait too long to talk to her. If she sees you looking at her and approaching, then let her see that you're a man of action, smile, and walk up to her.

, Keep it casual, as if you already know each other, but not too casual because you don't want to scare her off. You can start with a simple observation and end it with a question: ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""This place sure is packed, huh?"" What you say isn't important. You don't really need an answer to the question; you are simply inviting her to talk with you. If she responds pleasantly, continue the conversation. If she doesn't respond or seems preoccupied or disinterested, she probably isn't interested, so start talking to someone else.


Don't worry about saying the perfect thing at first. You just have to get the conversation started and can wow her later. Don't go for a pick up line or something that just doesn't sound like you.

, Don't come in with “canned material”, “nuclear attraction” routines, or other social robotics. The best way to make a connection with someone is to come from the heart and live fully in the moment. What you say isn’t nearly as important as how you say it. Socializing is about exchanging energy, not being a wordsmith. When in doubt, just say “Hi”., Since you just met, you shouldn't tell her she has the world's most beautiful eyes or that she has incredibly sexy legs. This will freak her out for sure. Instead, compliment her sweater, a piece of unusual jewelry that she's wearing, or even her laugh. You can maybe go as far as saying she has nice hair, but don't get much more personal than that, or it'll be too obvious that you're interested. Say something that you mean and which makes her genuinely feel appreciated.


Just one compliment during the first conversation is enough. You don't want her to feel like you're trying too hard.

, If things are a little awkward, at first, you can look around and use your environment to guide you. If you're in a bar, say something simple like, ""Do you come here a lot?"" or ""Have you tried the mango mojito? It's ridiculous."" If there's a poster advertising a concert that's coming to town, you can ask her if she likes the band. If she's wearing a Cal hoodie, you can ask her if she went to Berkeley, because your sister did.


You shouldn't look around too much or the girl will feel ignored, but if you're nervous about what to say next, the environment can be a great help.

, There's nothing small about small talk, so don't skip it. Small talk is the stuff that can help you transition into the big topics, and you can't just go from ""How are you?"" to ""What do you think is the meaning of life?"" So, start off by talking about what you did over the weekend, the weather, your friends, your work, or whatever you think will keep the girl interested. Keep the banter going back and forth and see if you can make her laugh. Don't be too nervous about boring her; you're just getting the conversation going.


Make her feel comfortable about talking to you about the light topics, and soon, she'll be ready to open up a bit more.

, If this small talk goes well, share a little information about yourself--just something small like what you do for a living or how you liked the show you just saw, for example. At some point, of course, you'll want to introduce yourself and, hopefully, get her name. The key to sharing information is that you both gradually open up. Take turns talking, and each time she gives you some information about herself, give similar information about yourself, and maybe give slightly more personal information than she gave.


For example, if you're talking to a girl who says she's taking summer classes, you might disclose that you are also taking summer classes, and then tell her which class you are most excited about. This invites her to disclose more information about herself so that the intimacy of the conversation increases over time.
You don't want to share too much about yourself too quickly, and you shouldn't try to get her to do so either.

, Laugh at her jokes, listen to her stories, and don't get distracted by what's going on around you. It's more important to seem interested than to seem interesting, and you don't want to hog the conversation. Being a good listener is far more important to successful conversation than being witty.


Put away your phone (until you ask for her number). This is not the time to check in with your friends -- unless you want her to feel unwanted.

, If you want the woman to like talking to you, then you have to show that you actually care about her as a person instead of just thinking of her as someone you can pick up. Without getting too personal, you should ask her some questions, either about her life, her ideas, or just about some general topics like her favorite sports team or what she likes to do with her free time. Here are some things you can ask about:


Her family
Pets
Her favorite movies, books, albums
Her friends
Her hobbies
Her job

, Show her you think she's a worthy, intelligent being and that you actually care about what she thinks -- beyond whether or not she'll say ""yes"" if you ask her out. You can joke around and ask what she thinks of your new outfit or haircut, or be more serious and ask her about what she thought about a movie that just came out, or about her favorite music or even her opinion on a local situation.


Just remember not to pick any topics that are too political or touchy. You may find yourself in the middle of a political or religious war, when all you were trying to do was flirt! Think twice before you ask a question that could upset the woman or get her fired up.

, Though opposites do attract, if you find something in common with the woman, you're more likely to maintain a great conversation. You shouldn't fire away with questions about her five hundred favorite things to see if any of them line up with hers, but rather keep it subtle and see if you notice her mentioning something that you both have in common and try to bring it back up when the time is right. You can talk about your favorite sports teams, your careers, your travels to Mexico, or something else that you can go on about for hours.


When you ask her a question, keep it open ended. Don't say, ""Do you love the Lakers as much as I do?"" Instead, say, ""What's your favorite sports team?"" so that you can find something to talk about even if she doesn't like the Lakers.
Pay attention. Maybe she mentions studying abroad in Spain back in college in passing during the conversation, and later, when things get a little slow, you can say, ""So you mentioned you spent some time in Spain. I actually worked in Barcelona for a year. Where did you live?""

, You said you were talking to a woman, not a girl, right? If so, then you have to show her that you're independent, intelligent, and comfortable with yourself. Don't complain about work, get incredibly drunk, talk trash about people you both may know, or genuinely conduct yourself in a way that makes you look like a teenager. You can still be goofy and fun, but make it clear that you're a man who knows what he wants, not a boy who is desperately scrambling.

, You may be so busy trying to impress the girl and pulling out all of the bells and whistles that you haven't let the girl get a word in edgewise. In general, try to keep the conversation going 50/50 or 60/40 if one of you is particularly talkative. If you're doing somewhere around 80-90% of the talking, though, there's not much of a chance the girl is enjoying herself unless you're really entertaining or are telling her the world's most amazing story. So, be self-aware. Take note of how much you're talking, don't interrupt her, and don't be so afraid of silence that you can't pause for a minute to let her gather her thoughts.


If you want her to feel like you two really connected, then you have to let her share her ideas, too, even if it takes a little prodding.

, Yes, flirting is a part of keeping the woman interested. You don't have to go overboard with it. Give her a coy smile. Tease her a little bit (as long as you know she won't take it the wrong way). Show her that you don't take yourself too seriously and that you can take a joke. Be playful. Lean a little bit closer to her if you like where the conversation is going and even give her a playful tap if you think she'd like it. Flirting goes both ways, so if it's not going well, you'll know pretty quickly.

, Though you won't know if the woman likes you until you try, you can try to read the signs to see how she's feeling before you get in too deep. If she's looking into your eyes, laughing a lot, and not looking around for her friends to save her or backing away when you come closer, then she may be interested. If she answers your questions by just saying ""yes"" or ""no"" and looks uncomfortable or even unhappy, then she may just be too nice to let you go.


Read her body language. Does she lean her body toward you, or away? If she leans in to talk to you, then this may be a sign that she wants to get closer.
Remember that every woman is different. She may like you but she could be really shy, and you may be reading the signals wrong as a result.

, This will be a way to hint at your romantic intentions. If you don't make it clear from the start that you're romantically interested in a woman, then you risk falling into the friend zone. It's not that hard to touch someone while still remaining respectful. If you're both about to go somewhere, hold out your elbow as an invitation for her to hook her arm around yours, or press with your hand on her back, just above her waist, towards the door (or corridor), while saying ""after you"".


Or, be bold and lightly place your hand over hers for just a second. If she's interested, she might seem a little surprised, but she'll still be receptive. If she's not interested, then she'll seem uncomfortable and will pull away.

, For most people, this is the hard part, because you have to actually make your intentions known, and in doing so you risk rejection. Be brave. Tell her you'd like to see her again, and just ask for her phone number or, if it feels right, try to set up a date for some future time. If she isn't interested, don't sweat it. There will always be another woman to talk to.


Don't put a lot of pressure on her when you ask. Just say something like, ""I've had a great time talking to you and would love to pick this up over drinks or dinner some time. Can I have your phone number?"" You don't have to use the word ""date"" or say, ""I really like you"" or something that makes it all a little too clear.

Compare the boy’s tone and mannerisms with you and others.,
Assess his enthusiasm about your interests.,
Check his clothing and grooming habits.,
Notice obvious flirting.",How to Tell if a Boy Loves You2," The key to identifying whether a boy is flirting with you is to notice differences between the way he talks to you and the way he talks to other people.


Some boys try to make their voices sound deeper and more manly when talking to a crush.
Sometimes boys will whisper or speak very quietly with someone they’re interested in.This may make you get closer to hear him, or it can sent the signal that you have a secret bond.

, If he seems overly interested in everything that you do or say, he is probably interested in you, not your interests per sec.Few people have exactly the same hobbies and passions, but everyone looks for commonality when starting a potential new relationship.


Be sure that you reciprocate and ask him about his interests as well. Showing enthusiasm for things that he likes will send the signal that you are also interested. It will also make you seem less self-involved if you encourage him to share as well.

, If he knows that he is going to see you, he may pay special attention to preparing his appearance. Notice if he seems to be dressed up or if he has styled his hair more carefully than usual.It would be nice to compliment him on his appearance if he appears to have put forth a little extra effort.
A boy who is willing to make himself look nice for you is probably a better potential boyfriend than one who seems unwilling to make effort to impress you.

, Things like cheesy pick-up lines or winking are traditional signs of obvious flirtation, and guys who don’t have any other ideas about how to flirt will default to these."
"
Have a meaningful conversation.,
Go on a chaste date.,
Make it through a difficult situation together.,
Be upfront about your feelings and see how he responds.,
Talk about the future.,
Spend time with his family.",How to Tell if a Boy Loves You3," You should be able to talk about a wide range of matters with someone in a loving relationship.Be sure you can have an actual 2-way conversation with a guy.


This can be everything from your hopes and dreams to your past relationships to your favorite celebrities.
If he doesn’t contribute to a conversation or seems not to care about your opinions, he either does not have reciprocal feelings or isn’t a good catch.

, Particularly if you have a physical relationship, try going on a date or having some time together that does not include physicality. Having fun together in a way that does not involve romance or passion is essential to a healthy relationship and can distinguish between a guy who is interested in you and one who is interested in just your body.

, This is obviously not something you can manufacture, but if one of you goes through something that is emotionally difficult, you can often gauge the depth of a man’s feelings for you.


Be open with your feelings about the event as well as your partner.
Communicate about your emotional needs and his, but remember that boys are often hesitant to share their emotions. This doesn’t mean that he is not interested in you.

, If you are in love with him and you want to know if he feels similarly, tell him how you feel.


If you tell him you love him, be aware that he may not say it back immediately. This does not mean that your relationship is over; he just may need some time to process the idea.
Watch his body language when you tell him how you feel. If he immediately seems physically uncomfortable, he may not share the same feelings.
If he does not respond and seems to feel indifferent, then he may not truly care about you.

, Talking about the future serves dual purposes. First, it can be a way to evaluate whether you have common goals and values, which signals long-term compatibility.Second, it can expose the feelings of someone who is only interested in a short romance.


Begin by talking about your individual goals and thoughts about the future.
Eventually ask if he can imagine a future together with you in it.
Know that goals and visions for the future can change a lot, especially when you are young. Reassessing those ideas periodically is a good idea.

, If a boy invites you to spend time with his family, he probably loves you.It’s unlikely that he would introduce his family to a girl he isn’t interested in. Getting to know his family can also tell you a lot about where he comes from and the type of environment he is likely to perpetuate.


Reciprocate and invite him to spend time with your family as well.
Even if his parents (or yours) do or say something embarrassing, it will give you something to laugh about later.
Boys are often very close with their moms. If you can impress his mom and she likes you, the boy will likely be proud to bring you home.
Be kind about his family. Sometimes people are embarrassed about their family situation and you can alienate them by making fun of their family, even if you do it as a joke.

Write a love letter.,
Tell her you want to help her relax.,
Try an old standby.,
Choose a more personalized gift.,
Make her a mix CD.,
Plan an outing.,
Make a photo or memory album.,
Look for little ways to surprise her.,
Host a gathering.,
Get together travel information for a vacation.",How to Surprise Your Girlfriend1," As convenient as e-mail and text messaging is, hand-written love letters are far more sentimental. Letters are often more romantic and thoughtful. If you feel awkward saying these words out loud, your girlfriend will appreciate hearing them on paper.


If you wear a certain type of cologne, add a spritz to the paper before you mail the letter.
Try placing the letter in her lunch bag or slipping it into her locker.;
, Plan out an entire day meant to comfort and pamper her. Prepare her meals, do her chores, and offer to give her a massage. You can schedule this day on a weekend, or you can make it a weekday.


This type of surprise works best if you and your girlfriend live together, but there are still ways to pamper her if you do not live together. For example, you could offer to buy her a cup of tea (if she likes tea) after school or give her a shoulder rub after her workout.

, Boxes of chocolates, toy animals, jewelry, roses, or a bouquet of her favorite flowers are classic romantic gifts. However, don’t buy something at random – pick something she will like.


For example, if her favorite flowers are yellow roses, then give her yellow roses. If she is a big fan of peanut butter cups, then surprise her with a package of peanut butter cups. If she really likes giraffes, then give her a stuffed giraffe.

, Get her a book by her favorite author, her favorite band’s latest album, or tickets to a play she is dying to see. These gifts show your girlfriend that you understand her well enough to know what she likes. They also show that you put more thought into your gift than settling on a typical romantic token.

, This is an especially nice gift if your girlfriend has a commute that lets her listen to music or if she likes to listen to music while she is exercising. Burn a CD with songs that mean something to your relationship or songs that remind you of her. A third option is simply picking songs that you know she enjoys.


If you think she might like an extra personal touch, then you can even include a personal message to her at the beginning of the CD.

, Do something she enjoys, even if it is not something that you like to do. For example, you could take your girlfriend out for a full day of shopping. If shopping is not something she enjoys, take her to a play or concert she would love, or try a museum, zoo, or botanical garden. Try to make whatever you do something that often comes up for discussion, but you never follow through with.


For example, if you have been meaning to see a new movie, check both of your schedules to find day that would work for both of you. Tell her you have cleared your schedule, and want to see the exhibit if she has time that day. If you were correct about her availability, she should be excited that you made enough time for the outing., An album filled to the brim with memories of you and her together is sure to surprise your girlfriend. The simplest route is to give her a simple photo album filled with pictures that span the length of your relationship. For something a little more in depth, you can make a memory album that includes both photographs and notes about your thoughts and feelings toward her.


You can make this more of a scrapbooking exercise by adding, for example, ticket stubs and food labels that have sentimental meaning.

, Even small gestures will show your girlfriend that you care about her. Watch for little opportunities throughout the day to surprise your girlfriend. For example, you could:Charge her cell phone when she is not looking. If your girlfriend sometimes forgets to charge her phone, then charging it for her can be a nice surprise. Just plug it in before you leave her house or before you start watching a movie.

Give her a compliment. Compliments are always a welcome surprise. Try to give your girlfriend complements when she least expects them. For example, you could tell her she looks beautiful first thing in the morning or tell her she is brilliant after she describes the book she just finished reading.

Leave her a note in an unexpected place. Something as simple as “You’re the best!” or “Have a great day!” will put a smile on her face. Try putting the note in her planner or somewhere else that she is sure to find it.

, Don't throw a surprise party unless you're sure your girlfriend will enjoy it. This can be a great way to surprise her on her birthday or graduation day, but only if she enjoys being the center of attention. If she can be shy, anxious, or introverted, choose a more intimate way to show affection.


Remember to invite her friends and family, not just your own.

, If there has always been somewhere you have wanted to visit, within reason, do some research. Get some brochures and figure out the costs of the trip. Find a way you can afford it and show your girlfriend that you think you can finally go on that dream vacation. Make sure it is a place both of you want to go, not just yourself."
"
Be the chef.,
Surprise her with lunch.,
Take her on a nice dinner date.,
Share a box of chocolates.",How to Surprise Your Girlfriend2," Few gestures are quite as romantic as the home-cooked meal, especially if she is usually the one who does the cooking. If you are confident about your cooking abilities, try making your girlfriend a gourmet meal. If not, make something simple like grilled cheese or ramen noodles. You can make breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The meal does not need to be anything fancy, but make sure that it is something she will enjoy.


If you are nervous about cooking a meal on your own, surprise her by bringing up the idea of cooking a meal together. The two of you can spend some fun time together, and the gesture will still be romantic.
Clean the table, use matching dinnerware, and light candles. This will show that you aren’t just getting the nightly meal out of the way, but that it is a special occasion.
If you have roommates or live with your parents, find an evening when they’ll be gone for at least an hour or two to make this date all about you and her.

, Show up at her workplace or meet her at her locker with a meal from her favorite café or fast food restaurant. Homemade sandwiches, wraps, or salads also work great. If showing up at her job is not an option, you could pack a picnic lunch on a random weekend and take her out to eat at a park.


Make sure to pay attention to her schedule. If she normally has lunches free, but has something going on during lunch every day this week, then you might need to wait.

, The restaurant can be a new place with good reviews, or it can be an old favorite that the two of you visit less than you used to. Moreover, if you choose a new restaurant, pick one that your girlfriend has expressed an interest in or that at least serves a type of food your girlfriend enjoys.

, If you don’t feel the need for a grand romantic gesture, sharing a simple box of chocolates is nice. Go to a chocolatier and pick out a box together. Keep them on your kitchen table and enjoy them over the next week. Discussing your favorite flavors and sharing samples are fun bonding activities.

Consider your romantic history.,
Think about why you've been dating.",How to Take a Break from Dating1," Do you find you've been attaching yourself to short, meaningless relationships, only to find yourself heartbroken afterwards? This is a good indication that you need to take yourself out of the loop for a while. Taking a break can give you a set of new eyes when you get back into the game to really find a partner you want to be with.;
, You may need to reevaluate your priorities: were you dating to please others, or really to please yourself? Once you have figured out the root of the problem, you'll know what you need to do while on your single stint.

Discover a new hobby.,

Establish better friendships.,
Spend some time with yourself.",How to Take a Break from Dating2," Finding new things you love to do can open you up to other people when you are ready to start dating again, and can provide stress relief and calmness to your busy life.

, Tell yourself that you will stay single for, say, 6 months before you get back in the game. Now, being single doesn't mean you can't have fun -- you can still flirt and have a good time, just don't get yourself into a long-term commitment if you aren't ready.


If you find someone who really makes you happy and you think you are ready to start dating after a little while, that's totally okay! You wouldn't want to miss out on a great opportunity if you feel you are ready for it.

, When you're constantly dating, it can be hard to focus on your platonic friends if you are so caught up in your partner. Making new friendships and rekindling old ones can help you figure out the type of people you like to hang out with and the things you like to do when you are with them.

, If the goal of taking a break from dating is to get to know yourself better, spending some time alone can help you figure out who you are and what you want out of all areas of your life, not just your romantic partner.

Ask her out and see if she gives you an open-ended ""no"".,
Contact her and see how long it takes for her to respond.,
Watch if she shows you your competition.,
Look for physical signs of flirting.,
Listen carefully to the way she speaks to you.,
Watch how she acts around you versus how she acts around others.,
Play hard to get too.,
Back off and give her space.",How to Tell if a Girl Is Playing Hard to Get," This technique keeps you chasing that bit of hope she offers you. She might say she's not available, but is free on another day. She might say ""no"" but tell you about an interesting place she wants to see. Or she might not commit to a date, telling you to wait and see.A rejection or flat out, definitive, ""no"" means she's not interested. She won't be offering you a rain check or be in contact with you again.
Learn to give her space and when to stop. If you ask her out too many times or too often, you will become less attractive and look desperate.;
, If it always takes her awhile to respond to your calls or texts, even just to say ""hi"", then she’s probably playing hard to get. And when she does respond, she might make up an excuse about how incredibly busy she was. She'll say she was at a party or hanging out with someone. She's showing you that she's a busy girl and is not entirely dependent on spending time with you.


Her delayed responses should happen consistently and almost strategically. If she doesn't respond to you for days or makes up a weird excuse, it probably means she's not interested enough to respond back in time.
Some girls just don't respond to texts or calls right away. Don't overanalyze this or get upset with her. If she's showing signs of being interested in you, take a breath and understand that people are often busy or forgetful.

, A girl playing hard to get, will want to look hard to get. It's her way of showing you she has many options to choose from and could be taken by someone else at any moment.


She might bring along some good-looking friends to a party to make you jealous.
She'll tease you about people who have tried to hit on her, but failed. It may seem like she's ridiculing them, but she's really pointing out to you how attractive she is.
If she talks about the people she's dating with you, then she's probably not interested and might just see you as a friend. Don't treat this as a failure but rather as the start of a blossoming friendship. However, not everyone can stay friends with someone they're interested in, so know when it's time to count your losses and find someone else.

, Even if a girl is playing hard to get, it still means she's interested in you. And if she is, she'll be sending out subtle signs that she likes you. It can be hard to tell if a girl is flirting, so carefully observe her body language for these common signs of flirting:She's constantly touching you. She might touch your shoulder or arms while talking to you. Maybe she'll lean in close and rest her body against yours. There'll be many excuses or reasons why both of you are always touching.
She smiles at you a lot. She might catch your eye across the room and give you a sweet, unsolicited smile.
She draws attention to her body. She might bite her lip, fix her hair, or cross and uncross her legs. She may be doing these things unconsciously or purposely, but all these subtle moves draw your attention to a specific part of her body.
She gives you special hugs. If she's not a hugger, then it's easy to tell when she's giving a hug reserved especially for you. It's an excuse to get closer to you and an affectionate expression. Even if you're not sure it's a special hug, be happy you're receiving such a nice gesture from her.

, An interested girl will attempt to give you subtle suggestions through her speech. So it’s important to learn to read between the lines. A simple “hello” could have seductive intentions if you listen closely enough to the way she says it.


She laughs at your dumb jokes. You might tell the same joke to your friends and get a nice laugh or two, but when she hears it, it's hilarious. She wants you to feel like the star of the show, but don't get this mixed up with awkward laughter.
She compliments you a lot. According to her, you're really funny, kind, and have nice hair. However, some girls might do the complete opposite and insult you. This is an age-old flirting technique used by almost everyone. It lowers the self-esteem of the target and oddly makes the insulter seem much more attractive.. But don't mistake this for a girl who is truly disinterested in you. A few light-hearted insults does not harm, but if she's giving consistently hurtful insults, then it probably means she doesn't like you.

, She might change drastically around you. Whether she becomes nervous or extremely aloof or flirtatious, a change in behaviour often signifies that she feels differently about you.


You can usually tell what her normal behaviour is like when she's around her friends. If you can, observe her behaviour without her knowing that you're in the room. Watch if she changes once she notices you. She might straighten up, become quiet and serious, or be very happy to see you.
Watch how her friends react around you. If they're whispering, giggling, or sneaking glances at you, it's likely you were the subject of their conversation and they're checking you out.
Don't assume a change in behaviour means she's into you. She could be playing hard to get, or is just genuinely not interested.

, If you're still not sure, take a turn at the game. It works even better if you know she's playing hard to get or is actually interested in you.Flirt with her sparingly. Keep her guessing if you're really interested in her. It's fun for both of you and keeps things fresh and entertaining.
Stay mysterious. Drop hints about yourself to keep her curious about who you are. You'll look intriguing and more attractive.
Some girls, even if they're the ones playing hard to get, might not appreciate this approach. After all, the point of playing hard to get is to force the person you're interested in to work harder for you - not less. Instead, play by her rules and show her just how much you'll do to win her affection.

, Ultimately, you should let her decide how to let you know whether or not she likes you. The worst thing you can do is become obsessed with wanting to be with her. This can lead to incidents of harassment on your part.



No means no. If she rejects your advances or tells you to stop contacting her, respect her wishes and stop.
Don't ask her out constantly or demand her attention all the time.
Don't stalk her or her friends to find information.

Or perhaps your partner has always sworn, and you've simply dealt with it as best you could. Whatever your situation might be, it's important to talk to your partner about his bad habit as early as possible. If you wait, you'll only grow resentful.


Some researchers refer to a partner's bad habits in a relationship as ""social allergies"" - the habits are a minor annoyance at first, but over time they can lead to annoyance, resentment, and even disgust.If your partner's language is a significant problem to you, or if you believe it may become more of a problem for you in the future, you owe it to have an honest and straightforward discussion with your partner.
As with any bad habit, the sooner you address it, the better it will be for you and your relationship.;
, Your partner may have learned to swear from his family, friends, or even coworkers. Many people are exposed to vulgar language socially, and those individuals probably do not see their swearing as anything offensive or hurtful. Your partner's swearing may upset you, but it's important to remember that he loves you and does not necessarily engage in this habit to hurt or upset you.


Let your partner know that you love him, and that you do not resent him for who he is. At the same time, though, you need to be upfront and communicate to him in no uncertain terms that his behavior upsets you.Don't discount your partner's feelings or lapse into judgmental behavior, as this may alienate your partner and create further tension.Use ""I"" statements to convey that your partner's behavior upsets you. ""You"" statements tend to communicate anger, accusation, or frustration, whereas ""I"" statements address the way you feel about the behavior.Instead of saying ""Your language is awful and you're unpleasant to be around,"" say something less hurtful and less absolute, such as ""I love you and I'm not trying to judge you, but your language is a problem for me.""

, It's not enough to point out problematic behavior. You need to go a step further and let your partner know what you'd like him to do instead. Giving criticism without guidance or direction towards whatever you'd prefer as an alternative may make your partner get defensive or feel like he's being picked on.Have an honest, back-and-forth dialogue about what you'd like your partner to do instead, and ask for his honest feedback.
Agree to a progression. Work on curbing casual swearing first, as some language patterns (like swearing while in pain, for example) may be more difficult for your partner to break.After casual swearing has been eliminated, work on your partner's swearing when he's upset.
The last step, and potentially the most difficult, will be to eliminate reactive swearing (like swearing in response to an injury or shock).

, Don't be upset if your partner is willing to stop swearing in front of you but wants to keep swearing when he's with friends or family members. Remember that swearing may be a social ""language"" for your partner, and expecting him to change how he interacts with friends, coworkers, or relatives may be exceedingly difficult.


Talk to your partner about his limits, and convey your own expectations and concerns.
Dialogue is important through this entire process. If you and your partner are not equally communicating what you want and what you are willing to compromise on, it can quickly lead to arguments and feelings of resentment.

, Your partner's behavior isn't going to change overnight, and it would be unreasonable to expect such a radical transformation. However, you should have a frank conversation with your partner about how you will measure his relative success in the effort to stop swearing. Talk to your partner about your expectations and his to determine how you will mark his progress and the eventual accomplishment of the goal, and remember to make S.M.A.R.T. goals (specific, achievable, results-focused, and time-bound).Set incremental goals. Don't expect change to happen overnight, but don't give your partner a never-ending timeframe or he won't be motivated to make any progress.
Ask your partner what he thinks would be a reasonable timeframe, and try to focus on negotiations instead of demands.

, If your partner is willing to work on controlling his language in some form or another, try to meet him halfway. Find out what would make him happy or motivate him on a day-to-day basis, and try to help keep him on track by being his supporter rather than his critic.Ask your partner what he likes and what would help keep him motivated. He may have some kind of minor indulgence, like getting takeout from a favorite restaurant or going out with friends after work, which could help keep him motivated and on some kind of progress schedule.

, One way to reduce swearing is to provide your partner with alternative words to use. You can come up with words together, even making up nonsensical words that will help replace your partner's vulgar language.Even as you work to control your partner's swearing, his need for expressive words will not diminish. Coming up with euphemisms or nonsensical words can be a fun and humorous bonding exercise.

, A swear jar is a great way to create low-stakes ""consequences"" for swearing without actually punishing your partner. Every time your partner swears, ask him to put a dollar in the swear jar. Let the money build up while you help your partner try to achieve his goals, and at the end (only once he's met whatever goals you've set together) you can use that money for a fun night out together.A swear jar may seem like a ""punishment,"" but it can actually act as a sort of motivation over time.
As more money accumulates, your partner will realize that that money won't be spent on a fun date night until he stops swearing, which may give him the push he needs.

, Your partner may need gentle reminders whenever he slips up and swears, but sometimes your words or a discontent expression on your face aren't enough. The best way to help your partner break his bad habit is to help him find ways to increase his own awareness of what he says, and work together to make him more aware of his words.Ask your partner to wear a rubber band around his wrist. Any time he slips up and swears, tap your wrist to remind him to snap the rubber band.
Use a dry erase board to tally up the swear words used each week. Any time he swears, ask him to write down the word he said. This can help your partner track his progress and see if his swearing is improving.

, Every bad habit has a trigger. Just as a smoker might have an extra cigarette after a stressful day at work, your partner may indulge in swearing when he's upset, scared, stressed out, or frustrated. One important way to help support your partner is to learn what tends to set off his swearing, and help him become aware of it too.Don't address swearing during a moment of anger or frustration, as this may cause your partner to get angry with you or to escalate his anger at the situation at hand.
Help your partner through moments of crisis, wait until he's calm, and then talk to him (gently) about how certain situations seem to set him off. He may not even be aware of it himself., Some people may think that getting angry or punishing a person will help curb that person's undesired behavior. But getting angry or punishing your partner will only make him frustrated, and it could cause him to feel hopeless and even resentful.


Instead of focusing on ""punishment"" (like withholding things your partner likes), focus on celebrating his accomplishments, no matter how small or minor they may seem to you.Remember that progress is slow and often marked by a series of minor victories and setbacks. Be patient and help your partner the best you can.

, Any time your partner avoids swearing in a heated moment or goes a duration of time without swearing, praise him and celebrate that accomplishment. It will make him feel good, and it may give him motivation to keep at it.


Don't just offer a big reward once the goal has been met. You should have a goal for the end in mind, but offer little goals along the way to help your partner feel your support., It bears repeating that no bad habit is going to change overnight. If your partner has grown up with vulgar language, breaking that habit may take months or even years. The best thing for both of you (and for your relationship) in the meantime is to remain patient with your partner.


Work to develop patience by changing your own mindset. Don't see your partner's slip ups as an indication of failure or a lack of effort on your part or his.Recognize that your partner is trying, and continue to offer him support. Celebrate his accomplishments, no matter how small.
Remember that change takes time and patience. Your partner needs your support during times of change and struggle more than ever.

, The emotions you experience may help guide you to what the real issue is. Here are some examples of how identifying what you are feeling can lead you to a deeper issue.Do you find you are comparing yourself to her exes? You might be feeling inadequate of down about yourself. Consider your self-esteem and whether it could use a boost!
Are you worried that your girlfriend will ""go back"" to her ex? You might be feeling anxious. Consider the trust between you both and see if you could address any issues.
Do you get upset or angry when you hear about their relationship or things they have done together? You might be feeling jealous. Consider how secure you feel in your relationship and maybe talk about any insecurities you are feeling.

, Chances are, even if you have not talked about it yet, she knows there is something bothering you. Consider how you might be making yourself and your girlfriend feel.

Know you are not alone.,
Express your feelings about the situation.,
Bring it out in the open by talking about it.,
Find a solution.",How to Stop Thinking About Your Girlfriend's Past Relationships3," This is a common issue in relationships causing anxiety and something your girlfriend may be struggling with as well.Even if your relationship is otherwise going well, this can occur.Know that bringing it out into the open, while difficult, will be ultimately better for your relationship than keeping it hidden.

, Work on making sure you are not suppressing how you feel.

You want to be able to feel totally comfortable and confident with your girl.


By suppressing or ignoring your emotions you are risking they will come back up at a later time. By not opening up to your girlfriend and working through the problem you will just be shutting her out creating more potential issues between you two.

, If you have determined that the patterns, focus, and behavior are being caused by you, you may find that you'd like to bring it up to your girlfriend. Bringing it up will give you the chance to let her know what you have been thinking about, and how you feel. Try to be open minded and consider what your girlfriend has to say about the issue.


Mention how you feel and what's bothering you. “Hey, I've been overthinking something lately and it's really been bothering me, can we talk about it?”
Talk to her about anything in your past history that may be contributing to your reaction to these issues.“This may be bothering me because in the past I...”
See what her opinion is. “What do you think?”
Ask her to help. ”I'm feeling like I might need some more love and support to move past this. It would really help me if...”

, If you discover that the overthinking is due to your girlfriend bringing up the topic, it's time to talk. Let her know how you feel when she mentions her ex and give her a chance to explain. Take the conversation slowly, step by step and work towards coming to an agreement about how you can both change or how you can work on it to move forward.Open up the topic. “I've noticed something and it would really help me if we could talk about it so I can understand it better.”
Acknowledge that you understand what she has said, by repeating it back to her and stating, “okay, I understand.”
Advocate for yourself and how you feel. “When you bring up your ex or your past relationships, it makes me feel...”
Figure out a compromise. “What can we do, so that we can move forward?”

Whether you had a promising first date or a flirtatious encounter, it's normal to feel a sense of excitement. However, if you have a tendency to fall too fast, you may let that elation take over. Try to make sure you allow yourself to focus on day-to-day tasks instead of getting wrapped up in love fantasies.Try to occupy your mind with other things if you find yourself thinking about the guy too much. You can try reading a book or watching a movie.
Ask your friends for help. Ask them to be honest and tell you when you're talking too much about your new love interest. Tell them you're trying to avoid losing yourself in a new relationships again, and request they let you know when you're going overboard.;
, If you have a habit of falling in love too fast, you may start neglecting your schedule. Instead of making plans with friends, you may wait for the new guy to call. Instead of keeping up with hobbies, you may spend time daydreaming about this new man. If you want to avoid falling too fast, you have to work on maintaining your sense of self. Many people who fall too fast have a habit of losing themselves in a romance early on. Make sure to stick to your schedule and do the things you need and want to do., The early parts of a relationship are often poorly defined and confusing. Try to accept this. If you're the type to fall too fast for guys, you may push for a label after only a few dates. This can lead to premature feelings of love and attachment.You may be anxious about the relationship progressing to love or a serious romance. This may mean you want to push to seal the relationship by making this official. Resist this temptation. Instead, try to enjoy the early moments of getting to know someone.
Wait until the topic arises naturally to try and seal the romance. For example, you may invite the guy to an event with your friends after a few weeks of dating. You can ask something like, ""Should I call you my boyfriend?""

, If you're falling for someone fast, find ways to distract yourself as this can prevent the feeling from becoming overwhelming. Some studies indicate you feel more creative when in love, so working on a creative project like writing can help distract yourself. If you're not the creative type, take up a hobby. You could start running, for example, or join a cooking class., Remember you are your own person. Many people who fall in love fast also have a hobby of losing themselves in a relationship.You may sacrifice your own needs and wants to always be readily available for a guy you barely know. For example, you may skip a friend's birthday in hopes the guy will call. You may neglect to finish a book you were invested in because you've spent too much time pouring over his Facebook page.
Avoid doing things like this. Keep up with your obligations, interest, and hobbies. See where the relationship goes if you're interested, but do not neglect yourself to do so.

, If you tend to fall in love fast, your expectations may be skewed. You may want premature intimacy and commitment, which can result in you losing yourself in relationships with virtual strangers.Do you think you would be happy for the rest of your life if you found true love? Do you obsess over movies, music, and TV shows that deal with romance? Do you hold your own personal experiences to ideals you get from television?
What do you expect from a romantic partner? Do you expect another person to make you feel happy, fulfilled, and lovable? Do you think you cannot find happiness unless you're in a romantic relationship?

, Love, like other things, can be addicting. People who are love addicts tend to fall in love fast. They try to fill a sense of emptiness in themselves with various romantic relationships. Review the symptoms of love addiction and see if any ring true for you and your experiences.Do you tend to go from one relationship to another? Do you have trouble staying single for long? Do you take time to heal when a relationship ends, or simply move on to the next thing?
Have you ever had to talk yourself into falling for someone? Have you ever dated because you wanted to feel loved?
Have you ever changed many aspects of yourself for a relationship? Do you find your style, tastes, and opinions change from one person to the next?

, Many people who fall in love fast do so due to childhood issues. Oftentimes, people fall in love fast because they like the comfort of commitment. Was your child tumultuous? Were your parents not particularly present? Did one parent abandon or leave you? If so, this may make you prone to falling in love too fast., People who fall in love too fast tend to have the same types of relationships over time. You may continually find yourself playing a certain role. For example, you may always be the follower. You may have a tendency to fall for people with big personalities and defer to their decisions. Do your relationships tend to follow similar dysfunctional patterns? If this is the case, you may have a love addiction. You may not be falling for people genuinely. You may be falling for people because you need to feel in love., If you feel that your tendency to fall to fast is a problem, the first step is awareness. Try to remind yourself that you have certain issues that make you fall for people fast. Remind yourself that is not necessarily love, and that you need to adjust expectations.


Keep your history in mind when falling for someone new. Draw similarities between your current love interest and past romances. You likely felt some of the same early excitement, and yet those relationships did not work out. Try to take it slow this time around.
Remind yourself that love and intimacy take time. You cannot force love prematurely, and you'll have a healthier and happier relationship if you let love happen on its own.

, If you believe you have a love addiction, talk to a therapist. A qualified therapist can help you sort out your issues with love addiction. He or she can help you figure out proactive ways to cope with falling in love too fast or too often.


You can find a therapist by asking your regular doctor for a referral. You can also ask your insurance for a list of in network providers.
If you're a college student, you may be entitled to free counseling from your university.

, If you feel like you have a love addiction, a dating break may help. You can try to stop dating and seeking romance for about 6 months. Refrain from set ups, online dating sites, or going out to bars or parties looking for guys. If you're seeing a therapist, ask your therapist for advice on how to go about taking a dating break., Oftentimes, people crave romance to cope with anxiety over being abandoned or forgotten. It can help to surround yourself with supportive friends. Some of the intimacy you're seeking through love can easily be found in friendship. Instead of looking for a new boyfriend, strengthen your existing bonds.

Release expectations.,
Give it time.,
Try to find unique qualities in the new person.,
Change up your “type.” Odds are, if you are comparing new dates to your ex that you are actually searching for that person in a new suitor.",How to Stop Comparing Dates to Your Ex1," One of the reasons you might keep comparing new dates to your ex is because you’re worried about committing to them. Although a long-term, healthy relationship may be your ultimate goal, you might be missing out on opportunities because of this pressure. Just date for the sake of dating without questioning where it might go., Are you immediately judging new dates without really giving them a chance? In some situations, it may take several dates to discover attractive qualities or quirks about a new person that you don’t see at first. Set a timeframe before you start pre-judging new dates.

Let’s say you give them a three-date minimum before deciding if they are worth continuing to see. That way, you don’t cross anyone off your list because they don’t come off as perfect on the first date.

, Challenge yourself to dig a little deeper and search for traits this person has that are appealing to you (that have nothing to do with your ex). You may be conditioned to immediately start tearing down a person, noticing all of their flaws. Instead, check off all the things you do like. You may find that these qualities outweigh those you don’t.Purposefully look for qualities that you like in this person. For example, maybe a new date has an adorable laugh, gets really passionate when talking about animals, and has a great sense of style.

, Switch it up a bit and go on a few dates with people who are drastically different from your ex. This will help you see that you may have gotten stuck in a type. It may also help you to see that many dates can offer promising traits without being like your ex.For example, if your ex was a serious business professional, it may be nice to date someone who is more relaxed and fun in their work, such as an artist or video game developer. Or, your ex may spend their free time screening films indoors, so you date a new person who mostly enjoys outdoor activities.

"
"
Get rid of things that make you remember the relationship.,
Write a letter to the ex.,
Stop ruminating.,
Take a break from dating.",How to Stop Comparing Dates to Your Ex2," It’s no wonder you’re holding on to the past—memories of your ex are all around you. If you’re still holding on to mementos, looking at old photographs, or visiting their favorite restaurant with the hope of an “accidental” meeting, you need to stop. The only way you can move on is by putting this person in your past.Go through any mementos to decide if you really need to keep these items. Box up those you can’t bear to give away and donate or trash the rest.
Stop going to places hoping to bump into your ex.

, Maybe you can’t stop comparing because you haven’t quite cleared this person from your conscience. You can “let go” by writing them a letter to say all the things you never got around to saying. Don’t mail the letter, though. Read it aloud and then rip it to shreds., If your thoughts sound like a non-stop reel of “woulda, shoulda, coulda” you may be stuck in the past. It’s impossible to move on and really fall for a new person if you’re still examining everything that went wrong in a previous relationship.Slide a rubber band onto your wrist and snap it each time you catch yourself dwelling on the past relationship.
You can also try distracting yourself with another activity like reading, watching a TV show, or calling a friend.
Another way to reduce the amount of time you spend ruminating is by scheduling sessions to do this. Dedicate 15 minutes to thinking about the ex. Then, in a few days, reduce the window to 10 minutes. Then, five.

, Although this may be hard to hear, you may be falling prey to comparisons because it’s too soon for you to start dating again. Make sure the emotional wounds of the previous relationship are completely healed before starting up something new. That way, you’ll be able to begin a new relationship with objectivity and you’ll be much less likely to fall for an unhealthy partner."

Recall the ex’s faults.,
Think about incompatibilities in the relationship.,
Relive the breakup.",How to Stop Comparing Dates to Your Ex3," Your memory may have softened some the negative characteristics of your ex. For instance, they aren’t around constantly leaving the toilet seat up or forgetting to let the dog out. Without them there to remind you of their less-than-perfect habits, you may have started to idealize everything about them.Put your ex back on a realistic playing field by bringing to mind some of their faults. Make a list of these faults and keep it handy to review whenever you find yourself comparing.

, Chances are, if your old relationship ended, there were some issues you and this other person didn't quite click. Maybe you had different ideas about spending money or perhaps they had no intention of ever getting married.

Remind yourself of these key incompatibilities if you notice yourself glorifying the old relationship.

, Once the initial breakup passes, you may have repressed this part of the relationship and are only remembering the good times. Freshen your memory by recalling what happened that caused this relationship to end.

Did the other person cheat? Maybe they dumped you at a special event or on a special occasion like your birthday. Or, they may have even left a note or sent a text message to tell you the relationship was over.

Close speed dating sessions appropriately.",How to Speed Date," Look at it as a fun, pressure-free event. Keep an open mind about who you will meet and be prepared that you may or may not find someone you like. There is no pressure and if this round of speed dates doesn't work for you, you can always try again.;
, Research your options by doing a Google search for speed dating and your location. See what events are available and contact the organizer if you have any questions. Select an event that is for your age range and keep in mind that some are for specific themes or groups of people. Find one where you are likely to have things in common with the people there.For example, there are some events for young professionals and others for older retired singles. Choose the event that is appropriate for you.
You will likely need to register ahead of time. You can register on the website for the event or over the phone. You will pay in advance and it will likely cost around $40., It is important that you make the most of the few minutes you have in front of your matches. Practice what you want to say and how you want to say it. You will need to prepare an introduction and basic biographical information that you wish to share so that your dates can get to know you.For your introduction, consider how you want to first present yourself to other speed daters. You could say something like, “Hi! My name is Mary. I’m a 31 year old single mom. I work in microbiology and in my free time I love to hike.”
For your biographical information, you should have an idea of what you most want to say about yourself. Create a short biography that sums up what you feel are the qualities you want to communicate. You could make a list of important things to share, such as your hobbies (“I love to ski”), interests (“I enjoy foreign films”), personality traits (“I’m very outgoing and love to socialize”), values (“I’m a vegan who is an advocate for all animals”), and what you’re looking for (“I’m looking to settle down and start a family”).
Make sure to practice speaking clearly and to smile often. You could practice in a mirror to see how you appear.
Keep it light and positive. Don’t discuss your negative feelings about your job or your strained relationship with your ex.

, Have a list of questions in your mind that you can ask your matches. Think about what you are most interested in finding out when assessing a potential partner and then formulate a set of questions that are tailored to getting that information. You may opt to have a sense of humor or to be deep and probing, but the important part is that you stay true to yourself.You could ask all different kinds of questions, from the basics like “What do you do for a living?” and “What do you like to do for fun?” to more probing questions like “Where do you see yourself in five years?” and “What are you most passionate about?” You could even ask goofy questions like “Do you have a favorite joke?” Just keep in mind that you have a very short amount of time to converse with this person, so choose the questions that matter most to you., Remember that you may be nervous for your first speed dating event, so it will help to have an idea of what you are looking for before you get into the process. You should also list traits that are deal-breakers. Take some time to seriously consider what you want in a romantic interest so that you can accurately qualify and disqualify potential matches, even when your nerves might be clouding your thinking.


For example, maybe you are looking for someone who is passionate about their job, is adventurous, and wants to have kids some day.
For deal-breakers, perhaps you are unwilling to date a smoker or will only date someone of a specific religion.

, Be sure to dress appropriately for the venue, and to wear an outfit that speaks for your style and personality. Your clothes should be clean and wrinkle-free. Wear something that makes you feel confident and attractive. When you feel great, it will show.Dress up a bit to look nice. Men can wear a dress shirt and tie and women can wear a nice blouse. This will help you to make a good first impression.

, Arrive at the venue at least 30 minutes early. This will give you time to register, meet people, and get settled before the speed dating begins., When you arrive, you will need to sign in and will be given a match card. You might also get a name tag. There should be a host that can walk you through the registration process.The match card is what you will fill out after each speed date. You will hand it in at the end of the night and if you both checked “yes,” then that is a match and you will be given each other’s contact information., Depending on the event, you may not get to meet everyone. It is a good idea to get started ahead of time and begin introducing yourself so that you meet as many potential matches as possible. Make use of all available time because speed dating will go very quickly.To introduce yourself to someone, you could say, “Hi, I’m Fred.” And then you could strike up a conversation by saying something like, “Is this your first time speed dating?”

, This will show confidence. Even if you don't feel confident, making an effort to appear confident is important in making a good first impression., You can start by exchanging names and give an open-ended prompt like, “So tell me about yourself.” This will get the conversation started so that you can quickly get to know each other., After your date tells you a bit about themselves, you can ask further questions. Keep in mind the questions that you prepared ahead of time, or come up with a new question based on the information your date told you. For example, if your date told you that he has a son, you could ask “How old is your son?” Of if your date told you that she is an actor, you could ask, “What’s a typical day in the life of an actor?”Don’t ask too many questions. If it starts to feel like an interview, there probably isn’t good chemistry between you. The goal is to have a natural, albeit hurried, conversation.Be sure to ask the most important questions. Since time is limited, find out what really matters to you.

, The purpose of a speed date is to form an opinion based on not much more than a first impression. The only way to attract people who are genuinely interested in the real you is to present your real self to your dates. Otherwise, you are just wasting your own and your matches' time. Therefore, it is important to avoid saying things simply to impress the other person if it isn’t true, like saying “I love mountain climbing too!” when you are terrified of heights.Disagree when necessary. It’s ok if it doesn’t work out with this person. The point of speed dating is simply to find a couple of people who might be potential matches for you. For example, if the other person says, “I love dogs and having pets is very important to me,” it is perfectly acceptable to admit that you’re not a pet person., This is one of the most important ways to form a connection in a short amount of time. This will make the other person feel understood. It can be something very simple, such as, “That’s awesome!” or “Congratulations!”Showing sympathy is another good way to connect. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry to hear that,” if the person has recently lost their job.
You can even interrupt the other person to give positive feedback as a way of showing that you understand what they are saying, for example, “I know! That restaurant is the best in town!” This shows that you are excited about the conversation. But don’t interrupt to change the direction of the conversation.

, When you get the signal that one date is over and it is time to move onto the next, move promptly to allow the next match to move in. Be sure to mark your match card for whether you think that date was a potential match. Remember, if you both like each other, you will be able to continue the conversation on your own time and go out for a real date!

, Be sure to acknowledge the other speed dater by saying something like, ""It was nice meeting you."" If you are genuinely interested in the other match, it is okay to express an interest in talking to that person again. Be sure to take note of any potential matches.Do not request contact information or ask the person out. The event is low pressure because whether you are a match will be determined at the end based on whether you both said you liked each other on your match card.

Set up another date.",How to Start Dating After a Relationship," If you don’t take time to process your relationship, you will not be emotionally available when you start going on dates. The grieving process is important, and if you don’t follow it through, you may end up comparing your new date to your last partner.You also want to ensure that you’re not bitter about how your last relationship ended. If you are, you may project this bitterness onto the new person or make them feel like you have too much emotional baggage to handle, making successful dating very difficult.
Instead, work on forgiving your last partner. Forgiveness is the exercise of letting go of what you cannot change and not demanding justice for a wrong. It doesn’t mean letting someone treat you like a doormat.;
, To gain closure and give yourself license to explore your identity again, you must fully believe the past relationship is over. Do whatever you need to do to prove that the relationship is truly dead.


If you were dumped, meet with the other person to hear her reasons for breaking up with you or watch her in a new relationship.
If you’re the one trying to get out of the relationship, stop all contact with the former partner, move to a new location, or recall how much she damaged you or held you back.

, Studies have shown that your body actually experiences physical pain after a long-term relationship ends. This is because couples often end up dictating one another’s biological rhythms. This means disrupted sleep, loss of appetite, and change in rates of temperature and heart rate.After a breakup, keep your physical body in good shape even if you don’t feel like it. As you take time to forgive the other person and get used to being without him, your physical body will adjust.

, More than physical recovery, mental recovery is key for moving on. A breakup affects the way you perceive yourself and your level of self-esteem. Studies show that clearly defining who you are after breaking up with someone is the most important part of being able to move on.You may not remember who you are without the other person. Re-identifying yourself is the only way you will be able to present a whole person to a new dating interest.
Try “dating yourself” by going out to restaurants alone, seeing movies you like, and attending events you enjoy. You may even start to enjoy being single because you get to do things your former partner didn’t like.

, The more you focus on longing for your last relationship and regret how it ended, the worse your future will be. To move on, you must practice self-compassion. One study showed that those who practiced self-compassion directly after a divorce were coping much better nine months later than those who did not.Practice being kind to yourself by having positive thoughts about how your relationship ended. You can say something like, ""I'm not alone in this; I am not the only person to go through this. We had some good times, and I can take those with me, but it's best for the both of us if we move on.""Focus on how it’s best to forgive the other person rather than blame yourself for how it ended, or playing the “what if” game (repeating alternate scenarios in your mind).

, No matter how it ended, choosing to learn from the mistakes both you and your former partner made will help you be more successful in the next relationship.


Common relationship errors include taking your partner for granted, not paying enough attention to her, gossiping about your partner to others, and constantly questioning the relationship.Examine yourself closely for mistakes you made and determine not to repeat them.

, One way to help yourself forget the last relationship and focus on the present is to build a network of close friends. Even if they are friends you had before the relationship, these friends should be on your side and ready to help you find new love.


Friends can distract you from your pain by talking about other things, taking you on outings, and so on.
Friends can encourage you when you are tempted to beat yourself up for how things went in the relationship.

, There are many ways to attract someone with looks and actions. If you haven’t dated in while, it is a good idea to recall these ways of interacting with a love interest in order to keep him interested enough to give you a chance. Try actions like:Smiling
Mirroring body language and poses
Making eye contact, then looking away, repeatedly
Being pleasant and engaging
Once you’re in a conversation, look steadily into the eyes of the person who is talking

, At first, dating should be a lighthearted event where two people enjoy each other for who they are without worrying about the future. Focus on getting to know general facts about the other person rather than intimate or serious details.Avoid discussing your shortcomings in detail.
If the desire to get married is in your mind, avoid discussing this for at least a few dates, because this is a serious topic that can instantly change a lighthearted time into a heavy one.

, If you’re looking for a fun dating relationship to have the potential for a serious one, you should probably try to date people who fit your desired profile. Write down what you are looking for and attempt to date people who fit at least part of the list.


Setting up an online dating profile is an easy way to make sure someone fits the characteristics you want. You can usually select qualities you want from a list provided by the dating website, such as match.com or eharmony.com.

, To promote your goal of having a lighthearted time, try to schedule dates for fun locations. Being in a place where other people are being lighthearted can set the mood for fun, just as being in a location where couples are being very serious can turn your date into the same.


Going places that don’t specifically cater to couples like an amusement park, skating rink, or arcade can take your mind off the date and focus it on playing and having fun.

, Even though you’re not trying to get serious yet, that doesn’t mean you aren't trying to attract a potential partner. Dress tastefully and attractively to help your date enjoy being with you.


For women, this means wearing clothes that aren’t skimpy, but aren’t business-related, either. Go for outfits that suit the venue of the date, or that you get a lot of compliments on.For men, this means avoiding clothes that make you look like you’re at work (like suits and khakis) and opting for solid colors and clean-looking shoes., Believe that you are worth dating, and the other person will too. Develop a mindset of self worth before you go on a date so that you can project a confident image when you meet someone.


Increase your self-esteem by doing things like changing your negative beliefs, finding evidence to confirm that your new positive beliefs are true, and practicing positive thinking., If you have children, you should be very cautious about the dating process. It is probably best to keep the dating aspect of your life hidden until you are serious about someone new.Community support is helpful for this. If one of your family members or a close friend can babysit, this might distract your child from what you’re doing until it’s the right time.

, Having confidence on a date inspires confidence in the person you’re with. In fact, some say that confidence leads to security, security leads to positive emotion, and positive emotion leads to better performance.Try taking risks, being honest with yourself, and giving yourself internal pep talks.
Remember to boost your self-esteem with positive thinking.

, You want your date to see your most admirable qualities on the first handful of dates, so delay heavy details such as a chronic illness until you’re deeper in. You’ll have plenty of time for that after you see that things might go somewhere. The point is to have fun at first.To keep from divulging serious details about your life, focus on restricting information. Ask the other person lots of questions, and keep the conversation on activities and interests that you have in common.

, It’s ok to mention that you had a past relationship, since so have most people. However, if you talk too much about this relationship, it may spoil the mood and seem like you are still hung up on a past romance. No one wants to be runner-up.You also don’t want to seem bitter about past relationships, as this shows an inability to forgive—not a great quality.

, If you’re headed to a scene where there are other singles, such as a bar or singles event, be prepared to flirt a little bit in order to attract a date. Flirting can help us identify interested parties, so if you want a date, flirting can make it happen.Flirting is also useful on a date to confirm that you’re enjoying yourself and indicate you’d like another one.

, Make sure that you’re not doing all the talking. Sure you can share about your life—no one would want to be with someone who didn’t—but if you dominate the conversation, that is exhausting and will prevent someone from wanting to return.Be a good listener by being open minded, not interrupting, and offering feedback.

, After a successful first date, set up the next one. To avoid seeming overeager and scaring someone away, you might wait for them to bring up it up. This idea might also come up naturally, especially if you have both expressed interest in a certain event or activity in your area. If it doesn’t, you should speak up.


Be prepared for the possibility that the other person may say no.

Close friend.
Romantic partner.
Life-long friend and partner.
Spouse.
Fling or very short-term relationship.
Roommate who cares about you.;
, Before looking for someone to get into a relationship with, you need to think carefully about your prior relationships. By examining prior relationships -- and writing about them -- you’ll get a better idea of how you’ll make a new relationship work in the future.


When journaling about previous relationships, make a list to include information about different aspects of previous relationships.
Think about conflicts between you and previous partners. Did you fight a lot about money, time, priorities, sex, or family? Keep this in mind when you envision your next relationship.
Consider things you enjoyed about previous relationships. Did you have similar interests with prior romantic interests? Use this information when searching for a new partner.
Determine what you would have liked better about previous relationships. For instance, did you and prior partners share interests and hobbies?Did you have joint friends? Did you talk things through well? Answering questions like these can go a long way to make things clearer about future relationships.

, After thinking about prior relationships, create a list of your life and relationship priorities. Without a good idea about what you want to do with your life going forward, you may pick a partner with conflicting priorities and values.


Write out a list and rank different aspects of your life and their importance to you, such as family, career, socializing, leisure time, hobbies. Feel free to include notes, if you want.
Think about if you want to spend a lot of time with your family. If so, you should probably look for partners who live close to you and your children or other family.
Include how you value your career. If you are committed to your career, you should find someone who is somewhat independent and has something they can spend time on when you are apart.
Rank how you value leisure.
Remember to include religion or spirituality in your list., By searching for people with traits that are desirable to you, you'll increase the chance of getting into a successful relationship.


Reflect on what traits you want in a person, but remember to leave room for spontaneity. You want to be more open to a wide range of people, and not be shopping for a ""type.""
Evaluate potential partners or people you date based on the traits you value the most. For example, if you were previously married to a loner, pay attention to a potential partner's circle of friends and their genuine interest in others.
Don't eliminate people just because they don't match up exactly to your list. Instead, consider the whole person.
Some potential traits you might value include: independence, spontaneity, predictability, romance, a sense of humor, and an easy going attitude., The best thing about starting a new relationship late in life is that you should have a good idea about your personality and your own flaws. By putting some time into figuring out your quirks and flaws, you’ll form a good foundation for future relationships.


Make a list of your flaws or personal weaknesses.
Consider identifying partners who may be able to tolerate or even like your flaws and quirks. For instance, if you’re a frugal person, find someone else who is also frugal.
Think about whether you can take steps to manage flaws and personality quirks that might undermine future relationships. For instance, if you’re somewhat obsessive about neatness, consider seeing a counselor or therapist so you can manage this obsession.
Spend serious time doing self-reflection in anticipation of new relationships.
Consult friends or prior love interests about your flaws and how they might have negatively impacted your relationship. For instance, if you are recently divorced, consider talking to your ex-spouse if enough time has passed and you are on friendly terms.Good friends and family members are also good sources for honest feedback. Remember, none of us are perfect, nor are we supposed to be!

, It is very likely that there will be available singles in your social circle. These might be people you know directly or friends of friends or acquaintances. These will ultimately be the easiest people for you to meet.


Ask your friends if they know anyone who might be compatible with you. People who know you are often great resources because they can connect you with someone else who they know well.
Date long-standing friends or acquaintances that you think you have a romantic connection with.
Be careful when you consider asking a friend or acquaintance on a date. Try to carefully judge whether they are interested in you., You may already be a part of groups or organizations where you can find someone to get into a relationship with. The best thing about looking for people in groups you’re already apart of is that you have something in common. In addition, you may already know the person. Consider:


Looking for a romantic interest at church or synagogue.
Finding someone at your country club.
Locating a person at your home owner’s association or other civic organizations.
Dating someone in your tennis club or a similar group., Be sure to proceed with caution when looking for someone online. For example, do not disclose financial details, lend money, etc. Also, remember that relationship building takes time. Be wary of anyone wanting “too much information” from you up front. There are a variety of websites that specialize in connecting people late in life with each other. Ultimately, you need to find a website that is geared toward your taste so you can find the right person to become involved with. Consider:


OurTime.com
SeniorMatch.com
AgelessFish.com
Match.com., Ultimately, you’re not the only one your age looking for a new relationship. Just take some time and visit many of the places or events where people like you will gather. Consider:


Singles clubs for people over 50 or 60.
Visiting meetup.com for a list of meetups for people in your age group. Starting with a group of like-minded people who enjoy the same things can lead to great friendships or a possible love interest.
Looking for bars where singles like you might frequent. In the end, bars are not only for young people. If you find the right bar, you may also find the right person to get into a relationship with.
Attending events where you mind find someone, like events at art galleries, benefits, or other community gatherings., Ultimately, there is no reason to rush your new relationship. By taking it slow, you’ll be able to get to know the person before you are too committed.


Get to know each other in a casual environment. For instance, spend time with each other among friends or in an organization you are both involved in.
Avoid having expectations about how quickly your relationship will progress., Establishing a successful relationship late in life is highly dependent on successful communication. Without getting to know the person and inquiring about things you think are important, your relationship may not work.


Inquire about financial planning. Have potential romantic interests engaged in financial planning like you have? If not, this might present a problem later. However, don’t disclose (or expect the other person to disclose) too much too soon. There are people who prey on lonely people, so if someone pressures you to share too much too soon, then consider it a red flag.
Where do their children or other family members live? This is important, especially if it far away, as potential partners will likely want to visit their family regularly., Much like asking questions, you need to be prepared to honestly answer questions. In addition, you must be honest and share how you feel about a wide variety of things, including finances, family, and your personal taste.


Avoid the mistake many youthful people make of hiding your true feelings for fear of alienating a potential mate.
As someone with much experience, you need to let the other person know about anything you feel strongly about. For example, if you have strong feelings about religion or politics, don’t hide them. This could become a problem later.Remember that with age comes wisdom, so exercise it. It can be very freeing.

Know yourself, your dignity.,
Know your likes and dislikes.,
Dress modestly.,
Hang out with a guy who wants to be your friend not your lover from the first sight.,
Stop him at that moment you catch him disrespecting you.,
Don't set a guy to be your #1.,
Choose a guy who's morally good and wants the best for you.,
Test him.,
Don't waste time with someone who can't accept you for who you are.",How to Set Standards for a Guy," This is what one person said, ""If you want a man to respect you, and perhaps eventually fall in love with you, then you must show him that you respect yourself and that you recognize your dignity before God.""


Who are you?
How do you like to be treated?
What's important to you?
Why is it important to you that another person treats you with respect? Every girl needs to set realistic standards, write a list of what you want from the other person in regards to respect and stick to them. E.g. needs to open doors for me, calls me by my name, doesn't yell/swears at me, etc.;
, What do you like/dislike in other people? Write a list.

, Guys respect girls more who don't need to show off their body parts to attract them. They like a girl with confidence in who she is without having to show off her boobs to get his attention, but her mystery and how she carries herself is what attracts him. If he can't respect your way of modest dress and tells you otherwise, he's controlling and doesn't like/love you for who you are and what you stand for.

, Chances are, if he wants to be your boyfriend right away, he may be seeking to sleep with your body first before getting to know you as a person. Don't friend-zone or brother-zone him EVER. Basis of a relationship is a deep friendship.

,


If he yells at you for example say, ""Look __, when you yell at me I find it disrespectful and rude. Please stop."" If he respects you, he won't do it again and keep that in mind, but if he doesn't respect you, he'll do it over and over.






If you're in a relationship and he's disrespecting you repeatedly, leave him. You can't change a guy, the only thing you can do is leave him. You're not changing him by staying in a relationship, you're changing him when you leave.







,


Guys can never make you fully happy. Your guy should be someone you can share something with,not someone /something to fill you up. Take care of your health, exercise. Be busy with life, get involved in your community, get your education, volunteer, develop hobbies and help others if you're single and/or in a relationship.






Guys who love you will wait for you, accept you as you are and respect your wishes. Don't fall for that guy that says all the sweet things, but verbally, physically abuses you. Look at the guy's actions, don't listen to his words.







,


Don't go looking around for bad guys, chances are many of them are verbally, physically abusive, involved in some bad addictions, cheaters, arrogant,dishonest, and disrespectful.







,


Don't sleep with him, if you don't want to. Wait till marriage if you want to. If he really loves you, he'll wait if you don't want to. If he doesn't, he'll go to the next girl. Is that the kind of man you want to marry, the kind that says, ""If you don't give me your goods, I'm out.""






Don't think: ""If I'll just sleep with him, I'll get his love.""
What ends up happening, the guy uses you and then leaves, and you'll be hurt more than before. You can't force a guy to love you by giving him your body. He may like your body, but not you. Do you want someone to love your boobs, but not your personality, likes and dislikes. No girl likes to be treated like an object. You're not mere bodies, you have a soul, heart, and mind. You truly want to be loved as a complete human being. Wait for the right man to love you wholly as you are. Pray for him.







, Move on. You deserve better.

Be friends first.,
Say Hello to her when you see her around, but don't overdo this or she'll be creeped out.

,
Make eye contact and smile.,
Go ahead and introduce yourself.,
Start a conversation.,
Compliment her on something she is good at or interested in, rather than how she looks.,
Keep showing her attention.,
Be Patient.,
Look for indications of reciprocal interest.,
Choose your next course of action.",How to Show a Girl You Like Her," Try to control the libido and see the girl as a person, not another conquest. Your first goal is to get to know about her, not just her look, as cool as that may be.


Partner up with her on a science or history project. Be easy to work with, put in a lot of effort, and listen to what she says. A friendship may blossom.
Pick her when you choose teams for sports. Give her reassurance after the game that she did really well, and that it was fun playing with her.
Make a strategic friendship with one of her other friends. It doesn't matter who the friend is, as long as you don't openly flirt with her. The friend should give you an opportunity to get an introduction.;
,, Eye contact is a perfect way to let a girl know you like her without saying so. Look her in the eyes, don't shy away and don't check her out below the neck at this particular time. If she meets your eyes, smiles back or blushes, then you may have a chance. If she frowns or gives you that ""what the heck?"" look, back off for a while. Remember though, she may get a lot of attention from men, so that look may be automatic if you are a stranger or near stranger. Don't give up hope over one little frown, maybe she has something in her shoe? Wait a while and try again later.

, Don't rush right up, take your time, remember, you are building a friendship. Being overly aggressive is likely to scare her or creep her out.


A really simple, basic introduction works fine. You can say: ""Hi, my name is . It's nice to meet you."" You don't always need a fancy pick-up line to impress her.
If you're a little shy or bashful, you can go up to her and say something like: ""I'm sorry this is so awkward, but I get really nervous around pretty girls. My name is ."" She just might melt if you pull this off casually.
If you're a little more confident and want to add a little pizazz to your introduction, try something like: ""I hope you know how hard it is to summon up the courage to talk to the prettiest girl in school. I'm . How are you?""


, Chat about something safe, like school, or the weather, and then ask her something about herself. Critically, listen to her answer! Don't talk about yourself too much. Keep the focus on her.


Avoid conversations about religion, politics, or other ""hot-button"" topics. Religion and politics are best not talked about because they make us feel very strongly and they divide us by party or affiliation. What that means is that if you're religious and she's not, or she's one party and you're not, she's likely to not give you a chance, without looking at your other qualities. Save religion and politics for later.
Choose something you think she's really interested in. People like talking about themselves, and by definition, she'll like talking about one or her hobbies or interests. If you get her going on one of these, you won't have to do much talking and the conversation will feel natural.
Pay attention to what she says. Remember what she says. Show interest in her as a human being. If you really think about what she says, and remember it, you can use it to your advantage: it could help you think of the perfect gift or be the start of an inside joke.

, She was born with her appearance, but she earned her accomplishments. Look for some kind of skill like drawing, singing or a sport. Be genuine with your compliments.


That said, many women put a great deal of effort into looking good, so if she has a new haircut, or a new bag, it's OK to notice that too, especially if she has good taste. The mere fact that you notice something new or different about her will show her that you pay attention, and that you like her.
Reinforce the way she wants to be seen. Does she think of herself as an athlete, a thinker, or a social worker? Then give her compliments that make her feel incredibly coordinated, or incredibly smart, or incredibly compassionate. Find out the way she wants to be viewed and then compliment her on that.

, If this is a fleeting encounter and will be your only chance to show her your feelings, flirt a little more than you would normally.


If you're with your friends, ask her if she wants to hang out with your friends. If she's busy, ask her if she wants to hang out later. This would be a perfect time to get her number.
Break the touch barrier. While you're talking with her, touch her gently on the hand, the arm, or the shoulder. These are all safe places to touch a girl, provided she knows you. If you do it right and she likes you, it'll send a shiver down her spine.
Be a little playful with her. If you're friends, tease her gently (making sure she knows you're joking!) or offer to give her a piggy-back ride. Don't be needy, but don't be scared either!

, These things take time. But by giving her your undivided attention, she will eventually get the hint that you like her.


In the meantime, take any opportunity you can get to ask her to a dance, go swimming or hiking with her, invite her to a party, or just be with her and her friends. Be sure to have a good relationship with her friends.

, Try to read her body language. Is she leaning into you? Did she just touch you lightly on the arm? Does she hold your gaze? Does she play with her hair, smile, or giggle? If so, then the odds are she likes you too. You've made quite the impression on her!

, Once you have figured all the previous steps out, what you do next is up to you.


You could ask her on a formal date if you like your chances. You can really wow her on a nice date.
You could swoop in for a gentle first kiss, or even the daring French kiss. Be warned, however, because this could ruin the first date and is best saved for later on in the relationship.
Maybe what you really want is to know how to flirt before you make your move. Look no further. You'll be flirting in no time!

, Although you may want to go out on the date as soon as they say ‘yes’, slow down and plan when you will go out. Your date will be more successful if you figure out the right day and time to go out on the date.


Talk to your date about their schedule. Find out when would be a good day and time for the date.
For example, you could ask, “When will you be free over the next couple of days?”
Also find out what time of day will be best for the date. Although dates are often at night, a day date might work out better.

, The location of your date can have a big impact on how successful the date is or even if the person agrees to go. You can ask your date where they would like to go or you can think about places your date might enjoy going on your own.


You might say, “Is there anywhere in particular you would like to go on our date?”

Have a back-up plan in case you can’t go through with your date as planned.
For example, have an alternative restaurant in mind or another activity planned as a backup.
Try to have extra money in case of an unexpected event.

Keep your initial rejection straightforward.If you've just been approached by a friend for a date, the best thing you can do to start is to give your answer right off the bat.,
Be honest.Even if you don't take the other person seriously as a dating prospect, his feelings still matter.,
Empathize with the other person.,
Offer a compliment to lessen the blow.Compliments are a good way of making someone feeling better after you've caused them pain.,
Focus on the good things in your friendship.While this isn't something you have to be worried about if you're approached by a stranger, rejecting a friend can have negative consequences for the friendship you already have.,
Give space and time.All rejections need time and space to heal over.",How to Say No when Someone Asks You Out1," Don't beat around the bush or avoid giving a real response. Something short and straightforward is best. Although something as simple as ""I'm just not into you that way"" sounds cold, it's important to lay down the groundwork first. Once that's out of the way, you can offer consolation as a friend.


Say something like ""Sorry, I think you're great but I just don't see you that way."" rejecting someone like this offers a compliment, but still makes the rejection firm and straightforward.
Don't be worried about being blunt. Being blunt will save the other person pain in the long run.;
, Trying to sugarcoat the situation to protect his feelings is a common mistake people make, but you should try to be as honest and forthcoming about your rejection as you can. After all, he went out of his way to ask you out. The least he should get in return is some sincerity on your part.


Don't confuse honesty with being cold. There are always ways you can word something to sound less harsh. For instance, instead of saying ""I think you're ugly,"" you can soften it by reminding him it's all about personal taste: ""I'm not personally attracted to you, but I could see why other girls might be.""
Avoiding the touchier parts of your rejection may seem like a good idea at first, but runs the risk of being misinterpreted. Your best bet is to give as many reasons as needed to make him understand the rejection.

, If you've ever asked someone out before, you should be able to empathize with the sort of courage it can take to make yourself vulnerable to someone. If he's already a friend of yours, he probably sees you as more than just a dating prospect. Taking the moment to see things from the other person's point of view can make it a lot easier to talk things out together.


Even if you feel for the other person, don't let the empathy change your mind about the rejection. There's obviously a rejection why you rejected the person in the first place, and it's a good idea to stick with it once you've started.
Any type of social rejection hurts a lot. When you're trying to empathize, it's a good idea to think back on times you've been rejected. Social rejection can take many forms, and it can have dismal effects on the person being rejected.If you consider him a friend, you're probably going to want to save his feelings from being hurt. While this a good thing, you shouldn't let protecting his feelings get in the way of talking about the situation.

, A compliment is a good consolation, and can go a long way towards making that person feel better. It's very important to note that the compliment shouldn't be anything that makes him think like he still has a chance at dating you. Keep the compliment platonic; say something that you'd normally have no problem complimenting a friend for.


If it applies, say something like: ""Even though we wouldn't be good together, I think you're incredibly sweet and funny.""

, After you've gotten past the initial stages of rejection, it's a good idea to talk about the good things in the friendship you already have. The person you rejected may not sound too enthusiastic about the friendship at first, but reminding him of the good things is an important part of moving forward.


Stress how much the friendship personally means to you. This will boost his self-confidence. After just being rejected, he'll probably need that consolation., Even if you're very good friends with this person, it's often a good idea to offer some space apart while he regains his bearings. After enough time has elapsed, the two of you should start talking again and pick up the friendship where you left off. The time apart will be healthy for you too. Although your friend may come back after a while, you should expect to make the initiative in continuing the friendship. Wait until you think the dust has settled, and ask your friend how he's doing. After talking for a bit, you should get an idea if enough time has passed or not.


Time will vary depending on the outcome of the rejection and the type of people the two of you are. Time apart could be a matter of hours to a few months.
It should be cautioned that there's always a chance your friend won't be interested in continuing the friendship at all. Sometimes the pain will be too much.

Go with your gut.Although you should give just about anyone a chance to prove themselves, being approached by a stranger in a public place usually relies on spontaneous decision making.,
Give a straightforward rejection.You can always just say ""No."",
Leave no room for interpretation.If someone asks you out, a more persistent sort may try to analyze what you've said and look for loopholes.,
Offer an excuse.,
Resist the urge to apologize.,
Let the other person have the last word.If you're talking to a stranger, egos can come into play.",How to Say No when Someone Asks You Out2," If there's something about the stranger's approach that's made you uneasy, it's a good idea to go with your gut and reject. On the other hand, if you feel good and like the attention, don't be afraid to let it continue and see where it goes.


Saying ""Yes"" because you feel pressured is a bad move.It's a common mistake to make, but you should take care to avoid it in the future.

, Unlike a friend approaching you, where you may care about his feelings, a stranger can be dismissed more easily. The best rejections are done in a few words or less.


You can reject someone through body language as well. If you're in a loud environment like a club, you can simply shake your head. This should get the message across in most cases.
Say something like: ""I'm not interested."" It's simple, gets the job done, and you're not going out of your way to help or hurt the other person.

, That's why the best way to reject someone is to do it in as straightforward a way as possible.


Giving false hope at the start increases the risk of getting a stalker later on.

, If you're going to lie your way through a rejection, you need to make sure your excuse can't be called out.Whether any of it is true or not, saying you're already in a relationship keeps the other person from feeling personally hurt. This is a very common technique, but it should only be done if you don't think the other person will find out you're lying.


Simply saying ""I have a boyfriend/girlfriend"" can save the other person from taking the rejection personally.

, Saying something as simple as ""Sorry, I'm not interested"" is perfectly okay, but apologizing can become a problem if you do too much of it.It ends up seeming like you're being condescending to the other person. Worse still, the apologies may seem like you're unsure whether you really want to reject him or not. No one likes hurting someone else, but apologizing isn't going to make anyone feel better, least of all the person you rejected.

, Everyone wants to have the last word, and this can sometimes result in an argument. If you've rejected someone, there's a good chance he'll have something to say in response. Just listen to and accept what he has to say, and don't feel obligated to respond.


This may be hard advice to accept for some people. If you're the kind of person that loves to have the last word, remind yourself that you only stand to lose from a prolonged confrontation with this person. You can benefit from keeping the rejection short. The shorter it is, the faster you'll be able to go back to enjoying your night.

"
"
Get firm with your rejection.,
Ignore the person.,
Involve your friends.,
Contact an authority figure.",How to Say No when Someone Asks You Out3," One of the biggest mistakes people make when rejecting someone is not being firm enough with their decision. If someone keeps asking you out, it is possible that you weren't absolute enough with your rejection and he thinks he still stands a chance. If need be, you should repeat that you do not want to date him. Don't mince words. Be very direct and leave no room for interpretation.


Say something as simple and straightforward as ""Sorry, I do not want to date you."" Saying anything more risks losing track of the message.
Make sure your body language is saying the same thing as your words. Non-verbal communication counts for a lot. If you're smiling suggestively while rejecting someone, he might take it as a subtle challenge to keep chasing you.

, If it gets to the point where you don't think the person is going to stop, the best thing you can do for the time being is to ignore him. The most you can do is tell someone you're simply not interested. If he continues to pursue you, cutting off contact and ignoring him will cut his incentive to keep talking to you. In some cases, someone will do just about anything to get his crush's attention. Most of the time however, people will begin to lose interest after a while. This is the best thing to do for both of your sakes.


This includes stopping all online contact. Even if you're giving him space in person, it ultimately means nothing if you're still commenting on his social media posts. A persistent suitor will almost certainly try to get in touch with you online or via text message.

, Whether you're being pursued by someone known to them or a relative stranger, getting your friends involved can be a big help when a suitor isn't getting the message. Let some trusted friends in on the situation. Depending on the circumstances, they may be able to give you advice on how to deal with the specific person, or even help you deal with it actively. Regardless, you'll stand to gain some much-needed emotional support. It can be easy to lose sight of the fact that you have lots of people who care deeply about you. Don't be afraid to turn to them for help if someone is getting to you.


It's even better if your friends are mutual friends with the person asking you out. Your friends can talk to that person directly, and hopefully they'll be able to convince him to cut his losses.

, Although bringing authorities (parents, teachers, the police etc.) into a personal matter can only be recommended for the absolute worst of cases, it is available for those who feel like a situation is getting progressively worse. If you've told the person you have no interest in ever dating him and he refuses to let up, it can eventually escalate to the point where your safety is at risk. If it gets to this point, don't hesitate to let someone know. If you truly feel like you're in danger, filing a complaint with the police will prevent things from getting any worse.


Only take things to this point if you think you're in physical danger. Some people may take a rejection very seriously and threaten violence. If the person is simply texting you or being annoying, this isn't grounds to bring authorities into it.
If you're of a school age, telling a teacher or the principal about the situation should be done before going to police.
Restraining orders are available to those who feel like their safety is at risk. These should only be considered if the situation is horrible and it doesn't look like your stalker will ever stop. Restraining orders are to be taken seriously, and aren't available just for people who feel they're being bothered by someone."

Take deep breaths.,
Get some exercise.,
Play some music.,
Take a bath.,
Drink some tea.,
Massage yourself.,
Try meditation.,
Use positive thinking.",How to Relax Before a Date1," A simple way to calm yourself down is to take some deep, slow breaths. There are many deep breathing techniques that can help calm you down. One that it is simple to remember is to breath in while counting to six, hold the breath in for six, and exhale for a count of six.Deep breathing reduces the effects of stress by lowering your blood pressure and heart rate.;
, Obviously you don't want to work up too much of a sweat right before your date, but if you've got some time to spare (and shower), getting some exercise is a great way to relax yourself before the date.


Even a quick walk around the block or a few trips up and down a flight of stairs can cause your brain to release chemicals that can help ease your anxiety., Playing some music that makes you feel good is a great way to relax. Play some of your favorite songs, and maybe dance around a little. That way, you get some exercise too!Another approach is to pick out some very soothing music. Research shows that calm, soft music reduces stress and anxiety. Music with the sounds of nature incorporated into the recording may be particularly helpful., A bath is another great way to relax yourself before a date. The warm water will help relax your muscles and ease tension. As an added bonus, you'll be all cleaned up for the big date afterward!


Adding some epsom salts (available at any drugstore) will make the experience more relaxing. Epsom salts are a gentle muscle relaxer.Consider lighting some scented candles to make the bath even more calming. In particular, medical research has shown the scent of lavender to have calming effects., Taking some time to sip a warm beverage can be very relaxing.Likewise, some herbal teas are thought to have soothing effects when smelled or sipped, such as:Chamomile
Passion flower
Ginseng
Valerian root

, Many people ""store"" stress and anxiety in their necks or shoulders. If you can get a professional massage to work this stress out, great. However, even just a couple of minutes of rubbing these areas yourself can work wonders.Some people also find gently massaging a pressure point along the crease between the wrist and palm, straight down from the pinkie finger, produces a calming effect. Try rubbing gently with your thumb for a few minutes., It may seem like a strange way to prepare for a date, but meditation can be a powerful way to relax. Close your eyes and try to clear your mind.Focus all of your attention on your breathing.You can also meditate by repeating, either mentally or out loud, a positive phrase, such as ""I feel at peace,"" while keeping your mind free of thoughts and worries.Like deep breathing, meditating can reduce your heart rate and blood pressure.Used regularly, meditation can actually change the pathways in your brain in a way that can make you more resistant to stress and anxiety in general.This could be good news for future dates!

, Remind yourself that you have many good qualities that other people (including your date) are likely to appreciate. If it's helpful, make a list of those qualities.Give yourself a compliment, such as ""I'm really funny,"" or ""I have beautiful eyes.""Remember that your date is probably as nervous as you are, if not more so!Your wouldn't have said asked you out or said ""yes"" to your invitation if he she didn't like you, too.

Watch TV.,
Read a book.,
Call a friend.,
Do a puzzle.",How to Relax Before a Date2," Another way to relax before a date is just to try to take your mind off of it. Fill your thoughts with other things. One way to do this is by watching some TV or a movie, or even just some videos on the internet.Watching something funny can be especially helpful, as laughter is thought to ease tension and reduce stress., A book is another great tool for occupying your mind. Pick a novel that will really hold your attention. You can pass a few hours this way and hardly even think about your date.Make sure to pick something that will really engage you. A book with a topic or writing style that doesn't keep you interested won't be of much help.

, Talking to a friend can be a great way to either distract you or calm you down. A conversation with a good friend can really keep your mind occupied. Reaching out to someone in your social network can also reduce stress.In addition to calming your nerves, you might also get some good last-minute advice for your date., A puzzle that makes your brain work is another good tool for taking your mind off your anxiety. Do a crossword, a sudoku puzzle, or any other kind of brain teaser that interests you.Try to pick a puzzle that's challenging enough to keep your mind from wandering, but not one that is so challenging that you get frustrated, as this can add to your anxiety.

Plan ahead.,
Clean up.,
Dress well.,
Practice some icebreakers.",How to Relax Before a Date3," Like anything else in life, you will probably be less stressed out about your date if you feel well prepared for it.One thing you can do, if you are the one planning the evening, is to make sure you have everything planned out well in advance.


For example, if you are going out for dinner, make reservations in advance. Have any travel arrangements taken care of. Buy those movie tickets online, so you don't have to worry about it selling out. All of these mean one less thing you have to worry about.

, Take the time to get yourself extra clean. Nobody wants to worry about body odor during their date. Don't forget the importance of dental hygiene for fresh breath.No matter who you are dating, a little extra effort is always appreciated.

, Dress nicely and appropriately for your date. You want to look your best, but you don't want to overdo it either. You'll look silly wearing a tuxedo to a pizza restaurant.Dressing well can also help boost your feeling self-confidence., Are you worried about what to say on your date? Many people get nervous and don't know what to talk about on first dates, but if you plan some ""icebreaker"" questions in advance, you'll have some conversation starters ready that will also help you get to know your date better.Think about questions that can get someone to open up and share information about themselves, without getting too personal. You might ask, for example, ""What was your favorite book when you were young?"" or ""What is the strangest thing that's ever happened to you?""Anything that might lead to some laughs is a good idea too.

Thank the asker.,
Compliment the person.,
Be mindful of your body language.,
Avoid gossiping.,
Be honest.,
Avoid being a people-pleaser.,
Be timely.,
Be courteous.,
Show empathy.,
Suggest alternatives.,
Be safe.,
Deal with feelings of guilt.",How to Refuse a Date Gracefully," Remember that it took a lot of courage for the person to ask you out. If you genuinely appreciate him for asking, thanking him will soften the blow of your refusal.;
, Be kind and give them positive feedback before your refusal. Be specific about what you do like or appreciate about her.Some examples of compliments you could give include:


“You’re so much fun to spend time with, but...”
“You’ve been a great friend these past few months, but…”
“You’re really thoughtful and nice to think of me, but…”

, You might speak clearly and assertively, but you may send unintended or confusing messages with your body language. Don't pull away from the person, but don't lean in, either. Keep your arms uncrossed, make eye contact, and smile gently. This is an awkward situation, but allow your body language to be relaxed — try not to clench your jaw, furrow your brow, or compress your lips into a tight line, which may appear harsh and mean.

, It might have been funny to you that this person asked you out or it may be tempting to talk about it with your best friends. Don’t spread the news of this person asking you out. Respect her feelings and remember that it took courage for her to ask you in the first place.If the person asked you out via text, avoid keeping the text message or showing it to anyone else.If the person asked you out via social media, do not take a screenshot of the message and show it to others., Give them him truth about your reasons for refusal. You don’t have to be overly blunt or rude, but you should be clear about why you’re not interested. Avoid vague excuses or blatant lies.If you get asked out on a second or third date from someone you find unattractive, you might say, “I had a lot of fun with you on our first date, but I’m just not interested in you in that way.” This can be easier to hear than “I don’t find you attractive.”If you get asked out by a friend and would prefer to remain friends, you could say, “I appreciate our friendship and have so much fun with you, but I don’t see you that way and want to stay friends.”
If you get asked out by someone new at school or work who doesn’t know you’re in a relationship already, you can say, “I really appreciate you asking and it’s been nice getting to know you, but you should know I’m already in a relationship with someone else.”

, It’s normal to want to avoid any feelings of discomfort or awkwardness, but do not say “yes” just to make the person feel better. If you go on to refuse her later, she will feel confused. Do not string anyone along.When you say “no,” you should:


Be brief. You have a right to just say “no” without giving any explanations.Avoid over-apologizing. You don’t need to apologize for how you feel. You have a right to express your feelings honestly.Be firm. Repeat your “no” if your message isn’t getting across or if the person is trying to change your mind., Don’t delay your answer after someone asks you out. Avoid ghosting or disappearing on him entirely, as this isn’t respectful and isn’t what you’d want to happen to you. Give him an answer as soon as possible.If you genuinely need time to think about your answer because the situation is complicated, be direct and ask for time.
For example, if you’re interested in the person who asked you out, but he used to date a friend of yours, you may want to avoid saying “no” right away. Instead, you can say, “I’m not sure. I do like you and I think it would be fun to go out with you, but I know you used to date my friend. I need to talk to her first before I can give you an answer.”, Show you’re polite by refusing her in a way that makes her feel heard and respected. You’ll show you’re a good person if you respond to her in a mature way.


Choose the appropriate setting to refuse her. For example, if she asked you out in-person, but in front of other people, you may avoid refusing her until you can be alone. You can say, “Thank you so much! Why don’t we go have coffee or take a walk to talk about it?”
Choose your means of communication. If the person asked you out over a text message, through email, or through social media, you can return in kind, or give her a call., Be compassionate and remember the other person’s feelings. Take time to listen to and validate his response. Let him know you appreciate his vulnerability and value his feelings.You can say, “I know you must be feeling hurt or confused right now. I appreciate you asking me out. That takes a lot of courage and I can’t imagine how hard that is.”
You might ask, “Is there anything you need to feel more comfortable? I know it might be weird since we still have to go to school together.”

, If you trust or like the person who asked you out, but don’t want to date her, you might be able to offer your help in other ways. Suggest other options for how the two of you could have a relationship.


Suggest a friend who might be a good fit for her to date.Get your friend’s permission first.
Ask if the two of you could just be friends, if you aren’t already.
Ask for more time if you’re unsure of your decision or can’t agree to a date right now, but are interested in dating her in the future.
Suggest spending more time with her one-on-one if you don’t know her well, but would like to get to know her better before formally dating her.

, Beware of people who persist to ask you out or refuse to accept your refusal. Watch out for reactions of anger or abusive language. If something about the person is disturbing, offensive, or inappropriate when you refuse him, you can ensure your safety by:Letting someone know where you are, if you’re alone with him.
Leaving the situation immediately and going to where there are other people.
Blocking him on any social media applications or dating websites where you talk to him.
Avoiding responding to his phone, email, or text messages.
Avoiding being alone with him in person in the future.

, While you may be graceful in your refusal, the other person may not take it so well and have a strong negative reaction. This may lead you to feel guilty — maybe you should have said yes, just to be nice? — or the person may try to outright guilt-trip you, but you don't need to feel bad or guilty about being honest and genuine to what you are feeling and thinking. You can't force yourself to feel a certain way, and if you're not connecting with that person on a romantic level, you can't talk or trick yourself into feeling that connection. The person's reaction is her own, and if she reacts poorly, you are not responsible for that.

Remember that he is your boyfriend; you chose each other!,
Relax against him.,
If you have never been with a boy before, or are really nervous about touching, remember that a single hug or kiss does not immediately lead to sex or groping.,
Body language is a big part of relationships.,
If you don't like hugging, but don't want to hurt your boyfriend's feelings, tell him outright (not in front of other people!,
It may just be that you are a 'shy hugger'.,
Hugging is a very natural way of showing how happy you are to be together through body language, don't be shy about it otherwise he might feel rejected by you if you keep unexpectedly pulling away every time he tries to hug you.",How to React if Your Boyfriend Hugs You," Don't be nervous.;
, If you pull away, especially if you don't touch often, it could be pretty offensive to him. If he puts his arm around you, lean against him. If he hugs you, hug him back. Again, remember that he is your boyfriend!

, Simple hugs are his way of saying, ""Hey Babe! Good to see you. In fact, good to be dating you."" If you pull away, it is your way of saying, ""Um, excuse me? Stay away. Far, far away.""

, It can often be stronger than words, because people subconsciously look to body language to figure out what you really say. Even if you talk sweetly to him, he may take it badly if you reject even one hug without explanation. Just think about it: if he walked away from your hug without any reason you can tell, wouldn't it hurt your feelings?

, Face to face is also better). Say something simple, like, ""Hey, sorry if I freaked out on you today... I'm not big on hugs."" Guys put a lot on touching, so make sure you find something else to make up for it.

, If this is true, say so. Many people, especially from conservative backgrounds, are shy about close contact in public but do not mind in private. Most guys will be more than happy if their girlfriends have no problem with snuggling in private - more time for being alone together!And remember he's your boyfriend the more you hug, the more comfortable you will feel with him!

, Good luck!!

Write up a specific ad for what you're seeking.,
Assess any people contacting you to see if they meet your requirements.,
Watch out for warning signs.,
Meet in public.,
Look out for inappropriate interactions on the date.,
Try to have a pleasant experience!",How to Safely Pursue Casual Dating Opportunities on Craigslist," This is initially where the proverbial pedal hits the metal, by describing exactly what it is you are looking for precisely, when composing the CL Ad. For example, you might specify gentle bottom, aggressive top, no verbal, anonymous scene, shower available, parking situation, door unlocked, buzz you in, condoms required, safer sex only, open ended friendship, relationship wanted, hook up only, no strings attached, no oral preferred, missionary position, traditional positions, your stats, his expected time of arrival, pictures, discreet private environment, his stats, your expectations, role playing, truthful physical descriptions, time frame, behavioral expectations, terminal objectives, categorical imperatives, etc. You can let the responder know, even before chatting, exactly what it is that you are interested in. This specificity also helps avoid any misunderstandings later.;
, Then once a date responds in kind, he can either be referred back to the ad for clarity, or be further assessed and given your personal contact information, meeting place, address, or phone number. If the responder won't provide a picture or additional basic information, it's best to move on to the next person.


Frequently, the date may be a repeat CL responder/dater. They may already pretty much know your particular drill, and you know their's, from past experience. Great personal contacts can be saved to a permanent on-line file with any necessary contact information. Also if they were too rough, too loud, or too anything, you can easily make a comment on their profile page, so they can be pin-pointed later or identified for any pattern of uncomeliness, untoward, or even stalking type illegal behaviors. One CL date, for instance, was looking all over the host's apartment for a laptop after intimacy. Luckily all valuables had been placed well out of reach, but this behavior required noting in the date's recorded profile, for future reference and or follow up with authorities.

, Is he making a lot of typos while texting the host? (Could he be drunk or high?)  If he calls, is his speech slurred or is he abusive or demanding in any way? Or is he just a CL adolescent gamer, who is playing around on line while mommy is out of the house? Most of these signs can be delineated long before further contact information is shared. The rule of thumb is = 'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.' Don't be afraid to rely on your gut instincts.

, It's always best to meet initially in a public space, coffee house, or other peopled venue prior to inviting the guest over. The last thing that should be given out to the date is your apartment number. Potential dates have to arrive promptly, and call or meet with the host for that most important detail. After all these screening methods, it may appear that the date is in earnest, and has at least made the effort to show up on time, and has appeared clean and sober, and finally, also been scanned visually by you on the outside, prior to actually buzzing anyone in. In addition, there may be highly visible security cameras in the lobby of your building, so that anyone who arrives or exits, knows that they are being recorded on film. Your apartment may also be ideally located in the rear of your building. To get to it, guests may have to pass by 25 other apartments, so the likelihood of them being seen by others is much greater.

, Once the CL date is in your apartment, is he courteous, low key, and friendly? Once in a while a guest may arrive who has been drinking. Simply turn on all the brightest lights. Put on a large overcoat, crank up the volume on your TV set, and tell him he has to leave. Make the environment as un-erotic and inhospitable as possible in just a few seconds, and he will usually exit quickly. After he's gone, report him to Abuse@CL and make a personal file tag on him that insures he will never again return. Also during intimacy, if the date for any reason gets too rough, takes his condom off, is noisy, verbal, excited, biting, demanding, or whatever, attempt to interact with them. A lot of behavior can be modified if the date is reminded that they are an invited guest in your home, and that the walls there may be literally paper thin.

, Most dates on CL may be agreeable, consensual, and fulfilling, mainly because the person coming over knows exactly what your parameters are in advance and what to expect. Even though it may technically be a quasi-anonymous CL hookup, it can be handled with attention to human dignity, safety precautions, common sense, and a modicum of reciprocal grace. It's one reason why many CL posters establish a routine of regularly returning predictable guests.

Listen to your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs.,
Examine problem areas in your dating history.,
Write down what you want from your dating life/relationship.,
Get advice from people you trust.,
Set your boundaries upfront.",How to Set Dating Boundaries That Make You Feel Safe1," Being able to set good boundaries in your relationships comes down to knowing yourself. If you’re unclear about yourself, it’s hard to figure out what sort of limits you’ll want to set.Observe yourself over a number of days. Closely consider your interactions with others. Notice what emotions friends, family, and dates bring up in you. Whenever you feel resentful or angry, there’s a chance a personal boundary has been violated.;
, Spend some time reminiscing about your previous dating encounters. Think about how your dates treated you. Many people have a dating “type”—you seem to go after girls or guys with certain traits. Pay attention to any commonalities in your dating history. Also, take notice of why many of your relationships didn’t work out.


Do you often find yourself having to justify a choice with them? Did you feel suffocated or unable to be your true self? Were any of your dates pushy?
When you go on dates, do you have a pattern of ""going along"" with whatever your date wants?
Thinking about relational patterns, and why these relationships didn’t survive, could help you identify boundaries that your dates may have crossed., Now that you have listened to yourself and reflected on your dating history, it’s time to clarify what you want. Knowing what you want can shed light on what you don’t want. For example, you might say, “I’d like to really get to know someone before sex enters the picture.” You’re basically saying you’re not interested in casual hookups, which is a boundary.
Write down all the important characteristics that you want from your dating life or relationships. Use these to help you make a secondary list of your boundaries. For example, you might write, ""I want to date someone who will occasionally go out with my friends without complaining.""

, Do you have a best friend or sibling who knows you well? This person probably knows your dating history and can objectively look at problem areas. They may be able to point out some issues that you have overlooked. Reach out to this person to get their input on setting dating boundaries.


You might say, ""Hey, sis, I've been trying to come up with some boundaries that help me stay safe while dating. You've been here through many of my relationships. What areas do you think need tweaking?""
Try to keep an open mind. You might not always like what you hear about your dating patterns. Listen to the other person's advice, and try to seriously consider it.
Make sure this person has healthy relational patterns. It may not be the best idea to seek advice from someone who is constantly in negative or rocky relationships., Early in the relationship, communicate to the other person your needs, limits, and boundaries. Try to do this before a problem arises. This may prevent many problems, and it may help you avoid situations that will upset you later on."

For example, you may be attracted to their pheromones or feel connected in a strong intellectual way rather than physical way.If you notice your tastes changing or that you’re surprised in who you’re attracted to, accept these changes and don’t fight against them.;
, Perhaps you’re drawn to someone new because what has worked before isn’t working now. For example, the kind of partner you were interested in during college may not be the kind of person you’re interested in now in your 30’s. Be open to exploring it and surprising yourself. It may open up new parts of yourself that you’ve never discovered before.Don’t immediately shrug off the attraction you feel. Be open to exploring.

You may have gained clarity on something in your own life, which has extended to making different decisions for your romantic relationships.

Perhaps this person shows more love and respect than you’ve experienced before. They might show support in a way that you’ve never known. Think about the positive things they bring that may be attractive to you.For example, notice if they’re patient and calm, even if you don’t feel patient and calm.

, If you find yourself attracted to someone who doesn’t fit your type based on looks, be open to experiencing attraction in different ways. You might be more attracted to this person for who they are and less for how they appear.Attraction can happen on many fronts. If you’re less physically attracted to someone yet still feel attraction toward them, it might be their charisma, intellect, or relatability.

, Attraction to someone goes beyond physical sex appeal. While you may not feel immediately attracted to someone by their looks, you might find that you become emotionally or intellectually attracted to them. As you build a connection, you might begin to feel more sexually attracted to them, even if it wasn’t there at first. Focus on what you desire about the person and allow that to unfold.If you’re surprised by your attraction to someone, see where it goes. It might lead to more attraction to them overall.

, While someone might look different from others you’ve dated, they might have similar qualities or personalities. For example, if you tend to date people who are controlling, they might be controlling in different ways, but are still controlling. Stay clear of people who exhibit signs of bad patterns from your past.For example, you may have dated materialistic people who had fancy cars. If you find someone new who doesn’t have fancy cars but spends lots of money on their appearance and clothes, you still like a materialistic person, it just looks different.

, If you’re attracted to someone then realize that they trigger some old habits, take note. For example, if you’ve just quit smoking then meet someone you’re attracted to who smokes, question your attraction to them. You might just want an excuse to justify your behavior to go back to smoking.


For example, if you’re an alcoholic, you might be attracted to other people who also drink in excess, even if they are very different from you. Notice if your attraction is based on something that might be harmful to you.

, If you find that you’re attracted to someone you know is trouble, stay away. It’s one thing to be attracted to someone, yet it’s another to act on the attraction. If you know someone is violent, dramatic, or a bad partner, acknowledge your attraction but stay far away. Some warning signs to look out for include possessiveness, mood swings, pressuring you to do things, and explosive anger.Don’t involve yourself with someone you consider dangerous or violent.

, If you find yourself always choosing the ‘wrong’ people in your love life, consider seeing a therapist. You may gain some insight as to why you’re attracted to people that are not ultimately good for you. If you’ve experienced trauma in the past and bring that to relationships, therapy can help you work through the trauma and move on with your life.Therapy can help you learn more about yourself and your patterns. Then, you can begin to create more positive patterns for your life.

, If you’re surprised and wonder why you’re attracted to someone, ask yourself if they fit in with the kind of person you want right now. For example, if you’re newly single and want to flirt with new people, you might be interested in people who flirt back or show an interest in you. Depending on what you want, act accordingly.If you want a fling and someone is available, then you might want to go for it. However, if you want a committed relationship and the person wants a fling, this ultimately does not align with what you want.

, If you tend to date people who are not a good fit for you, try to initiate something with this person. If it doesn’t feel natural at first, that’s okay. Give it a shot and see what happens. If you’re trying to break bad patterns, give someone who doesn’t fit your type a chance.Give yourself some time to adjust. Dating someone entirely new might feel uncomfortable at first, but give it a real chance to see if it might work well.

, Don’t just pursue someone because you want to see if you’re capable of liking them. Don’t lead someone on or play with their emotions, especially if their feelings are involved. It’s okay to try new things and date different people. However, if you know you are not emotionally invested, be honest with the person and tell them your intentions.


If you’re unsure about dating someone, don’t promise them commitments. Ask for more time in defining the relationship until you know what you want.

Share your boundaries with your social network.,
Be forthright about your limitations early on.,
Don’t justify.,
Be assertive when boundary violations occur.,
Cut off those who constantly test your boundaries.",How to Set Dating Boundaries That Make You Feel Safe2," Set yourself up for success. You can weed out poor matches by being vocal about your boundaries to potential dates. Inform pals and coworkers who are trying to set you up. Place a disclaimer in your online dating profile.


For example, in your online dating profile, you might say something like ""I'm interested in a serious relationship"" to let people know you aren't interested in casually dating., Rather than leading your dates on or fooling yourself into thinking they will suddenly change, be clear upfront about what you expect in a relationship. Use discretion, however. You don’t have to bring a list of your boundaries on the first date. But, it may be nice to share a few in casual conversation to ensure your date understands what you’re looking for.For example, if you expect someone you like to be exclusive with you, you’ll need to share this. You might say, “I really like you, and I’m not seeing anyone else. Are you?”

, No matter how rigid your boundaries seem, refuse to defend them to your dates. If you come off like you have to explain yourself, you won’t appear firm on your boundaries. Express what your boundaries are in simple terms and move on.Say, for instance, your date asks if they can come back to your place. You should reply “I like to get to know someone before inviting them to my house. I hope you understand.” This appears like you are firm on your limitations as opposed to a vague “Not tonight,” which may prompt them to see if they can change your mind.

, Remain firm with your boundaries no matter how uncomfortable it feels. Chances are dates are going to push the envelope a few times to see how steady your limitations are. Expect this and respond with assertiveness.For instance, you already told your date that you won’t be inviting them back to your house. The next week they try again. Simply say, “No. I’ve already told you that won’t be happening. I thought I made myself clear.”

, If you meet someone who tries to persuade you to violate a boundary, end the relationship as soon as possible. While it can come off as romantic that a date claims they are so head-over-heels for you that they want to toss out the rulebook, you don’t want to be with someone who sees your limitations as negotiable.


Cut off contact with this person by deleting their number and removing them as a social contact. If they call, you might choose to explain, but you can also just ignore them. They will get the message. You don’t have to explain yourself to someone who compromises your safety."
"
Disclose personal information gradually.,
Hold off on physical intimacy until you feel ready.,
Say “no” to alcohol or drugs.,
Trust your gut.,
Develop a safety plan.",How to Set Dating Boundaries That Make You Feel Safe3," There’s a prototypical scene in many people’s heads of meeting the perfect someone, and spilling your deepest secrets on the first date. However, disclosing too much too fast can leave you feeling unsafe in the long run.Take your time sharing the intimate details of your life over a span of dates. Better yet, try to match their pace. If they don’t seem overly forthcoming when sharing private information, neither should you.
Regardless of how much your date claims to share, make sure you are being careful when meeting up with blind dates or people you meet online. Withhold qualifying details like your last name, place of work, and info about your family until you get to know the person better.

, A date should never try to speed up to second base without your consent. Listen to your gut and only do what you feel comfortable doing.


Also keep in mind that sex is not a form of currency. If your date has paid for dinner or a movie, that doesn’t mean you have to “reimburse” them with sex.
Never put yourself in a situation where you might be unsafe. That’s why it’s important to be clear with your stance on sex early on. Also, avoid going to their place during the first couple of dates—in case it’s difficult for you to get away or if they become pushy., These substances compromise your judgment and can threaten your safety while dating. It’s best to set a clear boundary that you do not drink or you only have one drink per date. This doesn’t have to be explained to your date. Just remind yourself of this commitment and stick to it., While you should try your best to avoid risky situations like drinking with someone you're unfamiliar with, you also want to tune into your instincts. Everything could seem to be going well on a date. But, if the person gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad about cutting the date short. Or, phone a friend to come and pick you up if the person is supposed to give you a ride.

, Safe dating is all about being prepared. If you and a group of friends are all dating, take turns joining each other on the first few dates. A friend could inconspicuously sit in a restaurant where you're meeting a date. That way, they can get a good look at your date, and be available if you need to make a quick exit.


It may also be helpful to carry cash for a cab or plan your own transportation. Another handy tip is to place a whistle in your bag if you need to call out for help.
Opt for neutral, public settings like restaurants for the first meetings. And, always make sure a friend or family member knows where you are.If you are meeting someone from online, keep a record of all your communications with the person just in case.

"
Use your boundaries to choose dates.,
Demand to be treated with respect.,
Refuse to wait.,
Get professional help.",How to Set Dating Boundaries That Make You Feel Safe4," The best way to preserve your boundaries in dating relationships is to start off on a good foot. If your boundaries are firmly in place, you should avoid getting involved with someone who obviously won’t respect them. Be aware and listen to your gut. This can save you from trouble down the line.


If you have a sense that the other person is playing games, is only out for sex, or is lying, stop there. There’s no use wasting your time. If someone starts out violating boundaries, this behavior will only continue.
For example, you are looking for a committed relationship, but the other person tells you they are just interested in casual sex. There’s no need to take the encounter any further. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you will change someone’s mind. Move on to someone who’s looking for the same thing you are.

, Not every date may be the perfect lady or gentleman, but they should still treat you with basic human decency. Watch out for people who call you names (even if they declare it’s a joke), stand you up for dates, or don’t respect your privacy.If you feel disrespected by a date early on, they may not be redeemable. Let's say a guy calls you ""chick."" You might choose to correct them: “I’d appreciate it if you stuck to Tiffany. That’s my name.” But, if it happens again, know that by staying you are sending a message that you’re okay with disrespect.

, The expectation to wait can manifest in several ways while dating. Firstly, you may meet someone who is currently in a relationship, and expects you to play second fiddle. Or, you might be with someone who is toying with you and has no real interest in taking the relationship to the next level. Both of these situations should be avoided at all costs.


Sure enough, a relationship never unfolds how you plan. But, if you find yourself constantly breaking your own rules to keep someone, that’s a sign to let them go., If you find yourself unable to state your boundaries in a relationship or if you have trouble enforcing them, contact a professional therapist. They can help you find ways to assert your boundaries and to establish healthy, mutually respectful relationships."

Evaluate the actions in question.,
Be honest about your feelings.,
Point out the problem.,
Say your farewells if things don't work out.",How to React if a Guy Tries to Make You Jealous1," When dealing with a crush who makes you jealous, you might wonder if his efforts at jealousy are intentional or accidental--and if you don't ask yourself this question, you probably should. Your crush might flirt with other girls in front of you to get your attention, but it's also possible that he's just a natural flirt who does it without thinking.


This issue typically occurs when the guy in question flirts with you and several other girls. It can be hard to know if he genuinely likes you, or if he's flirting indiscriminately. To figure out if he might like you more than the other girls he flirts with, ask yourself if there's a difference between his flirtation with you and his flirtation with others.
For instance, when you see him in the hallway, pay attention to where his eyes are. If he immediately locks eyes with you, that's probably a good sign. On the other hand, if he's looking at another girl and barely acknowledges you (or doesn't acknowledge you at all), that's probably a bad sign.Try not to assume that a guy who talks endlessly about his girlfriend in front of you is doing so to make you jealous. It's possible that he's genuinely head-over-heels for her and just trying to let you know.Even if he's honestly using his girlfriend to make you jealous and spur romantic feelings in you, the disloyalty and disrespect this behavior demonstrates should be a warning sign telling you to stay away from a potentially toxic mate.;
, If you think your crush really is trying to make you jealous, the best thing you can do is tell him how you feel. There's a decent chance that his actions are caused by insecurity about how you feel. Letting him know that your feelings of attraction are mutual may resolve the problem.This step is easier said than done, of course, and you do face the risk of rejection by following through and telling your crush you want to date him. Even so, clearing the air is the only way to fix the issue before it gets worse.
Wait until the next time you two find yourselves flirting in a private, one-on-one setting, then let him know you're interested in something more. Wait for his response before determining how to approach the topic of jealousy.

, You'll need to deal with the jealousy issue regardless of how your crush responds to your feelings, but the exact method will vary on his reply.


If your crush is interested in dating you, let him know in a casual, joking manner that he needs to save his flirting for you. Try to avoid making him feel guilty, but make it clear that you don't want him flirting with other girls.If your crush is lukewarm or rejects the idea of dating you, politely ask him to tone down the flirting he does with you. Dealing with regular flirtation from a guy who won't commit will only play with your emotions; it isn't healthy for either of you to continue like that., If your crush doesn't change his ways after you tell him your feelings and point out the problem, you're better off cutting ties.Starting a relationship with a guy who can't stop flirting will likely lead to continued frustration and insecurity, which will damage the relationship in the long run.
Continuing a friendship with a one-sided crush is always difficult, but if he's continuing to lead you on when he should know better, the best thing you can do for yourself is move on.

Discuss your feelings.,
Stay calm.,
Offer some reassurance.,
Manage your own insecurities.",How to React if a Guy Tries to Make You Jealous2," Sit down with your boyfriend and let him know how his recent actions are making you feel. Try to set boundaries about behaviors that are and aren't acceptable.It's possible that your boyfriend isn't actually trying to make you jealous, and simply isn't aware of the fact that his interactions with another girl are causing you to feel jealous. Letting him know can help limit the behavior in the future.Even if he meant to make you jealous, it's possible that he has his own insecurities with the relationship. Opening the topic up to discussion can give you both the chance to talk things over while also giving him the chance to reassure you about his feelings., Before, during, and after your discussion, you need to remain calm. Don't explode when your boyfriend says or does something that makes you feel jealous.


Talk about your feelings using ""I"" statements (i.e. ""I feel..."") instead of placing blame (i.e. ""You make me feel..."").
If the misunderstanding is genuine, staying calm with help you work things out more completely and with as little conflict as possible.
If your boyfriend is intentionally trying to push your buttons, however, exploding at him will only give him the reaction he wants. Instead of responding the way he expects, keep your cool and be the mature one when you talk things out. If his behavior continues even after you bring the issue to his attention, he might have some toxic control issues, and it might be in your best interest to break things off., Oftentimes, a guy may try to make you jealous because he feels insecure about your feelings for him. His insecurity doesn't make the behavior acceptable, but it does make it quite normal.His attempts at making you jealous might be his way of trying to capture your attention. By ""reminding"" you that he's a catch, he's trying to win more of your affection.
Try to reconnect with your boyfriend to give him the reassurance he needs. Compliment him. Be appreciative when he does good things for you. Cuddle, kiss, and be intentional about giving him signs of physical affection as you feel comfortable with., In addition to dealing with your boyfriend's insecurities, you also have to manage your own. Being more confident about your self-worth will usually make it easier to stop obsessing over feelings of jealousy,ultimately leaving you with more energy to strengthen your relationship.


Show compassion to yourself. Admit it when you fall victim to jealous, and assure yourself that it's a natural feeling you don't need to be ashamed of. Only by accepting the feeling at face value can you learn to overcome it.
Take time to focus on your own interests independent of the relationship. Developing yourself as an individual can make it easier to see what you bring to the relationship, which can make it easier to accept that your boyfriend loves you."
"
Ignore him.If your ex-boyfriend is intentionally trying to throw his new relationship in your face, giving him a jealous response will mean giving him exactly what he wants.,
Limit his opportunities.,
Avoid rebounds.,
Resist the temptation to get back together.",How to React if a Guy Tries to Make You Jealous3," Don't respond when he talks to you via email, texting, or social media. If he tries making you jealous in person, reply in as neutral a manner as possible before ending the conversation and walking away.


In addition to not replying to him directly, you also need to resist the temptation to post that vague, passive-aggressive status update on Facebook or Twitter, and avoid complaining to mutual friends who might let him know.
Stay persistent. It's possible that he may put more effort into making you jealous initially, but if you're consistent, he should eventually get the message that it won't work.

, If he's especially stubborn and the behavior is really getting to you, respond by cutting him off. Unfriend, unfollow, and block him via social media. If things get really bad, block his phone number from your phone and mark his email address as spam.He might temporarily feel pleased upon realizing that he succeeded in making you upset, but now that he's unable to continue the behavior, he'll have no choice but to stop it.

, You might feel tempted to fight fire with fire--or, in this case, fight jealousy with jealousy--but this usually isn't a good idea. Getting into a new relationship just to make your ex jealous won't be fair to you or the new guy you start dating.


Furthermore, flaunting around a new boyfriend you genuinely like can damage the new relationship, too. Using your boyfriend to get back at your ex keeps your focus on the old relationship--and adding fuel to the fires of jealousy will mean keeping the war between you and your ex alive indefinitely. You'll be much better off cutting ties with your ex and focusing on your attentions solely on your new sweetheart.

, Even if the opportunity to get back together with your ex comes up, and even if you're tempted to take it, don't. An ex who goes out of his way to make you jealous is clearly capable of hurting you. This is not the sort of guy who's worthy of your love and affection."

Give the girl some space.,
Think about what went wrong.,
Make a game plan for addressing the problem.,
Work on yourself.",How to Make a Girl Want You Back1," Though you may think that the best way to get your girl back is to fight for her tooth and nail, you're actually better off giving her some breathing room than fighting for her affection right away. Unless it's getting serious between her and another guy and you're determined to break them up, you should play it cool until she has time to heal and to get a fresh perspective on the relationship.


This doesn't mean that you should cut off communication completely unless you think that's best. But you shouldn't text her every five minutes or ask her to hang out with you all the time, unless you want to scare her off.
If you give her space, she'll also be more likely to think about you. She'll think, ""I haven't heard from in a while. That must mean that he's just fine without me..."" This will intrigue her and make her wonder what you're up to.
If she initiates a hang out early on, fine. But don't come on too strong when you do get together.
Giving her space is also a sign of maturity. This will make her want you even more.
It goes without saying: don't go too long before you swoop in enough again. Wait long enough so she has time to heal, but not so long that she forgets all of the wonderful things about you. Each situation is different -- feel it out. Though as a general rule, give it at least a few weeks, but no longer than two months.;
, While you're giving your girl some space, don't just sit idly by and wait for the clock to run its course. Instead, think about why things ended between the two of you. If it was something obvious like you not giving her enough time, great. But if it was something more complicated -- a combination of her not feeling appreciated enough and you spending too much time partying, for example -- than you need to pinpoint the problem or problems that caused your love to fizzle out.


If she was the one who ended things, then you will have more of a challenge on your hands. Think about all of the reasons she ended it; if she ended it abruptly, look through old emails or texts to see if you can pinpoint the problem.
If you're the one that ended it, then you may have a different challenge on your hands. You have to convince her that you won't break her heart -- again.

, Once you've located the problem, it's up to you to find a solution. If there are several problems, well, then you'll need to find several solutions, or an overarching solution that tackles all of these problems. If it ended because you spent way too much time with your friends, find a way to make her a bigger priority by setting up weekly date nights and coming up with new things you want to do together. If it ended because of your inability to communicate, practice honesty and compassion in your everyday relationships.


Part of fixing the problem will mean working on yourself. There's no way that you were blameless in the relationship.
Another part of the game plan will mean that you'll have to work on how you perceive her; if her obsession with horses drove you nuts, find a way for it to not annoy you before you move on.
If you have to work out some major issues, then make a long-term plan for how you'll do it, whether it's going to therapy, dropping an addiction, or giving yourself a major personality overhaul in some regard.

, Even if you think you've found the exact problem and solution that would win your girl back instantly, it's rarely ever that simple. Instead, you need to work on making yourself a more desirable person overall. When you come crawling back to your girl, she will see the difference. This means working on yourself inside and out; though getting a new haircut won't impress her, looking like you're more happy to be alive and that you're more conscious of the image you're projecting will catch her attention.


Devote more time to your favorite hobbies, whether it's biking or mechanics. Being more excited about your interests will make you a more fun person to talk to.
Work on developing a more positive attitude toward life. If she feels happier just from being around you, then she'll be more likely to keep wanting to see you.

Ask yourself why you’re not into it.,
Tell your FWB the reason why.,
Give them an alternative.",How to Say No to Your Friend with Benefits1," If you feel less than excited about having a little “benefits” time with your FWB when they suggest it, take a step back and examine your own reaction. Figure out why the idea doesn’t appeal to you at the moment. Of course, the reason might be pretty obvious (like, you just took a tumble off of your bike and your body hurts all over), but if not, ask yourself:“Am I upset with my FWB over something they did?”
“Am I distracted by all the stuff I have to do for school or work or anything else?”
“Am I just too exhausted to hook up right now?”;
, Once you’ve figured out exactly why you’re not feeling up to it, share it with them. Whether it’s because they’ve upset you or it's due to something else entirely, be honest with them. Keeping them in the dark could hurt their feelings and make them resentful, so keep your friendship alive and healthy by letting them know the score. For example:“I want to keep hooking up, but if we’re going to, you have to know that you hurt my feelings when you did/said __.”
“I’m sorry, but I have to finish these projects for school/work/etc. before I can play.”
“I’d love to hook up right now, but I’m too zonked out to be any fun.”

, Soften your “no” with a promise of things to come. Offer other options to assure them that this isn’t a blanket rejection. Show them that you’re still interested in maintaining your “benefits” status even though you’re not up for it this very second by either making concrete plans for later or offering them a reward for their patience, like:“I can’t right now, but let’s definitely get together this weekend.”
“Maybe I’ll call you once I’ve finished all this work, and we can talk dirty.”
“I don’t know when I’ll be free, but maybe I’ll make it worth the wait and we can try something new.”

Let her see that you're doing just fine without her.,
Make her friends see that she needs you.,
Slowly approach her when the time is right.,
Show her you've changed.,
Play hard to get.,
Make sure she wants you back.,
Tell her how you feel.",How to Make a Girl Want You Back2," If she hears that you've been absolutely miserable, crying in public, and shouting her name out on street corners, she'll be turned off quicker than you can say, ""I miss you!"" Instead, you want her to hear -- and see -- that you're having a great time going about your everyday life without her by your side. She'll see you as a dynamic person who has a lot going for him, and will begin to wonder why you're not openly showing signs of missing her more.


Casually hang out at a place where you're both likely to be. Make sure you show up with friends and she sees you laughing and having a good time without overdoing it.
If you see her socially, like at a party, don't drop everything you're doing to run up and ask how she's doing. Come up to her eventually -- but let her see that you have a busy social life without her.

, It's a fact: you will never be able to make your girl want you back if her friends can't stand you. If her friends don't like you because you were too controlling, not caring enough towards them, or just because you were a bad boyfriend, then your job is to make them think that maybe you weren't so bad after all -- and to pass this information on to the girl you want.


If you run in to her friends, make a conscious effort to make small talk without being too obvious about it.
If you talk to her friends, don't bring her up immediately. Though you can casually ask how she's doing and really let them see that you're hurting, if you're open to being so vulnerable.

, After enough time has passed and you've made it back on her radar, you should slowly start to make your way back into her life. It can be as simple as stopping to have a five minute conversation if you run into her, or casually sliding your tray next to hers at lunch, or even texting her if you know that she'll love something that's about to start playing on TV.


Keep it cool. Be sweet to her while making her wonder if you are just looking to be friends. Don't shower her with compliments the second she hangs out with you again.
Once you've started talking again, up the ante. Invite her to do something simple, like grab coffee or check out a lecture together. Don't ask her to do anything romantic quite yet.

, You can let her see that you're a changed man without shouting, ""Look how different I am!"" Just spend enough time with her to see that you really have changed your ways, if changing your ways was necessary. If she thought you were too messy, put an effort into your appearance. If she criticized you for always showing up late, make a conscious effort to show up early to your next coffee date. Don't point out these changes; let her see for herself and she will be truly impressed.


These changes should feel natural to you. Don't change something about yourself just to please her, or you'll fall right back to your old ways the first chance you get.
If you feel like you really hurt her while you were dating, it's never too late to apologize. She will be touched that you've put that much thought into the relationship after it ended.







, That's right. Just when you think you're about to get your girl back, just when she's finally realizing what an amazing catch you were, is not the time to declare your love. Instead, throw her a curve ball by making her see that she still has to fight for your affection instead of just falling into your arms. As you start to hang out more and more, make sure to not always be available.


Go MIA for a few hours and make her wonder where you are. Her mind will be racing.
If you've gone on dates, mention them without being too descriptive, so she really thinks that she can lose you.

, Once you feel like you've grabbed her attention and have even made her a little jealous, it's time to check in to make sure that she really wants you back before you tell her how you really feel. Though you don't have to know how she feels with 100% certainty, the more sure you are that she wants you back, the less likely you'll be to embarrass yourself. Here are some signs that she wants you back:


Check out her body language. When you talk to her, does she lean closer to you and make eye contact, looking at the floor every time she gets embarrassed?
See if she's jealous. Does she ask if you're seeing other women, or look upset if she sees you talking to other girls? If so, then she may want you all to herself.
See if she's started treating you like a boyfriend again. Has she given you hugs, compliments, and asked you to go on date-like adventures?

, Once you're pretty sure that she shares your feelings, there's no point in beating around the bush. Find a time when you can both be alone and pick a place that is just a little bit romantic and gives you the privacy that you need. Then, look into her eyes and tell her how much you've missed her, and how much you'd like to date her again. You don't have to grovel, but you should show her that you've put a lot of thought into the failed relationship and that you're determined to make it work this time.


Be specific. Show her how you've made an effort to change instead of making empty promises.
Give her time. If she's reluctant at first, don't get angry or disappointed. Remember that even if she does want you back, she still wants to protect her heart.

Give your new relationship a fresh start.,
Don't make the same mistakes.,
Don't overthink it.,
Remember to be yourself.",How to Make a Girl Want You Back3," If you're lucky enough that your girl wants to give it another go, then you should try to start fresh as much as you can. Though you can go back to enjoying some of the same restaurants, TV shows, and things that you loved together, it's important to pick some new activities and relationship strategies so your relationship doesn't feel like another version of your former dating experience.


Though you can bring up the happy memories, try to avoid thinking or talking about any bad experiences you've shared, unless you can laugh about them.
Don't take her for granted. Just because you're dating again doesn't mean that you shouldn't take the time to let her know how much you care about her.
Take it slow. Treat it like you're starting a new relationship instead of jumping right back into an old one. Don't spend all of your time together right away, even if that's what you were doing before you broke up.

, Though you shouldn't constantly worry about the relationship ending, you should be conscious of whatever it was that made your relationship fail the first time. If it failed because you spent too much time with your friends and you find yourself hanging out with your friends all the time again, cut back a bit. And if it ended because of something that she did, have an honest conversation about it if it comes up again.


Remember how awful you felt when you made those mistakes the first time. You don't want to go through that pain again.

, Though you should be conscious of the mistakes you made, you cannot obsess over them or you will doom your relationship to failure before it has a chance to start off on the right foot. If a bad situation arises, you can remember what happened the last time and proceed with caution, but don't constantly worry about messing things up or you won't be able to truly enjoy your time together.


If you're always worrying about messing things up, your girl will be able to tell, and that won't make the relationship very enjoyable for her.

, Though if you needed to make a dramatic change (for the better) to be in the relationship, then so be it, but you shouldn't walk around like a dog with his tail between his legs because you're so set on making up on whatever hurt you caused that you can't relax. In the end, your girl started dating you the first time because of who you are, so don't forget to let her see the parts of your personality that she loved the most.


If you feel like you can't be yourself without causing a major problem to the relationship, then you have to rethink your priorities.
Have confidence. Remember that she loves you -- not just a more meek version of yourself who is desperate for her affection.

Know why you want to nix the benefits.Go back to the beginning of your “unofficial” relationship.,
Choose how to break up.,
Be upfront with your FWB.,
Brace yourself for the break-up.,
Keep communicating.",How to Say No to Your Friend with Benefits2," Review the reasons why the two of you became friends with benefits to begin with instead of an “official” couple. Now ask yourself how the situation has changed:Have either one of you met someone new whom you’d rather be with?
Is your casual arrangement growing into something too serious for you to handle?
Are you unsatisfied with keeping things casual?

, Break-ups between committed partners traditionally warrant a face-to-face meeting or a conversation over the phone. If you feel that you should honor your preexisting friendship with the same respect, break up in person or over the phone so you can talk it over immediately. But since your FWB situation is (or is supposed to be) more casual, feel free to send the message via text or email.Just be sure to use straight-to-the-point words so there is no room for misinterpretations, since you won't be there to clarify. Instances where text or email might be preferable include:When you feel like your resolve might weaken in direct conversation.
If your FWB has a track record of being obstinate, manipulative, or slow on the uptake.
If you are in a long-distance relationship, have conflicting schedules, or face some other obstacle that makes seeing each other in person a chore even in the best of times.

, If you want to ditch the benefits but keep the friend, share the truth with them. Keep your friendship intact by communicating honestly. Let them know exactly how things stand so the two of you can figure out how to move forward as pals.Soothe their feelings by emphasizing what was positive about this time together, while making it clear that it has come to an end:


“What we have is obviously a lot of fun, but now that So-and-So and I are getting serious, it’s not really fair to them for us to keeping doing this.”
“I really enjoy what we have, but I feel like we’re becoming a little too involved, and I’m not ready for that.”
“I thought I could handle keeping things casual, but now I think I’m expecting too much, which isn’t fair to you.”

, Even though you and your FWB had a less than serious relationship, it was still a relationship,so expect all the awkward feelings and situations that follow a traditional break-up. Give your ex-FWB (and yourself) some alone-time to adjust to your new dynamic.Resist the urge to “force” your friendship.


Allow yourself to experience the sense of loss.
Spend more time with other friends and family.
Avoid hanging out with your ex-FWB right away, especially in situations that often led to the two of you cashing in on your benefits.

, A lot of FWB situations suffer because one or both friends keep their lips shut rather than risk the good time that they’re having.Whether or not this applied to your own relationship while the “benefits” part was still active, talk openly with your friend now in order to strengthen your friendship. Don’t pretend the whole FWB phase never happened. Catch and resolve issues that may develop after the fact before they grow into more serious problems.


If you feel jealous when they start dating someone new, admit to it. Even if you’re the one who broke things off, you’re still human, and the quicker you can laugh about it with your ex-FWB, the better.
If you feel tempted to relapse, or feel like your friend is still trying to claim benefits from you, talk about it so you can set up clear boundaries for the both of you to follow.

"
"
Break up directly.If you care about your FWB’s feelings, but don’t think you could ever go back to being just friends, have an honest conversation with them.,
Make sure they get the message.,
Remove them from your life.",How to Say No to Your Friend with Benefits3," End your relationship while honoring your friendship by letting them know exactly why you’ve made this decision. If needed, write a letter or email, either before or after talking with them directly, to express all the points you wish to make clearly so nothing is left unsaid:


“Now that I’m seeing So-and-So, I feel like I’m only being half-hearted with them because I still think of you as more than just a friend.”
“I’m not ready for a serious relationship, but it feels like that is where we ended up, and it wouldn’t be fair keep going just because it seems like that is the only way for us to stay friends at all.”
“I said at the start that I was fine with ‘no strings attached’ because I truly thought I was fine with it, but now I realize you mean much more to me than that, and I can’t go back to the way things were without pretending to be okay with that, too.”

, Use straight-to-the-point words to make it absolutely clear that things are over. Resist feeling obligated or being manipulated into providing some sort of exception that might lead to the resumption of benefits. Respect their feelings and avoid being hurtful (unless they really warrant it), but avoid sugar-coating the situation and leading them on with false hope.


If they continue to pursue benefits after you have told them that things are over, write them a text or email to restate your decision, using no uncertain terms, so that it is right there, in plain language, for them to see, without providing them a chance to argue the point., If your FWB refuses to accept the change in your status, reinforce your decision to move on by cutting off all ties. Unfriend them on social media. Take their phone number out of your phone. Delete old emails, voicemails, and other correspondence. Focus on a bright new future rather than dwell on the past.If you share the same circle of friends, make a point of seeing your other friends separately, especially if your ex-FWB continues to pester you at every given opportunity.


Exes often try to remain friends because one or both hope to reconnect some day.It may seem cold, but if you truly want to avoid relapsing with your FWB ever again, the best way is to commit to a life without them.

Make eye contact when listening.,
Ask her how particular situations make her feel.,
Give her your undivided attention, ignoring distractions.,
Let her know you are listening through your gestures.,
Don’t offer solutions to her problems.,
Resist mocking, laughing or being sarcastic.",How to Make a Girl Feel Good1," Don’t be too intense, though. That can look like you’re trying too hard. Also keep your face relaxed without too many animated expressions. If your face is going a mile a minute in everything she says, that can be distracting.;
, Girls usually have lots of feelings about things, and this gives her a chance to express them versus keeping them bottled up inside. If you sense that a situation was frustrating, difficult or upsetting, let her know. Even if she doesn’t say anything, she’ll notice and appreciate it.


It’s okay to not understand every aspect of a situation but don’t say that her feelings are wrong because feelings can never be wrong. Be careful to not blame her either when she shares something with you. Strive to be empathetic, not judgmental or overly harsh., Turn your cell phone off. Don’t look around the room or at other people. Listening well is an art form, and many people are poor listeners. Go the extra mile here. It will pay dividends in making her feel good.


Females secrete a feel-good hormone when expressing their feelings. By sharing things with you, she can’t help but also feel good about you. The more comfortable she is in talking to you, the safer she will feel, too, in opening up.

, Along with eye contact, show active listening skills by nodding your head and saying things that confirm you hear her like “I would feel the same way myself” or “I can see why you would feel that way.”


Don’t interrupt. Many people also find this difficult when listening to others. You will go far in making her feel good by waiting until she’s completely finished before commenting. This also goes both ways. When it’s your turn to talk, she’ll listen better to you, too., This can be challenging because it’s natural to want to immediately try and solve matters. First and foremost, though, she needs to feel heard. Jumping in with what you think is best could make her feel that you don’t trust her in solving them. So let her express herself and ask what she thinks is best. This will boost her confidence in situations, and she’ll appreciate this quality in you, too.


The more you understand where she is with an issue, the more she will trust that you can help her solve it. But wait until she asks before automatically giving your opinion. When you do give it, be thoughtful about it. Think what it’s like to be in her shoes before commenting.

, Sometimes what people say or how they say it can be humorous to the person listening. Pay attention to her body language. If she’s serious, then trust that it’s a serious matter. If you’re condescending, she could think you don’t understand her at a deeper level, not just that situation.

Be very cautious if she has violent tendencies.,
Listen to see if she refers to other people as crazy: ""my insane boss,"" ""my psycho ex,"" ""my crazy mother"".,
Note patterns of unpredictability.,
Consider how she talks about her past.,
Notice how much she builds herself up.,
Consider how quickly she tries to get close to you.,
Beware lying.,
Notice how she talks about her past relationships.,
Recognize that some disabilities or mental illnesses can cause unusual behavior.",How to Recognize the Potential Crazy Girlfriend1," She should never hit, kick, push, etc. her date (or anyone else). Nor should she be breaking things on purpose.

Some people will ""play fight,"" such as if she grew up wrestling her brother or trying to push him onto a couch. However, this play isn't meant to cause harm, and both parties consent to it.
Some people kick someone under the table, or play slap them, if they say something rude. However, these shouldn't cause real pain and shouldn't be upsetting to the recipient.
If she breaks things when upset, notice (1) whose things she breaks, and (2) who cleans up. If she's truly losing control, her things are just likely to be broken as yours. And if she's remorseful, she'll clean it up herself. But if she only breaks your things, and then has you clean it up, it's a power play.
Abusers are often very good at hiding their true selves, so they might not give any obvious signs until you're in it deep. Even then, they'll keep you questioning it. This is the nature of the abuser, and it's not your fault for not seeing it.;
, It's highly unlikely that everyone this woman associates with is irrational—the problem is most likely her.

Calling other people ""crazy"" is a red flag in general: it's dismissive and shows that the person may not think highly of people who don't act like the person wants.

, If she often switches jobs, friend groups, or living situations, then there's likely an underlying problem. Sometimes the problem isn't with her personality (for example, her awful parents kicked her out of the house at a young age and she had trouble finding a place to live for a while). Other times, the problem is her.

A long history of making enemies often means trouble.

, Some people have decent pasts, and some people have hard ones. If she's gone through a lot of hardship, she may be hesitant to open up to you, because it's painful and difficult. But if she's acting secretive or shifty, it may be that she has something to hide.

There's a difference between hiding genuine pain because she's not ready to share, and hiding secrets because she knows you wouldn't like what she's done. Are her motives honest, or manipulative?

, Some women are more confident than others, and it's normal if she jokingly compliments herself (such as if you say ""You're pretty"" and she says ""I know"" and gives you a flirty smile). But constantly building herself up could mean that she has self-centered tendencies, or serious self esteem issues that hamper her ability to have a real relationship.

Notice the difference between joking bragging and excessive bragging.

, It's okay for a girl to be forward if she likes you. However, if she tries to integrate herself too quickly into your life, without letting you have a say in it, then she may be obsessive.

Do you feel overwhelmed by how much she tries to contact you? Does she try to get involved in every aspect of your life: friends, family, etc.? A secure woman will feel comfortable letting you have some time to yourself, because she trusts you'll always come back to her.
If you feel pressured, tell her that you want to take it slowly. Say you'd be more comfortable that way. If she listens, then she's excited but clearly respectful of you. If she refuses to accept your boundaries, then it may be time to break it off.

, A good girlfriend is honest, even if she think you might not like what she has to say. She shouldn't be hiding things, constantly dodging questions, or keeping big secrets.

Sometimes people will tell white lies (like ""yes, I like your tie""). This is ordinary and not a big deal.
As you two become close, she should be open about exes (if they come up), and whether she's seeing them at all in her life.
Don't expect her to share everything with you. She doesn't need to tell you what she ate for breakfast, or the precise details of her time with friends. A good relationship has a healthy balance of truth-telling: saying the things that are important, and leaving out minor details that don't matter.

, A mature person will admit she's not perfect, and that past breakups may have been partially her fault. She usually won't talk extremely negatively about her exes, unless they were truly awful or if she's still caught up in her feelings.

If she badmouths her past dates, she may talk the same way about you later.
Consider if she conflates facts and feelings, or calls names. ""I felt really pressured and uncomfortable, so I broke it off"" is different from ""My ex girlfriend was an obsessive stalker-like creep.""
A mature woman might say things like ""We were a bad match"" or ""He wanted so much space I didn't feel like his girlfriend anymore,"" acknowledging two perspectives. She may have had a few experiences that were completely the other person's fault (e.g. an abusive ex). But, depending on the circumstances, she won't always place 100% of the blame on the other person.

, Not all differences mean that your girlfriend is undateable. Some people have issues outside their control. As long as she never makes you feel unsafe, then she'll be a good girlfriend as long as you enjoy spending time with her.

A girlfriend with an anxiety disorder might get very worried sometimes, need reassurance, and hyperventilate over things that feel small or overblown to you (such as thinking you'll leave her even though there's no way you would).
A girlfriend with bipolar disorder may have mood swings she can't control.
An autistic girlfriend might be sensitive, act eccentric at times, and have awful crying episodes when she gets overwhelmed. She just needs to ""cry it out"" and rest, and then she'll be back to normal.

"
Make her feel good through small, protective gestures.,
Respond in a relaxed manner if she says something in an awkward way.,
Offer to give her a foot massage or shoulder rub.,
Reach for her hand when walking.,
Compliment her on how she looks.,
Ask her if the indoor temperature is too warm or too cold.",How to Make a Girl Feel Good2," A girl likes to know you are watching out for her. A fine balance is important here, though. You don’t want her to feel that you’re watching every move she makes. That’s too controlling. Just be natural with the small things that come up; she can’t help but notice and feel good!


Offer your arm when crossing the street.
Wait until she’s safely in her house before leaving.
If you haven’t seen her for a few days, give her a call to see if she’s okay.
If she’s sick, call and ask her if she wants you to come by with some magazines or a book., Calmly, and not too seriously, laugh and say something like “It’s okay, whatever.” Try and make her feel comfortable no matter what she says. If she smiles, then that’s good. She will feel that, even during her goofy times, you fully accept her for who she is.

, With how much time people spend hunched over computers and smartphones these days, volunteering to reduce any pent-up tension can definitely make her feel good! Do it slow, though, with medium pressure. The tendency, if it’s not your occupation, is to go too fast with light pressure. But that can make her feel even more stressed. Whether it’s her foot or shoulder, knead the area in a relaxed, slow manner, and watch her melt like butter under your hands!

, Most girls are romantic at-heart and holding her hand as you stroll together in the world can make her feel special. It also lets her know that you’re comfortable showing others that you are together. Keep your clasp relaxed, though, not a death grip! If you’ve just started going out, only do it occasionally. If she grabs your hand, that’s a great sign.

, Don’t automatically assume that she knows. Either way, she wants to hear it from you. She doesn’t have to be all dressed up for you to say it. Most girls make an effort to look pretty, even with a casual outfit, and letting her know that you think so, too, can go a long way in making her feel good.

, All of these small niceties convey to her that you care enough to ask. It also shows that you’re not just thinking of yourself. Be careful to not go overboard, though. Gauge your actions based on what’s seems logical for the situation.

"
"
Set up a romantic table just for the two of you.,
Make an easy, but tasty, pasta dish served with fresh bread and salad.,
Do your prep work.,
Play dinner music in the background, like R & B, jazz or soft rock.,
Prepare an easy, but delicious, chocolaty dessert with coffee or tea.",How to Make a Girl Feel Good3," Put fresh flowers in a vase. Place candles in the center. Arrange the table in an attractive way. Even if you don’t do it perfectly, she will still be impressed with your efforts, especially if it’s not something that comes naturally to you.


If you do something wrong, that’s okay. The important thing is that you tried. It will probably bring out the humor in her if you mess part of it up anyway. Many seasoned chefs, however, recommend not cooking a meal that you’ve never made before. So consider it whipping it for yourself once before inviting her over.
Don’t worry about having the best of the best. Keeping it real is important, too. If you can’t afford crystal glasses at this point in your career, that’s fine. You want her to accept all aspects of you and your life. If she truly cares for you as a person, then she won’t mind one bit!

, If you’re not a natural in the kitchen, pasta is one of the easiest dishes to make. Plus, if you don’t know whether or not she’s vegetarian, then it’s a safe bet, too. Bread and salad are also good accompaniments because then you don’t have to worry about cooking side dishes at the same time as the pasta., If you wait to do everything until she arrives, you could be slaving away the whole time versus spending quality time with her. Basically do everything that you can in advance. For the pasta, it’s good to have everything ready except for actually dropping it in the boiling water. Prepare the salad in advance.


Try and avoid having her feel as if she needs to take over for you in the kitchen!

, When she arrives, asks if she likes it. If not, ask her to put something on that she likes better. Many girls feel that guys aren’t caring enough and/or have a caveman mentality. Pulling out all the stops conveys to her that you have overcome these odds to make her happy!

, Making anything chocolate can make a girl feel not only good but great! There’s truth behind this, too. Chocolate contains a compound called phenylethylamine, a natural feel-good chemical linked to the release of endorphins. Offering coffee or tea with it can give both of you an extra energy burst if you served wine with dinner."
"
Think about her perspective.,
Consider how you might be able to handle the situation better.,
Try clear communication.,
Work out boundaries.,
Consider your expectations and feelings.,
Make a clean break if you break up with her.,
Leave a toxic relationship.",How to Recognize the Potential Crazy Girlfriend2," How does she see things? What does she need? Understanding her side of the story can help you relate to her and figure out how to make the both of you happy.

If you don't know why she's doing something, tell her ""I don't understand why you ____. Could you explain your point of view to me?""
In rare cases, her perspective might be something to understand but not honor. You don't have to give up your boundaries or tolerate abuse. For example, if her goal is to insult you and make you feel that only she will love you, that is terrible and wrong.

, Many times, relationship problems are two-sided. Instead of fighting with her, try to work together with her to make both of you satisfied.

For example, if she wants more time with her friends, and you are worried about drifting apart, perhaps you two decide that she has a girl's night on Friday, and then comes back to watch a movie, snuggle, and relax with you. This could start a tradition that you both enjoy.
Or if she wants to talk on the phone for a long time but you have a deadline, you could tell her that you have 15 minutes, devote those minutes completely to her, and then tell her you'll be able to talk more tomorrow.

, It may be that your girlfriend has different expectations than you do, or doesn't realize how you feel about her behavior. Use ""I"" language to express how you feel.

For example, ""I feel overwhelmed when you send a lot of texts in a short period of time. If you just send me one, I'll text back as soon as I'm able.""
Or ""I felt hurt when you teased me about my haircut.""
A good girlfriend will listen to ""I"" statements, and try to avoid upsetting you again.

, Both of you deserve to be able to have alone time, have a social life outside of dating, and reveal very personal details only when you are ready. Neither one should be pushing the other.

If you feel pressured, say so. Ask that she give you a little space when you're elsewhere, and trust that you'll come back ready to devote time to her.
Similarly, let her have her own privacy and time alone or with friends. You don't need to know every detail of her life. This is important in showing that you trust her.

, You should stay in a relationship because you enjoy it, and because you feel that the hard times are worth it. If you feel like it isn't working, you're allowed to break it off.

Don't stay in order to ""fix"" a girl's issues. That's not your job, and she's the one who needs to take the initiative. You can be supportive if she wants to change, but you can't change her.

, Some people have a hard time taking ""no"" for an answer, and if your girlfriend is one of them, expect her to be very difficult to deal with.

Don't invite her over.
If she leaves lots of messages, give one message asking her to stop contacting you. Then block her if she continues.
Tell your family and friends that you are broken up and don't want to see her anymore.
Ask your mutual friends not to talk about it with you. Explain that you don't want them to take sides; you just want to move on.

, Some people are toxic, and you should get out as safely as you can (if possible). If your girlfriend ignores your boundaries, follows you, belittles you, or hurts you (it doesn't have to be hitting), then you have a very serious problem. No one deserves to be treated this way.

Get advice from supportive loved ones.
Ask a counselor or trained expert for advice if your girlfriend scares you.
Don't go back to her. She may draw you back in. Even if it seems nice or she says she's changed, change takes time and the will to change, and it's likely it'll be just the same.

Consider your partner’s feelings.,
Buffer your responses.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Look at your partner as a whole.",How to Learn Patience in a Relationship1," One way to deter impatience in your relationship is to think about how your actions and attitudes will affect your partner. If you are patient and kind with your partner, they will feel loved and adored. If you are impatient and intolerant, your partner is likely to feel rejected by you. Keeping this in mind will help motivate you to be patient in your relationship.For example, if your partner forgets to stop and buy milk, saying “That’s okay, we’ll just get it later,” shows that you understand it was a simple mistake. If you instead say something like “I can’t believe you did this again. You always forget everything,” you are implying that your partner is flawed and that their mistakes are unacceptable.;
, Many people turn immediately to an impatient response. They assume that mistakes or inconveniences are the result of incompetence and carelessness. This leads to having a bleak outlook on those around you, and will likely cause you to say hurtful things before you even have time to think about what you are saying. To break this habit, use a buffer to force yourself to think before responding.For example, you could make it a personal rule that when something frustrating happens, you take three deep breaths before you say anything at all. This will give you time to process the situation and respond appropriately.
In a more serious situation, you could leave the room or go for a walk. This will allow you time to cool down and think about your reaction.

, Patience comes with understanding. One of the first things you will need to understand about your partner is that they are not perfect. When you set unrealistic expectations for your partner or decide that things absolutely must go a certain way, you will inevitably be disappointed. This disappointment will lead to impatience and frustration in the relationship. Avoid this by having reasonable expectations for your partner.An example of an unreasonable expectation might be thinking that your partner should be home at exactly 5:30 every day, even though they have a 25 minute commute and work until 5:00. This leaves little to no time to account for things like walking to the car, or changes in traffic, and ultimately sets your partner up to fail. A reasonable expectation, on the other hand, would be to expect your partner to let you know if they get held up or will be late getting home for some reason.
Another example of unreasonable expectations is to expect your significant other to always want to watch the same shows that you want to watch. Instead, you could expect that they allow you to choose some of the time, and you allow them to choose other times.

, No relationship is perfect. There will inevitably be points of tension between you and your partner from time to time. Instead of letting this tension define your relationship during those times, keep in mind the things you love about your partner. When you see your partner as a whole, it is easier to be patient through stressful times.For example, if your partner does something that really annoys you, like tapping their foot, do not let that pet peeve take precedence over all of the good qualities that you love in your partner.
You might also notice that some expressions your significant other uses often seem repetitive to you. Keep in mind that you are likely around them more than anyone else, and that you hear their stories and phrases more, too. Remember that these things are part of the whole person that you fell in love with.

Ask his friends and family.,

Keep it a surprise.,
Pay attention to presentation.,
Pair it with a thoughtful note.",How to Know What to Get Your Boyfriend for His Birthday," What does he do in his spare time? What does he read about and watch videos on? What does he spend his money on? Thinking about questions like these will give you a great start towards choosing the perfect present for your boyfriend. Anything that helps him pursue these is sure to make him smile.


Put yourself in his shoes. Think about what he might buy for himself if he had the money and wanted to treat himself. People who do this tend to give gifts that the recipient loves more often than people who don't try seeing things from another point of view.;
, He knows his birthday is coming up and that you’re obligated to get him something just as well as you do. He’ll probably try to help you out by dropping some hints into your normal conversations. Expect to start hearing hints about three or four weeks before his birthday comes. If he brings something up multiple times, it’s something you should definitely investigate further.


Depending on your boyfriend’s personality, these hints might be pretty subtle. He may not come right out and say that he’d really like it if someone got him the collector’s edition of his favorite movie series. He’s much more likely to say something like, “I saw this box set came out a few weeks ago, it looked really cool!” if he tends to be more reserved.

, He may be more comfortable talking about what he wants for his birthday with his friends and family than he is with you. Talk to them when your boyfriend isn’t around to see if they have any ideas that might help. If you decide to go with something that they mention, make sure to ask them to keep it a secret.

, Your boyfriend is probably around your friends a lot of the time. If you’re feeling stressed about how to get your boyfriend a birthday present he’ll love, ask your friends for some advice. They will be able to offer some helpful insight into what types of gifts their boyfriends have appreciated and what might be something nice to get for yours.

, Not everyone can be psychic when it comes to knowing what people want for their birthday. If you’re really feeling frazzled and can’t think of anything good, just ask your boyfriend for some suggestions. He won’t mind that you needed a little help from him. In fact, gifts that people ask for often end up being the most appreciated ones.Don’t ask him for something specific. Try to get him to tell you that he wants some nice winter accessories rather than a red and gray checkered wool hat from a specific store. Fill in the blanks with what you know about your boyfriend and you’ll get him something thoughtful that he loves.

, Figure out how much you can reasonably afford to spend on a gift for your boyfriend. Be strict about it and don’t get anything that goes over it. Contrary to what you may think, the monetary value of a gift doesn’t have a huge impact on how much the recipient enjoys it. In fact, recipients enjoy cheap gifts just as much as they do expensive ones, as long as they’re both thoughtful. Consider how long you’ve been dating. If you’ve been dating for six months or less, don’t get him something expensive, even if you can easily afford it. You don’t know how long the relationship will last. If you end up together for a long time, you’ll have plenty more birthdays you can spoil him on. You may be able to get more bang for your buck if you buy something refurbished or hunt for sales. This is an especially good idea if you’re thinking about getting him electronics. Most of the time they come with a warranty, and your boyfriend probably won’t care or notice that someone used it for a little bit before he did.

, If you don’t know a whole lot about what your boyfriend spends his time doing, then it’s time to do a little research. You can learn pretty much anything on the internet in an hour. Spend some time searching his hobbies and interests and reading anything that talks about them. Read any websites dedicated to bringing hobbyists and enthusiasts together and see what’s new in the field.


You may need to take his level of experience and expertise when you’re thinking of gifts. If your boyfriend has been skateboarding since he could walk, it doesn’t make sense to get a beginner’s board that he’ll probably hate riding. At the same time, an expensive fly-fishing rod doesn’t make sense if he’s only gone fishing two or three times in his life.
Ask people with similar interests for help if you’re stuck. There are online communities for pretty much any pastime imaginable. Look for forums and other groups dedicated to discussing something your boyfriend likes to do. Make an account and explain your predicament. Chances are, the members will offer helpful advice that will guide you towards getting your boyfriend something he’ll love.
You may find lists that say something like “10 Great Gifts for Guys Who Love Hiking.” These can be helpful, but sometimes they are just a marketing tool to sell stuff. If you get an idea from a list like this, try to find some actual reviews to see if it’s worth it or not.

, As long as your gift fits into one of these categories he’ll appreciate it. It shouldn’t just be another addition to his collection of stuff. It should be something he will actually use or something that he can look at and remember all the happy moments you’ve shared together. Don’t limit yourself to products. Sometimes experiences can make a much better gift. Make a video of all his friends and family sharing their favorite memory of your boyfriend. Schedule an activity that you know he’ll enjoy that you can do together. He may not be able to show it off like he’d be able to with other presents, but it will mean a lot more to him. Stay away from classically bad gifts. It can be tempting to get your boyfriend something like a tie or shaving kit for their birthday. It makes sense, these are pretty common and obvious answers to the question of what makes a good gift for a boyfriend. In reality, these gifts pretty much always fall flat. If it seems like a stereotypical gift from a girlfriend, consider other options unless you’re positive he’ll love it., Lots of people make the mistake of getting one big gift and a bunch of small ones for their loved ones. It’s easy to see why. After all, isn’t more always better? In fact, giving small presents alongside your large one will make the main gift seem less special. Put a lot of effort into one present rather than a handful. , Few things are as stressful as not knowing whether your present will be ready in time for your boyfriend’s birthday. Give yourself a couple of weeks to buffer yourself and make sure everything is right. Check how long any online orders will take to ship. Don’t forget that products are occasionally damaged or defective and will need to be returned.

, If you know any of your friends or your boyfriend’s friends are likely to spill the beans, don’t tell them what you got your boyfriend for his birthday. Drop your boyfriend a few hints if you want to, but not anything that’s specific enough that he’ll be able to guess what you got him. He’ll appreciate what he gets a lot more if he isn’t expecting it.

, A beautiful presentation will make your boyfriend excited to open the gift he’s been anticipating. If you got him something you can wrap, make sure the paper and ribbon complement one another and that the gift is neatly wrapped. If you got him something that’s better off written in a card, pick a card he’ll like and put some effort into making your handwriting look good. , Talk about why you care for him and why you thought he would like the gift. Even if it isn’t perfect, the old saying, “it’s the thought that counts,” has been proven to be true. People hold gifts that people spent a lot of time and energy thinking about in just as high a regard as they do gifts they’ve been asking about for months. As long as you really put some effort in and got reasonably close to the mark, he’ll love it. Keep it light if you’ve only been dating a few months. It’s pretty awkward to go on and on about how he’s your entire world if you haven’t known each other very long. Talk about how much fun you have spending time together, but don’t drop anything too heavy on him.

Give it time.,
Set goals.,
Remind yourself that patience will pay off.,
Practice positive self-talk.",How to Learn Patience in a Relationship2," Learning to be patient takes patience. If you are easily frustrated, that isn’t likely to change overnight. Being hard on yourself will only add to your frustration. Instead, recognize that you are working toward being more patient and forgive yourself for any mistakes that you make along the way.For example, if you get frustrated sitting in traffic, recognize that you are frustrated and try to calm down. Then let it go. There is no need to be frustrated about being frustrated.

, If you want to be more patient, you’ll need to set some goals. This way you can have a clear definition of how you are succeeding. Each goal you reach will help energize you to reach the next. Some examples of goals that lead to being more patient might be things like:Waiting in line without being frustrated.
Keeping a positive attitude with co-workers.
Overlooking things that your significant other does that you find annoying.

, Being patient benefits you in many ways. First of all, it allows your relationships to be more loving and respectful. Being patient also helps you remain calmer and more at peace with yourself. When you start to feel frustrated, keep in mind that responding with patience will help you live a more satisfying life., Most people have an inner dialogue that plays out in their minds day in and day out. This is your “self-talk.” Just like the things other people say, your self-talk can tear you down, or it can boost your confidence. When you analyze yourself and think (or talk) to yourself about being patient, focus on your progress in a positive way.


For example, avoid thoughts like “I’m just not patient enough to deal with that.” Instead, frame it in a positive by thinking or saying something like “Dealing with that is going to require a lot of patience.”

Be aware of your stress.,
Remain positive.,
Have a plan for tough situations.,
Keep your body healthy.,
Focus on your mental health.",How to Learn Patience in a Relationship3," Understand your stress levels and what stressors affect you the most. Keep a journal of the things that frustrate or stress you out the most. As you come to understand your triggers, you can better control your stress. Having your stress under control will allow you to focus on being a more patient person. Common stressors are things like:Traffic
Long lines
Excessive phone calls
Deadlines

, Most situations can be looked at in a positive and negative light. How patient you are in a given circumstance will depend on how positive or negative your outlook is. If you focus on the positive aspects of a situation, you will be much more patient.For example, if you view time spent sitting in traffic as time wasted, you will be frustrated and impatient. If you view that same time as a chance to have a conversation with your significant other, the experience is more positive and you will both be more patient.

, Being caught off guard is stressful, regardless of the situation. You can be more patient if you prepare yourself for difficult situations. One of the best ways to prepare for a situation is to visualize yourself dealing with it before it happens. Close your eyes and think about how the situation will play out, and how you will react to it.For example, if you get irritated when your significant other sleeps in on the weekend, visualize yourself doing something you enjoy in the morning. Include in the visualization how you will greet your significant other warmly when they wake up.

, Exercise and a healthy diet can keep your body healthy. This will make you feel better, raise your self confidence, and help to balance your hormones and neurotransmitters (the chemicals that send messages throughout your brain and body). All of these things will reduce your stress level and help you to be more patient., Physical health is not the only factor to remaining happy and stable. If you practice good mental hygiene, you will find that you have much more capacity to be patient with yourself and your significant other. Things like yoga, meditation, deep breathing techniques, and talking in support groups can help you relieve built up stress."

Be aware of the difference between falling in love and staying in love.,
Consider how you both deal with conflict in your relationship.,
Think about if you both have similar priorities and life goals.,
Determine if you and your girlfriend have the four dimensions of intimacy.,
Ask your friends and family how they feel about your girlfriend.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Really Loves You1," While there are many complicated feelings associated with falling in love with someone, it is usually a very passive and emotional experience. But staying in love can be incredibly difficult and requires a more active and involved approach to the relationship.Think of “love” as a verb, or an action you have to continue to reinforce and support as you move forward in your relationship. Consider how your girlfriend actively contributes and cultivates her relationship with you, and if your relationship is just as good, if not better, than when you first fell in love.
Through action and words, your girlfriend can reinforce and commit to the relationship every day, even in small or seemingly insignificant ways.;
, Most couples with poor conflict resolution skills engage in Fight, Flight, or Freeze behaviors. So, they fight and stay mad, sometimes holding grudges or resentment for months or years. They take flight and avoid uncomfortable or difficult issues by sweeping them under the rug. Or, they freeze up emotionally and shut down, blocking out any attempts at communicating or discussing the issue.Successful couples who are committed to the relationship for the long term will try to work on solving any problems and letting them go. They will focus on taking care of the issue, rather than attacking each other or freezing each other out.
In a healthy, loving relationship, both partners should be able to forgive and forget, as any lingering resentment that is not addressed and dealt with can lead to further drama or conflict down the line and will work against sustaining the relationship for the long term.

, This is an important step to committing on a practical level to being with your girlfriend and will be an important step for her commitment to you.


Opposites may attract, but they rarely make for a good long-term relationship, and compatibility in your tastes and preferences, as well as your values, priorities, and life goals, will help to create a deep and lasting connection between you and your girlfriend., Authors Ronald Adler and Russell Proctor II identified four ways we can feel closely connected with our significant other: physical, emotional, intellectual, and shared activities. Complete the following exercise to see if you and your girlfriend have all four dimensions of intimacy:List the four dimensions in a vertical line. Write Partner A and Partner B on top of the list of dimensions.
Next to each dimension, rank whether it is a “Must” have, a “Should” have, or a “Could” have for your relationship.
Pass the list to your partner, and have them rank the dimensions. Or, mark down how you think your partner would prioritize these dimensions.
The more “must-must” and “must-should” combinations between you and your partner, the greater the possibility of an intimate and long term relationship. Since no relationship is static, especially a healthy, loving one, the rankings of each dimension may evolve to be even more compatible over time.
Understanding each other’s priorities, especially in these core areas, will help to ensure long term success in a relationship and staying in love.

, If the people closest to you are encouraging you to break up or get away from your girlfriend, this may be an indication the person is not for you.Though it’s important to trust your own instincts and feelings, it’s usually a positive sign if your friends and family support your relationship with your girlfriend and think you have long term potential together.

Listen to the tone of her voice when she talks to you.,
Notice if she wants to spend the majority of her time with you and calls you frequently.,
Think about if she asks about your day when she sees you.,
Look for signs that she respects your opinion and your judgement.,
Notice if she avoids keeping tabs on you or asking you constantly where you are.,
Consider if your girlfriend makes you feel good about yourself.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Really Loves You2," Compare how she talks to you with how she talks to others. If your partner uses a sweet, caring, and compassionate tone when talking to you, it’s likely she considers you a special person in her life and cares deeply about you., Investing time in a relationship is a major indicator of long term commitment, especially if your partner is trying to balance other commitments like school, work, or family. Someone who truly cares about you will use whatever available time they have to spend some alone time together.Love triggers the release of serotonin in your brain, and it is believed that high levels of serotonin can cause you to think constantly about a partner. So the more your partner calls you or talks to you, the more they are thinking about you, which is a (chemical) indication of their feelings of love for you., While this may seem like a small gesture, it will show she is interested in even the minor details of your life. These check ins will also keep the lines of communication between you open and build a practical, supportive element to your relationship., Perhaps you have opposing political views or different ways of making the best risotto. Regardless of these differences, she should still open to listening to your perspective and treat your views with respect and interest.If your partner truly cares about you, they should be willing to hear your opinions and ideas, and engage in a civil, respectful discussion about subjects you may not agree on.
She should also be comfortable with including you in decisions, from mundane things like where you should eat dinner to high-stake questions like whether she should accept a new position at work. Though she may not always take your advice, she should still be interested in hearing what you have to say and take it into consideration.

, Partners who truly care will give you the benefit of the doubt and will not snoop around on your cellphone or check your credit card bills to determine where you’ve been or who you’ve been with as they will be committed to trusting you.This kind of trust shows true caring, and is a big sign of a long term commitment.

, A partner who cares about you will boost your self-esteem and sense of self. They should provide positive reinforcement and make you feel loved.This doesn’t mean your relationship will always be a bed of roses, but overall, you should feel like your girlfriend gives you self-confidence and support, rather than negative thoughts or low self-esteem. If you are with someone who makes you feel good, you will not only want to spend more time with them, but also regard yourself more positively during the times that you are apart from them.

Create an intimate, private setting.,
Be honest and straightforward.,
Don’t be afraid to show emotion.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Really Loves You3," Declarations of love, whether from you or from her, might be harder to do in a crowded room, so make dinner at home or take her to a secluded spot in the park where you can have a deep conversation about your feelings.


This will also put you both at easy and make you both more comfortable with talking honestly and openly.

, By being blunt and straightforward, you will have the best chance at knowing exactly how your girlfriend feels about you., Your girlfriend may need some encouragement to tell you about her feelings for you, so don’t be shy about displaying your emotions.


If you feel strongly about her, indicate this to her so that she feels comfortable enough to share how she feels about you.

Follow up.",How to Keep a Phone Conversation Going with Your Girlfriend1," This is the most important part of keeping a conversation going with anyone, from your girlfriend, to you grandfather, to the kid next door. People like to talk about themselves as a general rule, and if you open that conversational door, most will walk through it.Try to ask more open-ended questions, and avoid ones with yes or no answer. The idea is to ask things that will lead naturally into conversation, not to pepper her with interview questions.


Ask about her day. This is an obvious place to start. When asked simply, “How was your day?” many of us automatically respond, “Fine thanks,” without even thinking about it. This probably won’t lead anywhere. Instead, try something a little more pointed, like, “Did you do anything interesting today?” or “Did you make it to work before that storm started this morning?” It may not lead to anything particularly fascinating, but it will ease you both into the conversation.
Ask about mutual interests and acquaintances. This is a great way to introduce a subject you can both talk about, while still framing it as a question. Try asking what she thought of latest episode of a TV show you both like, or if she read a recent interview with a mutual favorite author, or if she’s seen so-and-so lately.
Ask for support or advice. It is important to offer your girlfriend a sympathetic ear and a shoulder to cry on when she needs it, but if she feels like you never need support from her in return, she may begin to feel like a burden. No one wants to date an emotionless robot who never needs help. Don’t invent problems if none exist, but if you are struggling with something, don’t be afraid to get vulnerable and turn to her for advice or validation.
Ask what she wanted to be when she grew up when she was 7. This is a bit of an unusual question. It will show her that you are interested in learning more about her, and give you some new perspective.;
, If something particularly funny or interesting happened to you today, tell her about it. It can be easy to rely too heavily on gripes about frustrating situations when you do this, so try to make sure you are not just rattling off complaints.

, Brainstorm fun things the two of you could do together this week. If you already have plans, talk about how excited you are to go to that concert, or mention a review you read of the play you are going to see. This will help her get excited too, and make her feel like a valued part of your life.

, You don't want to monopolize the conversation, but no one likes to date a person with no ambitions. Tell her about some of your hopes and dreams.

, This should constitute a small portion of your conversation, and you should avoid anything too brutal or personal, but this can be an easy fallback if you are at a loss. There aren't a lot of people who can resist indulging in gossip from time to time., Inviting her to tell you more about something she just said will let her know you are interested. It will also extend the mileage you get out of that particular subject, saving you from immediately having to come up with a new topic.

"
"
Try to understand her.,
Focus on her.,
Pay genuine attention.,
Make open-ended, non-judgmental responses that demonstrate you were listening.,
Reflect her feelings back to her.,
Invite her to continue.",How to Keep a Phone Conversation Going with Your Girlfriend2," Empathetic listening is also known as “active listening” or “reflective listening.” It refers to a way of listening and responding that seeks above all to understand the person who is speaking to you. This is perhaps the most important conversational skill you can cultivate. Not only will this make conversation with your girlfriend flow more easily and naturally, it will make her feel truly seen and heard, increase her trust in you, and bring the two of you closer together., In a healthy relationship, there should be equal conversational space for both of you. That said, sometimes one of you will need more attention or support than the other. An empathetic listener is willing to let the other person dominate the conversation when he or she needs to, without inserting his or her own ego.

, You can’t fake this, so don’t try. It can be easy to get so lost in trying to think of things to say that you forget to really listen. This spells the death of empathy. Let her say what she needs to, and listen without interrupting.

, Often this can be as simple as telling her, “That sounds really hard. I know how important your dog was to you.” This lets her know that you are listening and that you feel for her, while giving her plenty of space to continue sharing.

, If she just told you a story about a fight she had with her friends, avoid saying something like, “It sounds like your friends are real jerks. They don’t appreciate how great you are.” This may seem like a supportive way to respond, but the truth is that she loves her friends, and your harsh judgment of them will ultimately come back to haunt you. Try responding with something more like, “It sounds like you felt really disrespected by the way they spoke to you.” This validates the way she’s feeling, without pointing fingers of blame or offering advice she didn’t ask for.

, Use phrases like, “Tell me more about it,” “I’d like to hear more about that,” “How did that feel?” or “What did you do then?” to encourage her to keep sharing.

"
"
Ask for updates about things she mentioned before.,
Avoid offering solutions unless she asks for them.,
Demonstrate that you relate to what she feels.,
Avoid invalidating her feelings.",How to Keep a Phone Conversation Going with Your Girlfriend3," This will show her that you really pay attention to the things she shares with you, and that you care about the things that are important to her. Try asking things like, “So was your boss less of a jerk today?” or “Is your mom feeling better?” or “Did you finish that book you’ve been so into?”, Many men see telling people about their problems as a practical route toward solving those problems. Many women, on the other hand, want commiseration more than practical suggestions. When your girlfriend tells you about something she is struggling with, your first instinct may be to offer solutions. Avoid this. There is a good chance that what she wants is simply to get something off her chest. If she wants advice, she will probably ask for it. Until then, a good working assumption is that what she really wants is just to feel understood., This will definitely not be appropriate in all situations, but sometimes sharing a story about a time when you experienced something similar can help validate her experiences and make her feel less alone. Don't go on too long though. You don't want to overshadow her or make the conversation all about you.

, Never say things like, “You’re overreacting,” “Don’t worry so much,” “You’ll feel better tomorrow,” “It’s not that bad,” or “There’s no reason to get so upset.” Whether or not you feel like her emotional response is appropriate, it doesn’t change what she is feeling. Don’t discount or minimize her emotions. Don’t always expect rationality, either. Emotions are not rational things, and people who are upset are not always reasonable. You should expect to be treated with respect, but don’t tell her she’s being unreasonable, or suggest taking a more rational approach. There will be time for this later. Right now your job is to listen."

See if you are the person your crush turns to you to talk about his or her problems.,

See if your crush always ends up inviting other people out when you're together.",How to Know if You Are in the Friend Zone," If you are your crush's go-to person whenever something goes wrong, then you may be in the Friend Zone. Think about it. If your crush likes you back, then there will be an element of mystery in your relationship, and also an element of excitement. If your crush tells you every little thing on his or her mind or every little problem he or she has, then your crush isn't trying to impress you or cover things up, and this is probably because he or she sees you as a friend.


If your crush says something like, ""I wanted to call you the second this happened,"" or ""Your opinion means so much to me"" or ""I'm so glad I can count on you,"" these are all signs that he or she thinks of you as a really, really good friend.;
, This is a dead giveaway that the person only sees you as a friend. If your crush goes on and on about how much he likes his cute coworker or how much she wants a new guy in school to ask her out, then you are definitely in the Friend Zone. If the person asks you for advice again and again and never once thinks that you might be interested, then you are definitely in the Friend Zone.


If your crush talks to you about other romantic opportunities, then you are probably in the Friend Zone. However, if you hear him or her saying things like, ""None of the guys in my class are as good as you..."" Or, ""I just feel like I'll never find the right person..."" then this may be a hint that you're the one.

, If your crush likes to pal around with you and gives you cute but corny nicknames, such as ""Buddy,"" ""Brother,"" ""Sister,"" ""Champ,"" ""Slugger,"" or ""Kiddo,"" then yeah, you won't be feeling the love any time soon. This doesn't mean that the person will never be able to see you romantically, but that, right now, you are firmly entrenched in the Friend Zone.

, This is another red flag that you are absolutely in the Friend Zone. If the girl or guy you like just got dumped and you're the one who is there consoling him or her with a tub of ice cream and a Love Actually DVD, then you are deeply entrenched in the Friend Zone. If you're the one saying things like, ""You can do so much better..."" and ""How could anyone not want to be with you?"" then you are definitely just a friend.


If your crush really opens up to you and lets you see him or her during such a vulnerable time, then you are probably just a friend.

, If he or she dresses in front of you without any romantic undertones, he or she is probably not attracted to you and may assume you are not at all attracted to them. If you're heading to the pool together, at the beach together, or just hanging out, and your crush does this without thinking twice, then you may be in the Friend Zone.


If your crush changes around you or even wears less clothes around you, like if you're at the beach, pay attention to how he or she acts when this happens. Does the guy you like look down at his chest when he takes his shirt off? Does the girl you like nervously adjust her bikini when you're at the beach together? If so, then he or she may be feeling a bit self-conscious in your presence.

, This is friend, or even sibling, behavior. If you find yourself in the same bed with your crush and you're on opposite ends, or perfectly comfortable splaying out on the bed, then you are in the Friend Zone. Though this may not happen too often, it's an opportunity to see where your relationship really stands.


If your crush wears dorky pajamas or his or her retainer, then it's even more likely that you're in the Friend Zone. If your crush seems to have no incentive to look sexy around you, then it's because he or she only sees you as a friend.

, If the family asks why you two haven't started a relationship, you are probably in the Friend Zone, because you are a couple in every way except romantically and sexually. If your crush's family always putting the pressure on for you to date, and you already know everyone there pretty well, then there's a pretty good chance you're in the Friend Zone. If your crush had special feelings for you, then having you meet his or her family would be considered a big deal.


Of course, you should keep in mind that feelings do change. Maybe you met your crush's family a long time ago, and only now he or she is starting to have feelings.

, This is another sign that you are in the Friend Zone. If your relationship is romantic, then your crush will be nervous around you, at least to an extent. He or she will fidget occasionally, laugh when nothing is funny, or go out of his or her way to impress you. If your crush only sees you as a friend, then he or she won't care about his or her appearance or about how he or she comes off.


If you never detect any nervousness, preening, or worry whatsoever when you're together, then you are probably just a friend.
If your crush says anything without censoring him or herself, backtracking, or wondering how he or she comes off, then you are most likely just friends.
Check out how your crush dresses when you hang out. If you get the sense that he or she hasn't tried to look nice, wear makeup, or put on cute clothes around you, then it's probably because he or she thinks of you as just being friends.

, This is another dead giveaway that you're in the Friend Zone. If the girl you like is always telling you about the cute girl in her math class or her cute second cousin that you'd be perfect for, then this is a big red flag. It's even worse if you show up to hang out with her and she brings along a random girlfriend, clearly with the intention of setting the two of you up together.


Think about it: if the girl liked you, why would she be trying to set you up with someone else?
This may even be the person's way of hinting that you should direct your romantic feelings elsewhere.

, If the girl you like really likes you, then she'll go out of her way to do the things you want to do, whether it's going hiking or watching a baseball game. But if you always get roped in to going shopping, getting ice cream, or doing other things that she wants to do, then it may be because because she doesn't care about impressing you. Ask yourself when the last time was that you got your crush to do something that you actually wanted to do.


This is especially true if you always end up shopping with the girl you like. If she's asking your what she should wear or how she looks in a certain outfit, then it's probably because she doesn't think of you as dating material.

, If the guy or girl you like returns your romantic feelings, then you'll probably be touching each other a fair amount, whether you're playfully hitting each other or finding other excuses to graze arms or fingers. If you never end up touching each other, even when it's easy to do so, such as when you're sharing the same menu, then it may be because your crush just doesn't think of you that way.


However, if you like a guy who treats you like one of the bros, then there may be a fair amount of touching. Try to see if it's just friendly or something more.
You can even test this out by finding an excuse to lightly graze your crush's arm or to playfully shove her just to see if she responds.

, If you find yourself walking your crush's dog, picking up lunch for her when she's having a busy day, or giving her a ride to school, then your relationship is probably not romantic. If you're already an errand boy (or girl) for this person, then you are definitely not on your way to dating. If your crush really had romantic feelings for you, then she wouldn't ask you to help her out in non-romantic ways all the time.

, If you're always trying to get your crush alone so you can turn your relationship into something more, while she always ends up inviting the whole gang, her three siblings, her random neighbors, and anyone else in the same city, then it's a sign that your crush does not see you taking your relationship to a romantic level. This doesn't mean that it will never happen, but it does mean that, for now, your relationship is not in a romantic place.


If your crush sees you as a romantic prospect, then he or she would be looking for excuses to be alone with you, not trying to make it so you're never alone together.

Determine his actions.,
Determine his body language.,
Pay attention to how he's talking/texting to you.,
Make him think about you in his mind.,
Seeing if he's playing a game on you, or he does like you.,
Give him hints.",How to Know if He's Totally Interested in You," See if he wants to sit close to you. If he's about 2 or 4 inches (5.1 or 10.2 cm) between you, there's something to consider. See how he uses his arms. If he puts his elbows on his knees, he's truly listening to you. Things like that you need to pick up on.;
, When you look at him, see if he puts his pelvis towards you while either are talking. If he does that, he's into and probably likes you. Does he lean a little when your talking?

He probably likes you, but just a little nervous around you.

, Sometimes when you hear what your guy has to say, he would take a simple question and make it a huge answer. He would just go on and on explaining/telling you something that should've been a few words shorter. In that instance, he probably likes you and nervous on what to say next. Try to break the ice slowly, then tell him what's on your mind. When it comes to texting, he may start saying ""how was your day?"" when you know he hasn't said it for a while until just recently. That means he's starting to have interest in you. When he starts saying things he hasn't done in a while and somehow starts saying something to you just recently, he's definitely wanting to take the next step up.

, Be mysterious. He would start to think, or wonder when you say something like ""oh, it was nothing"", or ""never mind, just forget it"". It would make him want more of you. It would also mess with his mind in a good way, and he probably might like that.

, Sometimes you would text him and he won't text you for about 3 or 4 days. But on the fourth day when he does finally reply to your text, he would just pick right up where he left off. It would make you wonder if he's just doing it for no reason, or if he's really busy. What I suppose is that it's just a guy thing. He's probably doing it so it would seem that your obsessed with him, but he could oddly like that. He probably also thinks that you do care for him, but you don't know if it bugs, or annoys him when your filling up his phone inbox. It could also mean that he wants you to think of him more So you would think that he's really special. However, when he talks to you in person, he seems like he's not playing a game on you.

, When all else fails, give him signs that you like him. Tease, flirt, smile, all that stuff you could do to tell him that you like him, He should understand what you're doing if you do it right. He could like you as much as you do to him.

Reflect on your feelings.,
Make a list of positives and negatives.,
Talk to him.",How to Know if the Guy You're Dating Is Right for You4," After you determine your priorities and evaluate your relationship, you should reflect on your feelings.

, When you are trying to decide if your relationship is a good fit, it is important to reflect on both the negative and positive aspects of the relationship.

Pay attention to her gaze.,
Notice the size of her pupils.,
Count how many times she blinks in a minute.,
Listen to the tone of her voice.,
Look for groupings of gestures.,
Watch her body language when she laughs.,
Don’t assume too much too fast.,
Notice signals that say she is not interested in you.,
Ask her to do an activity where you can concentrate on her.,
Listen actively to what she says to you.,
Ask her how she feels about you or a situation where you are worried about her feelings.",How to Know a Girl's Feelings," There are several things that eyes can tell you about the way she might feel romantically. If her eyes seem to gravitate toward your face and eyes often, during conversation and when you are not in conversation, she may be interested in you romantically. Typically if a person is interested in someone else sexually, than her gaze will shift to parts of his body that she finds attractive. If a person is romantically interested in another person, her gaze will stay more focused on their face and eyes of the other person. Be careful though, her eye shifting patterns could be a sign that she is an extrovert. Extroverts tend to be much more stimulated by social interactions and make more eye contact than introverts.;
, Constricting eye pupils are another indicator or interest or desire. If you notice that the black pupils of her eyes become smaller when she is looking at you, it could indicate that she is interested in you romantically or sexually. People's eyes will dilate when they are looking at something that they want. This is particularly easy to spot in people with blue eyes because of the contrast between the darker black pupil and the lighter blue iris.
Be careful, people’s pupils also constrict in response to increased light brightness, so be aware of any lighting changes if you notice her pupils constrict.

, If while you are talking she blinks more than 6-10 times in a minute, that could indicate that she has feelings for you. People who are looking at something or someone they like tend to blink more often than normal. Wear a watch with a second hand that you can easily watch while you are counting. Make sure that you two are interacting while you count. , If she is romantically interested in you, her voice will probably get lower, not higher, and it will sound huskier and more breathy. Researchers theorize that there is a cultural stereotype that women who are interested in a man speak in a way that is more low and seductive.There has been a misconception that women who are romantically interested in a man will make the tone of their voices higher and sweeter. However, if she is trying to send you signals that she likes you, she is probably talking in a deeper and huskier tone.

, A group of gestures together could show that she feels connected to you. For example, if she is smiling, she has her head titled to the side, and she is holding or touching her face at the same time, this could indicate possible romantic interest in you. If she is extroverted, she may be more expressive with her gestures and more likely to make these kinds displays with people whom she simply feels connected to.

, Although laughter itself is not an indicator of romantic interest, what happens when she laughs could be. When men are interested in someone they tend to take up more space and lean forward toward that person while they are laughing. When women are interested, they will position their bodies so that their positive physical traits are being highlighted while they are laughing. Women will sit up straighter or take on postures that make them more attractive or seductive., If you are interested in her, your interest in her could hurt your ability to read her signals correctly. Anticipating signals of attraction from her will make your perceptions more unreliable, so take your time and do not jump to conclusions too quickly. Take the span of a whole night or a few dates to gauge her feelings for you. When you are observing her try to be objective, and look at the situation how a person with an outside perspective might see it.


Look at how she is acting with other people to check to see if you are assuming too much. For example, if she seems to be giving other people lots of eye contact and grouping her gestures often, she may be an extrovert, and you will need to take that into account when you read her body language.

, Just like there is body language that shows interest, there is also body language that shows disinterest or anxiety. For example, if she is raising her eyebrows often, she might be uncomfortable. And this could mean that she does not want you to like her.Additionally, crossed legs and arms may mean that she is trying to stay closed off to you. This could mean that she is anxious or resistant to your feelings. You can ask her if she is worried about anything. If she tells you that something is going on with her that is causing her worry, her body language may not be in response to you.
Also, her feelings for you could be causing her anxiety if she likes you and does not know how you feel. This anxiety could be coming across in her body language. If you notice conflicting signals of interest and than disinterest, you may want to talk to her about her feelings.

, Set up an activity like going out to dinner or going to a coffee shop for the purpose of talking. Make sure there is plenty of time for you to sit across from her and talk about things. The best way to understand a person’s feelings is to have a conversation with them where you are looking at them and actively listening.Men generally feel more intimacy from doing doing side by side activities, like watching sports or drinking, but doing side by side activities makes it is harder to read how a person else is feeling because you are not facing the person and actively listening during these activities.

, Sit face to face, and when she is talking, lean forward a little and maintain eye contact with her. This will allow you to understand her feelings because you will get access to all of the signals that she sends through their voice inflections, facial expressions, and body language. The more information that you get, the easier it is to understand how she is feeling. Use your body language and these conversational techniques to improve your listening skills:


Show through your body posture that you are listening. This will encourage her to speak, and you will be able to understand her more the more she communicates. Nod your head to show your agreement or to encourage her to keep talking.
Give her the right amount of distance. This will also encourage her to communicate with you because if you give her the right distance she will be more comfortable talking to you. If you stand too close, you may come off as overly interested while standing too far away will make you seem aloof. Give her space to talk but position yourself so that you can hear and see her well.
Restate the main idea of what she is saying. This will help you know that you are understanding her feelings correctly. And she will be able to correct you if you have the wrong idea of what is going on with her. If she is talking about her frustrating day, for example, you can say “So you are saying that you didn’t understand why your sister was acting up until you saw what was going on with her at school.”
Be empathetic to her feelings. If you can start to exercise this muscle in your interactions with her, you will become more adept at picking up on how she is feeling. Empathy means you can understand the feeling that she experienced even if you do not share a common feeling. For example, you can combine restating her main idea and being empathetic by saying “You must have felt so eager to get out of the house after sitting in a desk all day.”

, Often the best way to find out how someone feels is to ask them directly. This will take the guesswork out of your interactions and can free you from overthinking the situation. You should listen the most to what a person says, even if you think it contradicts what their body language says.


Find a place where you aren’t distracted by other people or activities. This doesn’t have to be a long conversation. Look for a quiet table or a couple of chairs where you can sit for a couple of minutes and talk about how she feels.
Ask her if she would mind talking to you for a minute. You don’t want the situation to put too much pressure on her, so tell her it will be short. You don’t need a lot of time to ask her how she is feeling. Say “Hey, do you mind talking for a minute?”
Think about what you want to know specifically before you talk to her. Phrase your question in your mind before you ask it. If you seem confused or ambiguous when you ask her the question, she may not be able to understand how to answer your question, and she may give you an answer that doesn’t help you. First think about how you feel, for example, “I am starting to develop romantic feelings for you.” And then consider what you want to know, “I want to find out how you feel about me romantically.” Make sure you are specific. For example, “Do you feel romantically for me?” is a better question than “Do you like me?” because “like” could mean many different things to different people and is too ambiguous. She may not want to hurt your feelings and might avoid telling you how she feels directly unless you ask her directly.
Ask her directly how she feels, and tell her how you feel. For example, you can say “I have been really enjoying our time together and have developed romantic feelings for you. Do you feel romantically about me?”
Respect her feelings, and do not feel bad about how she feels. Recognize that you are brave for asking, and if you respect her feelings, then you can only feel good about your actions. Remember that your self worth and identity are not in how she feels about you even though you may care very much.

Consider ending the relationship to protect your own self-worth.",How to Know if You're Dating a Narcissist," A central aspect of the narcissist is being very self-involved. If you are dating a narcissist, your partner may talk at length about themselves, possibly in an exaggerated manner. They will dominate conversations and love being the center of attention.Other tell-tale signs of being self-absorbed and self-centered include always admiring themselves in mirrors, commenting on achievements, pressuring you to do or see things their way, and expecting instant gratification to their demands (e.g. quick answers to phone calls, texts, or requests).
For instance, you find yourself hearing the same stories about your partner's great promotion at work, even weeks or months after they have transitioned into the new role.;
, While a narcissistic person can be incredibly charming and likable, they may also have the tendency of putting other’s down. This is done to demonstrate their own superior looks, abilities, or accomplishments. In truth, narcissists have low self-esteem, but they hide this behind a false sense of superiority.


As a result of this tendency, you may find yourself questioning your own self-worth or feeling particularly flawed in your partner’s presence.Does your partner tell you how lucky you are to be with them? Maybe they mention how many other people would love to be in your shoes, making you feel terrible about yourself.

, The self-centeredness associated with the narcissist also gives way to the tendency to play the victim. If you have a fight, all the blame will somehow land on your shoulders. If you disagree with a small aspect of your date’s ideas or opinions, they may say that you are sabotaging them.For example, your date whines for days about how their professor treats them unfairly at school; however, they aren't willing to notice when they treat others unkindly. They only seem to notice when they are being mistreated.

, The victim mentality of the narcissist goes hand-in-hand with manipulation and exploitation. Your date may not necessarily be conscious of this behavior, but they probably use shaming or guilt-tripping to make you do things their way. In terms of exploitation, a narcissist typically uses others for personal gain and then quickly discards them without any concern for their feelings.


A lack of empathy explains why a narcissist can so easily inflict hurt on others. This person is virtually incapable of putting anyone else’s needs above their own; however, they may be able to “pretend” to care in situations when showing empathy works in their favor.For example, your date never cares to listen about problems with your family. Yet, when they visit with your mother, they say, ""Oh, they never tell me what's going on in the family! Please catch me up,"" in order to get on her good side.

, You are likely to be able to count on two hands the number of times your date has reacted negatively when they didn’t get their way. Narcissists generally have difficulty coping with negative feedback or consequences that lead to criticism, rejection or disappointment.


Your date may display a variety of responses to these negative, yet common, situations. They may demonstrate anger by having a tantrum and cursing you out or insulting you. Other narcissists go the passive-aggressive route and give the silent treatment or withhold love and affection when you don't bend to their way of thinking.Another common reaction to criticism, rejection or disappointment is playing the victim by guilt-tripping or blaming you for negative consequences that happen in your partner's life.

, If you suspect you are dating a narcissist, you may be able to identify a pattern in the highs and lows of your interactions. The cycle may include three phases: idealize (or over-evaluation), devalue, discard.During the idealize stage, the narcissist will put their best foot forward. The person will be at their most charming and charismatic and may appear to be the perfect partner. They will idealize you, as well, placing you on a pedestal and showering you with compliments, telling you that you are better than anyone else, and they may rush intimacy, trying to get very serious with you very quickly.
During the devalue stage, the euphoria evaporates and the narcissist changes. This may happen gradually or overnight. The person will become distant, and may become cruel and abusive. They may cheat, lie, manipulate, and may fly into sudden rages. You may feel like you must walk on eggshells and begin to question your own behavior. You may go through many turns of this hot/cold, loves-me-loves-me-not cycle.
This discard stage is when the relationship ends (sometimes temporarily). If the narcissist ends the relationship, it will likely be very abruptly, with no sense of closure. The person may give you the silent treatment and take pains to hurt you — such as removing all traces of your relationship from social media, making a big show of being happy in a new relationship, and possibly running a ""smear campaign"" in which they tear you down make themselves look like the victim. This may mark the end of the relationship, or the narcissist may return and the cycle can start all over again.

, Any person may, at some point, act like a victim, manipulate others, or act with arrogance or feigned concern; however, with a pathological narcissist, this person is likely to display all of these qualities quite regularly. What’s more, pathological narcissists are mostly unaffected or unaware of how their behavior affects those around them.For instance, do you often tell your date that you are feeling used, but they laugh it off as if it's a joke? The person seems incapable of seeing their own faults or misdeeds.

, In addition to having very little self-awareness or concern about their negative personality traits, a pathological narcissist has probably been demonstrating these behavior patterns for many years. These behaviors are consistent over long span of time, perhaps starting in early adulthood or adolescence, and are quite resistant to change.


Only a trained mental health provider can adequately diagnose and treat narcissistic personality disorder. Still, noticing long-standing narcissism in a person — or hearing stories from other loved ones and friends — can give you some clues as to whether your date has a more serious personality issue., A narcissist who may warrant a mental health diagnosis is usually experiencing problems in many areas of life. Your date may not necessarily have a more serious form of narcissism if they show only one or two traits in one specific area of life, such as in a romantic partnership. People with true narcissistic personality disorder have traits that affect their ability to function in most social relationships and other aspects of life, such as in school or at work.Try to have a chat with your date's friends or family members, or reach out to coworkers or classmates. Ask these people ""So, how have they treated you?"" See if they share any of your concerns or complaints.

, Many narcissists will only seek help as a result of the urging of you or close family and friends whose lives have been negatively affected by their behavior; however, another reason a narcissist may show up for professional treatment is after experiencing depression. The sense of superiority and grandiosity of the narcissist may be severely challenged when this person experiences negative consequences like rejection, prompting a depressive mood state.Do you notice your date getting really down in the dumps after a bad evaluation or when something doesn't go their way? This could be a sign of the person's sense of superiority taking a depressive dive.

, Having a strong network of friends and family nearby to lean on is a great antidote to being in a relationship with a narcissist. Simply having a shoulder to cry on after a particularly hurtful encounter or an ear to vent your frustrations to can be comforting as you learn to live with a narcissist. Be sure to choose a trusted adult that you can count on to keep your confidences, such as a best friend, counselor, or religious/spiritual advisor.Reach out to a trusted confidante by saying, ""I really need to talk to someone about my relationship. Are you willing to listen?""
It may also be helpful to seek out and participate in local or online support groups for those who love narcissists. Sharing your experiences with others who can relate may give you the support you need.

, Although it may be easier said than done, don’t take the narcissistic behavior of your partner personally. Condescending language, emotional manipulation, and blame can all eat away at your self-worth. Remember that these behaviors are a reflection of your partner’s insecurities, not your own. To counteract any negative impact from being around this person, support your own self-esteem and self-worth and refuse to be a victim.Ways to improve your own self-confidence include practicing self-compassion (i.e. being good to yourself and not continuing condescending language internally), making a list of your best attributes or accomplishments, spending time with people who value you, and taking good care of your health and well-being through diet, exercise, and stress-management.

, It’s important to accept that you cannot change your partner. Nonetheless, you do have control over how you interact with and react to a narcissist. Since being in a relationship with a narcissist likely causes you great emotional pain, if you are considering maintaining the relationship, you must have boundaries in place.Let your partner know that you will not accept insults from them. Reinforce this by pointing out disrespect or hurtful comments when this person becomes condescending.
Learn how to say “no” and stand behind it. Guilt-tripping or blaming on the behalf of the narcissist can make you give in. Don’t. Let the person know “I’ve told you my answer. I no longer want to discuss this.”
Refuse to react to emotional manipulation. Ploys for your attention should be ignored; however, when your partner treats you respectfully and acknowledges your boundaries, be sure to highlight how much you appreciate this treatment. “Thank you for respecting my decision on this matter and not trying to change my mind” is a great way to let the person know you notice progress.

, If you are in a committed relationship with a narcissist, you may try to convince your partner to seek out professional help. There is research to show that with intense therapy a narcissist can change these maladaptive ways of interacting with others.You may gently suggest therapy by focusing on a situational example like ""Hey, babe, I've noticed you have been pretty upset ever since you didn't get accepted into grad school. I think it would be a great idea if you went to see a professional to discuss your feelings about this."" This is a great way to get the person in the door, without them becoming defensive or denying the problem.
Long-term talk therapy can help a narcissist understand the reasons behind his or her emotions, thoughts, and actions and, ultimately, develop more effective ways of interacting with others.
If your partner has symptoms of depression or other debilitating symptoms, their mental health provider may also prescribe medication to help with treatment., When it comes down to it, you are responsible for supporting your own emotional and mental well-being. If you find that being in a relationship with a narcissist undermines your well-being, get out as soon as you can. Ending a relationship with a narcissist can be difficult due to this person’s naturally manipulative nature. Here are some tips to cutting all ties:Commit to leaving the relationship fully. Avoid maintaining even minimal contact, if possible.
Don’t give in to manipulations or repeated promises that they will change.
Start a loving relationship with yourself to pour in the love that the narcissist may have withheld.
Look to the future. Believe in your mind and heart that there are better days ahead. With time, you can find healing.

Do your kids know that you are dating someone who is very important to you, even if they haven't met her yet? Consider whether you intend for this person to be in your life (and your kids' lives) next year. If so, it's probably the time to proceed. If not, it is not time to introduce them until you have greater certainty about the relationship's intended future.;
, Once you are clear that you and she are planning to be together for awhile, talk to your girlfriend about your kids. Let her know how important they are to you. Let her know what activities, or preferences she may connect with them on. Begin introducing her to them before they actually meet, by way of talking about them often and in detail, so that she can feel more comfortable with the idea of you as parent.

, Tell them why she is important to you. Let them know what makes her special. Let them know that she is a special friend and that you want them to meet her, to get to know her finally.

, Don't just spring it on them. Let them know you are planning an activity for you all together next weekend, for example. Or, make it for the next time they spend time with you. Give them a heads up, to avoid surprises.

, An introduction might best happen through an activity so that you all have something to do together, and a reason to chat along the way.


Depending upon the age of your children, different activities may be appropriate.  Some examples may be: shopping for ingredients then baking or cooking together, going to the zoo together, a sporting event.
It is better to choose an activity that will give you something to do where you can also interact. A movie will be all of you just sitting next to each other quietly, while going to dinner will be quite a bit of pressure to come up with conversation. These latter two examples will be good activities for later on, but not for the first meeting.

, This may mean meeting her outside and walking in together. Or, both of you picking the kids up together. Make sure that your girlfriend feels connected to you first, before meeting the kids.  She is the outsider and will likely feel like a third (or fourth or fifth) wheel once the children are in the vicinity. If you want her to feel included, it will help for you to go out of your way for the first few months of her relationship with your kids.

, Let them get to know each other at their own pace. And don't expect everyone to immediately love each other. This will take time; that's to be expected, is perfectly normal, and can't be hurried along. This is especially the case if your kids don't live with you full-time.

Find out what sort of geek girl your girlfriend is.,
Take her to places she'll enjoy spending time at.,
Talk books.,
Enjoy video games together.,
Be news-savvy.,
Cook for her.,
Enjoy her crafts.,
Show her your collection of impressive somethings.,
Give her gifts a geek girl likes.,
Get ready to cosplay and attend conventions together.,
Read her poems, essays, and novels.",How to Impress a Geek Girlfriend," This will guide what you do together, talk about together, give her, and what you'll need to swot up on! Geek girls include computer geeks, science fiction (SF) geeks, fantasy geeks, math or science geeks, history geeks, music geeks, writing geeks, etc. and many geek girls are a combination.;
, A geek girl will often prefer dates where you're able to talk together rather than having to shout because you're being drowned out by loud music and drunks.


Find out where her favorite watering hole is and reserve her favorite seats - by the fire, by the window, etc.
Meet up in her favorite bookstore or cafe with books. This might also be a comic store, the library, or a used bookstore.
Visit a museum, a nature park, an art gallery, or state of the art exhibition.
Go geocaching or treasure hunting together.
Never overlook the value of staying for a Lord of the Rings or Star Trek marathon...

, Be a guy who loves reading books and talking about them. Geek girls love their books; be sure you've really read the stuff you're talking about.

, Many geek girls will love video games as much as you do; just be sure to pick games they enjoy and not only yours alone.


Enjoy board games and card games together as well. Plan a board game night now and then.

, Listen to the news and be prepared to discuss current events in detail.


Don't presume you're smarter than she is. If she's clearly smarter than you, let it go and love it! If she has more acronyms after her name than you do, revel in it!

, Let her know you're able and willing to cook. Make it delicious. And end it with a cake made in the shape of her favorite SF character.

, If she's into knitting, crochet, sewing, baking, calligraphy or tatting, ask to see her works. Ask to see her online photo album or blog following her craft pursuits.

, Many geeks collect something of interest, from Star Trek figurines to comic books. What have you got stashed away to impress her with?


In turn, love what she's collected; compliment it excessively! Ask if you can take photos of it so you can look at them when you're not together.

, Geek girls aren't fond of repeats of the standard gifts of flowers or perfume. She'll melt if you give her books, book vouchers, DVDs of favorite movies or TV shows, collectibles, or a new video game.


Potted plants can work better than flowers – they continue to grow. Look for unusual types, such as cacti, pitcher plants, rare orchids, etc.
Like most people, a geek girl will appreciate chocolate but aim for the better quality chocolate, with clarity as to source and cocoa percentage - the more boutique, the better.

, Get out your diligently prepared costume and wow her with your enthusiasm to go to a convention together and meet other like-minded people for fun.


Be prepared to spend time together making chainmail, sewing cloaks, and sourcing the right wood for wands!

, If she's into NaNoWriMo, proofread her work for her before she enters it. Send her poems or works off to publishers for her.


Love her blog or photo collection online. Leave supportive comments!
Love her imaginary world; let her know often just how awesome her imagination is.

Examine the situation.,
Reflect on your feelings.,
Talk with your boyfriend.,
Create some space.,
Rededicate yourself to your job or a hobby.,
Spend time with friends and family members.,
Give him the cheek.,
Distance yourself.,
Limit eye contact.,
Stop initiating communication.,
Ignore his calls and texts.,
Shorten your responses.",How to Ignore Your Boyfriend," Identify when your boyfriend’s behavior started to upset you. Consider how your actions may have impacted the situation.


Does the shift in his mood coincide with a stressful week at school or work or has he been acting strange for months? His inattention may not be a reflection of his feelings for you, but his emotional response to a stressful or upsetting situation.
Are you placing unreasonable expectations on your boyfriend? Do you flood his inbox with texts? Are you constantly checking up on him? Or, have you remained patient, calm, and trusting? Are you the only one putting any effort into the relationship?;
, Ask yourself why you desire to ignore your boyfriend. Are you fighting? Is he failing to communicate with you? Consider why his actions, or lack of actions, are upsetting you. Are you the only one putting any effort into the relationship? Remember, you are allowed to feel upset, hurt, angry, or neglected.Keep track of your thoughts in a journal.
Talk through your feelings with someone you trust. Talk about your feelings over coffee with your best friend.

, Have a conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. Allow him to respond. Don’t cut him off or interrupt him. If he remains emotionally evasive or brushes of your concerns, end the conversation and take action.Take responsibility for your feelings. Use ""I"" statements, such as ""I feel ignored,"" ""I am concerned about our relationship,"" ""I feel hurt when you choose to hang out with your friends instead of spending time with me.""
Avoid ""you"" statements, which place the blame completely on the other person. Examples of ""you"" statements include ""you are ignoring me,"" ""You don't seem to care about our relationship,"" and ""you never want to see me."", Don’t spend all of your spare time with your boyfriend! Intentionally spend time away from your significant other. Limit the amount of time you see your significant other. It may make him miss you!Occupy yourself. If you live together, do not let him be the center of your attention. Read a book, go for a run, cook something, clean something, do anything but do not try to get his attention just to entertain yourself.
Do not spend every night at your boyfriend's house. Try to spend a few nights a week alone. This will give him time to realize that he may miss you when you are gone.

, Now that you have spare time, invest it in your career or a new hobby. Filling your time with new activities and setting new professional goals for yourself will make it easier to intentionally spend time away from your boyfriend.Refocus your energy on excelling at work. Take on a new project or assume additional responsibilities.
Devote your free time to scrap booking, a new club, or a sport. Finding activities that allow you to meet new people are a great way to fill your time!
Get active! Join a local gym or explore a new trail.
Spend time outside. Go to the beach or relax under a tree with a great book!

, Instead of sitting at home alone, go out with your friends and spend time with your family. Enjoy a night out on the town with your besties! Plan a trip to see your family. Fill your social calendar with fun hangouts, spontaneous adventures, and relaxing outing. Reconnecting with friends and family members will make it easier for you to ignore your boyfriend.Visit your local art museum with a friend.
Invite a close family member over to your place for dinner.
Host a themed party.

, When you are out and about town with your boyfriend, abstain from PDA. Treat him as you would treat a friend. If he goes in for a kiss, give him the cheek. When he reaches for your hand, put it in your pocket.Don't toy with him by initiating PDA. Resist the urge to rub his back or rest your head on his shoulder.

, Increase the amount of physical space between you and you boyfriend. Don’t sit directly next to him on the couch, but sit a space away or opt to sit in a chair. Put distance between your bodies at night.Don’t spoon with him in bed!
If you attend the same class, sit a different row.
Separating yourself from him physically will make it easier to avoid his advances (and keep you from initiating contact too)!

, When you happen to run into your boyfriend in public, avoid making eye contact with him. Avert your eyes to something in the distance. Look up. Look down. Look all around. Just don’t look at him!Don't turn your back to him, you won't be able to see his reaction? Keep him in your peripheral vision; watch him out of the corner of your eye.

, Don’t call your boyfriend or text him. Let him take the initiative to contact you for a change. When the urge to call him arises, call a friend instead. Make plans to see a movie or go out to eat with your friend. Only contact your boyfriend when it is absolutely necessary!
Avoid him on social media too. If it is too tempting to chat with him online, take a brief hiatus from social media or block him.

, When your boyfriend contacts you, ignore him! Let his calls go to voice mail. Let his unanswered text messages fill your inbox. Force your boyfriend to wait around for your response!Resist the urge to constantly check your phone. Keep it in the next room, turn it off, or put it on silent.
Give your phone to a friend or family member.
Ignore his attempts to reach you on social media platforms too! Don't respond to his messages or reply to his comments. Block him for a short period of time if you must.

, When you talk with your boyfriend, keep the conversation brief. Reply to his inquiries with short responses, don’t elaborate. Don’t ask him questions about his day or his plans for the weekend. Come off as aloof and uninterested.Reply with head nods and shrugs.
Keep your responses brief. Use one word answers: “Yes,” “No,” “Okay,” and “Fine.”

Avoid the stereotype of the ""Ugly American"".,
Be open-minded.,
Be patient.,
Keep the dating laid back.",How to Impress a French Girl," Even if you're not American, you'll be better off avoiding the characteristics of the so called ""Ugly American"" such as: being obnoxiously loud, complaining because things are different from home, and dressed too casually.Here are some guidelines (you can find more in How to Avoid Looking Like an American Tourist).


Dress a little nicer than usual. Casual dress (athletic shoes, baseball hats, sweatshirts, t-shirts, jeans, or shorts) is not as common in France. The French girl you like is probably not dressed like she just rolled out of bed, or got back from the gym. Neither should you!
Eat like the French. Don't ask for condiments (ketchup, salt, pepper), ice in your drink, a non-smoking area, or decaf. Eat slowly. Savor your food.
Don't brag, lose your temper, argue loudly with your companions, or do anything to draw attention to yourself that you don't see other French people doing.;
, The French are generally a very tolerant people. If you have conservative political and religious views, understand that this French girl is likely to have a more liberal perspective. Getting into an argument over the way things ""should be"" is an easy way to kill the romance. Be ready to say Chacun ses goûts--the French equivalent of ""different strokes for different folks"".

, A French journalist who dated women on both sides of the Atlantic observed that women in some cultures (especially American) have a more ""contractual"" approach to dating, in that they want to know what the status is of the relationship, where is it going, etc. You might find that French girls are not in as much of a hurry to define the relationship, and may be more quiet and coy than you are used to.If this is an unsettling surprise to you, it may help to read How to Stop Being Needy and How to Tame a Free Spirit.

, The author of a book about how French women date observed that they preferred getting to know a man at dinner parties and by taking walks, rather than on a formal date which feels more like a job interview.So if you want to spend more time with a French girl, consider throwing a dinner party of your own, or asking her to take a walk with you.

Know what you're looking for in a future husband and don't settle because he seems ""okay."",
Don't stick around with a guy who is manipulative and controlling.,
Beware of rushing into a relationship.,
Trust yourself.,
Communicate.,
Don't rush into sex.,
Recognize disrespect as a warning.,
Examine his relationship with his mother.",How to Know if Mr.Right Isn't Really Mr.Right," You don't want a man who's just okay, do you? No! You want Mr. Right! Start by making a list of good qualities that you want in a man, differences between you that you can work out, and deal breakers - the things you just can't live with. It's fine if he likes pizza and you don't, or if you think bowling is loads of excitement and he thinks it's a drag - these are activities you can share with other friends, but they aren't fundamental to the relationship. If you are religious and he's an all out atheist, it won't work. Love shouldn't be conditional, and it makes no sense changing who you are for someone else. Guys can be tricky and if you see particular qualities in them that don't add up with your original plan, dump him! It can only lead to heartbreak in the future. Allow yourself to turn back at the first signs of a shipwreck even if you like this guy a whole lot. It will be better for you in the long run if you can be strong enough very early on to realize that the differences you've already seen will mean the relationship is doomed.;
, He can say things like: ""If you break up with me, you'll regret it, because no one can make you happier than me."" or ""If you won't have sex with me, then you don't love me as much as I love you."" This person is officially a walking time bomb, and this is also a pretty good indication that he is immature and not ready for a relationship. Again, love should be unconditional. Your desire to spend a little time out with your girls one night of the month does not mean you don't love him enough. A guy who uses this phrase is someone you should run from immediately! Be your own person. ""The oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow,"" said Khalil Gibran and, he was completely right. You have the right to remain the same person you always were, and if your man can't appreciate that, then he is not ""Mr. Right."" One.

, Likewise, beware of being strung along with no commitment. If you met a guy this weekend in a club, and within a month or so, you guys are ""together,"" it is likely to end just as quickly as it began. On the other hand, if you've been ""talking"" and going out with a guy for 6 months and he hasn't even brought up getting together, it's probably not going to happen. A guy who can't pull it together to call you his girlfriend after 6 months will probably still not be ready for marriage after 6 years!

, If you're crazy about the man, but for some reason, your alarm bells tell you he isn't as crazy about you, trust your intuition. Be direct and ask him about his feelings. Tell him you are ready to settle down with him and ask if he feels the same way about you. If he can't or won't give you a straight answer, leave. Get out of the relationships and fast! It's a woman's instinct that allows her to tell when something is wrong. It doesn't make sense being in a relationship that isn't built on trust.

, If a guy speaks to you too much about his past relationships and you feel uncomfortable with it, let him know it's bothering you. If he continues to talk about his ex, especially if she dumped him, then break it off. It's obvious to you that he needs time to think about whether he is really ready to move on.

, Dating is the way we decide whether this person is right for us. Women tend to view sex as a very intimate act, while men aren't nearly as warm and fuzzy about it. No matter how gorgeous or perfect he seems to be in the first two to three months, you have to remind yourself that you really haven't had a chance to know him deeply. Wait until you really know this man before you share this very intimate part of yourself with him. If, after a month or two, it turns out that, gorgeous as he is, he's not Mr. Right, it will be much easier to let him go if you haven't been sleeping with him. If he pressures you before you are ready, dump him. You need a mature man who is willing to respect your wishes on this important subject.

, A man who really loves you will never disrespect you in front of others, especially early in the relationship. While gentle teasing is acceptable, ragging on your flat chest, calling attention to the fact that you've gained a few pounds, or making you the butt of his jokes should be a warning to you. A man in love will not only never disrespect you himself, but he won't stand for others saying rude things to you or about you. If you really want that knight in shining armor, don't accept a neanderthal who doesn't know how to treat a woman. This extends to his treatment of your friends> If he's calling your best friend an ""ugly ho"" or some other nonsense, that is disrespectful. Tell him so, and insist he behave in a respectful manner where you and your loved ones are concerned. The same goes for you - don't take advantage of him by making pointed comments about him, either. Verbal abuse is still abuse, and girls can do it to guys just as easily as guys can do it to girls.

, You can tell a lot about a man by the way he treats his her, and his whole family. If he's too attached, he's a mama's boy and you'll have to deal with his mom as long as you're together. If he's dismissive or rude to her, he's going to be that way with you. If he idolizes her, beware. You will find yourself trying to live up to that goal that was set by his mother, and that is not only stressful, but impossible. It's about finding the perfect medium, a guy who looks after his mother but doesn't worship or depend on her fully - and by fully, that means things like housing, rent money, food money, car and clothes.

Get to know her.,
Hug her goodbye when you part ways with her.,
Open your arms and step toward her to signal that you want to hug her.,
Hug her whenever it feels natural.,
Read her reaction.",How to Hug Your Girlfriend1," Walk with her. Talk with her. The more time you spend with her, the more natural it will be to hug her.


Consider holding her hand. Don't ask her: just reach for her hand while you're walking together and twine your fingers into hers. This establishes physical intimacy, but it isn't as heavy as a hug.
If she is very shy or reserved, she may not be comfortable hugging in public, at least not at first. Be considerate.;
, This moment is the perfect opportunity to make a move.


Maybe you walked her to her next class at the end of lunch, and now it's time for you to head to your own class. Maybe you walked her home and you're leaving to walk to your own house. No matter the situation, you're probably going to tell her goodbye, and you can easily turn this into a hug.
If you are walking together, slow down until you are at a complete stop. If she keeps walking, she may not be ready for the hug.
Say, ""Well, I'd better get to class."" or ""It's been great talking to you."" This will establish that you're leaving without saying ""goodbye"" yet. Consider saying something romantic, like ""I really like you."" or ""You have such a beautiful smile."" If it's a new relationship, try not to come on too strong and say something like ""I love you."" This might scare her.
Look into her eyes. There will be a moment when you're both looking at each other. Open your arms, step toward her, and initiate the hug.

, Wrap your arms around her and hold her gently. Don't hug her too hard, at first, but don't be stiff about it. If she's into it, she will return the hug.


The important thing is that the hug feels natural, not forced. If you get the moment right, she won't even have to think about it. She'll just hug you back.
It doesn't matter too much whether your arms are on top, or her arms are on top. If you're much taller than her, it may feel more natural to hug her around the shoulders while she hugs you around the waist. When you're more intimate with her, you may want to hug her with your arms below hers--this brings your faces closer together.
Don't hug too tight. Be careful not to hurt her or make her uncomfortable. You should be holding her gently, but not squeezing her. If she squeezes you, by all means squeeze her back.
Bear in mind that if she shrinks back from the hug at first, she may just be surprised. It doesn't necessarily mean that she doesn't want you to hug her. In fact, there's a good chance that she's just as nervous as you are.

, You don't need to hug her only to say goodbye--you just need to make sure that the mood is right.


Hug her anytime you'd hug a female relative--your mother, your sister, your aunt. You'll hug your girlfriend differently than you would hug a female relative, but some of the emotions are the same.
Hug her when she's sad. Open your arms, hold her firmly, and let her cry into your shoulder.
Hug her when she's happy. If she's excited, open your arms and step toward her to offer a hug. Odds are, she'll take the hint and jump into your arms.
Hug her when you feel emotionally close to her. If you've just said romantic words to each other--something like ""I like you a lot."" or ""I'm so glad you're my girlfriend.""--try to hug her in the heat of the moment. Open your arms, step toward her, and offer a hug.

, If you reach to hug her and she seems into it, then keep hugging her. If she refuses, let her go.


If she seems uncomfortable or she pushes you away, give her space. She may not be ready to become physically intimate with you, even if it's just hugging. If she doesn't have much relationship experience, she may not know what to do in the situation.
Again, odds are that if she's calling herself your girlfriend, she wants you to hug her. Go hug her!

Put your arm around her while you're sitting next to her.,
Sit next to her.,
Make the move.,
Consider yawning for effect.",How to Hug Your Girlfriend2," This is a classic early-relationship move. If she's open to a hug, she's probably open to this.


You can try this any time that you're sitting next to her for longer than a few minutes. Consider putting your arm around her during a movie, a concert, a school play, in the backseat of a car, or on a ferris wheel.
Make sure that the seat you're sitting in has a back-side to rest your arm on. Couches are great for this.
Consider picking a time when there aren't many other people around. She may feel self-conscious if a lot of her friends, or yours, see you make your move. If the lights are low--say, you're watching a movie, or it's dark outside--she may feel more comfortable.

, Sit close enough that you can reach around to her far shoulder--anywhere from a few inches to a foot apart.


Wait until you've been sitting next to each other for at least 5-10 minutes. She should be comfortable, and you should be comfortable.
Wait for the right moment: maybe there's a romantic scene taking place in the movie, or maybe it's a slow, cinematic scene when there's no dialogue and the music swells. Avoid making your move during an especially tense moment, such as a chase scene or a scene with complex dialogue. When you put your arm around her, the movie is the last thing that she'll be thinking about, and she might be irritated if you make her miss something important.

, Lift your arm slowly but purposely and reach behind her. Lay your arm against the back of the couch or seat, and gently rest your arm along the ridge of her shoulders.


Play it cool. Be casual and nonchalant. If she doesn't shake your arm away, there's a good chance that she's into it. Leave your arm where it is and keep watching the show.
Keep acting the same way that you were doing before, but feel about ten times cooler.
If she shrugs your arm away or moves your arm off of her shoulder, don't push it. She isn't in the mood, or she isn't interested. Keep your cool and keep watching the show.

, This is a classic ""excuse"" to lift your arms up and make the move.


Take a big, theatrical yawn, reach your arms high into the air, and lay one arm down on her shoulders. Rest your arm there unless she shrugs you away.
The yawn is a cheesy move, to be sure, but it might make her laugh and break the tension of the moment.

Decide first of all if there's someone you know that you want to make your boyfriend or if your happy for The One to wander into your life at random.,
Be sociable.,
Look and feel your best at all times when you are out and about.,
Be approachable.,
Smile.,
Be confident in your personal hygiene.,
Find something that makes you feel super confident.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Don't adopt some look or other like Emo, Scene or whatever else just to get a guy.,
Be normal.,
Show guys you like them.",How to Increase Your Chances of Having a Boyfriend," If there's someone you've got your eye on, make sure you know them so you're not wasting your time on someone you ultimately won't get on with.;
, You won't meet anyone, let alone attract them and end up with them as a boyfriend, if you don't at least communicate with other people. Start hanging out with your friends. Go online, join a dating agency if that's appropriate for you. Go to evening classes, school clubs, community social events, out for coffee on your own, jogging, walking etc etc. Get out and about meeting up with people you know so you can meet new people or be brave and have that coffee 'in' and not to go or head out somewhere people gather on your own.

, You don't have to wear your best outfit to nip down to the dairy for a packet of Tim Tams, but you're more likely to catch someone's eye if your walking tall in some nice jeans and an ironed top or whatever else makes you feel good, than if you scuttle about, head down, clad in jogging bottoms, a scruffy vest top and jandals.

, Don't glare at people who stare at you, you don't know why they are starring. Don't be the first to break eye contact. Don't stand around with your arms folded looking miserable. That guy asking you the time might not just want to know the time! Could be that's the only thing he could think of to say, so, smile tell him the time, and if you like him, say, 'Hope you're not late for a date'

, No need to grin like a loon but try to have a happy, friendly expression on your face most of the time. Even if you're not feeling too flash, try not to show it.

, You might meet 'The One' on a day you skipped cleaning your teeth or a bad hair day, sure, but, you'll feel more confident talking to any potential boyfriends if you're looking and feeling clean and healthy. Being sweaty at the gym is fine, having one pimple is NORMAL, scars, birth marks, moles, wheel chairs, walking aids, hearing aids, big ears, green hair, pierced lips, tattoos, all NORMAL! Nothing about your physical appearance is any more or less likely to stop you getting a boyfriend unless YOU let it by feeling self conscious about it and letting it bother you.

, It could be a scent, an item of clothing, a lipstick, some underwear, a bag, a belt, anything. Have this be your talisman for feeling Great. Know that whenever you have your chosen thing with you, you're on top! You can wear this whenever there's a chance of boyfriend material around, even on line!

, Don't hold out for a Brad Pitt lookalike if there's a kind, genuine, funny guy next door. Realise that you won't meet the man of your dreams down to the finest detail! Don't reject guys on the basis of their height, skin colour, income, eye colour, preference in clothes, parental status etc. One date won't kill you, as long as you are sensible, and, you might meet Mr Practically Perfect while you're out with Mr Not So Perfect.

, If you are Scene, Emo, Preppy, Country, Death Metal or whatever else, realize that you may be putting off a lot of nice guys who aren't Emo, Preppy, Country etc. It's fine to label yourself and identity yourself however you wish to. None of the popular 'looks' are wrong or right, but realize your look may mean you only attract others who like this look and people are very likely to make assumptions about your personality, rightly or wrongly, based on what you look like.

, Don't assume you need a certain personality to get a boyfriend. Shy people have boyfriends, outgoing people get into relationships, quirky people get married, boring people aren't found boring by everyone, witty people have love affairs, there's someone out there who will like you enough to be your boyfriend despite any little flaws you may think you have. Adapt by all means but you need to feel comfortable to say and do what you like with anyone, let alone a potential boyfriend.

, When you meet a boy or man you like, in real life or on line, don't assume he knows you like him. Some guys are terrible at picking up on subtle hints. A guy who doesn't know you like him will NEVER be your boyfriend unless you can find a way of letting him know, beyond any doubt, that you are at least interested in him. Try flirting, but make sure he knows you really want to playfully show him you are sexually attracted to him and not just being friendly. Try being direct and asking to see him again. You can do this without asking for a date by saying, 'So, if I stop by here again, am likely to see you?'. Pay him a compliment, see if he pays you one back. Make eye contact and have a good conversation instead of just passing the time. All of these are more likely to get you a boyfriend!

For example, she may be able to study for 45 minutes without her mind wandering. Point this out to her so she can study in the most effective blocks of time.Your girlfriend may need help recognizing what her optimum study time is. If you’re studying or reading nearby, try to look for signs that she’s losing focus, such as fidgeting, looking around the room, or falling asleep.;
, Your girlfriend may find that there’s a particular time of day that allows her to study more effectively. For example, if she can concentrate better in the morning, she should schedule her study time earlier in the day. If she’s a night owl, it may be better to study at night., If your girlfriend is stressed because she doesn’t feel like she has enough time to study, help her create a schedule. Go over all of her daily activities, such as classes, an after school job, or sports, so you can find free blocks of time. Have her choose the time slots for studying and write them down in a planner or her phone’s calendar., While your girlfriend may need your help to study at times, she also needs quiet time when she can read or go over the test materials. If she tells you that she’s studying for the next hour, don’t call her, text her, or stop by her home because you may distract her.Don’t get upset if she’s unable to make plans with you for a certain night either. For example, if you want to see a movie on a night that she needs to study, offer to go see the film the next night instead.

, You can help your girlfriend go over the the material for her test is by asking her to repeat the information aloud to you. She shouldn’t use her notes or books to provide the facts, and you can ask questions where appropriate to make sure she really knows the facts.If your girlfriend is studying a subject that you’re not familiar with, you can simply ask her to repeat certain pieces of information. That can be particularly helpful if it seems like she’s struggling with certain facts.

, Practice tests are often the easiest way to go over material for a test. Sitting down to take one by yourself can get a little tedious, though, so you can help your girlfriend by asking her questions from a practice exam.Make sure to have the answer key for the practice test nearby so you can go through the exam as efficiently as possible.
If your girlfriend gets a question wrong, tell her the right answer. Mark the question, and come back to it after you’ve gone over the rest of the questions.

, Flashcards aren’t just for little kids; they’re one of the more effective memory retention techniques because they allow you to focus on key points. Your girlfriend can put the information the cards since you might not know it, and you can make them more colorful with markers, stickers, or other images to get her attention. You can read the cards to your girlfriend or she can go over them by herself.Flashcards work well for both individuals who learn better through listening and those who learn better by reading or using graphs, charts, maps, or diagrams.

, While she’ll want to make the most of her studying time, remind your girlfriend that it’s important to take breaks. They allow her to clear her mind so she can refocus on the material. Advise her to take a 10 minute break every 90 minutes or so she can concentrate more effectively.If she’s studying in front of a computer, encourage her to take a break from all screens. Looking at her phone won’t be as energizing as getting up and walking around.
If possible, suggest that she take a break outside. The fresh air can help make her more alert and refocus on her studying. A little exercise, such as yoga, can help energize her too.

, Your girlfriend needs to stay energized to keep her focus on her studies, and that means she needs fuel. Giving her some snacks to munch on as she studies can be a big help, but make sure that they’re healthy so they don’t make her feel tired or sluggish. Fruit, veggies, nuts, granola bars, yogurt, and pretzels are all good options.Your girlfriend may also appreciate a caffeine pick-me-up in the form of coffee or an energy drink. A little is okay, but try not to load her up on too much caffeine or she may get jittery and jumpy.
Bringing her a couple of bottles of water can help her stay hydrated too.

, If she’s got a big test to study for, chances are that your girlfriend is nervous. Encourage her to take a deep breath and relax when she’s getting worked up. It may seem like a small thing, but it can help her stay focused and calm.If she’s into meditation, you might even suggest that she meditate to help her relax.

, In some cases, your girlfriend may just need a little support to feel more confident about her exam. Jot down a quick note telling her that you believe in her and wishing her luck and tuck it inside her notes or books so she’ll see it when she’s studying.You can also send a quick text or a message through social media to let your girlfriend know that you support her. A funny YouTube video or meme could be a nice touch as well.

Weigh the risk of standing up to your parents against the risk of being caught.,
Don't tell anyone that you don't trust.,
Make good excuses.,
Don't act suspicious around your parents.",How to Hide Your Boyfriend from Your Parents1," Try to understand where your parents are coming from. If you are trying to be sneaky because your boyfriend is significantly older, abusive in any way, or could have any other negative effects on your well-being: reflect on the reason why you're trying to keep him from your parents. Decide if it is really worth it. If your boyfriend is a genuinely good guy, then your parents might be acting unreasonably.Is your boyfriend a bad influence, or involved in gangs/drugs, or very controlling or cruel to others? Your parents may just be concerned about you spending time with someone that they don't trust.
Consider any religious or cultural differences that might be driving your parents' decision. It may not be fair of them to impose their beliefs and values onto you, but it may be hard to go completely against the grain until you're supporting yourself.;
, People love to talk about other people, and news may travel quickly through your school, church, or community. Be very careful who you tell, and make sure that they understand the gravity of the situation. If your friends tell their parents, then their parents might tell your parents. If your friends tell their friends, their friends might tell their parents, who might in turn tell your parents. Don't underestimate the power of gossip!


Tell your friends that your boyfriend is a secret. Ask them explicitly not to tell anyone, and make it very clear that you're serious.

, Avoid lying. Just tell the truth about things that don't relate to your boyfriend. If your parents ask you what you did at school today, and you were ditching P.E. to be with your boyfriend: you still don't have to lie. Don't mention P.E., and tell them what you did in science, history, and math.

, If you act strangely or differently than you usually do, they might begin to suspect that you're hiding something. Try to keep a level head, and don't let anything slip. If your parents keep a close eye on your activity, they might notice when you start acting different.If you're texting constantly, talking on the phone more often than before, or spending a lot of time on social media, your parents might start to wonder who you're always talking to. Be more discreet, or be ready with a good excuse!
If you're staying out late at night, or even coming home late from school, your parents might notice.

Be careful when you talk on the phone.,
Consider making a fake/private email account.,
Speak in code.,
Consider asking your boyfriend to make fake social media profiles.,
Delete your messages.",How to Hide Your Boyfriend from Your Parents2," Call your boyfriend by a nickname, when you're on the phone, maybe even a girl's name so that your parents don't suspect who you're talking to. Save that nickname in your contacts; don't use his real name or photo, in case your parents decide to snoop through your phone.


Don't use the name of a friend that your parents know; ideally, pick someone that doesn't have a phone. Do this in case (for instance) you leave your phone in the dining room and you get a call from your boyfriend. Instead of your parents seeing ""Blake Grant"" they'll see, say, ""Bella Grey.""
If your parents are in the same room as you, try to keep a blank expression on your face so they don't catch on that you're talking to your boyfriend. Make them think you're talking to a regular friend.
If you video chat him, make sure you do it when your parents aren't around. They may see you virtually kissing him.

, This is only important if your parents are monitoring your email, or if you think they might be able to get access. If you email your boyfriend a lot, make sure you message him with a fake account so then your parents don't find out about your conversations. If they find out, you could be in trouble, especially if you're messaging things like 'I love you!'

, Establish secret code words or phrases that only you and him know. This way, you might even be able to talk to him on the phone right in front of your parents without them knowing. This goes for call, text, or email, depending on how closely your parents are watching your communication.


For example, slipping the word ""hungry"" into your conversation might mean that you want to meet your boyfriend to get food. The word ""homework"" might mean that you can't get out to meet him tonight.
Try devising a numerical code that signifies when you plan to meet your boyfriend. For example, pretend that you're talking to your friend about your math homework. Use the ""problem number"" to tell your boyfriend that you want to meet at a certain time. If you want to meet up at 10 pm, say, ""Did you do the math homework yet? I'm having trouble with problem number 10.""

, This way, if your parents check out your web history, they won't see his true name or photo. It may help if he creates an entirely new online identity. If not, ask him to abbreviate his name on Facebook (or use his middle name in place of his last name) so that he at least somewhat hides his identity.

, If your parents check your phone or computer often, delete your messages in 5-10 minute intervals. Don't only delete conversations between you and your significant other, but between you and everyone. If you don't have many conversations, it won't be as suspicious.


If your parents ask why you're deleting conversations, just say that you're trying to conserve memory. Tell them that you have a lot of photos, apps, or music, and you're trying to free up space by deleting unnecessary chat records.
Got a message that you really want to keep? Screenshot it and back it up elsewhere: a computer, a flash drive, or even a private album of pictures on Facebook.

Be careful about when and where you meet.,
Consider going out in groups.,
Say you're sleeping over at a friend's house.,
Be very careful about inviting your boyfriend over to your house.",How to Hide Your Boyfriend from Your Parents3," If possible, meet where you won't be recognized. You don't want your parents, your relatives, community leaders, or your parents' friends to see you while you're out with your boyfriend. Meet when your parents think you're somewhere else, you could pretend to have a club meeting, or to be hanging out with a friend. You might even sneak out of the house at night.


If you live in a city, you could meet almost anywhere: a big city park, a free museum, a scenic hill, or a little cafe in your favorite neighborhood. The same goes for the suburbs, although it might be harder to get around if you and your boyfriend don't have your own cars.
If you live in a rural area, you might need to meet up outdoors. Don't hang out with your boyfriend in the park across the street from your house, or the local supermarket, or anywhere that your parents or their friends might run into you.

, When you go out with your boyfriend, your parents will probably want to know where you are. It may be best to bring a friend or two with you when you go out. That way, when they call you, you can just say ""Oh, I'm with Amy,"" and then put Amy on the phone with them to verify that indeed, you are with her and not your boyfriend!

, This is a classic move, but you'll need to be very careful about your story to pull off. The basic idea: if you want to meet up with your boyfriend after hours or even stay over at his house, tell your parents that you are sleeping over at a friend's house. If your parents insist on meeting your friends, then you should use a good friend (who your parents have met) to corroborate your story.


Tell your friend about your plan. If possible if you are completely certain that you can trust your friend's parents have your friend's parents agree to pretend that you're sleeping over. It helps if you name a friend whose house you've slept over at many times before.
If your parents are suspicious, they might call your friend's parents to check out your story. Consider whether this is likely to happen. If so, then you may not want to risk it.

, Understand the risks: if you bring your boyfriend into your parents' space, then you are giving them a huge opportunity to find out about him. Wait for a time when they aren't home, a whole weekend is even better.If you sneak your boyfriend into your house while your parents are home, make sure that he has a secret way to enter and escape. Try to bring him in once your parents are asleep, and be extremely quiet so that they don't suspect anything.
Keep the noise level down so you can listen for your parents voices or footsteps in case they're walking toward your room. Be prepared to hide him under the bed or in a closet at a moment's notice, or have him leave through the window if possible!
Don't leave any evidence that your boyfriend was there. Your parents will get suspicious if they see a men's comb or a men's jacket. If he gives you a gift (a note, a photo, a bouquet of flowers) don't leave it out in the open!

Normalize having guy friends over.,
Tell them he's just a friend.,
Make him familiar to your parents as a friend.,
Consider when and whether it's time to tell your parents.",How to Hide Your Boyfriend from Your Parents4," Have girl friends over, too. Emphasize to your parents that these boys are just friends. The more regular and neutral these visits, the better to warm your parents up to the idea of external male figures in your life.

, As weird as it may sound, band your boyfriend with the rest at first. If you've played it cool enough, your parents won't suspect a thing.

, After a while, your parents will probably loosen up and become used to having him around. This way when (and if) you choose to introduce him to them as your boyfriend, they won't be as disapproving. They will know him and have seen you interact, and they will know that it is a healthy relationship.


Never close the door to your room. That just calls for your parents to get suspicious. Have a very open and casual ""friendship"" with him in front of your family so that they are not uncomfortable or second-guessing anything.

, Once they are friendly with him and are used to having him around, you may choose to tell them about him or continue with how you're going. Whether they like him or not generally plays a large role in that."

Think about why you haven't told them.,
Prove the stability of your relationship.,
Introduce your boyfriend as a friend, first.,
Make sure that it's safe for you to tell them.",How to Hide Your Boyfriend from Your Parents5," Try to understand the underlying communication issues between you and your parents. Perhaps you don't want to tell your parents that you're dating someone of the same gender, or someone from a different ethnic or religious background, or someone significantly older than you. Maybe your parents have forbidden you from having a boyfriend, period. Give yourself a clear picture of the situation so that you can decide how to move forward.


The longer you date this guy, the more likely your parents will be to find out. Your life will be much easier if you don't have to sneak around.
Consider whether your parents would be okay with it. Perhaps you're projecting your own worries onto them. If you aren't sure, ask a trustworthy sibling or relative for advice.

, Your parents might be suspicious of any new guy who comes into your life, but this may just be because they care. Don't tell your parents the moment that you start dating this guy. Give it at least a few weeks (or months) before you break the news, and try to

, If your parents learn to trust him, they may be less hesitant to say ""no"". Consider that your parents may have forbidden you from dating based on the abstract idea of a boyfriend a new and potentially-threatening male presence in your life, but that they might be a bit more lenient if the male presence is a friendly face.


This can be a great way to ""hide"" your boyfriend in plain sight. You will need to be especially careful, however, not to let your parents interacting with him in a romantic way. Try to bring him around in groups, and don't be too affectionate.

, Weigh the consequences of such a conversation. If your parents wouldn't react well (would disown you, forbid you from seeing your boyfriend, etc.), then it may be safer to wait. If you don't feel comfortable telling your parents, consider asking a teacher, a relative, or a community member to sit in as a moderator.

Listen to your boyfriend about his thoughts on children.,
Find out if this is a long-term relationship.",How to Introduce a Boyfriend to Children," After you've been dating your boyfriend for about six months and see this as a more exclusive relationship, consider introducing him to your kids. But nonetheless, talking about your children with your boyfriend early will help to set the tone for when he does meet them.Naturally during this time, your dialogue with your child should vary according to their age (this will be discussed later in the article).
Avoid introducing him too soon to your kids. You want to make sure that your connection with him is strong before he starts to feel like ""part of the family."" It's the same way with possibly introducing him to your parents. Meeting too soon might be uncomfortable.
Consider waiting six months to a year of dating before introducing your new boyfriend to your children. Your kids may not be ready before then to see a potential new ""father figure."" Contact between your boyfriend and your kids should gradually increase over time. ;
, Both your boyfriend and your children should be made aware of an upcoming time that they all will meet. Allow both sides to ask you questions before the day of.Your boyfriend and your children may both be uneasy about meeting. Both adults and children can be awkward sometimes when meeting new people, regardless of the circumstances. Provide guidance and reassurance.
Avoid making assumptions that your boyfriend will fall in love with your kids immediately, or vice versa. Keep your expectations in check.
Consider saying to your boyfriend, ""I know it may be awkward at first, but I was hoping for you to meet my kids next week. What do you think?""

, The first introduction shouldn't involve a big event, or a long-weekend trip. Avoid possible high-stress events or places that could be draining for both your children and your boyfriend. Consider these types of settings: A backyard BBQ with the kids and friends
At a park with a play area for the afternoon
A Wednesday night dinner at home

, While it may seem nerve-racking to you, try not to make it a big deal to your boyfriend or your kids. It may take time for things to go smoothly. Don't be too hard on yourself.Keep the initial visit brief and work up to longer visits. That way anxiety on either side won't eventually get the best of you and cause the visit to break down.


Play it cool, and be easy-going.
Respect that your boyfriend may take some time to warm up to your kids and vice versa. Building friendships and relationships take time.
Consider preparing a few neutral topics for everybody to discuss to relieve both parties from the pressure to carry the conversation. Consider mutual interests and avoid any topics that could cause tension, like politics.

, A younger child may not understand what a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship is. They may just see your boyfriend as someone to have fun and play with. An older child (likely above 11 or 12) might be more aware of the relationship that you and your boyfriend have. If your children are older than 12, consider ways to talk with them about your boyfriend. You may want to discuss with your children about your boyfriend before they meet in person.
If your children are really little, like four years old or less, they may not have much interaction with your boyfriend other than to play, and that's okay.

, Don't make it awkward by trying too hard. If you share too much too soon, it may make your child, and your boyfriend, confused about what's really going on. For your younger kids, you may want to introduce him as ""your friend."" Younger kids have a limited understanding of your relationship on a romantic level. Keep it simple when giving an introduction.
For your teenage kids, you may want to be direct and introduce your boyfriend and your teen by first names. Keep the conversation light. If your older kids have questions, allow them to share their feelings after the meeting with your boyfriend is over.
You don't need to explicitly state that your boyfriend is ""your boyfriend"" or ""your special friend.""

, When your boyfriend meets your kids, allow your kids to be as they are normally when they meet with your friends or relatives. Don't make them act in a strange or new manner that they may not be used to doing.


Do not make your children hug your boyfriend hello or goodbye. A handshake is appropriate, but you want your child to be secure about their personal space. Let the child decide when they are ready to display affection.
Giving a false impression of who you and your children are may make it more difficult for your boyfriend to trust you and see how you truly are.
Allow interactions between you, your kids, and your boyfriend to flow naturally.
Provide your children reassurance if they appear concerned when meeting your boyfriend., When you're first dating, it's important to be honest, particularly about if you have kids. After a few dates, it shouldn't be a surprise to the person you're dating that you have children. You don't need to talk at length about your kids, but be honest that your kids are a part of your life.Be calm and clear about your situation, and that you have children. While it may be tough to tell a new boyfriend, it's tougher to start a relationship off on the wrong foot.
Be confident that being a single parent is nothing to be ashamed of. It shows that you are strong and nurturing.

, Find out what your boyfriend thinks about children. Does he like kids? Does he have kids of his own? Does he enjoy doing family things? If you are wanting a long-term relationship with your boyfriend, you need to really listen to how he responds.See how your boyfriend interacts with children in public. Does he seem irritated by them?
Watch his body language when you both talk about children. Does he seem nervous, or excited when talking about being with kids?
Think about how often your boyfriend interacts with children now. If he's not a parent, he may have little interaction with kids. Some people may have less experience with kids, but still enjoy being with them.

, If you've been dating your boyfriend for a few months or more, you may want to find out what his (and your) intentions are. Are you looking for someone long-term? If so, you need to find out if he feels that same way. He needs to know that your kids are part of the package, and getting to know your kids is important.Think about if you both have the same values about family and children.
Do you see yourself with him in a year? Or five years?
If you see this relationship as a casual fling, you may be less inclined to tell him about having kids. But if you become exclusive, think about what the next steps in the relationship mean to you and him.

First, be casual.,
Don't wear that short skirt with the see-through top that is cut backless.,
Enjoy the moment, and concentrate on having fun and enjoying your time getting to know this new person.,
Relax and be yourself.,
Put your best foot forward like it is a job interview.,
Do something a little crazy, a little wild, and a little unexpected, but not too crazy!",How to Have a Great First Date with a Guy," Put the date out of your mind. Do not daydream about marrying him. If you get emotionally worked up you might be too anxious and serious on the date. Stay busy until it's time to get ready, then go. Look your absolute best but do not dress in something too revealing. Reveal some skin, but in just one place, like your legs or your back or show some cleavage.;
, Have some class and style and be comfortable in your outfit so you can relax.

, Don't worry about tomorrow or the next date, just enjoy it now. Do decide ahead of time just how long you will stay on the date and stick to your limits.

, Be honest, but do not give too much information and do not discuss touchy subjects. Do not share your faults and problems. Don't ""let it all hang out"" because you ""don't like to play games.""

, Above all, do not discuss how much you want to get married and have kids. That will scare a new guy off immediately. Have some boundaries about what you will and will not talk about. Guys will try to pry information out of you. It is his ""job"" on the date to find out everything. This is part of his hunt and chase. Don't fall for that trap and spill too much about yourself.

, Guys love it when you are a little outrageous and can laugh at yourself. Sing some karaoke, sneak into a back door, or play a fun trick on a friend together. These things create a bond and the excitement drives up the chemicals in your brain, leaving you both happy, content and full of energy. Don't drink too much, and don't have sex with anybody on the first date. Be discriminating and get to know people before you go there. Sex is a big decision, and having sex too early can totally change the way your relationship plays out in ways you might not realize, so hang on and just don't go there.

Actively listen.,
Give her the benefit of the doubt.,
Define the nature of your relationship.,
Keep your word.,
Express an interest in her feelings.",How to Handle Women1," Great communication is important to any healthy relationship, regardless of whether or not it is a professional relationship or a personal relationship. Effective communication occurs when both parties actively listens to the other and understands what is intended.Sometimes when a woman is communicating a problem, she does not necessarily want your advice on how to solve it, she simply wants you to listen.
Use body language and gestures to demonstrate that you are paying attention. For example, using good eye contact and leaning forward are ways to communicate that you are interested in the conversation.
Never interrupt because it can appear as though you do not value what is being said.;
, If there is a misunderstanding, do not assume that she is being deceptive. Instead of making assumptions, listen to what she has to say about what has occurred.


To make sure that you are clear on what has happened, repeat what she has said to ensure that you are on the same page.

, In order to avoid misunderstandings, it is a good idea to communicate your understanding of the relationship. If you are just friends without any type of commitment, that should be communicated. If you feel like you are more than friends, then that should also be communicated.

, During your communication with women and anyone else, it is best to say what you mean and mean what you say. Being straightforward will alleviate unnecessary drama and hurt feelings.


Trust and reliability are critical components of any relationship and is especially important if you want to maintain deep connection with someone., To maintain a great long-term relationship with a woman, it is necessary to demonstrate an interest and openness to both caring about and understanding her emotions.Get her to open up about her feelings with questions such as: ""How do you feel about what happened?"" This type of open-ended question will allow her to communicate her feelings so that you can better understand each other.

Understand emotional differences.,
Acknowledge her strengths.,
Respect her boundaries.,
Appreciate her career.,
Compliment her.",How to Handle Women2," While some people believe that women are more emotional than men, that is not necessarily the truth. Research has revealed that men and women simply process emotions differently. The types of situations that provoke an emotional response in women is different than that of men. Instead of dismissing a woman's emotional response, try to get an understanding of what is causing her response.

, One great benefit of relationships is that others may be strong where you are not so strong, which can be highly beneficial to your life. When you are honest about areas where the woman in your life is stronger, it can be of great benefit to you in the long run.

, Some women need personal time and space. How much varies, but generally speaking, you should not be intimated by phone calls and text messages from friends, nor should you feel compelled to monitor them. As long as you trust each other you should not worry about the time that she is away from you.


You should also avoid being controlling and allow her to be her own person by not trying to dictate how she should live her life., There should be a mutual respect for each others career without one person diminishing the other based on the nature of their job. If the woman makes more money, this should not cause a rift or any feelings of insecurity.

, Whether you are in a serious relationship or just friends, a good compliment is often appreciated. When complimenting a woman, be sincere and do not just focus on her physical attributes.


There are many aspects of a woman besides her physical appearance that deserves attention. Consider complimenting her intelligence, sense of humor, creativity, cooking skills, or compassion for others.

Making a decision to accept your differences, whether they are based on gender or not, will likely help you with building positive relationships throughout your life., As with any relationship, being forthcoming and not playing games will get you a lot further than being dishonest.


In the beginning of a relationship, you do not have to put all of your cards on the table right away because you might scare her away. However, if you feel like both of you are moving at the same pace, you can share your feelings and encourage her to do the same.

, Shine a light on her accomplishments and show her that you are proud of what she has achieved.


Kind words, a nice greeting card, or a gift are all ways to celebrate her achievements.

, Show that you respect the relationship by viewing situations from her perspective to better understand how she feels. For most people, perception is reality, so examining situations from her perspective is a great way to be more empathetic.


Set aside your point of view and be open to another perspective.

, Instead of constantly questioning her motives, assume the best about her. If you become suspicious about a situation, do not automatically assume that she is guilty, but instead, respectfully share your concerns to get clarification or more information to better understand the truth."

Be genuine.,
Let yourself be vulnerable.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Listen to You2," Silence or put away your phone, and ask him to do the same if he doesn't copy you. Look right at him, and tell him you want to talk about something important.


""We need to talk"" is often how break-up conversations begin. Unless you're actually breaking up, you may want to phrase it differently, such as ""There's something I'd like to talk about with you.""

, Subtle hints and implications may not work on your boyfriend, and are more likely to leave him confused and frustrated. Being direct is kinder than being passive. It's okay to say how you feel.

, ""I"" language is a good way to assert yourself in a clear, non-accusatory way.


A good template is ""When ______, I feel _____.""
For example, instead of ""You're so lazy about washing the dishes,"" you could say ""I feel frustrated and unappreciated when I come home from work to see a sink full of dirty dishes.""

, Giving him a clear example of why you feel the way you do will help him recognize exactly what's going on. ""You're such a workaholic"" is an un-specific (and aggressive) way to communicate, and your boyfriend won't know how he can improve. ""I feel left out and lonely when you work so late"" lets him know what the problem is and how he can work on fixing it.

, Avoid the temptation to tell him a white lie about whether he looks good in that tie, or cover up the fact that you aren't okay. Work on being more honest and compassionate with your boyfriend. It's okay to tell him things he doesn't enjoy hearing. Part of trusting your boyfriend is trusting him with the truth.


Obviously, honesty shouldn't get in the way of compassion. If your boyfriend comes home exhausted after work, don't tell him he looks like a week-old zombie. Try a more tactful ""Long day at work?"" and help him relax.

, It's okay to admit that you feel hurt, or even to cry if you need to. It may be uncomfortable, but as long as it's genuine, it will help you both recognize the situation and understand each other's feelings. If this is scary to you, find little ways to start opening up, and build up to the more difficult parts. Here are some examples.


""No, I'm not okay.""
""I need help.""
""I felt hurt when you joked about my accent.""
""I'm really worried about my dad. I'm scared that his grief over Grandma's death is overtaking him.""

Find interesting things to talk about.,
Listen to him too.,
Ask for his opinions.,
Let him help you.,
Share your news with him right away.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Listen to You3," Look for things that you and your boyfriend have in common, whether it's a place you both visited, a hobby you enjoy together, or a shared love of cats.


Try learning more about his hobbies. Do any parts of them interest you? If so, these would make great conversation topics.
Most guys are not interested in gossip or celebrities. If you are, save those conversations for people who are interested.

, Your boyfriend also has a lot on his mind, and if you are a patient and sympathetic listener, he'll feel that he can turn to you to talk about important things. Validate his feelings and listen closely to what's on his mind.


Take time to hear him out. Don't rush conversation. This will help him feel that he can let it all out, and once all his feelings have been heard, he'll happily grant you time for all of yours.

, Part of helping him feel valued is wanting to hear what he thinks, and incorporating his advice. This can be a simple as asking him whether you should wear your blue dress or your purple dress, or as complicated as asking for advice on dealing with your overbearing father.

, Many boyfriends immediately want to help if they see that their partner is struggling with something. Let him reach a high shelf or help you brainstorm ways to solve a problem. Helping you makes him feel good, and it offers you an opportunity to practice clear communication and ask for what you need or want.


Tell him how specifically he can help you. For example, ""I could use help figuring out this bug in my program,"" or ""Please hold this end of the sheet so I can fold it.""
If he's busy offering solutions when you aren't ready, try saying something like ""I just need to vent right now."" This lets him know that the best way to help is to listen.

, Your boyfriend will feel special if he is the first (or one of the first) people in your life to hear your big news.

Get creative.",How to Give Your Girlfriend an Unforgettable Birthday," You can’t give your girlfriend an unforgettable birthday if you forget her birthday. If you don’t know it, ask her.


Proper birthday planning doesn’t happen the night before, and you’ll never even know it’s the night before if you don’t ask. You want advance warning for the preparations you should undertake.;
, This should go without saying when it comes to maintaining a healthy relationship and being a functional conversationalist for your partner, but double down when her birthday draws near. The most obvious of hints will be missed without effort. While you’re shopping together, guess what! She will talk about things she likes. Start a list using the notes function on your smartphone, or keep a small notebook in your bookbag (do be discrete when writing in it, though).
Hints can come while you’re both vegging out on the couch idly surfing the web or halfway-watching Netflix. If she’s got her iPad or phone open, keep an ear out for stray comments with gift potential.
This extends out of the realm of gifts, as well. Only by actively listening could you know, for example, that your girlfriend hates surprise parties because she was savagely ridiculed by her best friends at one in the tenth grade about the print of her pajamas and it would be a terrible idea to plan such a thing for her today. Don’t assume she will like something because you like something.

, Even if it's just a few of you hanging around during lunch, she's more inclined to speak freely about interests of hers that she thinks you're not interested in hearing about. Don't let these freely given gift ideas (or opinions which could warn you away from bad gift ideas) go to waste!

, She is, of course, under no obligation to directly tell you what she wants, but simply asking is a straightforward solution which can leave both parties happier.


If she says she doesn’t want anything, it doesn’t mean “literally don’t do anything.” Small gestures like cooking dinner, or crafts which commemorate your time together can be appreciated even if she doesn’t want a big gift. If she doesn’t want an event, how about spending a quiet night in with just the two of you?
It is not recommended to ignore any expressed wishes limiting how much to spend, especially after asking for her input. Thinking “spending more = better gift” is a common mistake when it comes to gift-giving, especially in the early stages of a relationship. While expressing a want opens a person up to disappointment if they don’t receive the desired gift, don’t be discouraged if you can’t fulfill your partner’s first choice. If they want something presently unattainable for you, however, pursue entirely different gift avenues rather than settling for a less ideal version of those limited edition sneakers or that Tom Ford perfume.

, This social media platform exists to pin images of things users like. Simply put, if your girlfriend has one and you’re struggling for gift ideas, look to her Pinterest.


While a little online recon can provide great ideas, never use this as an excuse to invade your girlfriend's privacy. Respecting boundaries is always important.

, What’s appropriate for the girl you asked out in homeroom two days ago won’t be appropriate for your girlfriend of four years whom you share a dorm with, and vice versa. Take the length of the relationship and the level of intimacy into account when handling your significant other’s birthday.


Coming on too strong is another of those common mistakes for a new relationship. Planning out an entire evening of festivities might not be the best bet for newbies, but be communicative, and let her know that you’re thinking of her during her day. Texts or a couple old-fashioned, handwritten notes passed back and forth can accomplish this goal.

, Waiting until the last minute to pick up her gift, or to make reservations at the restaurant, or to ask your boss for time off so that you can meet her at the movies is going to stress you out and create situations where you have to settle for the second (or third) best option for the day. No girlfriend’s idea of an unforgettable birthday involves their partner’s procrastination.


If you’re planning a surprise party, make sure all who would be invited have time to clear their schedules and make any necessary arrangements.
Exploring a museum is a fun possibility for a birthday event, but make sure you’re entirely informed when it comes to the museum’s policies, ticket prices, and hours. Expecting everything to be open because it “seems like it should be” is a good way to have excellent birthday plans dashed at the last minute.

, While every girl may not be overly fond of these, the idea is sound. Small tokens that show you care and think about her while she’s not there can mean the world. Even better than buying a card is making one, no matter your skill level with the ancient tools of marker, glitter, and glue.


Flowers induce emotion, when received and even when given. You’re doing more for yourself than you might think with that bouquet! Just picking a particularly pretty flower you see growing outside and giving it to her without much pomp or circumstance can make her blush.

, Online retailers need time to ship to you, after all, and smaller businesses (like those found on Etsy) often adhere to different timetables than you may expect, and can take longer to fulfill orders. , Digging through your neighborhood's upcoming events online can yield interesting and unexpected ideas for birthday plans, but it’s smart to be abreast of these events even if you’ve already made arrangements. Various festivals, concerts, and construction can derail your day if you’re not expecting them, so plan alternate routes to the restaurant.


Along these same lines, keep up to date on your meteorological happenings. A storm system could spell potential disaster for your hike, while a meteor shower could provide just the right low-key end (or midnight beginning) to a birthday.

, Nothing says an unforgettable birthday requires huge expense. The tried-and-true picnic is ever affordable and fun for a couple's afternoon, down by the water, or in the woods, or just in your backyard with a choice playlist and some privacy.


Even if you're not culinarily inclined, a couple sodas and chicken nuggets can be just what the doctor ordered. Don't hesitate to ask friends and family for help making bruschetta or other easy appetizers, or even with simply laying out a neat french-style spread: deli meats, butter, cheese, and a baguette.

, Being with another person for long enough can create lots of gift potential. Sometimes you can directly use all the opinions, ideas, and places you've experienced together as gifts!


A scavenger hunt is a fun way in which a lot of effort and thought can stretch a smaller gift budget and turn it into a fun experience. Write rhyming clues which reference events specific to your relationship, then hide them for her around your home and class (hopefully nothing that would embarrass her in this case), or at meaningful locations to her. You can ask her family for help so that she'll have the first clue awaiting her when she wakes up for the day, dangling from her ceiling fan!
Scrapbooks are sweet, inexpensive ideas. You can reflect on all your positive memories by pasting photos and old notes into it, and even stick in some ideas for future dates for the two of you. And in case you're self-conscious about making one, hey: there's nothing embarrassing about giving your girlfriend a really good gift.

, It's not clichéd, it's classic. Sending a couple of small--emphasis on small--pebbles up at their window right at the stroke of midnight, even just to wave at them if they can't come outside, is a meaningful gesture that everyone can make.


Bonus point for bringing them their gift because you just can't wait to give it to them, or for holding up a ""happy birthday"" sign.

, We take our phones everywhere now: in the classroom, into meetings, into the bathroom, into bed. Don’t take your cellphone into your girlfriend’s birthday. It’s a distraction that will affect your attention and hamper communication. Undivided attention is the greatest gift of all.


Note: do not mistake “my undivided attention” for a satisfactory birthday gift to give your girlfriend.
You may need your phone on hand to coordinate with friends and family meeting up for the birthday plans. Don’t, however, prioritize checking your cell phone over being mentally and emotionally present for your partner.

, It’s easier than you might think to mistake great gifts for you as great gifts for your girlfriend. Make sure that Super Nintendo you’ve got wrapped in your closet is actually because Super Metroid has immense sentimental value to her, and not because you really wanted to get a Super Nintendo.

, Although she’s the focus, ensuring those gifts you give are undeniably from you can make them all the more meaningful.


If you’re heading out to dinner, don’t just go for the fanciest place possible. Take her to the new pizza place, because you’ve both talked about studying abroad in Italy.
If you’re giving her a book (or any form of art) give her something meaningful to you that you think she will like, but that will make her think of you. Make her a mixtape or an extra special playlist, and she'll think of you every time she hears those bands.

, If you’re a musician, pen something particular to your partner and perform it for them! And if you’re not—take lessons on the sly and perform something for them! Even if it’s bad, you will have given your girlfriend something sincere that could’ve only come from you (and possibly something sincerely funny for the two of you to laugh about later that night).

Be passionate about life.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Meet new people in different ways.,
Try online dating.,
Connect with other single friends.",How to Get Used to a Dating Relationship when You Have Been Married1," While married, you may have fallen into a routine of doing things a certain way, or on a certain schedule. Consider new experiences. If there are things that you had always wanted to do, but never did, then go do them. Find things that interest you, outside of what your family, children, or friends may already be doing. Being passionate about something is an attractive quality to a potential new partner.


Get active. Go to the gym. Join a fitness or activity group. Be outdoors.
Get creative. Make art or music. Attend an art class. Write stories. Build things.

Get happy. Do things that relax and boost your spirits. Make time for fun.;
, There are many things you may have come to rely on during your marriage, including a sense of security or having certain expectations of your spouse. Remind yourself that you are starting with a clean slate and that things will be different when you begin dating. Your date may not know your expectations from your marriage or even be willing to live up to them. In addition, remember that dating relationships are not necessarily committed or monogamous.

Have a conversation early on about your expectations of the relationship. If you are looking for a committed, long-term, monogamous relationship, then let your date know. If that's not what your date is looking for, you may need to move on. Making sure you are on the same page on these subjects may save you some heartache and frustration down the line.
Remember, too, that a dating relationship doesn't have the same security as a marriage. Try to become comfortable with the possibly transitionary and ambiguous nature of dating — at least until the relationship reaches that level naturally.
For instance, you may encounter ""ghosting,"" which is when someone tries to end things with you by ceasing to respond to texts, emails, and calls. This can be a confusing and painful experience, but try not to take it personally or continue to pursue that person.

, Dating should be about having fun and trying new things. The modern world is filled with ways to connect with other singles. Get out of your comfort zone. Consider these ways to find dates: Singles' groups or other group activities like an outdoor club or volunteer group.
Speed dating events. It's a way to meet a lot of other single people and find out if there's an initial spark.
Networking or alumni events. If you're career-oriented, you may want to find some like-minded people.

, At any age, online dating is a great resource for meeting new people. This has become a common way to connect with people in your community. There are many ways to date online, and you can cater the experience to your interests, age, background, or faith.Create a profile that focuses on your strengths and diverse interests. Consider asking a friend to help you edit and craft your profile to make it appealing.
Messages sent through dating apps or emails are like trying to get someone's attention in person. Be open-minded. Flirt in the ways you like and feel comfortable.

, If you're new to the dating scene after marriage, you may be wondering what to expect. Find your single (or also newly-single) friends, and talk with them openly about any fears or concerns.


Avoid seeing yourself as the odd-person-out. You are starting a new adventure, and you have the freedom to choose what happens next.
Go out with other single friends and identity the good and bad of the new dating scene. Depending on how long you've been out of the dating circuit, it may feel strange with new and different ways of interacting.
Kindness, chivalry, and good manners never go out of style in the dating world."
"
Keep things casual at first.,
Find common interests and values.,
Get up-to-date about safer sex practices.,
Avoid introducing your date to your children or family too soon.",How to Get Used to a Dating Relationship when You Have Been Married2," Don't plan out your life with someone on the first date. Enjoy the time in the present and find ways to have fun. After being in a long-term committed relationship, you may want to act like a married person, but now is the time to explore new things and new people.


Laugh, smile, and be happy. When you're dating, it's about being free to have fun. If you're not feeling that, you don't have to be there. Surround yourself with the people and things that make you feel at ease.
Avoid misleading people who may have greater expectations, or conversely, having greater expectations about someone who you only met once or twice.

, Keep the conversation fun with topics that interest both of you. You don't have the focus only on being with people that are the exact same as you, but there should be something that you have in common. Consider these topics as a way to keep it fun:Movies, TV, or other media you're into
Restaurants, cooking and good food
Music, art and books
Fitness, outdoors, and sports
Goals, dreams, and hopes for yourself and your community
Weekend plans or other fun activities

, If you've been married for a long time, you may have anxiety about sex or be eager to find a new love interest. Either way, it's important to make safe sex a priority. You don't know someone's history of sexually transmitted diseases just by looking at them. Be safe and take precautions. Talk with your healthcare provider about contraception, even if you are past menopause.


Male latex condoms are the safest method to reduce your risk of getting some STDs.Depending on your age or background, consider other types of contraceptives such as birth control pills or an IUD.
Talk openly with any future partner about safe sex and ask them to get tested before things get physical. Consider asking other single friends your age about what they do to remain safe and have fun.

, Allow yourself time to be independent when you date. When dating someone new, it's about have a strong connection first with the person you're dating before having them become ""part of the family."" Future partners may need time to get to know you well before they meet the other important people in your life.Don't hide the fact that you were been married before or if have children. Just make sure that your previous marriage and your children are not the focus of your time when dating someone new, particularly on the first few dates.

Avoid negative thinking.,
Enjoy having time to yourself.,
Focus on being the ""real"" you.",How to Get Used to a Dating Relationship when You Have Been Married3," Avoid self-doubt or self-hate. Be hopeful that there are opportunities for better and healthier relationships. By building up your self-confidence, you are more likely to find dates and keep them. Train yourself to stop negative thoughts in their tracks.When you see yourself heading towards negative thinking, stop yourself for a moment. Take a deep breath. Think about the good things that you have to offer.
Avoid making a date into a big, stressful ordeal. While dating again may be awkward, be positive that going on a few dates with someone is not a lifetime commitment or a horrible mistake.

, You are not defined by your relationship status. There can be benefits to being alone after a difficult breakup, as it may allow you time to heal. Be comfortable with being independent.Avoid seeking a mate if the only reason is to feel less lonely. Consider widening your social circle with other single friends in order to feel less isolated.
Consider a new way to define yourself as an individual rather than as part of a couple. If you were married for many years and had a very limited support system outside of your spouse, it may be time to redefine how to get your emotional needs met outside of one person.
Give yourself time to learn more about yourself — what you love, what matters to you most, who you enjoy being around, and what hope you have.

, Imagine yourself as without children, without worries, and without marriage. What does this look like? Dress and act in a way that represents your own personality, and your unique self. Avoid being held back by your ex, your children or your family, while still being mindful of your responsibilities.


Seek advice from friends and family, but don't let them hold you back from new experiences to be more independent.

Find closure with the past in order to feel right about the future. Consider changing your environment, outlook on life, or appearance. With closure, you will be more ready to see the real you.Try a new look which indicates you're ready to see yourself in a new way. Get some new clothes, or a different hair style. Try a new approach to interacting with others.

If the relationship had been going wrong for months, then consider if trying to get him back is worth the effort.;
, If it was an argument that led to the breakup, understanding why the fight happened will help you fix it. Was it your first fight, or was the fighting consistent?

Redirecting to a previous topic may be easier and more polite than starting a completely new conversation.You can say, ""That's interesting, but I'm more curious about what you were saying earlier about your project at work. Tell me more about that.""

, If your date doesn't get the hint, you may have to be more direct with them. You can be polite while still being clear that you're uncomfortable with whatever your date is saying or doing.


If your date is talking about something inappropriate and you want it to stop, you can say, ""I'm sorry, but talking about sex makes me feel uncomfortable on a first date. How about we talk about your job instead?""
If your date is doing something inappropriate, like drinking too much or being rude to the waiter, you can say, ""I am feeling uncomfortable with how you just talked to the waiter. That's not okay. Please stop.""

, Since you're on a date, naturally your date may try to talk about intimacy or may try to touch or hug you. Know what your limits are and stay in your comfort zone with intimacy. Physical touch may be inevitable on a first date and could bring you two closer together, but avoid anything you're uncomfortable with. Be direct when you need to if your date keeps trying to touch you.If your date is making you uncomfortable with touch, you might say, ""I appreciate you wanting to hold my hand, but I'm feeling a little nervous. I'd like to talk more and get to know you a little better first.""

, Remember that you two just met! It’s perfectly normal that you may be awkward around one another. In fact, acknowledging that it’s weird or that you’re nervous may help turn the bad date around.If you’re feeling like the date isn’t going like you hoped, chances are they are too, so speak up.


You can say, “I’m a little nervous right now, aren’t you? It’s so different talking to someone online and then meeting up in person.”

, Your date may try to impress you and sometimes this could lead to little white lies or bigger lies about who they are. Keep an eye out for any inconsistencies in what they say and call them out for it.You can be gentle and remind them that you just want to get to know who they really are.


You might say, ""Hey, it's okay if you don't really speak Spanish. You don't have to impress me. I appreciate honesty.""

, Changing the setting of your date or taking a break from the conversation may help to ease the tension of a difficult date. Some ways you can leave the date temporarily without leaving include:


Taking a short bathroom break.
Texting a friend to get advice/tips to help.
Suggesting doing something else fun or different from what was planned.

, You don’t have to stay out on a difficult date forever. Take notice of any warning signs or red flags that this person is not someone you should be spending time with. There is no rule that says you have to stay out on a date just to be nice, particularly if the person is being rude, offensive to your beliefs, or aggressive. Some red flags to take note of include:Your date starts using terms of endearment for you after you just met.
Your date says something sexually inappropriate or uses sexual innuendo.
Your date makes inappropriate comments about your figure, race/ethnicity, or religion.
Your date violates your physical boundaries or makes you uncomfortable.

, Pay attention to your instincts once any red flags come up and/or if you just aren’t enjoying the date anymore. You may want to continue to give someone the benefit of the doubt, but take a moment to really listen to your feelings and evaluate if you can put up with your date anymore tonight or ever. Only you know who and what is best for you., If you’re really not interested in the other person, you won’t be able to fake your way through the rest of the date. Your date will notice that you’re not really listening to him/her. They likely won’t want to continue a relationship with you if you’re not interested, so just be genuine and honest with them.


You can say, “I’m just not feeling a spark with you. You seem like a really nice person, and I’ve enjoyed chatting with you over dinner, but I’m going to go home now. I’m sorry it didn’t work out.”

, Sometimes it may be too confrontational, uncomfortable, or dangerous to be overly direct about ending the date. Instead, keep it focused on you or something you need to do. Some excuses that might be useful include:""I'm sorry, I didn't realize how late it was getting. I need go home now. I have an early morning at work.""
""I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling that well. I think something I ate disagreed with me. I need to go home before I get sick on you.""
""I'm sorry, I just got a call from my best friend. I forgot she and I had plans later tonight. I need to go.""

, When you leave your date, ensure you're own personal safety and that you don't get followed. You may want to let someone know the date has gone badly and make sure you have safe transportation home. For example, you can:Call or text a friend to let them know who you were with, when you're leaving, and when you expect to be home. Or ask them to come pick you up directly.
Let the manager of the bar or restaurant you're at know what's going on. Ask them to call you a cab or walk you to the car. Ask them to distract your date if you need to leave undetected.
Stay on the phone with someone as you leave until you're safely inside your home.

, Make sure that your expectations of the person you’re trying to date are realistic. Honestly assess if you’re trying to connect and enjoy your dates, or if you automatically write them off as “not good enough” because of a bad cologne, being too short, or not having an interesting job. Let go of your expectations and give people more of a chance. Remember that everyone has value, you just have to find it., Try to stay positive and remember that with time and practice, you’ll start to find and enjoy better dates. Don’t give up. Keep dating and think of difficult dates as opportunities to work on your conversational and flirting skills.Rejection is a normal part of dating. Be happy that you were able to reject someone earlier rather than later and save yourself from a difficult relationship., Dinner dates or movies can be time-consuming. It's awkward to try to get out of those dates as they happen. So, actively try to plan shorter dates. You could try:


Meeting for coffee.
Meeting on your lunch break.Meeting for frozen yogurt or dessert.
Meeting at a dog park with your dog.

, Remember why you’re going on dates in the first place to give yourself some motivation. It can be difficult to do if you’ve gone out on several difficult dates, but chances are you’re trying to date people because you want a healthy and fulfilling relationship with someone. Try to remember that and keep that in mind, even after you’ve gone on some difficult dates and aren’t having fun anymore. You can think about and write down:What you want from a relationship.
What you want from a partner.
Why dating and relationships are important to you.

, If you find that you’re constantly going on the same type of date and not having success, reevaluate and add variety. For example, maybe most of your difficult dates have occurred when you’ve scheduled dinner, a movie, and drinks. Instead, add some variety to your dating experience and try doing something you find more fun or enjoyable. That way, if you don’t end up liking your date you’ll at least have a pleasant time on the date.Schedule activities that are time-limited, too, which will help keep the date from lasting forever if it’s difficult. You could try:


Going to a BYOB painting class.
Taking a guided tour or hike.
Going to your local zoo or aquarium.

, Plan dates that are at safe locations where you feel comfortable. Never let a date pick you up from your home until you know them better. Get to know the owners or managers of where you typically go on dates. Have safe transportation lined up and always tell a friend who you're with and where you're going., Instead of forcing yourself to go on more dates that may end up being bad, take some time off from dating to spend time with people you enjoy. Schedule dates with friends and family you may not have spent time with in awhile. Being around people who support you will help you feel more comfortable and relaxed, even if your dating life isn’t going so well. It may even reenergize you to put yourself back out there to date again."

Put his mind at ease by flashing a big smile when you meet him. A genuine smile is perceived as a sign that we like someone and want to be friends with them. In a genuine smile, the corners of the mouth are pulled upward and the muscles around the eyes contract. Make sure your smile looks welcoming and real.
Don't give him a flirty smile or you'll risk offending your friend. In a flirty smile, the head is slightly tilted and the eyes are peeking upward at a person.;
, Everyone likes the sound of their own name. Try to say his name about three times during your conversation. Don’t be obvious about it, just look for places where you can say it naturally. If his name is John, you might say things like:“It’s so nice to finally meet you, John, I’ve heard so much about you.”
“John, I heard you took my friend camping last week, how was that?”
“I’m really glad that you make my friend so happy John.”

, Show him that you’re interested in getting to know him by making easy eye contact with him. Your eyes communicate even more to people about the way you feel than your words do. If you can't make eye contact with your friend's boyfriend, it will be almost impossible to build a real friendship with him.


Try to make eye contact fifty percent of the time while you're speaking to someone and seventy percent of the time while you're listening to them. If you lock eyes more than that, you'll appear creepy or aggressive.
You should maintain eye contact for at least four to five seconds at a time. If your eyes jump around too often in a conversation, you'll appear nervous which can make people uncomfortable.
Don't look down. Looking down communicates a lack of confidence. When you look away from the person you're talking to, look to the side instead., Show that you’re happy to meet him by giving your voice an energetic inflection. We like people who speak with enthusiasm. They come off as fun and exciting. If you speak in a boring, monotone voice, he won’t believe that you enjoy talking to him.


Speaking with enthusiasm can take some effort if you're not used to it. Practice speaking in an energetic voice in the mirror a few times before trying it out on people. After you get it down, you may find that simply acting excited can give you natural energy to help you actually feel that way.
Speaking enthusiastically can be contagious. You'll be surprised to see how often your electric energy is returned to you. You'll have fun talking to people and they'll have fun talking to you., Everyone loves to talk about themselves. It stimulates the same pleasure centre in the brain as eating food and winning money.Ask him questions that lead him to tell you what’s going on in his life. Ask questions like:


“What do you do for work?”
“What are some of your favorite hobbies?”
“What kind of music do you like?”

, Every time you see him, try to bring up topics you’ve discussed with him previously. He’ll be flattered that you care enough to remember what he’s been up to.Try saying things like:


“Last time we spoke, you were working on that project for work, how did it turn out?”
“Are you still enjoying volunteering at the animal shelter”?
“Your car looks really nice. I see you got those new rims you were talking about.”

, Relationships need intimacy to be able to grow. Give your friend and her boyfriend some time to enjoy each other’s company alone. Don’t try to jam yourself between them. They may start to resent you if you’re around all the time.Don’t make it awkward. If you sense that they’d like to spend some time alone, find a way to excuse yourself.
Don’t invite yourself to go out with them. If they want you to join in their plans, they’ll ask you to.

, Don’t talk bad to your friend about her boyfriend. Anything you say will likely to get back to him and he’ll feel betrayed by your comments.If you’re nice to him in person but you talk about him behind his back, he’ll think you’re two-faced and won’t want to be around you.


When your friend vents to you about her boyfriend, don’t take it as an opportunity to air your own grievances about him. For example, she might say something like ""He has no fashion sense."" Even if you agree, don't speak up. She might tell him what you said during an argument and he could take it personally.
Be a good friend. The only time it's okay talk negatively about your friend's boyfriend to her is if you see him acting abusive or disrespectful to her. Make sure to show compassion without being judgmental. Say something like ""I respect you and your relationship, but I really don't think the way he treats you is okay. I'm here for you if you ever need support.""
Don’t tell your friend anything you don’t want her boyfriend to know. She might be tempted to share your secrets with him.

, Don’t get too close to your friend’s boyfriend. While you want to be friendly with him, you don’t want to cross the line. Never contact or spend time with him without your friend’s knowledge.He’ll think you want more from him than just friendship or that you’re trying to test his loyalty. If he tells your friend, you could lose her completely.


The only time it’s acceptable to call him secretly is if you’re planning something like a surprise party for your friend.
Don’t comment excessively on his pictures or send him messages on social media.
Don’t ask him to go hang out without your friend.

, There are certain things about your friend’s relationship that are none of your concern. Resist the urge to learn all the juicy details. Don’t ask questions that could make them feel uncomfortable or cause a rift to form in their relationship. Try not to say things like:


“The two of you have been together awhile, when are you getting married?”
“Which one of you makes more money?”
“Do you both want kids in the future?”

, Don’t think of your friend’s boyfriend as someone who’s trying to steal her away. Rather, think of him as a new addition to your circle of friends. He’ll feel more comfortable around you if you welcome him into your group.Get excited to learn more about someone who is important to your friend.
Think about what qualities he has that are fun to be around.
You may feel sometimes feel like a ""third wheel"" when you're out with the two of them. Realize that he might feel like an outsider being around two best friends. Instead of worrying about being left out, try to find ways to make him feel included in your friendship.

, If you care about your friend, you should be glad that she has a guy in her life that makes her happy. Just because she has a boyfriend who she likes doesn’t mean that she likes you any less. If he's a good guy, he’ll respect you when he sees that you have your friend’s best interest at heart.


Stop thinking about yourself and think about what’s best for your friend.
Understand that romance is a part of growing up and your friend needs to experience relationships in order to grow as a person. However, she still needs her best friend.
See her relationship as a chance for you to strengthen your friendship. If you're supportive of her through her relationship, the bond between the two of you could grow more powerful.

, Ask him if he has any single friends.You just may hit if off with one of them. This may be an opportunity for you to find your own boyfriend. Your friend’s boyfriend will be excited to bring his buddy along to meet you.


If you like a particular one of his friends you can say something like ""Your friend is really cute. You should ask him to come along the next time we all hang out.""
You can go on fun double dates.
Don’t be pushy. Don’t ask him about his friends too often.

, Friends are important, but you should still have your own life away from them. Rather than worrying that your friend won’t be around as much, take some time to focus on doing some things that you enjoy. Your friend’s boyfriend will like that you have your own interests and that you aren’t completely dependent on other people.


Try out some new hobbies like painting, writing, playing sports or anything else you might find interesting.
You might even have time to make more friends and make your social circle larger.
If you're around someone too often, your personal identity can get tied up with them. It can be exciting to find out who you are and what you enjoy apart from your friend.

Go to the bar, bookstore, cafe, gym, movies, park, or some other place where you are likely to meet people. The busier the place is, the more likely it is that someone will see you and notice you.;
, One way to get a woman's attention is by having something that can act as an icebreaker or a conversation starter. The next time you head out to the park or go for a walk, consider taking your pet dog with you.


If you decide to bring your dog with you, make sure that your dog is friendly and socialized. The last thing you'd want is for a woman to notice you and your dog, approach you, and then be barked at.
Hobbies, such as drawing or playing the guitar, can help draw attention to you. If you choose to play an instrument, however, make sure that you are doing it in a place where you will not be disruptive to other people. A park or beach would be a great place to play music and get some female attention without disturbing other people. Don't put on a performance or show-off, just play casually.
It can also be as simple as an interesting hat (such as a fedora) or a funny T-shirt.

, Some women may not notice you until you walk up to them and engage them in conversation. Making the first move can be scary and intimidating, but not saying anything might prevent you from getting noticed in the first place. You do not need to have an entire speech planned out; a simple ""Hey"" or ""How's it going?"" could be enough to get a conversation going. Avoid doing this if the woman appears busy or uncomfortable, however. For example:


If a woman has her arms crossed, is not smiling, or is standing in the corner, she may not feel like interacting with anyone. Instead, try to make eye contact with her and smile. If she makes eye contact and smiles in return, then you may go talk to her. If she ignores you or glares at you, do not approach.
If a woman is talking on the phone or to some friends, wait until she is done before approaching her. Interrupting is rude and will get you the wrong type of attention.
If the woman is dressed up nicely and speaking with another man, she is most likely on a date. No not interrupt people if they are on a date.

, When you are talking to a woman, look at her face. Keeping eye contact will not only make you appear more confident and trustworthy, but it will also reassure the woman that you are interested in her. She may even notice and remember you as the nice guy who spent the entire evening focused on her (as opposed to that other guy who kept sneaking glances at other women).


You can also make eye contact with someone you wish to speak to. If a woman notices you making eye contact with her, she may take it as a sign that you wish to speak with her, and she might approach you. Be sure to give a smile as well.Do not stare at her chest. Women do not like having their chests gawked at.You may get attention, but it will not be the positive kind, and may result in a sharp remark or a slap.

, Having an idea of what you want to talk about ahead of time can help you approach a conversation with more confidence, which is something that women will notice and be impressed by.This can also help you when you don't know what to say. Avoid sensitive subjects such as religion and politics, but consider asking the woman about herself. Here are some examples of what you can say or talk about:


If you know that the woman is traveling or visiting, you can ask her where she is from. This can lead to more questions, such as how she likes it here and whether or not she has done anything interesting or exciting yet. If the woman likes you and has not yet done anything interesting, you can ask her out on a date.
Ask the woman about her interests, such as what sort of music she likes to listen to or what books she likes to read. She will notice this and remember you as the nice guy who liked to talk about her. You do not want to be remembered as the self-centered guy who bragged about himself all night.
If the conversation lulls and there is an awkward silence, try to keep the conversation going. Tell her something funny or amusing, or make a comment about something.Women will notice how you handle the awkward silence and remember you for it. Give her a positive memory!

, The last thing you want to do is to make someone feel uncomfortable. If you notice a woman fidgeting, looking at her watch or cellphone, looking away from you, or not engaging in the conversation, you may want to give her some space. She might be in a hurry to get somewhere, or she may not feel uncomfortable talking to you just yet. If this happens, do not press her or push her to keep talking to you. Simply smile and end the conversation politely. For example:


If you notice the woman looking uncomfortable or hurried, you could say something like: ""It was nice chatting with you. I'll let you get back to what you were doing.""
If the conversation has been friendly or going well, don't be afraid to ask the woman for her number, or offer her yours. She may just be in a hurry to get to an appointment and wish to speak with you later. You could say something like: ""It was nice getting to know you. I'd be up for chatting with you again some time soon. Why don't we keep in touch?""
Pressing a woman to talk when she does not wish to talk will make her feel uncomfortable and not want to talk to you any more. Worse still, other women might notice her distress and make them want to avoid you.

, Looking down at a cell phone screen will make you disappear into the background. It will also make you appear unsociable and unapproachable. If a woman does notice you, she may only do so for a moment before moving her attention to someone or something else.

, This doesn't mean that you have to wear a suit in order to get women to notice you; you can still capture a woman's attention with a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. The key is to wear clothing that is clean and not ripped, torn, dirty, or wrinkled.Dirty, ripped clothing may get you brief attention, but it will not be the positive kind, and the woman may not look your way again.

, Looking and smelling clean will not only increase the chances of a woman noticing you, but it will also increase the chances of a woman approaching you and wanting to interact with you.Grooming yourself means that you bathe every day, brush your teeth, and keep your hands and nails clean.


If you like to wear a beard, maintain it by keeping it free of crumbs and trimming it—even if you like to wear it long.
If you tend to get bad breath, pop a mint before starting up a conversation.

, If you can't get a woman to notice you through sight or sound, get her to notice you through smell. Avoid any cheap, drugstore brands, however, and avoid wearing too much. Cheap, drugstore cologne usually do not smell good, and too much cologne (even if it is the most expensive kind) can be a huge turn-off; it can also irritate the nose and repulse women rather than spark their interest. This is not the kind of attention you'd want!


If you can still smell your cologne some time after you have applied it, you probably put on too much. If you aren't sure if you put on too much, try going into a small room or sniffing your shirt. If you can still smell the cologne strongly, then you put on too much.
If you put on too much cologne, you may have to change your shirt. If you cannot change your shirt, consider wiping it off with a damp towel. Do this in a bathroom or a private room.
Consider changing your cologne up to match the season and occasion. For example, you could wear something with a citrus undertone during the warm, summer months, and save the deep, spicy scents for the winter., Humor can be a great icebreaker, and the easiest way to do that is by wearing a shirt, pin, or patch with a funny or amusing picture or slogan on it.Try to stay away from anything that might be insulting, as you risk driving women away from you instead.


Insulting things include anything that is aimed at a particular race, gender, political party, or ethnicity.

, A stiff posture will not only make you appear too proud or serious,but it may also cause you to disappear into the background. Try a more open posture instead. Not only will it help you stand out more and get noticed, but it will make you appear more open, friendly, and approachable. There are many ways to achieve this:Stand up straight, with your shoulders slightly thrown back, and your head up. This will make you appear more confident, aware, and awake.
If you are sitting, try leaning forward ever so slightly. This will make you appear more interested and engaged in the conversation.
Keep your arms at your sides and uncrossed. Crossed arms make you appear defensive and moody.
If you are sitting, keep your legs straight, and don't cross them. Crossed legs make you appear defensive and moody.

, Hiding in corners and slouching with your arms crossed over your chest or your hands stuffed into your pockets will not only make you less noticeable, but it will also make you appear unapproachable. Even if a woman does see you, she might think that you do not want to talk, and move her attention to someone or something else.

, Studies have shown that smiling not only makes a person appear more attractive, but more trustworthy and approachable as well.Smiling will make you less intimidating and might encourage the woman you are trying to impress to approach you. Do not overdo it, however; a fake, cheesy smile that you wear all night long might make you appear crazy or creepy. You want your smile to be genuine—the type that reaches your eyes and makes them crease.

, Many people do not use good quality pictures on their profiles, so a good quality picture will make you stand out on the search page.This is important, as some people search only by pictures and either turn the descriptions off, or don't read them.


Consider hiring a professional or a talented friend to photograph you.Don't edit the photo too much, however; you want the photo to flatter you, but you also want it to depict you honestly.

, This does not mean that you should flood the gallery with a dozen pictures of yourself; post at least two to three pictures up-to-date photos of yourself. Current photos are photos taken in the past year.


If you changed something major about your appearance, such as shaving off your beard or cutting off your long hair, take a new photo of yourself and use that one on your profile.

, Not only do smiles help you look attractive, but having a photo of yourself having fun will help you stand out from the rest. This includes photos of yourself at an amusement park, on a camping trip, performing music, scuba diving, or riding a horse. If you have some interesting hobbies, such as scuba diving, be sure to post a photo of yourself performing them!

, Posting yourself with other people will detract attention from you. If you post a picture of yourself with some friends, you might risk your friends getting the attention instead. If you post a picture of yourself with another girl, people may misinterpret and think that the girl is an ex-girlfriend—even if she is a family member or friend. The woman viewing your profile may not know that, and she might assume the worst.


Avoid posting multiple pictures of your car, truck, or motorcycle, no matter how cool you think it is. Women visit your profile to see you, not your car, truck or motorcycle.
Consider posting a picture of yourself and your pet.Some women might find the animal in your picture cute and remember you because of that. Be wary of including pictures of yourself with your pet, however; some women might not like the type of animal you keep for a pet.

, Short, brief, or empty profiles may prevent you from getting noticed. Don't leave a blank profile, and don't use cop-outs such as ""Message me to find out more... ;)"" or ""I don't know what to say.""Aim for something that is a few paragraphs long.


Don't write too much, however. Long profiles may lose you attention as well, as most women are skimming the search results and either don't have the time to, or don't want to, read something that is six paragraphs long. You want something that is a few paragraphs long., You want your profile to stand out and be memorable. Common phrases and clichés will make you appear just like everyone else. If a woman sees something in your profile that she has seen in at least ten others, she will skip your profile and continue searching. Common phrases include:Seeking my partner in crime
My friends say I am funny/have a nice smile/pretty eyes
I like walks in the park/long walks in the sunset on the beach
I don't play games or do drama
I like to go out and stay in
Work hard, play/party hard

, Instead of simply stating that you are funny in your profile, consider using humor in your description. If you like to have adventures, don't just write ""I am adventurous and love the outdoors,"" but add a short story of an outdoor adventure you had. This will help distinguish you from the hundreds other men appearing in search results who are also calling themselves ""funny"" and ""adventurous.""

, Humor can not only make you stand out on the search page, but also make you more memorable. Try to use a humorous tag line or username, or use humorous and witty language in your description. Do not overdo it, however; doing so might make you come off as cheesy, fake, or annoying. The best places to use humor are in the tagline, the first sentence of your profile, and the last sentence.


You can be humorous by referring to popular internet memes, television shows, songs, and movies. Be sure to use ones that are currently popular, however.

, Another way to stand out from other search results is by having a catchy headline. You can make your headline catchy through humor, including puns, rhyme, and alliteration. Doing so will make you appear creative and witty.


Don't use phrases that are suggestive or sexual in your headline."
"
Stop thinking about his past.,
Be aware that you are suffering from Retroactive Jealousy.,
Don't punish him for his past with bad behavior.,
Work on yourself.,
Work on your relationship.,
The past makes us who we are.",How to Get over His Past," Sounds a little too simple but in fact its not at all hard. If you find your mind drifting towards his past or his ex try to think of something else. You can either substitute your thought with an image, such as that of a loved one or you could simply think about a different topic such as your shopping list. Alternatively just focus on your breathing, feel your lungs take in air, feel it travel through your nasal passage. Become aware of your chest gently moving up and down and finally feel the hot hair rushing out.;
, This is when jealous thoughts and feelings are initiated by people or events from the past. Thinking about your boyfriend's past with his ex causes you to feel insecure, sad, resentful and even angry; all the landmarks of feeling jealous. The good news about retroactive jealously is that these past events and people are less likely to be a real threat to you or to your relationship. Usually, the ex in question is long gone and the events that they shared are only a distant memory to your partner.

, Constantly obsessing over his past is not going to make you feel good about yourself or your relationship. Feelings of anger, sadness and insecurity can be overwhelming and they can cause you to act irrationally. It's easy to take out your feelings on your partner as he is the one that is closest to you and also, he is indirectly the reason that you are suffering from the problem. By acting out in such a manner you are essentially punishing your partner for his past mistakes. Try to recognize when you are in this frame of mind and go for a walk, read or engage in an activity which gets you away from your partner. A bit of time to yourself where you are distracted will help you to calm down prevent you from saying things that you will later regret.

, When you make your life revolve around your partner you will start to loose your sense of self. Go back to a time without your partner and think of what type of person you were and what you enjoyed doing, then go out there and do these things! . Alternatively, find a new hobby, connect with old friends and family, re-read your favour book or just be on your own for a little while enjoying your company. Good self esteem is essential in order to stop the eroding effects of jealousy. Write down a list of things you are good at as well as your accomplishments in order to feel good about yourself. Remember, that you are a unique and wonderful individual with a great deal to offer and a story to tell. Having a positive self image will stop you from comparing yourself to his ex and wondering what she had that you don't. Truth is she too has a lot of wonderful qualities and this is why your partner was attracted to her in the first place, but that does not take anything away from you or your relationship as you have just as much if not more to offer. As the old adage says, you can't love someone else before you love yourself.

, You are jealous of the experiences your partner had with his ex, perhaps they went on holiday or shared a love for a special activity. The best remedy for this is to create some of your own wonderful experiences and memories. Start a joint hobby, have a date night or try something new with your partner. Enjoy each others company, laugh and also take pictures as tangible mementos that can be looked at in the future. In time, you will see that you are creating your very own story with your partner and the one he shares with his ex will be a distant memory.

, Unless you were literally born last night, you also have a past. Just take a moment to think about your experiences over the past decade and recall how many of those experiences made you the person you are today. We all have a past, we all have a story about how we got here to the present moment and try as we might we cannot change it. We all make decisions along the way, some good, others bad and the outcomes of those decisions is ultimately what shapes our very being. Your partners past is precious as it led him on a journey to you. He may have reached you without being scathed, or he might have had a few mishaps along the way but the result is the same: he found you. So instead of being angry and resentful for the path he took, be glad as without it he wouldn't be here.

Don’t ask overly personal questions.",How to Get to Know Someone on a First Date," Picking the right date spot is imperative to being able to get to know someone. If you choose to go to a noisy place or to the movies, you won’t be able to have a quality conversation. Consider going for coffee, out to dinner, or having a picnic. Avoid bars or places with large crowds.If you do choose to go to the movies, go for a walk afterwards or out for ice cream so you can chat.
See if they have any places they would like to go as well.;
, When selecting the day you’re going to go out with someone, avoid picking a day when you are very busy or when you have limited time. You will want to devote at least two hours to this date so that you can properly get to know the person. Pick a day of the week and time that works best for both you and your date.


Make sure that you get enough sleep beforehand so that you are well rested and prepared to be social. Your date will be able to tell if you are tired.
Be on time. Allot enough time to get ready and to travel to the place where you are meeting them. If necessary, set an alarm on your phone so that you know when you need to leave.

, People tend to respond well to confidence and will feel more comfortable talking to you if you don’t seem shy and nervous. Be willing to be open about yourself and your date will be more likely to share openly about who they are as well. While you should not pretend to be someone that you are not, you can still kill your nerves and feel self-assured. Do this by spending time getting ready to ensure that you look your best. Dress well for your date. Take a few deep breaths before you approach them to calm your nerves.Repeat positive self mantras to yourself on the day of your date to hype yourself up. Say things like “I am beautiful, I am confident, I am incredible.”
Listen to music that boosts your confidence as you are getting ready.
Watch some funny videos before your date to lighten your mood and make you laugh.
Try doing 30 minutes of moderate exercise before your date. This can help to control anxiety and boost your mood.

, As you are interacting with your date, be actively engaged in the conversation. Don’t be on your phone and perhaps even consider keeping it in your car if possible. Ask them questions, follow up on certain responses that they give, and reply to them with exuberance.For instance, if they mention having recently gone on vacation you could ask an open ended question like “Can you tell me about your vacation?”
Don’t try too hard to come across a certain way because this may make you seem fake. Just relax and be yourself.

, When you are talking to your date, be sure to actively listen to them. Avoid preparing a response in your head as they are speaking. Don’t monopolize the conversation; leave space for your date to speak just as much as you are. You can even try repeating back to them what they said to show that you are hearing them and to help you remember details about them.For instance, if they tell you that they visit their family often and spend a lot of time with them you might say “So, it sounds like family is very important to you.”

, When you are interacting with your date, avoid sharing very personal details about your life. Remember that trust is built over time and you should not disclose too much about yourself to someone who you don’t know well. Some things you might keep to yourself are your sexual past, deep secrets, family drama, or political views., If your date asks you a question, answer it honestly unless the question is too personal. Just as you are looking to get to know them, they are also interested in getting to know you. It is best to be honest with a potential partner so that you don’t have to pretend to be someone you are not.


If you feel that you cannot be honest with them, you can always say that you would prefer not to discuss that topic at this time.

, Don’t always lead the conversation. You can sometimes assess a person’s character by what they do when there is silence. Do they try to fill the space with small talk? If so, they might be nervous. Do they sit in silence and never try to reinitiate conversation? This could indicate that they are either very shy or uninterested.

, When your date is speaking, even if you have something to say related to the topic, don’t interrupt them. Wait until they are done speaking to raise your point, ask a question, or pivot the conversation. Interruption is considered rude by many and doing so can be off-putting, making it hard for you to make a connection with them.

, You can get to know others beyond the words that they say by assessing their actions. If you are out at dinner, notice how they interact with the servers. If they are rude to the waiters, then this person may not be a good fit for you. If they make jokes with the servers or are very respectful, then this might be a good potential match for you.

, Start the conversation by asking them how their day was. You might ask them to tell you both the best and worst parts of their day. This will help you determine how positive or negative they are as a person, particularly if they cannot give you a high or a low, or if they dwell on one for a particularly long time.This is a good way to warm them up and get them talking initially.

, Ask them about their favorite movie, book, TV show, music or food. You might find that you have some of these things in common and that you are very compatible. This well help you to better assess their interests.You can also ask them to tell you the last song they listened to or last movie they watched.
If you do find that you have something in common with your date, ask them to expand on their interest in the subject.

, Some people do not like discussing work on dates, but you should at least know what your date does for a living. Ask them about their job and if they like it. If they don’t, tell them you can table the discussion and then shift the conversation to lighter topics.


A person’s career can also give you some insights into their personality type. For instance, a person who works with kids and enjoys doing so might be caring and empathetic.

, Broach this topic with your date, particularly if either are deal breakers. Ask them if they smoke cigarettes or drink regularly. In addition to being a conversation starter, this can also give you some insights into their personality.


Determine if their use of any of these substances align with your own values and usage levels.

, Find out where they grew up. Ask if they have siblings and if their parents live nearby. See if they have any nieces or nephews. These discussions will tell you about how close they are to their family, which is key to assessing their values., You might also want to learn what grinds your dates gears. Ask them about what bothers them the most, either in dating relationships or in general. This will help you determine how easily annoyed they are and will also let you know what behaviors to avoid should you date this person., The best way to get to know someone on a first date is to ask them questions. However, exert caution in this area and do not ask questions that are very personal unless they broach the topic first. Avoid asking about their dating history, sexual past, or finances. Reflect on what questions that you personally would not want to be asked and avoid those topics."

What can also make the situation worse is if you see posts about them with a romantic interest. You can stop torturing yourself by not having to look at them on your social media accounts.


You can unfriend or stop following the person so you don’t have to see their pictures or posts. If you don’t want the person to know you aren’t seeing their posts anymore, you can simply unfollow them, which allows you to remain friends but doesn’t put their posts in your newsfeeds.;
, Having the person’s number in your phone is too tempting. You may feel the constant yearn to call or text, particularly if you’ve had a few drinks. To resist reaching out, remove them as a contact.


You may also want to block them from contacting you. It may seem harsh, but you likely won’t be able to get over the person if you continue to interact with them., If you’re friends with the person you can’t date, you may still have to interact with them because of your particular situation. Doing so, however, is likely extremely difficult and can make getting over them even harder.


Refrain from attending events with them, and decline any invites you receive from them. This may make the person confused, particularly if they aren’t aware of how you feel, but it’s what you need to do to move on.
If the person is aware of how you feel, you can tell them the reason why you can’t spend time with them. For instance, you could say, “You know I enjoy spending time with you, but it’s too hard for me to be around you right now. I hate to do this, but I’m not going to be able to hang out with you until I get my feelings under control.” It may be difficult for them to understand right now, but they may eventually get your reasons., If this person is a coworker or other acquaintance that you can't completely detach from, try your best to limit interaction as much as possible. If you and this person don't work closely together, it may be as simple as avoiding areas where they hang out.


If you do work closely with this person, you might consider asking your boss for a reassignment or seeing if you could switch to a new project with a different team.
All in all, just make sure you don't let your emotional connection to the person interfere with your professionalism. Stay cordial, but don't go out of your want to connect with them., If you had a relationship with the person, it may seem like a good idea to engage in physical contact with them, particularly if that was the basis of your relationship. Although this is tempting because you like the person, doing so will only make things harder for you.


You will likely become more attached to the person if you spend time with them in this way. Plus, sex adds a whole host of other potential problems into the picture. If you have decided not to be with them, don't be with them in any way., When you really like someone, you tend to focus on their positives. This is particularly the case when you can’t have them. But this isn’t reality: everyone has flaws and it would be good for you to think about them instead of what you like about the person.


Make a list of why the relationship wouldn’t work. Also, write down what you don’t particularly like about the person. Refer back to it when you’re feeling down about not being able to be with the person., If you can’t be together because the other person doesn’t want to, simply accept that there’s nothing you can do about it. No matter what you say or do, the person is still likely going to feel the same way. Stop getting your hopes up and torturing yourself by trying to convince them otherwise.


It may also help to be frank with yourself. You might say, ""Get a grip, Samantha. You can't date Peter because he's married. He's off-limits.""
Otherwise, if the person can’t see how valuable you are, then they don’t deserve you. Remember to tell yourself this at times when you are feeling low., It can hurt to have to walk away from someone you care about. Having self-love right now is key to moving on. This may help you understand that this person clearly isn’t worth the effort and heartache you are feeling right now if they can’t reciprocate how you feel. Avoid blaming yourself for this and remember it is all because of their issues.


Self-love and compassion may translate to taking it easy on yourself. Be okay with less-than-perfect work performance. Allow yourself a night off to binge-watch TV shows or movies. Call a friend to let them know you're feeling low.
It may be wise to seek the help of a therapist if you are struggling with self-esteem problems. The therapist may be able to encourage you to see just how valuable you are and this may help you to move on., Sitting around and thinking about this person constantly is not only unproductive, but could make you extremely depressed. Instead, use your energy to take up a new hobby. Keeping your body and mind occupied is key right now to stop yourself from dwelling on this sad aspect of your life.


If you can’t find a hobby you enjoy doing, go online to look for opportunities to have fun. For example, you could join a club, start exercising, travel, or do anything you’ve always wanted to do. There’s no better time than now to start focusing on you., It may be hard to imagine yourself with anyone but this person, but doing so is a good idea. Finding someone else to spend time with can help you realize that there is someone out there who understands what a catch you are. It can also make you stop thinking about this person who is unattainable.


You could join an online dating site, or ask your friends and family to connect you with someone. You may also be able to connect with someone at your church, school, or job. You may be surprised at how many people you’ve looked over because you are only focusing on the person you couldn’t have., Think about the traits of the next person you want to have a relationship with. Be honest and true to yourself about what you really want. Doing this may prevent you from getting into the same situation you are in now.


Don’t settle for anything less than what you really want. You may be tempted to get over this person, but falling for someone who isn’t what you want may not make you fully happy, and you deserve to be happy., Talking about how you feel is vital to your mental health. Bottling up your emotions and feelings may seem like a good idea at first, but you’ll never feel better holding onto your anger, hurt, bitterness, and even grief. Talk to a trusted friend or family member about how you feel, and you’ll heal much faster.


You may even want to join a support group or speak to a counselor about your situation. They may be able to offer you ideas on how to move on and can give your self-confidence a boost so that you can meet the person you were meant to. "

It's common to feel this way, but trust us, it probably is not true. So let your friends talk trash about her. Remind yourself of the annoying things she did. Do what you need to do to remind yourself that nobody's perfect, especially her.;
, Relationships end. It happens, and beating yourself up about it or trying to ""solve"" something about yourself will only make the heartache worse. Instead, try to accept that it was more about her than it was about you.

, This can be a tough one. But dwelling on the ""ifs"" and ""buts"" and ""whys"" is helpful to no one, especially yourself. Find ways to get her out of your mind.

, Re-engage interests or people you missed out on while dating or pursuing Ms. Queen Bee. Join a sports team. Call up an old friend. Read a good book. Enjoy your own life and you will worry less about hers. After all, the best revenge is living well.

, Hit the gym, go running, eat good foods. Keeping your body healthy is scientifically proven to help keep your mind happy, and that's really what this is all about.

, You never know why people do the things they do. Obsessing over the guy she found will only make your own pain worse.

Enroll in a class.",How to Get Back Into a Relationship After a Bad Break Up1," People who are in relationships for long periods of time mentally and physically affect one another. To move on, you have to recognize the impact that your partner had on your daily life and force yourself to maintain healthy habits, which do not include going on drinking benders and eating ice cream for every meal. When you see your ex, or even photos of him or her, your brain reacts like you are experiencing physical pain. That explains why your body feels so beat down after you end a romance.
Your brain can respond to a break up similarly to a person withdrawing from cocaine use—no lie. If you feel unfocused and generally out of control, that’s why.
Spending so much time and sharing a bed with another person impacts your heart, body temperature, as well as how you sleep and eat. Don’t belittle yourself for having an extreme reaction to your partner’s absence. Give your body time to adjust. ;
, Shedding some tears will be therapeutic because tears from crying contain high levels of stress hormones. Crying also spurs parts of your nervous system. Therefore, after a bout of sobbing, you will feel calmer and your body will actually be more in tune.There is no shame in crying. Doing it in front of supportive people can be even more beneficial., Remind yourself that he or she was not perfect, even if you were not the one who initiated the break-up. No one has to read your journal or poem, so use them to vent about your ex, and to soothe your brain, which is off kilter right after a relationship ends. , Maybe you dabble in art, writing, or playing music. Perhaps photography is something you used to love doing, or designing with Photoshop. Whatever it is, do as much of it as possible to occupy your time and mind. , Hopefully, you were in continual contact with your loved ones while in the relationship. If not, however, or if you just didn’t spend as much time with them as you wanted to, now you can. , Maybe there is something new you would like to try, like learning a new language or picking up some culinary skills.

Identify patterns.,
Curb unrealistic expectations.,
Stop dreaming about the perfect package.,
Don’t obsess over trivial things.,
Expect to disagree.,
Stop comparing yourself to other people.",How to Get Back Into a Relationship After a Bad Break Up2," Most of us are attracted to similar types of people and repeat the same type of behavior. Often, relationships end for the same reasons, too. Determine your roadblocks so that you can set a new path. Figure out who you're normally drawn to. You might like excitement, so you are drawn to those who might be fun, but who don’t care for you much. Instead of going to the concert and approaching the guy in the motorcycle jacket, approach the wallflower.
Acknowledge emotional issues. You may fear true intimacy, so you aren’t honest with others. This could be a continual reason why your relationships don’t last long (if that is the case). Tell your new girlfriend how you feel instead of avoiding her or making up lies.
Don't be too passive or aggressive. Most people like to be with someone who is assertive, not a pushover or bully. Figure out if you have a tendency to dominate or stay submissive.

, We all wish for someone who probably doesn’t exist and circumstances that we can’t possibly maintain long-term. Remember that life is a not a movie. If you do find someone with every quality that you are looking for, though, hold on to him or her! , Meeting someone who is unbelievably sexy, highly intelligent, extremely interesting, always upbeat, and constantly entertaining is unlikely. Be willing to take an item or two off of your checklist if you are serious about meeting someone. , Don’t turn down a date because a guy is wearing a Bears jersey instead of a Packers jersey in his profile picture on the dating site. Give that woman a chance even if she has short hair, not long hair. You might pass up a great opportunity if you focus on silly details like these. , If you get serious with someone, you will eventually argue. Doing so might bring back upsetting memories from past relationships, but you have to be honest, and sometimes that will lead to unpleasant discussions., It is easy to watch those around you and feel that you will never have that great relationship or family. That’s not true, though. Just accept who you are and what you have, and you’ll be better off. If you have friends that seem to be in perfect relationships or at least seem to have an easy time dating new people, you might compare yourself to them and think that there is something wrong with you. There isn’t. Focus on you, not them.
Your parents might have been each other’s soul mates, been together for fifty years, and been extremely good at communicating. However, constantly trying to be just like them is a waste of energy since every relationship is different.
Realize that social media doesn’t represent reality. If you log on to Facebook or Instagram and feel sad because you see pictures of always happy people having the most fabulous time, think again. Those are only snapshots, not the whole story.

Do what you say you are going to do.,
Expose yourself emotionally.,
Use social media with caution.",How to Get Back Into a Relationship After a Bad Break Up3," It can be difficult to be upbeat about starting a new relationship, especially if did not end the last one. Self-doubts will often creep in. However, you must fight them to start a productive new romance. Don’t see yourself as the victim. We all have those “oh, woe-is-me” type of days, but remember that everyone has been hurt.
Focus less on the past. You may have had many unpleasant experiences during a long-term partnership or even while dating short-term. Obsessing over them won’t make your new relationship blossom.
Conquer fear. You could be on your third awesome date and then start behaving erratically because you are afraid of actually opening up and having a positive experience. Don’t let fear ruin your chances. , Break free of your social circles if dating people from those circles has not worked out. It may feel strange if you are not used to it, but using online dating sites can be productive. Talk to other people who have done it if it seems scary. , In the beginning of a relationship, it is tempting to make yourself sound like the perfect human. However, we all know that no one is perfect. If you create a false persona early on, the relationship probably won’t last. Instead, be truthful about who you are and what you have been through. , If you start dating without identified goals, you might not come off as sincere, which will push a new person away. Spend time figuring things out, and remember that you control your destiny, not your family, friends, or society at large. , You won't keep a new boyfriend or girlfriend for long if you make promises that you will not or cannot keep. If your new partner, for example, enjoys compliments, don’t give any that you don’t mean. Above all else, do not say you love someone if you don’t feel it. , Maybe you hesitated to tell your ex what you really desired in bed. Maybe you weren’t capable of voicing your opinion about mundane things, like what to eat for dinner. Whatever the case may be, pushing yourself in this realm is the most frightening, but it will pay off. , While using online dating sites can result in finding a new lover, be careful about how you interact on sites like Facebook while you are getting to know each other and even after you have been together awhile. A number of negative outcomes can occur if you are not smart about social media use. Jealousy occurs. Your significant other might think that you are having more fun without him or her based on your posts and check-ins. He or she might also misinterpret your interactions, which can cause fights.
Your partner might feel let down. He or she might feel that you don’t value the relationship or your family ties if you constantly enter statuses and photos that are about non-family events. Keep that in mind before you post!
Facebook use is actually linked to divorce. If you supplement real life spousal interaction with Facebook use, you have an increased change of divorce! Unfollow your significant other on Facebook if it leads to problems.

Don't become his therapist or marriage counselor.,
Don't confront the wife.",How to Get a Man to Leave His Wife," A married man who cheats on his wife is doing it for physical reasons only. Realize that at that moment, he does not want to leave his wife. That is why he is having an affair. If he really wanted to leave her, he would have done so before having sex. If you already had sex with him, stop. Tell him you cannot be with a man who is dishonest.;
, Convincing or manipulative behaviour never works in the long run. He has to figure it out for himself. Even if he does act on your advice or pressure, he may resent you later.

, By not falling into bed with him, you are showing him that you are a woman who deserves respect and are marriage material. Have your own life and interests. Hopefully you have interests in common, which are things his wife doesn't enjoy. This makes you more attractive to him.

, Even if he is unhappy, he is still getting something positive from the marriage or from not breaking up. This could be access to his children, money (he is likely scared of a divorce and losing half his income and property), emotional support, reputation (makes him feel good to be a ""family man""), mutual friends, having someone to do stuff with (vacations, hobbies), her cooking and cleaning, etc. There is no point in competing with the wife in these areas. Don't make the mistake of wasting your time trying to be a better ""wife"". Giving to him will push him away. Just know that you cannot do anything about these facts and work on all the other steps, so that your relationship with him will outweigh the benefits.

, Men need to feel masculine. Most likely the wife has emasculated him over time, and therefore he is no longer attracted to her. There are a lot of articles and books on what this means. Do your homework to find out how to make him feel more masculine (and you to feel more feminine). Admiring his masculine strengths and having the polarity of your femininity is important. Wives who give too much, over function, make all the decisions, work too hard at the relationship, take care of everything in the marriage, and who don't know how to receive gratefully what the man has to offer, start to assume the role of the man in the family. This makes the husband feel bad about himself and he will start to look elsewhere to validate his masculinity. That doesn't mean you should have sex with him. Most likely he is still having sex with his wife (even though he will tell you he is not), but he can do it without feeling anything deeply for her. Having sex with him will not attract him to you. You need to give him all the other things he needs to feel masculine and whole.

, Becoming friends and having him confide in you takes patience. His roots with his wife go much deeper than with you, so you need to take a long time to build up a good relationship with him. He has to feel more than just physically attracted to you. There needs to be an emotional bond with you. He needs to feel safe to share his hopes, dreams, fears, emotions and insecurities with you, and know he is still loved. Also, once you do get to know him as a person, you may discover things about his character that you don't like and re-evaluate your decision as to whether or not you want him at all.

, Don't get hung up on him or too attached. Men like to compete. But be careful not to discuss too much about your dating others with him. He may ask, and you can reply vaguely, but it could do more damage if you appear to be trying to make him jealous.

, Don't initiate contact, calls, texts, emails, etc. Let him come to you on his own. He needs to do so on his own time and for his own reasons. If he is not into you, you cannot make him love you. If you start chasing and giving to him, he may selfishly take what you have to offer at first, but eventually he will feel emasculated and pull away (just like he is doing with his wife).

, It is good to feel compassion for her. It is not her fault. Don't be insecure.

, Trying to help him get over her, or solve his problems, will not attract him to you. Trying to ""fix"" things is a masculine trait. He has to do it himself in his own way.

, Telling her about you or her husband's infidelity will only make him angry with you and destroy any future you have together. He knows best how to deal with his wife and has to figure out his own way of leaving her. If the wife finds out, they might end up in marriage counseling and back together.

It is important to be friendly and bubbly when you approach him. The other option is to find an opportunity to be introduced to him. You could ask your friend to become friends with him, and then be introduced by them later.

, Be social and smile a lot. Keep the first few conversations short, but talk a lot during them, and throw in a compliment! This will make him notice you more.

, Introduce him to your own friends, or become friends with all of his friends, so you can hang out and do things together. Start to have more focused conversations with him.

Remember the phrase, ""You only want what you can't have""? A guy cannot want you if he feels he already has you. He needs to feel like he has to work for you.

, If you see him looking at you often, or if he talks to you a lot, then he might like you. If you see these signs, start flirting a little, always not seeming too needy! If he flirts back, then keep going. Always remember that you have to keep him guessing a little, do not let him be convinced that you like him. He should be in the mindset that you probably like him, but there is a chance you don't.

, Just ALWAYS remember not be too clingy, and remember that guys like CHALLENGES, not girls that are easy to get with.

While cycling can be intoxicating, it is harmful to the development of long-lasting, stable relationships. Be sure to give yourself some time--a few weeks to a few months--before reconnecting in order to avoid this negative pattern. , Even though you were the dumper during the breakup, you will still likely grieve the end of the relationship for several weeks. Be sure that you are not still in the stages of grief for a failed relationship--that might force you to reconnect with an ex too soon or for the wrong reasons. The stages of grief are denial, bargaining, depression, anger, and acceptance. Until you have reached the acceptance phase, any urge you have to rekindle a relationship with an ex should be viewed with suspicion.

, Be happy with yourself for a while before reaching out to your ex. Take up a hobby, reconnect with old friends, learn a new skill. Not only will focusing on yourself help you recover from the breakup, but you will be a more interesting and more appealing person when you do reconnect with your ex.

, Breakups can cause emotional pain that your body registers as physical pain. Be sure that you are treating yourself well physically as well as emotionally. Exercise regularly, eat well, sleep well, and avoid heavy drinking.

, Not all breakups are bad--if a relationship stifled your self-growth, perhaps it is better that you broke up. Consider writing down how you feel in order to process your emotions and get an objective sense of why you broke up with your ex. Make sure that you are not interested in your ex simply out of loneliness. If you do not like or respect your ex, and if you do not think the relationship is fixable, you should not get back together with him or her. , If the reason for the initial breakup still exists, you might try to resist the urge to back together with your ex. For example, if you broke up with your ex because the stresses of a long-distance relationship were too great, do not try to reconnect with your ex if you still live far apart. If, however, you think that the two of you have moved well past the reason for the breakup, reconnecting could be a great idea. For example, if you find yourself finally living in the same city as your ex, you might consider getting back in touch. , More than 1/3 of couples who live together and 1/4 of married couples have broken up at one point or another.And almost half of young adults reunite with an ex. You are not alone, and there can be very good reasons why you might reasonably reconnect with an ex.

, This can be a nerve-wracking and difficult step, but it is necessary if you want to rekindle a romance. Consider using a form of communication that will allow your ex some time to think before responding to you, such as an email, letter, or text message. This also has the benefit of allowing you to choose your words carefully and to edit your initial message.

, An initial contact is not the time to dump all of your feelings onto your ex. Instead, be honest but judicious in what you tell him or her. You should also make sure that your ex has the opportunity to respond, so that you can begin to see whether your ex might be open to re-establishing contact. Some possible scripts include:


""Hi! I have been thinking about you a lot, and so I wanted to get in touch. How have you been?""
""Dear , I know it has been a long time since we talked, but I realize that I miss you a lot. It would be great if we could catch up sometime. Let me know what you think about that!""
""I just heard a song on the radio that made me think of you. I know that I am probably not your favorite person right now, but I would love it if we could hang out soon. How does that sound?""

, If your ex does not respond to your message, consider that a signal that your ex would prefer that you kept your distance. If your ex requests explicitly that you do not contact him or her, you should honor that request. Let the ball stay in your ex's court, and hopefully your ex will be pleased that you got in touch.

, If your ex responds in a positive way to your message, suggest an activity that friends might do together, such as go out for a lunch or a coffee, take a walk in a local park, or attend a book-reading. Keep the conversation friendly and upbeat if you can, and avoid serious topics for now--you have serious issues to work out, but you can work on the serious issues a little later. Taking your time is essential.Show genuine interest in how your ex has been doing. Ask about their job, their family, their hobbies. Be happy for them if they have been accomplishing great things, even if it was without you.
Be aware that your ex might have moved on already. Perhaps your ex started dating somebody else or is even in a serious relationship. If your ex seems happy in a new relationship, consider scuttling your plans to rekindle a romantic relationship and instead focus on your friendship., It is likely that your ex will have some complicated feelings after being dumped by you. Perhaps your ex feels ambivalent or angry towards you, or perhaps feels lost and has low self-esteem. Your ex might be excited about your friendship one day, and hesitant the next. Always respect your ex's wishes, and be patient as the two of you get to know each other again.

, Move slowly, and be aware that you might have to leave your partner again. The most dangerous thing you can do is force the relationship to progress too quickly. If you move slowly, you and your ex will be able to evaluate your feelings at each step of the way, and you will avoid unnecessary disappointment. , Even though it is common to use sex to reconnect with an ex, having sex too soon can simply restart a problematic break-up/make-up relationship cycle. If you want to create a lasting relationship instead of a fling with your ex, you will have to let things progress at a slow pace.

, Perhaps your ex has started dating somebody else, or perhaps your ex won't want any contact with you. Try to be generous and understanding as you start feeling out where the two of you are comfortable., In order for your friendship to grow into something more, you will have to address the elephant in the room: why you broke up, and how you can move past it. Consider keeping a journal or talking with a close friend about your feelings before you bring them up with your ex. , You do not want your ex to feel blindsided or tricked. Instead, be honest and direct. Try to set something specific down in your schedules so that both of you will come prepared to talk about some hard topics. Some scripts include:


""I'm so glad that we are friends again, but I think it might be a good idea for us to revisit what exactly went wrong in our romantic relationship. Do you think we could talk about that sometime next week?""
""I've been thinking a lot about why it is we broke up in the first place. Is that something you've been thinking about too? Perhaps we should schedule a time to discuss it. How is this Thursday looking for you?""

, Find a neutral location without a lot of noise or distractions, so that the two of you can hash out what needs to be hashed out. Try not to get angry or overly upset, even if you begin talking about upsetting things. Also be sure that you are not accusing or blaming your ex for your relationship troubles. , Because your ex is the one who was dumped, your ex might have a lot to get off his or her chest. Listen carefully to what your ex has to say, even if it is painful for you. These include using ""I"" statements, trying to restate your ex's words in your own language, and avoiding accusatory statements or patronizing tones. Make sure that you listen to your ex in a cooperative way, not in an adversarial way. You want to prevent this conversation from becoming an argument. Remember that this conversation is a positive thing and an opportunity for growth. , In order for the two of you to get back together, you will need to apologize for the role you played in ending the relationship and for any hurts you caused. Be sincere, and be honest about how you can demonstrate that your ex can trust you again. Apologies take four steps State clearly that you are remorseful for what happened.
Take responsibility for your actions.
Find a way to make it up to your ex.
Promise that you will change, and then keep that promise.

, Explain that you are hoping that your breakup--as painful as it was--is the starting point of something new and deeper.State clearly and directly that you are hoping that the two of you might get back together. Some scripts include:


""I have loved getting to know you again through our friendship, and I'm glad that we talked about what went wrong when we were dating. I think that the two of us might be ready to get back together. What do you think?""
""I really value this friendship we've developed, and it makes me hopeful that the two of us might be able to be more than friends. Do you feel the same way?""
""I really care about you, and, if you were up for it, I would like us to begin dating again. I know that we have had our share of hardships, but I think that they have made us stronger.""

, While breakups are emotionally draining, they can sometimes help people learn about themselves and grow into better people. Show your ex that you are not the same person who dumped him or her, and explain how you have become a better, more mature partner.

, Because your ex might be skeptical, it is important to back up your words with positive actions. Be sure that you are constantly working to improve the mistakes of your past. For example, if your ex is concerned that you do not communicate well, study up on communication techniques. Or if your ex is worried about how emotionally available you are, make time to support your ex when he or she is going through a difficult time.


Your ex might be especially worried that you might dump him or her again. Be patient with your ex's (understandable) anxiety. While you cannot guarantee what the future holds, you can guarantee that you will work and try your hardest to deepen the relationship and support your partner.

, Even if you have done everything right, it is possible that your ex will not want to reunite with you romantically. Or perhaps your ex will need time to think before making any decisions. But no matter what, you should be proud of all the work that you put into improving yourself and your friendship with your ex. Your hard work will pay you dividends in the long run, even if you did not win your ex back successfully.

, For the long-term success of a rekindled relationship, it is important that you remember that you are trying to set a new path for your romance. Try to envision your reunion with your ex as a new relationship, not just a re-hashing of the old, unsuccessful relationship. Remember that you are getting back together with an old love, but you are doing so in a new, more mature way. Your goal is not to repeat the mistakes of the past, so do not dwell on the past: instead learn from it and move on.

, Rekindled relationships are more likely to succeed if there are clear expectations for how the relationship will grow and develop. Similarly, there need to be clear expectations about how both parties will remedy some of the mistakes that led to the initial break up. Set goals and check-ins to make sure the relationship is progressing as it should, and that you are not falling back into old patterns.

, While it might be tempting to put the relationship into overdrive and make a permanent commitment immediately, remember that the best way to avoid a toxic cycle is to be slow and mindful as your new relationship progresses.Do not do anything permanent such as proposing or moving in together until your rekindled relationship has stabilized and is on a positive path. Instead, try low-key ways to reconnect romantically, such as go on romantic dates, go away for a romantic weekend, or cook your ex a nice meal.

, Because the two of you were exes in the not-too-distant past, there might be old hurts to blame each other for or old wounds to re-open. Resist the temptation to fling any of these resentments at your (now former) ex, even during times of stress or turmoil. Arguments are healthy: constantly bringing up old, resolved issues are not.

, People who reunite after a breakup can sometimes feel less secure in their relationships, even if it is going well.Find external, tangible ways to show your former ex that you care and that you are not just going to dump him or her again. These rituals can include:


Going for a weekly date.
Giving a nice gift.
Verbally affirming your love and devotion.
Expressing your appreciation when your partner does something kind or helpful.
Participating in your partner's hobbies and causes.

, First be honest and trustworthy yourself.

Work on building your self-confidence.,
Start gradually.,
Smile.,
Find a way to start up a conversation with her.,
Connect with her online.,
Be her friend.,
Compliment her.,
Goof off.,
Make her miss you.,
Touch her gently.,
If none of this works, move on to the next girl.",How to Flirt With Girls," Girls don't want to be with a guy who can't talk to them. Think of the things you are confident about (playing a sport, an awesome anime collection, your obsession with skateboarding) and talk about that. Displaying confidence is one of the sexiest things a guy can do.


Make sure not to overdo it. You don't want to seem like a stuck-up know-it-all. If the teacher tells the class to be quiet shush people but not her and do it quietly or she might not like it!.;
, If you start flirting up a storm all of a sudden, the girl you are interested in might think you're a fake or have changed personalities for no good reason, which is weird.

, When you see her in the hallways, smile at her;just a quick smile then look away. Say hello and ask how she is. DON'T ignore her!!

, Ask her about herself. Girls love to talk about themselves ask if you have any thing in common. If she has facebook, chat with her. If she doesn't say something like ""there's no good chat on my computer"" there is a good chance she likes you.

, But, don't just add her as a friend on facebook or contact on IM. Message her first and do something like commenting on her profile. This could be a great way to start a conversation before an actual face-to-face one.

, For girls, friendship is important. If she needs help, see how you can help her. But, make sure not to overdo it and help her too much. Then, she won't appreciate you and might just use you. Try not to set yourself up for that. If you see her at the movies or mall, go talk to her.

, Girls love to be complimented.

, The truth is, if she likes you even in the slightest bit, your corniest jokes will seem funny, and your dumbest antics sweet.

, Don't hang around her all day or be too available. This gets annoying. Spend time with your own friends and make sure she knows that you have friends. Leave her guessing. It's a big turn-on. If you are playing a game, don't ask if she wants to join but when she looks a couple of times and then looks at the girl you're playing with go up to her and ask her to join. Don't just shout over a table or something.

, This is called breaking the touch barrier. If she jumps and shies away, don't try it again for a while. If she shows signs of encouragement in the future, give her a light nudge on the arm or shoulder.If you sit next or opposite you check if she flops her shoes ok,then take your shoes off and with the tips of your toes touch hers and if she looks at you and keeps her feet there then go further, maybe go more on the foot. If you sit next to her that might be harder so try with your arm put it on her seat behind her back, or when your giving things to her touch her hand.

, Keep your options open and keep things moving. There will definitely be girls out there waiting for a cool guy like you. Maybe she just can't go out on her own so make sure you know that first or just try again later or flirt with other girls for a reaction!

You'll be thinking about it day in and day out, so bite the bullet and get rid of it. Delete her number, your texts, her email, however it is you stayed in contact. When the temptation isn't there, you won't cave.


It's important to not want to cave either. Think of it this way: if you contact her, you'll be that guy on his knees, begging to be taken back. She'll tell her girl friends and they'll have a good laugh about it. Do you want to be that guy? No thank you! You have at least a shred of dignity after all.;
, Technology is just about the worst when it comes to break ups. Apart from your phone and email, stay away from her Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and whatever other way you might find yourself wiling away the hours late at night over Taco Bell and Red Bull. You'll only see what she wants you to see anyway (she won't tag those photos of her dressing up her dog) -- you won't see what's really going on. There's no use in becoming a behind-the-scenes stalker just to see her life through a cyber filter.


If you have to, get off of Facebook and the like entirely. You won't be missing much! In addition to not wasting hours of your life getting caught up on what your friends had for dinner, you'll be able to start living in the moment and getting things done.

, You probably met this girl at school, work, a common interest or through friends, right? As such, there may be times when you have to see her. Sucks, but that's the way it is. If this happens, be civil. If she talks to you, give her a curt reply like you would any acquaintance. Nothing more. She's just like everyone else.


Don't put yourself in her line of fire in hopes that she talks to you or starts remembering how great you are. Not coming off as needy or available is what you want to be going for here. And why would you come off those ways? You have your own life to lead -- you're not going to mix it up just for her.

, You had your Wednesday night hangout, you had the anniversary restaurant, you had Stir Fridays at Leo's house. All these things? They're gonna need to be put on the backburner for now. Wednesdays and Fridays are now for your billiards league and that restaurant was too expensive anyway. It's time to switch it up and fill your life with new people and new places.


When you're literally in a new place, your mind will be in a new place. So use this as an excuse to explore a new neighborhood, a different Starbucks, a different route to work, a new running trail, whatever. You'll be forced to take in all this new stimuli, forcing the old out.

, All of her belongings need to go, in addition to everything that is just a reminder of her. That means photos and keepsakes from your time together, too. Heck, burn 'em. Throw it all in the trash. If you have anything of value, you could give it back, but you definitely don't have to. What goes around comes around, you know!


If it's too much to take, have someone else take care of it for you. They can help you gather up everything and get rid of it or give it back to her. There's no shame in not doing it yourself. Just have your friend drop it off on her doorstep when she's not home; no harm, no foul.

, You may not be used to it, but talking about your feelings can (and is) incredibly cathartic. Not only will you feel better, but sometimes saying something out loud to someone puts it in a light you never saw before. It can make you realize you're being ridiculous or show you a side you didn't see before. Either of the situation or yourself -- either realization can be perspective-altering.


The other person can be a good sounding board, too. If hearing your own words doesn't show you anything, their perspective on your situation just might. And a sounding board can be a great stress reliever, too.

, If someone said to you, ""Don't think of a white elephant,"" what are you going to be thinking about? Exactly. A white elephant. To that end, telling yourself not to think about her is just going to get you to think about her more. So when she crops up, finish your thought, but don't dwell. Move onto something else.


Make yourself move onto something else. Believe it or not, you have control of your thoughts. So the next time you see a peach pit on the ground and you start thinking of that one picnic you had, finish it and move on. Start thinking about the idiot who threw their peach pit on the ground when there's a trash can 5 feet (1.5 m) away. Save the environment, people!

, Because if you don't, here's what will happen:
You meet a new woman who's nice, pretty, and likes you.






You start a relationship with said new woman.






You're angry and bitter from your last relationship.






She dumps you because you're angry and bitter.






The process repeats ad infinitum.






In case it wasn't clear, this is not a cycle you want to get stuck in. Try to focus on what you have going for you, what you're grateful for, and just how awesome you are. Because seriously -- you have so much other stuff going on. So many better things to think about than this.







, If life with her was absolutely hunky-dory, you'd still be together, point blank. Did she cheat on you? Did you fight all the time? Was the relationship just plain lacking the ""it"" factor? There are good reasons this happened. And they're good reasons because it leaves you with the ability to find a person this isn't a factor with.


Half the reason you're not together is because you deserve someone better. Did you forget that one? Someone that sticks by through thick and thin. Someone that you gel with. And they're out there. They are.

, Can't remember any? It's called ""euphoric recall"": when you can only remember the good.Take off your rose-tinted glasses and get to thinking. Did she have a big nose? Skinny legs? An annoying laugh? Never replaced the toilet paper? Terrible cook? You could probably rack 'em up if you thought long and hard enough.


When you start thinking about great she was, make the effort to conjure up a bad memory. They're in there somewhere. Do you really want to deal with that crap again if you don't have to?

, Time may not heal all wounds, but it certainly is pretty good at burying them and letting you forget about them. In most situations, it's the solution. So stop beating yourself up -- these things don't happen overnight. You need time to heal. It sucks, but it's how it works. You'll muddle through until you wake up one day and realize that you forgot about her a while ago.


The more time you spent with her, the more time you'll need. Simple logic. So if it's been a matter of weeks, the end is near. If it's been years, cut yourself some slack. Your heart and mind will heal themselves in time.

, Once all that bitterness and regret are gone, you can make room for learning from your mistakes. Why did you break up? Why was she not compatible with you? What will you not do next time?


This is as important a step as any. Without this one, this will just be a vicious cycle you put yourself through with every woman you encounter. It's necessary that you learn the traits you need in a woman and what makes you happiest -- and what makes you miserable.

, Right now, you need some serious distraction. Spending time home alone will just open the floodgates for thoughts that won't get you anywhere. So seek out your social network. Call up a few friends and make plans for this weekend. Go have lunch with your mom -- she probably misses you, anyway. Jam pack your schedule so much that you don't have time to think about her.


It may seem like the best way to spend your time is balled up under the covers, eating Ben and Jerry's and not getting out of your pajamas for days. While this is very tempting, you won't realize how good getting out will feel until you do it. So even if you don't feel like doing anything social, force yourself. You'll probably be glad you did.

, So it's not the best advice -- and if it's not your style, don't heed it -- but having a fling can be one of the best distractions you can give yourself. Just make sure the new girl knows it's a fling! No use breaking hearts left and right -- karma is rarely forgiving.


Be safe. You don't want to turn into an emotionless, hedonistic player. A rebound is good -- going to the bar every night and waking up next to strange women is not. So find a girl who wants just to have a bit of fun and take advantage of it. It'll show you just how many fish in the sea there are.

, When you were in a relationship, you probably let a whole bunch of other things suffer. Your time was taken up and you didn't have anything to do the things you once enjoyed. Bring those back! What have you let slide recently that you'd like to pick back up? You'll be so much happier doing what you love and getting good at it. You'll feel accomplished, renewed, and full of direction.


Don't know what your passion is? Find it! Use this free time to step outside your box and find out what gets you going. When's the last time you felt completely fascinated and in your element? Talk about distracting!

, You know what's gonna make you feel good? Knowing you're hotter now than you were when you were with her. So start exercising and pumping that iron. And that's not to mention the fact that it'll get your endorphins going!


When your blood starts pumped and your endorphins are flowing, you feel good. If gnawing your own arm off released endorphins, it'd feel good. So take a cue from your body and exercise. You'll be healthier, happier, and you'll look great, too.

, It's easy to forget how wonderful being single can be. You get to do whatever the heck you want, whenever the heck you want, however the heck you want, with whomever the heck you want. You can get up at a moment's notice and change plans and be adventurous. Awesome!


Go out on weekends and stay out till 3 AM with your friends. Take a spur of the moment road trip cross country. Spend all your money on yourself. Gorge on french fries without shame. Apply for a job internationally. Take chances, risks, and do something just for you.

Give your new partner a fighting chance by waiting until you are completely over your last partner—and any heartache you may have endured—before getting into something new.


To avoid taking out your past experiences on this new partner, you’ll need to give yourself time before you jump into another relationship. You may even need professional help before you can consider yourself completely over your ex.;
, Ask friends, co-workers, and other people who are in your social circle for help finding a date. They know you and may have an idea as to what type of person would make you happiest.Additionally, avoid picking the same “type” person every time. By going out with someone you normally would not, you may find something you didn’t know you liked.

, The best way to meet people is get out there and mingle. Think about the kinds of things you once did before you were in a committed relationship. Can you use any of your former hobbies as a platform to becoming more social? For example, do you belong to a gym? Take painting classes? Or participate in a book club? Reconnect with your old self. Go after goals you put aside, such as learning a new language. Start back up on hobbies you once enjoyed. You’re more likely to meet someone with whom you share things in common when you’re doing things you love.

, Give online dating a try. Millions of people choose this route as an introduction to someone new and interesting.Meeting someone new in this manner is perfect for people who don’t know where to meet someone, or would rather not frequent the typical places people go to find dates, such as bars and clubs.


Also, online sites often do most of the legwork for you, and conduct screening processes before you even talk. This can reduce the pressure for people who are shy or hesitant to get back into the dating pool.

, Creating an online dating profile can feel overwhelming to some. How much do you reveal about yourself? The simple answer is to give the basics without going into too much detail. Choose a clear and attractive photo and explain a few things about yourself that you think are important in finding a match.For example, if you are divorced, it may be nice to add this to your profile, but you need not go into what caused the divorce or how much you hate people like your spouse. You could run off potential dates with this sort of energy. Keep it positive.
Refrain from listing traits you prefer in a mate, unless they are make or breaks. For instance, if you love travel, you can say ""searching for someone who enjoys adventure/travel,"" but it could be limiting to use that as a criteria for potential matches.
Also, avoid giving out any personal information, such as your last name, home address, place of employment, or personal contact info. If you connect with someone, there will always be an opportunity to do this at a later time.

, If you make the decision to transform an online connection to an offline one, that's a good sign that the two of you are getting on well. However, keeping yourself safe in this situation is paramount. Due to scams and fake profiles, you want to use caution when meeting up with online dates.


Only meet in public places when you go on your first few dates. Let a friend or family member know exactly where you are going and stay in communication with them often. Also, avoid giving out too much personal information about yourself, such as where you live or work., Online dating can be overwhelming, especially if you have lots of people who you are interested in dating. Some things you can do to reduce a feeling of being overwhelmed include:Messaging just a few people to start. You might find dozens of people who seem interesting to you, but contacting them all may overwhelm you. Just pick a few people to start and send them messages.
Taking notes on people you talk to. If you are speaking with multiple people at once, then you might have trouble keeping their details straight. To make this easier, try taking notes on the people you are speaking with.
Not waiting too long to meet in person. If you feel ready to meet someone in person, then do arrange a date. Try not to wait more than three weeks to meet someone you have been talking with regularly.

, Building confidence is something that takes time and persistence. It won’t happen overnight. However, there are lots of little things you can do to become more confident in yourself.Try using daily affirmations. For example, you can look at yourself in the mirror each day and give yourself a compliment like, “I am a smart, capable woman.”
Reflect on your achievements. You can improve your self-confidence by reflecting on what you have already achieved in your lifetime.

Set realistic goals for yourself. Feeling confident in your abilities may also be easier if you set goals for yourself that you can actually achieve.

Challenge critical thoughts. If you tend to put yourself down, then this can also interfere with your ability to build self-confidence. Work on identifying critical thoughts as they happen and challenging those thoughts to find more realistic ways of thinking.

, Visit a hair salon to update your look. If you’ve had the same hairstyle for the last few years, a new ‘do may help you get the confidence you need to help you realize that you are a catch and anyone would be lucky to have you. This may help you to find someone who really deserves you, instead of entering a relationship with the first person you meet. , Step out of your comfort zone and buy the clothes you may have wanted to before, but never did. It’s easy to get into a style rut when you’ve been with someone for a long time. But by trying new clothes, you may build your confidence and put yourself out there in ways you never did before. , Exercise to get in shape and boost your confidence about your body image. Having confidence in yourself helps you project the best you possible. Staying active can also help your mood and increase your well-being.Try to work 30 minutes of physical activity into your day on most days of the week.
Some exercises you might try include walking, biking, swimming, or dancing. Choose something that you enjoy to make it easier to stick with it.

, Take some of the pressure off of yourself by realizing that dating is an adventure, which is full of ups and downs. If this date doesn’t turn out to be what you expected, there’s always another in the future.


Thinking of the dating world like this may prevent you from becoming disappointed if every date isn’t how you envisioned it., Take the initiative. If there's someone you feel a connection to, don't hesitate to ask them out. If the other person is single like you, then they would probably love to go out for coffee or ice cream with another like-minded individual. Do this successfully by portraying confidence, being specific, and being flexible.


Portray confidence by approaching the person with an attitude that demonstrates that you expect the person to say ""yes."" Using certain language like ""I know you probably don't want to, but..."" only sets you up to get turned down. Instead, say ""Hey, I think we have a lot in common. In fact, there's an art show this weekend and I'd love to go with you.""
Be specific. Just as you don't want to seem like you are expecting them to turn you down, you also don't want to be tentative or vague. Say ""Would like to go for coffee on Saturday?"" This gives a specific activity and date so that the other person has a clear understanding.
Be flexible about the timing. There's a possibility the specific date you choose may not work for the other person. But, that doesn't mean it's an automatic fail. Ask, ""Will you be free next Saturday?"" to seal the deal.

, Plan to meet at a restaurant, museum, or a place where others will likely be in attendance, especially if you have only met online.Avoid meeting at your homes, in order to stay safe in case the person ends up being dangerous, or you would rather they not know where you live. Also let a friend know where and when you are meeting, as a precaution.

, It’s okay to play the field, or date more than one person, as long as your dates don't think you're exclusive. Keep first encounters short and sweet. Avoid getting into conversations that are too deep and serious for a first date. Talk about light subjects, such as what your interests are, rather than delving into each other's backgrounds or family histories.Keep first dates brief by carefully selecting the timing and context of your encounters. For instance, maybe start with a coffee date as a first encounter. That way, you have the option to cut the date short if you want to, or move into lunch or dinner if things are going well.

, Know that your first date is about fun and getting to know each other, not planning where your children will attend school or the joys of joint checking accounts. Avoid putting too much pressure on this meeting, and you’re more likely to have fun and want to see each other again.If you meet with someone who you enjoy and have many things in common, then you can consider becoming exclusive with this person. Otherwise, just make it carefree and fun.

, Trust your gut instincts about relationship red flags. Getting defensive, jealous, or controlling are all signs that you are in a relationship with the wrong person. If you have any doubts, trust your feelings and get out. Additionally, protect yourself if you become intimate with someone."

Just be yourself.,
Practice it with other people to see what they like and to build confidence to meet a girl you think you might like.

Figure out which one of these is you.,
Then, you can ask her on a date or become your girlfriend.",How to Find Your Own Style Meeting Girls," Make eye contact, and accidentally do something to get her attention. But don't be inappropriate. Next, start a small conversation and judge her by her interests and abilities.

Bad Boy: The rebel. They speak out a lot and keep you on your toes, and always wanting more. Bad boys tend to be a little shy or sensitive on the inside, but they're fun to be around.

Ask for her opinion.,
Give her a small token of your appreciation.,
Show that you've been listening to her.,
Take interest in her accomplishments.,
Let her pick the movie/restaurant/music.,
Offer a helping hand.,
Show her you respect her.",How to Flatter Girls," The biggest type of flattery people use on girls is complimenting their appearance. Remember though, some girls like to be appreciated for their intelligence, physical skills or abilities. There is a way to do this without being creepy or focusing too much on the physical side of a woman.Use a specific compliment like ""I really like the way your sweater brings out the colour in your eyes."" A specific compliment is tailored to the girl and is more than just ""you're cute,"" or ""you're attractive.""
Another good way is to notice the way she puts together her outfits. If she's wearing a pair of awesome earrings say something like ""Those earrings look really good on you. You have great taste.""
Do not, do not, do not, make a sexual comment (""nice rack,"" or ""I'd hit that"") unless you know the girl really well and she has accepted that sort of comment. Most girls find that sort of comment creepy.;
, These are boring compliments and way overused and inappropriate on girls under 16. Try for something a little more unusual and interesting. Even ""beautiful"" can be overused. A different way of saying that she's attractive will intrigue her, because she's unlikely to have heard it before.A few good words to try: ""radiant,"" ""breathtaking,"" ""elegant,"" ""riveting,"" or ""dazzling"" to name a few.
You could even use something like ""incredibly"" which could mean both her appearance and her personality and accomplishments.

, Too often people stick to only complimenting or flattering a woman's looks. You'll need to widen your flattery to include her personality as well. Make sure that you are being as specific and sincere as possible when talking about her personality, otherwise she won't take you seriously.


Tell her something like ""I love the way you brighten up any party and manage to make everything more fun just by being there.""
Or note how kind and generous she is. If she helps out her friends and family all the time, you could say something like ""It's amazing how much you do for other people. Just make sure to take some time to care for yourself!"" You'll both show that you notice what she does and who she is, but you'll also show that you care about her.

, Girls, just like other members of the human race, don't want to be noticed for their appearance alone. Find out things that she's done that she's proud of and compliment her on them.


If she plays an instrument or sings, ask her to perform for you. Praise her ability when she's finished. Make sure it's specific. You could say something like ""I love the way you're so amazing at holding those high notes.""
If she's just beat a difficult video game, tell her how impressive that is. (Do NOT say ""You're really good for a girl;"" that is not a compliment.)
If she's just done something like completed her dissertation, or gotten her PHD, compliment her on her chosen field and how much work she has put into achieving her goals.

, Flattery is about letting someone know how important and wonderful they are, so tell a girl what she means to you and why she is so important to you.


For example, you could say something like ""I find it really easy and fun to talk to you.""
Another example: ""Nobody else can make me laugh the way you do."" You're drawing attention to something specific and wonderful that she does and framing it in a way that makes your unique and important to you.

, Letting her know that you think her ideas are important is a great form of flattery. It will make her feel smart and like you are listening when she talks and take an interest in her thoughts.If she does a lot of artistic type work (of any kind, writing, visual arts, photography, music, etc) tell her that you think she's incredibly creative. Even better, give a specific example of her creativity. Say something like ""I love the way you used the green in that painting; it really stood out beautifully.""

, This will flatter her because it will show that you have respect for her and what she thinks and that you're paying attention to her ideas.


If you know she's interested in politics, engage her on the subject. Tell her that she really makes you think.
Especially ask for her opinion on something that you know she's an expert on. If the woman you're complimenting is a marine biologist, for example ask her opinion on something to do with the ocean.

, This doesn't have to be a super expensive diamond necklace or anything, but something small that lets her know that you've been thinking of her and that she's important to you.


If she likes flowers, get her a lovely bouquet of her favorites. By getting her favorites you show that you've been paying attention to her likes and dislikes (flattery in and of itself) rather than just reverting to the old red rose stereotype (although some women do like roses, of course).
If she's a gardener you could get her some seed packets she's been wanting for a while, or a new pair of gloves.
If she loves to write, or writes in a journal or diary, get her a lovely notebook or special pen. Again, the token should be something that's specific to her as a person and to what she likes.

, Showing that you listen to what she says and the things that she does is a huge compliment and one which a lot of people forget to do. Obviously, this means that you should be listening when she talks and paying attention to what she's up to.If she's been having trouble with a roommate or a family member, make sure to ask her how it is going with them. It'll show that you care and that you're paying attention.
If she's been talking about getting a new haircut, or piercing, or tattoo, compliment her when she actually gets it done. Say something like ""Your new haircut really frames your face in a great way"" or ""That tattoo is so creative and gorgeous. Did you design it yourself?""

, Even if it is something small ask her to show you something that she is proud of having accomplished. It could be anything from baking a cake, to refitting her car engine, to fixing a leaky faucet.


Ask her to help you with a project that appeals to her strengths. For instance, if she's really good at interior design, ask her for some ideas on how to make your living space better or more comfortable.
If she's good with web design, ask her help designing the webpage for your new novel, your new company, or simply a blog.

, By encouraging her to choose something for both of you, you are showing that you think she has good taste and that you trust her to exercise that taste. There is little that's more flattering than someone thinking you have good taste.Say something like ""You always pick the best food, why don't you choose where we'll eat.""
Ask her to help you pick out some clothes (if that's something she likes to do). Tell her that you're no good at it and that she has such a great eye you'd love it if she'd go shopping with you. You'll get to spend more time with her and you'll get to show her how important her skills and her opinions are to you.

, If she's having a stressful time, or she's trying to run an event, take care of her aging parents, and so on, offer to help her out. It will show that you've noticed what she's going through and that you like her enough to help.


If she's going through a busy period with work, school, or some outside interest, offer to bring her dinner and to clean up afterwards (bonus points if you make it yourself).
If she's running some sort of event, volunteer some of your time to helping her make it a success. She won't forget that you were there for her and she'll be flattered that you took an interest in what she's working on.
Don't only offer to do things that are self-serving to you. If she's really stressed and you offer her a massage and she says no, find a different way to show your appreciation for her like asking what she needs.

, This is a huge part of flattery and of making sure that flattery doesn't get really creepy. Make sure that you respect her boundaries and her as a person. If you aren't respectful, you're flattery will come off as creepy.


For example: If you say something nice about her appearance and she doesn't respond well, let it go. Don't badmouth her simply because she didn't respond to your flattery.
Remember: just because you've said something nice, or done something nice does not mean that she owes you anything.

If you feel uncomfortable doing that (know that if you do this too sexily, other guys will come towards you), do a flirty-sexy-bored look at him, making direct eye contact with only him. If you don't want to ask him, out of nerves or fear of rejection, don't worry. If he doesn't come, try it on another cute guy.;
, If he hasn't come first, maybe you should go. If he's moving around a lot, maybe he's trying to get your attention or trying to get another girls' attention (or trying to find someone, or see something). Go up to him and say, ""Hey, what's up?"" and make a little conversation. Don't ever first come out with, ""Will you dance with me?"" He'll have too much pressure and most likely say no. Only after your small talk, ask him, and he's most likely to say yes because he would know that it's okay.

, Sometimes flirting works. Flirting is a little confusing, as if you're supposed to use pick-up lines or talk in a sexy voice, but it's actually really a cute position, a sexy voice, and nice eye contact. If he's talking about something boring, nod your head so he feels he's not boring you. If he's talking out of breath, he probably likes you. If he's talking like he wants to speed things up, you start talking, and it always gets you the boy. If he seems unhappy with the conversation, that means he is in a rush to dance or wants to do something else. Ask him to dance! Say, ""Hey...I was wondering...do you want to dance? If not, it's okay.""

, This is the sulky part of dances. If he says no (most likely not) he was a jerk, for one, and he is someone you never should have crushed on. But most likely, he was hoping someone else was going to ask him. If you're okay, ask him who he wants to dance with and say you'll convince her to dance with you so you two can be friends. If he says: ""No one,"" don't ever ask him why he never wanted to dance with you. Just say: ""Oh, okay, because , I think he wants to dance with you."" Be nice!

, You've been accepted to dance. When dancing with him, there are many ways to dance such as: grinding, slow dancing, freestyle, etc. First, see how he goes off. If he's waiting for you, start with grinding- kind of being weird and funky and interesting.


Grinding is basically moving your hips in a sexy way, but he's uncomfortable at times Move him around tightly. Boys will grab your hips sometimes, and there will be a crowd of people around you. The guy you asked to dance will most likely want to dance in a crowd, not just the two of you. Sometimes you'll dance and he'll be behind you, so don't worry about trying to make a good impression. He's trying harder!

, If he tries kissing you, think as he leans in. If you want him to be your first (or another) kiss, then go ahead. If you don't know if he'll be your boyfriend, and he's known to be a player (or you don't want to kiss him), then be careful and say: ""Gotta go... bye!"" and leave, but not in a hurry. Maybe hug him quickly as a ""thanks for the dance"" gift.

, After he says no, if you feel really terrible, and maybe you're partners with him in a class (or have a class with him, or you might be locker buddies), then try doing a mind-reach. It's where you think of something else, erasing your memories of what just happened. Try asking another person, and try someone ""easy"", someone you know will say yes. If they say no, then don't think you're ugly or stupid. They are ugly and stupid! Just go to your friends and dance with them, and maybe sit at a table or talk, lying on the wall, and tell them what happened and ask them what to do. If they say: ""Let's dance it off, okay?"" do that! It's a great way to clear your mind and focus on the music!

, You'll most likely have thoughts rushing through your mind like: ""Oh my gosh, what just happened? Did I just dance with a boy? Is he my boyfriend? IDK what to do!"", either after the song ends and switches to Taylor Swift or a slow song, or after the dance because you might be all excited. Eek! Just calm down, and don't go and tell all your friends because he might not be your boyfriend and everyone might think that, and he might not want to be if he thinks you made up the rumor saying he was your boyfriend.

, If your stomach is rushing with butterflies because you think he might say yes, calm down (because if he says no your stomach will hurt and you'll want to go home) and relax, because it also causes you to freak out and think twice. Who knows, maybe he was going to ask you.

, If you guys were grinding, and all the sudden the music switches to slow songs, turn around and look at him (because most likely he was grinding the back) and ask: ""Should we...? If not, that's fine."" If he says: ""Oh, no,"" or ""NO!"", then just say: ""Okay,"" and move to the seating (there is probably seating). If not, move to the walls. If he says: ""Sure,"" or ""Okay,"" then wait until he either puts his hands around your neck or your hips. If he doesn't, then start with the ""white girl tap,"" where you move your foot slowly and smile, and act good.

, If he fast songs you, like jumping up and down and smiling, then do it with him, unless you're in fear of ""bouncing"". If you are, then just move your hips and slowly grind (you might get him and the crowd to, also), so relax with it.

, If he isn't dancing with you, and is turned around, dancing with his friends or another girl, slowly dance/move away. If he asks why you stopped and left him at the dance floor, say: ""I felt sick,"" ""My stomach hurt,"" or ""I had to go to the bathroom."". Try not to hurt him, and don't say: ""Because you weren't dancing with me! Because he won't like you and you won't have a chance with each other. Just smile and say: ""Want to dance now?"" and if he says no, say: ""Okay,"" and ask another boy or your friends to dance.

, If he's a bad dancer, just have a fun time with it. Kind of laugh with it, and if your friends say: ""Oh my gosh, you guys were adorable being terrible dancers!"", say: ""I know . . . isn't my boyfriend cute?"" or ""I know . . . but he's unique. That's why I like him!"" If it's a slow song and he's stepping on your feet all the time, and it hurts, ask him to ""follow you"". If he doesn't, separate and start the ""white girl tap"", tapping your feet left and right and smiling. It'll make you guys look cute together!

, If he's being rude, commenting on your dancing (even if you are bad), sometimes it's best if you say: ""Well, if I'm so terrible, you can find another girl to dance with, and comment on her."" and if you're in high school (and old enough to curse), say: ""Well, maybe you should stop commenting on girls' dancing and have fun."" And if he ""tattles"" on you, don't worry. Reject everything or accept it, and the teachers will let you back in.

, If he asks you to be his girlfriend at the dance, at the middle of the dance, the end or the beginning, smile and either say yes or no. If you say yes, then he'll be happy. If you wanted to dance, say yes! It's what you've wanted, right? If you say no, and ask to be just friends, he's gonna be depressed the whole dance. So say yes and break up with him by saying: ""I was thinking about it, and I don't want to,"" after the dance or at school the next day. Maybe you should give it a chance to see if he's a good guy.

, If you guys danced, there's gonna be some rumors. Be the rumor patrol! If he's making them up, ask him to clear them nicely, and if he says no, then just tell everyone the truth (especially ""Gossip Girl"") and if someone randomly made them up, smile and deal with them. At the end, say ""whatever"" to them if someone bothers you.

, If you see your crush/cutie/eye-candy dancing with someone else, relax. Find someone else to dance with, and don't let it ruin your day. He's probably having a good time, and that's his wishes. Don't turn it into ""everything sucks"" and ruin your friends' time complaining about it.

, There will probably be a big group of random 6th, 7th, or 8th graders, or in high school, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders, and if you get rejected or can't find someone you want to dance with, move to the grinders. If a cute boy you see happens to move to that group, too, maybe you should ask him.

, Don't forget to have fun because you can ask him to meet you somewhere and dance then!

Look back and think about what you did wrong in your past relationships.,
Do not look for a boyfriend.,
Release yourself from the social pressures around you.,
Make friends first.,
Be patient.,
Stay true to yourself.",How to Find the Right Guy the Second Time Around," This is a very important step. Take some time off, look onto your past relationships, no matter how hurtful they were, and realize what went wrong, what happened that made it bad, and what you can do to prevent the same from happening again. If you can succeed at doing this, then by all means you probably won't need to keep reading =). But in case you are still a little unsure of yourself, read on and consider my advice.;
, What? Then what's the purpose of this article? The point I want to make here is that if you are looking for someone for the sake of having a boyfriend, then you're doing it all wrong. There are millions of ""boyfriends"" out there in the world, but there's only one Adam Smith, one person that captures your heart. A boyfriend is an object, but an individual is a person. You fall in love with people, not objects. Get it? Don't ever date someone just so you can have a boyfriend.

, If you feel the pressure from your friends, peers, or yourself that you need to find a ""hot,"" rich, or popular guy in order to be cool, this applies to you. If you give in to these pressures, or give them too much value, then you've already failed at achieving what you want. These are probably the very pressures that are giving you a hard time in the first place, and you need to learn to let them go. Sure, being ""cool"" is great, but if being in the ""in"" group (especially if you're in high school) is just not who you are or what you're comfortable with, then you need to stop trying, because being who you are is important.

, Make lots of friends, not only male but female as well. The more friends you have, the more opportunities you'll get to meet new people and even more friends. This not only increases your chances of meeting that special someone, but if gives you lots of people to fall back upon if something happens to go awry. The best relationships start out as friendships, so stop trying to find someone and bond with them immediately; perhaps the right person is already just under your nose. Build a foundation first, get to know people, and then consider moving up.

, Don't set goals for yourself, like oh, I'm going to be at this stage with this guy on this day. Remember, you're not out looking for a boyfriend, you're there to make friends and have a good time, and perhaps just happen to meet someone who makes you happy to be you. Taking time to invest and make sure you've got it right will reap you happiness hundreds of times as much as if you just rush into something halfheartedly. Taking it easy will also show guys that you respect yourself, and you're not out looking for commitment.

, This is going to sound really cheesy, but don't ever forget who you are through this whole ordeal, because this is the most important part. It's true. Be yourself, because if you change who you are for someone you want to impress, they won't fall in love with you, and you won't be able to keep it up forever either. Sooner or later, if you put up a façade, you're going to stop being happy and its going to fall apart. Friends and boyfriends, good and bad, will come and go, and that's just a part of life, but don't ever let them change who you are. If you stay true to yourself through it all, you'll always be able to build something back up again.

Decide what kind of sugar daddy you're looking for. Do you want someone who is under forty, or over fifty? Should he be divorced, wanting to date multiple people, or even married? Do you want someone who wants to spend a lot of time with you, or just a man to whisk you away on the weekends?
Decide what you want the sugar daddy to do for you. Some women just require a flat fee -- like $1000 or $2000 dollars a week in exchange for their companionship, some fun times, and usually some lovemaking. Or do you want to be compensated mostly through fancy dinners, exotic vacations, and by being treated to fancy and exclusive events?;
, Don't be shy -- if a sugar daddy is what you're after, then you should join a website for finding sugar daddies. These sites allow you to be clear about what you want, and to easily find men who are looking for something similar.


Be clear about what you want. Let the men know what kind of a relationship you're looking for.
Post photographs that are appealing, but not too provocative. You want the men to think you're sexy while taking you seriously.
Talk about what you have to offer. Don't just focus on what you need, but let the men know that you're fun, exciting, mysterious, or that you just love a good time.

, If you feel too shy or embarrassed to check out the traditional websites for finding sugar daddies, or you don't want to be so obvious about what you want, you can check out regular dating websites, like OkCupid.com, or eHarmony.com, and try to find a man who will give you the money and gifts you want.


You can use filters to find the right man, such as looking at his salary bracket or his occupation.
You can also browse the profile of a man to see if he fits your needs -- if he lists expensive hobbies like boating or vacationing in Europe as his interests, appears to be dressed in very expensive clothing, and clearly has expensive taste, he may be the sugar daddy for you.
You should also look into what the man is looking for -- see if he wants a woman he sees as his equal, or if he wants to treat a woman to a good time in exchange for her company.

, Don't be afraid to ask your friends if they can set you up with a sugar daddy. You can phrase this differently if you feel more comfortable about asking less directly. It's likely that at least one of your friends will know a rich man, whether it's from work or their outside interests, who is looking for someone he can take care of. If you send out a feeler, someone should definitely know of the perfect man for you.


Ask your friends to set you up on a date, and tell them to be frank about your demands. You don't want to be set up with a man who is looking for his soul mate if all you want is a sugar daddy.

, If you're too shy to check out the online dating scene or to ask your friends if they can set you up with a sugar daddy, you can go out and try to hunt for him yourself. Take your friends to a bar or restaurant in the rich neighborhoods in your town, and catch the eye of an older and obviously rich-looking man.


You can even go out of your way to go to a place where rich men are known to be. You can even take a girl trip to the Hamptons, or other places where rich men spend their vacations, and see if you find anyone who appeals to you.
When you're looking for the men, dress up nicely, but not too provocatively. You want the men to take you seriously and not think of you as a one-night stand. Your relationship with the sugar daddy should last a lot longer than that -- at least long enough for you to get what you want.
Check out cultural places that are likely to be frequented by rich men, like museums, opera houses, or art galleries. If an art gallery or museum is having a special occasion night, like a cocktail party, make sure to be there with bells on.

, Finding a sugar daddy takes time. Don't be frustrated if your search doesn't lead you to the right man right away. You can try a mixture of looking online, asking your friends, and going out into the wilderness to find the sugar daddy of your dreams for best results. If you know what you want and are confident about finding it, then the sugar daddy will eventually find his way into your life.


The beauty of looking for a sugar daddy is that you can date multiple people at once. Remember to keep your options open as you keep looking."
"
Be clear about your needs.,
Be attentive to your looks.,
Be self-assured.,
Be independent.,
Be sexy.",How to Find a Sugar Daddy2," Your sugar daddy will appreciate it if you set the terms of the relationship early on so there's no confusion. If you want a weekly salary or expect him to pay some of your expenses, like your rent, let him know so that he knows exactly what you need from the beginning. If you only want to meet him once or twice a week, then tell him this so he doesn't expect more.


Being clear about your needs will also help establish the terms of the relationship. This will ensure that you're both looking for the same thing.
If you want the freedom to see other people while you're dating, you can make this clear from the beginning, too.
Don't feel shy about telling him what you want -- he'll appreciate your honesty and may even find it refreshing.

, You don't have to be a hot twenty year old with double-d breasts to appeal to a sugar daddy. Sugar daddies are looking for women of all ages, shapes, and sizes, so don't feel self-conscious if you're over forty or if your figure doesn't resemble a Barbie doll's. What's important is that you spend time maintaining the looks that you do have by showering daily, styling your hair, and wearing flattering and appealing clothing.Take the time to style your hair and to put on some make-up. You could find a sugar daddy at any time and want to look your best when you do.
You don't have to look like a porn star to appeal to a sugar daddy. Many sugar daddies prefer the natural look.

, If you want to appeal to a sugar daddy, you should be confident and self-assured, and ready to call the shots. He may be feeling shy about being a sugar daddy or unsure about how to proceed, and he'll appreciate it if you know what you're doing and aren't shy about asking for the things you need. Hold your head high, smile proudly, and introduce yourself with pride.There's a difference between being self-assured and bossy. Let the sugar daddy tell you what he's thinking, what he wants, and how you can help. Don't try to be so self-assured that you ignore his needs completely.

, A sugar daddy isn't looking for a life partner or a woman who will do all of his laundry and grocery shopping for him -- he probably has a maid for that anyway. He's looking for a woman who is fun and exciting, but who also has her own life, interests, friends, and plans when he isn't around. If you seem clingy, obsessed over his schedule, or like you always want to be around, he'll be turned off fast.Don't meet with the sugar daddy more than two or three times a week -- if you try to see him more than that, he'll think you're getting attached.
Avoid sleeping over too much if you can. If you start sleeping over at your sugar daddy's place all the time, it'll start to look like you want to move in and stick around.
Be open about your plans. If you're having a night out with your girlfriends, let him know. He'll only want you more if he's a little jealous. If you're both clear about the fact that you're in an open relationship, tell him when you're going out on a date with someone else. This will only make you look more independent.

, Sugar daddies want sexy women who will fulfill their needs. If you really want to find a sugar daddy, then you should look and act sexy as much as possible. Look sexy by wearing sexy clothes, wearing make-up to create smoky eyes, and wearing some sexy lingerie in the bedroom. You can act sexy by licking your lips, touching your sugar daddy just enough to turn him on, and by sending him sexy texts or even talking dirty over the phone.


If you really want a sugar daddy, you should have some sexual experience. Sugar daddies want women who are comfortable in the bedroom. You should know what you're doing and should be prepared to give him what he needs.
You don't have to wear provocative clothing to be sexy -- just wear something that compliments your figure and makes your sugar daddy want you more.

Stay mysterious.,
Be positive and fun.,
Keep things exciting.,
Avoid domesticity.,
Don't get attached.,
Know when to move on.",How to Find a Sugar Daddy3," If you want your sugar daddy to keep wanting you, then you should stay mysterious. If you have to go, don't always tell him where you're going. If you don't respond to his calls for a day, don't go into a big explanation about what you were doing -- you were just busy living your own life. Don't tell him about every little thing on your mind and don't go into detail about your deepest wishes and needs. You can reveal a little bit about yourself at a time, but always leave him wanting more.


Don't give him a planner with your schedule on it. Let him wonder about all of the things you're up to when you're not with him.

, Sugar daddies are looking for women that they can have a good time with. They're not shelling out cash to be with a woman who is negative or always whining and complaining. If you tend to have negative thoughts, try to keep those to a minimum when you're around your sugar daddy and save them for your real friends. Keep things light and positive by laughing often and talking about the things that make you happy and the things that you're excited about instead of the things that get you down.


Whenever you catch yourself saying something negative, counter your statement by making three positive comments.
Try to laugh as much as you can. Sugar daddies want women who are having a good time.
If you're having an emotional day or feel like crying, don't dump all of your emotions on your sugar daddy. Call up a good friend instead.

, If you want to keep your sugar daddy, then you should keep things fresh by always keeping him on his toes. Don't do the same thing every weekend, even if you always go out to an expensive restaurant. Instead, mix things up by asking him to take you boating, give you a tennis lesson, or whisk you away on an expensive vacation.


If you do the same things together all the time, your sugar daddy may begin to get bored with you. Make sure you do one new thing together at least once every week or two.
Keep things exciting in the bedroom too. Use your time with your sugar daddy as an opportunity to try out some of your new moves.

, The quickest way to turn off your sugar daddy is to make him feel like you're ready to shack up and sign a marriage certificate. He's with you because you're fun, adventurous, and exciting -- not because you love making home-cooked meals or ironing his shirts. Avoid sleeping over, spending too much time with him, or taking on any wifely tasks if you can, or a red flag will go up immediately, and he'll want to end the relationship.


As soon as you can tell he feels uncomfortable that you're getting too close, just pull back.
Don't call him your boyfriend, and don't make jokes about your wedding, either.
Don't introduce him to your friends or family unless that's really what he wants, or things will begin to feel too serious for him.
Avoid talking about anything too far in the future, unless you're just planning your next vacation.

, If you really just want to benefit from the riches of a sugar daddy, then don't get too attached to him. He's not your boyfriend or long-term material -- he's someone who you have a good time with, a man who provides you with the financial benefits that make your life easier and more fun. Don't start planning your wedding, coming up with your kids' names, or scheduling your life around his busy schedule. Remain who you are, keep pursuing your own interests, and you'll avoid getting hurt.


Don't contact him all the time when you're not together. Just plan your once-or-twice-weekly meetings and let him know when you're on your way.
Don't spend your time apart wondering what he's up to, or when you'll see him again.
Don't ask him about other women in his life, or get jealous if he even mentions another woman's name.

, If you've been with your sugar daddy for a long time, you may be wondering if it's time to break it off. There are a few good reasons for doing this: you may see that he's too attached to you, you may worry that you're too attached to him, or you may both just be bored with each other. Another reason for moving on is that either you or your sugar daddy have found someone who you really like, or even love, and want to pursue a relationship with that person.


Once it's over, it's over. Be clear and calm about ending the relationship and try to end things on a good note. If all you wanted was a sugar daddy, you'll be able to find another one in no time.
If the sugar daddy rejected you, don't get hurt. It happens all the time -- sugar daddies tend to get bored and want to move on, and it probably has nothing to do with you.

You're fine taking money in exchange for relations.,
You understand the risks of financial dependency.,
You're okay leading men on.,
You know you can keep your emotional distance.",How to Find a Sugar Daddy4," You're getting paid to like someone and act like their partner. There is nothing wrong with this, but you need to be honest with yourself about what you're getting into.


You need to be comfortable being upfront with your man. If you're too passive, or just take the money without questions, you're at risk of being taken advantage of.

, That money doesn't come no strings attached. You're going to be expected, in some way, to do things for him as well, or else the money will run dry quickly.


You will, in some way, become dependent on your sugar daddy to keep your lifestyle going.
If you have your own source of income, and just use him for amenities and luxuries, you can stay more independent.

, You should, of course, be honest with your sugar daddy from the get go. But even if you're honest, you're going to be leading him on. You need to act sexy and mysterious to earn your keep. No matter what the ""rules"" are, chances are good he's going to want more. You're going to have to be fine cultivating this while knowing that he isn't getting more.

, Many sugar daddies know fully well what they're getting you into. They start with gifts and money, but the ultimate goals are not always on the table. When you give someone that much power over you, you have to have trust in them. But sugar daddies, in general, aren't the most immediately trust-worthy people. You have to keep your head, and heart, on a swivel. At the same time, you're just there for the money, so don't feel like you don't have any power in the relationship either.


This is, in many ways, a business transaction. Keep it that way.
If you're looking for deep or meaningful connections, don't get a sugar daddy. Any relationship built on payment is unlikely to lead to a true and deep connection.
Silly as it sounds, sugar daddy relationships are very rarely like the plot of Pretty Woman. Don't let the dream of ""free"" money blind you from the realities of cash for sex relationships."

Understand that it may be hard for a guy to show his feelings.,
Take note of his eye contact.,
Pay attention to how he interacts with other girls.,
See if he goes out of his way to talk to you.,
Get to know what he's like without his friends around.,
See if he gets jealous.,
Notice how he acts in front of you.",How to Find Out if a Guy Secretly Likes You," If he doesn't just tell you he likes you, it could be because he's afraid to admit to his crush. He probably fears rejection or doesn't think you'll like him back. In addition, there's a lot of pressure on teenage guys to appear confident, untouchable, and ""manly"", so it's possible that he's worried about his reputation with his friends and other guys. Understanding the reasons he might be afraid to make a move can help you figure out if he's hiding a crush and what you could do about it.;
, If he's constantly looking at you, watching you, or paying attention to where you are and what you're doing, it might be because he likes you. If you often glance over at him just in time to see him turn away from you, he's likely trying to hide his crush. If he is never the first to look away or break eye contact with you, that might be another sign.

, Does he act overly friendly or flirt with other girls when you're around? He could be trying to get you to notice him or to make you jealous. Does he simply ignore other girls? Maybe he only has eyes for you. Does he tease you more than he does other girls? Perhaps he's trying to hide his crush. Notice the differences between how he interacts with others and with you, and ask your friends what he's like when you're not around.

, Does he ask you for the homework when he could very easily ask his friends? Does he ask you questions to which he clearly already knows the answer? Does he go out of his way to run into you so that he can say hello? He might be looking for excuses to talk to you. If you sit next to one of his friends in class, does he spend more time than usual talking to that friend? He could be trying to indirectly get closer to you.

, Try to catch him alone, and see if he acts differently now that there's no one to impress. If he jokes around and acts macho or cool in front of his friends, it's possible that he'll settle down and be more sincere and serious without them around. Try to spend as much time with him one-on-one as possible, and see if there are any changes in the way he acts without his friends around.

, When you hang out with another guy, whether it's a good friend, a casual acquaintance, or someone you're interested in, take note of how he interacts with that guy. If he ignores, avoids, or openly antagonizes your friend, it could be because he's jealous and wants to get closer to you.

, When he knows you're around, does he go out of his way to look good or act cool? Does he try to seem smarter or more athletic in your presence? He could be trying to impress you without being too obvious. Does he tell more jokes than usual? Maybe he's trying to make you smile or laugh. These could all be signs that he secretly likes you.

Surprise him in the shower.,
Be the boss.,
Send dirty texts.,
Talk dirty.,
Do a striptease.,
Give a lap dance.",How to Drive Your Boyfriend Crazy1," If you really want to be bold, then you should surprise your man in the shower. This will be a delightful, spontaneous, and unexpected treat for him. Before he goes into the shower, give him a kiss, tell him how sexy he is, and say something provocative to make him want you. Say, ""Have fun getting undressed in there,"" and say it while you're wearing something provocative.


When he steps into the shower, wait a few seconds and then knock on the door -- you don't want to scare him completely.
Tell him that you're taking off your clothes and that you'd like to get clean, too -- but not before you both get a little dirty.
Step into the shower and begin kissing his mouth and neck and caressing his body, and see how excited he gets.;
, Another way to be bold is to be the boss once in a while. Pick a night to take complete control of him, to drag him up the stairs and into your bedroom, and to tell him exactly what you want him to do. Don't take no for an answer -- within reason -- and don't smile or break character. Be firm about what you want and desire and see how turned on he gets.


Take him into the bedroom, tell him to lie down, and take control of him. If you want something, ask for it.
Have fun with it. Hold him down and don't give in if he begs for mercy -- unless he really means it, of course.

, Though you may think that sending dirty texts is silly, it's a great way to remind your man of how sexy you are when you're not around, and to check in with him in a sexy way. If you have to be apart for a night, a few days, or even a month, sending a few well-timed dirty texts is the perfect way to make your man want you even more.


Pick a time when you know you'll both be alone and unoccupied, preferably at night.
Send your man a text a few hours before you know you'll see him. Just saying, ""I want you,"" or ""I can't stop thinking about last night,"" will keep you fresh on his mind.
Ask your man what he's wearing or tell him what you're wearing.
Tell him, ""It's so hot in here."" Then, let him know when you remove any clothing.

, Talking dirty in person is another great way to be bold and to drive your boyfriend crazy. When you're hooking up, throwing in a dirty phrase or two can mix things up and drive your man wild. You don't have to overthink it -- just tell him how much you love what he's doing to you, tell him how much you love his body, and let him know what you want him to do. Here are some things you can say:


""I love it when you kiss my neck.""
""I've been thinking about your arms all day.""
""You look so hot with your shirt off.""
""I want you to take off my bra.""

, A striptease doesn't have to be reserved for the strippers. Have fun with it. Dim the lights, get your man in bed, and walk into the room like you own the place, with your head high. Wear some sexy lingerie and high heels, and cover up with a long button down shirt, or a sexy dress that you can easily remove. Then, strip down to your underwear while you use a chair as a prop so your man can see you move your body while you remove your garments.


As you remove each article of clothing, throw it at your boyfriend.
Put one foot up on the chair so your boyfriend can admire your legs.
Turn around, gyrate your hips, and bend down to let your man see your body from behind.
Have fun with it. Have a sexy smile on your face and don't take yourself too seriously.

, A lap dance is another bold way to drive your man crazy. You can sit your man down on a chair, play some upbeat and sexy music, and have fun getting on his lap, teasing him, dancing around the chair, and even bending over with your back to your man so he can see your body.


You can tease your man by kissing him a little bit, but it'll drive him wild if you play a bit hard to get.
Don't let your man put his hands all over you. You'll drive him wild if you make it clear that you're in control.

Plan out your dream guy.,
Now that you have thought of your guy, get in shape.,
To get that guy, you need to take some type of care with your appearance.,

Get a friend who likes this stuff and look for a cute guy.,
Have you found your guy?",How to Find the Right Guy for You to Date," Would he be funny? Hot? Nerdy? Humorous? Cute? Gamer? Go figure. He's your guy, so go ahead, start planning. What really helps some people is to write down the character traits you want your guy to have.;
, If you are already fit, go to the next step. Eat healthy foods and exercise. Make a plan for how long and what days you'll exercise. Maybe run/walk for a mile on Monday, and 2 miles (3.2 km) for Tuesday? Keep thinking. Remember you don't need to RUN the whole time. Take some breaks. Don't start off fast because you'll get tired. Lay off those junky foods. When your on the couch, you could be getting fit!

, Maybe some non-scented lip gloss? Wear nice and comfy clothes.

, But maybe not shorty shorts. Guys don't wanna see your whole leg. When you're 9 or 10, start wearing a training bra. When your boobs start getting bigger, ask your parents for a real bra. Don't get overwhelmed by if your butt is ""small"" or your boobs are ""small"". There is no such thing. Some people say guys like HUGE butts and HUGE boobs. Not true. Just think. Maybe lay it off.

, Be casual, when doing this, maybe sit on a bench and do it. DON'T POINT. Guys may see you and think your insulting them. Be careful!

, If you have, it's time. Ask them out. You can wait for them to make the move, or you. I usually like to meet them (if i haven't already) and then get their phone number, or text email, and once i get that, i will say, ""Wanna go to ______ (wherever) ? BOOM! Got it? Don't be discouraged it you didn't. Keep trying! NEVER GIVE UP!

Be direct.,
Make an excuse.,
Use a “rescue app.” Try installing an app, like “Bad Date Rescue,” on your phone.,
Make a quick exit if you feel unsafe.",How to Escape from a Bad Date1," Sometimes, the best way to get out of an uncomfortable situation is to be honest and to the point about it. Keep it simple: tell your date that you feel like it isn’t working out, settle your bill, and leave.If you want to soften the blow a little, try saying something like, “You seem like a really nice person, but I just don’t feel like we’re a good match.”
If you’re feeling unsafe, or if your date’s behavior is really inappropriate, don’t feel that you owe them any explanation. Just tell them you’re leaving and make your exit.;
, If you’re not feeling it, but you really don’t want to hurt your date’s feelings, try an excuse that will allow you to make a graceful exit. Consider one of these techniques:Pretend to be sick. Tell your date you’re feeling sick to your stomach, or that you’re having an allergic reaction to something in the food.
If you want to stick it out a little longer to be polite, tell them you can only stay for a short amount of time. For example, say something like: “Hey, I’m really sorry, but I just remembered I have to go pick up my friend at 7:30, so I can only stay for half an hour.”

, These apps can send you a convincing fake call or text that will give you an excuse to leave in a hurry.For example, the app may send you a call that is supposedly from a relative or neighbor claiming to be dealing with some kind of emergency. Just pick up the call and respond as if it were real (“Oh, no! Okay, Mom, I’ll be right there.”).

, If your date is aggressive or making you feel unsafe, you may need to leave in a hurry. To avoid creating a confrontation, excuse yourself to the bathroom and then quickly leave the venue.


If you are feeling extremely threatened and don’t think you can simply leave the venue without incident, go to the restroom and call the police.

Look sexy.,
Tease him.,
Be sexy in public.,
Kiss his neck.,
Give a sexy massage.,
Indulge in sexy foods.",How to Drive Your Boyfriend Crazy2," If you want to drive your boyfriend wild, then you'll have to make an effort to look sexy. This doesn't mean that you should look sexy or dress provocatively all the time, or that you should change your looks just to turn on your man. It does mean that you should try to up the ante a bit with your clothes and make up, and dress and look in a way that makes your boyfriend notice you -- and want to get you alone.


You don't have to wear a ton of makeup. Try creating smoky eyes with dark eyeshadow and mascara, and wear just a bit of lip gloss or lip balm to draw attention to your lips.
You can look provocative without looking trashy. Wear flattering clothes that fit you well and show off your best assets.
If you want to be really sexy, dress really provocatively from time to time -- or when you know you and your man will be alone. This will be a fun change and will drive your man wild.
Get some sexy undergarments. The right thong, lacy bra, or pair of panties can make your man even more turned on.

, If you want to drive your boyfriend crazy, then you can't just give him what he wants all the time. Instead, you should kiss him for a minute or two, and then pull back, leaving him wanting more. If you're out, touch him provocatively by putting your hand on his thigh or caressing his neck before moving away. If you're alone in the bedroom, drive him wild with your kisses and caresses before removing your clothes.


You can also tease him by saying the right things. Tell him that you know he wants you, but that you're not sure if you're in the mood -- this will drive him wild.
Compliment his body and let him know how sexy he is. Then, look down at the floor or distance yourself from him.
You can also tease him by caressing your own body. You can say, ""This shirt is so tight,"" or ""I can't believe how big my chest looks in this bra,"" to make him want your body.
If you're wearing a thong, lean down so he gets a peek at it. If you're wearing a lacy bra, lean toward him a bit so he gets a look at your cleavage in the bra.

, You can't just drive your boyfriend wild when you're alone and keep him at arm's length when you're out in public. Being sexy in public doesn't mean trying to initiate a make-out session in the checkout aisle at your local grocery store or touching your man every chance you get. It does mean touching your boyfriend in a knowing way from time to time, giving him seductive smiles, and mentioning something that makes him want to get private.


Don't be afraid to kiss him in public. Kiss him, linger a bit, and then pull away with a smile.
You don't have to touch him all the time in public, either. Just put your hand on his thigh, squeeze his knee, or rub his shoulder occasionally.
Get close when you can. Stand close to him, whether you're both looking at a menu or watching a movie. Let him remember how good it feels to be next to you.

, Kissing your man's neck will drive him wild and will want him to take things to the next level with you. Though there's nothing wrong with good old kissing, kissing his neck is a great way to drive him wild and make him crave you. Have fun gently kissing the side of his neck or even kissing or nibbling on his ears. You can also kick things up a notch by lightly licking his neck and then blowing on it.


If you're comfortable with your boyfriend, try giving his neck the tiniest nibble. This is guaranteed to drive him wild -- as long as you don't do it too much.
You can alternate between kissing him on the lips and kissing his neck. This will drive him wild too.

, Nothing is sexier than giving your man an unexpected and sensual massage. You don't have to plan it. Just wait for him to sit down and be relaxed and get behind him and start caressing his shoulders, kneading his muscles harder and harder until he moans with pleasure. You can also run your fingers in circles on his head and at his temples, and work your way down to his back and sides.


A sexy massage is great in almost any private circumstance, but it'll be even better if you dim the lights, turn off the TV, and indulge in the moment.
You can transition from a sexy massage to sexy time. Just work your hands down your man's body and start kissing his neck as you explore him.
If you want to be frisky, you can turn things around and say, ""Now it's my turn,"" and enjoy letting him touch your body.

, Another way to get sexy is to introduce some foods into the equation. There are some great foods that can help make your relationship feel more romantic and sensual at the same time. Here are a few things to try:


Take turns feeding grapes to each other.
Take turns feeding strawberries to each other while dipping them in chocolate or whipped cream.
Share a bar of chocolate while you and your boyfriend are having a sensual conversation.
Red wine always makes things sexier. If you're deciding between beer and red wine, go for the wine.
Sharing a chocolate and caramel dessert after dinner can make you get more in the mood.

Role play.,
Go dancing.",How to Drive Your Boyfriend Crazy3," If you want to drive your boyfriend crazy, then you have to be adventurous and be excited about making love or just hooking up in new places. If you're always getting it on on the couch or the bed, your moves may begin to feel stale, so you should mix things up from time to time so your boyfriend is still crazy about you and so that your relationship and love life feel fresh. Here are some places to try:


Try ""christening"" a new room in your house or apartment by making love there.
Pull the car over to a private and scenic location and have fun kissing each other.
Take it back to high school and have fun kissing your man at the movies.
Go on a sexy vacation and have fun having hooking up in a completely new environment.
There's nothing wrong with sneaking off to your friend's balcony in the middle of a party and stealing a few kisses.

, You can be adventurous in the safety of your own bed or home. If you're always making love or hooking up in the same position, mix things up next time. If you're always on top and your man is on the bottom, switch roles from time to time. You can make a game of hooking up only in new positions for a while, and cycling through a variety of positions before making it back to same old, same old.


Trying out new moves is a great way to keep things fresh -- just make sure you're not doing anything that doesn't make you comfortable.

, If you want to drive your boyfriend crazy, then you can't keep doing the same old stuff together, or your relationship can begin to lose its luster. Instead, you have to find new ways to keep things fresh -- and to continue to turn your man on. Here are some things that you can try:


Go hiking together. You'll have fun enjoying nature, feeling romantic, and enjoying each other's company.
Go camping. You'll feel romantic -- and frisky -- if you and your man are alone under the stars.
Play pool. Have fun leaning over and letting him see your body as you aim your cue.
Do power yoga. Get sweaty on adjacent mats and enjoy looking at each other's bodies.

, Another way to get adventurous and to drive your boyfriend crazy is to explore new places together. You'll get a new appreciation of your relationship, and your sexual chemistry, if you're out exploring completely new locations. Take a trip to the beach or the woods, or even have fun taking a long walk down a previously unexplored path.


If you have the time or money, go on a romantic vacation. Being in a completely new environment while hooking up will drive your boyfriend crazy and will make him see you in a new light.

, If you're not too shy, then a little bit of healthy role playing is guaranteed to drive your boyfriend crazy and to make him want you even more. You can have fun in a variety of role-playing situations, whether you're pretending that you're late to a party but really can't get enough of each other, or if your boyfriend pretends to be a stranger knocking on the door.


If you really want to drive your boyfriend crazy, have fun taking a trip to a sex store. Find some outfits that really drive him wild and don't get embarrassed or feel shy about it.

, Take a dance class or just take your man out to a nice bar or club with some mood-inducing music. Have fun leaning close to your man, whispering in his ear, and letting him explore your body. You can make a weekly or monthly date to go dancing together, knowing that this will lead you straight to the bedroom.


Look into your man's eyes when you're dancing. Let him know how much you want him.
If you take a dance class together, you'll be getting your adrenaline pumping while you enjoy each other's company.

Suggest that your date limit his or her number of drinks.,
Keep an eye on behavioral changes during the event.,
Decide whether you are able to help sober up your date.,
Make a decision to leave.,
In the situation where you are not able to escape a drunken date, self-preserve.,
Think about where this relationship is going.",How to Escape from a Drunken Date," If you are already aware that the person you are dating drinks too much at events, set the limits early on and set your own ground rules as well.

Tell them that it's no fun being with them when they're drunk and that you won't stay to see the results if they do this. Naturally, if you're unaware that your date gets drunk yet, this step is not relevant.



 

;
, If you notice unpleasant changes that bother, worry, or even frighten you, take heed that you are probably going to have to react to look after your own interests. Even if your drunken date does nothing more than make pigheaded jokes at your expense, it is more than enough to ruin your evening.

, If it's early enough yet and your date is responsive to you, try the sobering up route first (provided that your date is not behaving violently or vindictively.) Usually this step works when the drunkenness has not gone too far but is still very evident.

Take them to the kitchen, make a cup of coffee and put some food in front of them. Demand that they eat the food, drink the coffee, and talk with you.
Sit down and talk to them in clear, simple language about going home, or going to do something that doesn't involve drinking, such as watching a DVD. Do not let them fall asleep however, as they may stop breathing during their sleep. If they do pass out, keep an eye on their breathing carefully, and watch out for symptoms of alcohol poisoning.
Be polite but firm; this isn't the time for acting demure or coy, as you're dealing with someone who is losing self-control.







, If your drunken date is ruining the night for you, it is a good idea not to stay around. This won't always be easy though, depending on the situation. If it's just the two of you, it will be more challenging than if you're at a party and can slip out unnoticed:


For a situation where it is just both of you, offer to drive your date home, or order a taxi. If this offer is not accepted, loudly inform them (if other people are around) that you're going home now and they can do as they choose.
If there are no people around, and you feel threatened, you will need to tread more carefully. Look for excuses that you can make to leave momentarily but take that chance to leave altogether; for example, say you are going to the bathroom / to get some food/more drink / to shut a window / to put the cat out / to phone your parents or a friend / to turn off lights, etc. Whatever seems viable enough given the context that will buy you get away time. And leave quickly!
If you're at a party, leave your date with his or her other mates to get over it. Perhaps take the car keys if he or she drove there, to prevent them from making any fatal mistakes. They'll understand when sober, and if not, it's possible you need to rethink the relationship.

, If your date is simply a nuisance and rude, obnoxious, and loud, try ignoring them and moving to another part of the room or yard. If they are beginning to become violent, get help from others to restrain your date, or shut yourself into a room or place where you can ride this through. If you have a cell phone and you're alone, dial for help.

, If the drunkenness is a one-off or a phase, and you think that it is something that will either pass or will lessen, you might be prepared to work through this but place ground rules firmly in place, such as refusing to remain near your date if it occurs, or not even going to certain events with them at all until they reform and learn to hold their liquor consumption to normal standards. If, on the other hand, it becomes rapidly clear to you that your date has a real problem and few prospects for change, it might be necessary to end the relationship on its dating grounds, especially if you're experiencing fear or threats every time. You can still be there as a supportive friend if you feel strong enough, and can even help them to obtain medical or therapeutic assistance. But don't do anything that endangers your health and long-term emotional stability. People make their own choice to drink and only they can make a change in how they behave around alcohol.

Arrange for a friend to make a check-in call.,
Have a friend crash your date.,
Get help from the staff at the date venue.",How to Escape from a Bad Date2," Tell a friend ahead of time that you are planning to go on a date. Ask them to call you at a pre-arranged time (e.g., 30 minutes into the date) to check in. If the date is going badly, you can pretend that your friend is having an emergency and needs your help right away.For example, when your friend calls, you can say something like, “Oh no, really? I’m on my way!” Tell your date, “I’m so sorry, my friend’s car broke down, and she needs me to come pick her up.”

, Arrange to have a friend show up if things get uncomfortable. Send them a quick text, or step into the bathroom to make a call.When your friend shows up, act surprised and invite them to join you. E.g., “Oh, wow, I haven’t seen you in forever! Hey, why don’t you sit with us for a bit? You’ve got to try this cocktail!”

, Some restaurants and bars offer a “mayday service” for customers stuck on bad dates or feeling unsafe. Call ahead and find out if the place you’re going offers such a service. This can take the form of a code word (e.g., going up to the bar and ordering an “angel shot” or asking to “speak to Angela”).Even if the venue you have chosen does not offer a “mayday service,” you may be able to simply go up to the bar or pull a server aside and quietly ask for assistance.
A staff member may be able to call a cab for you. Or, if your date is behaving really inappropriately or making you feel unsafe, you can ask to have them escorted out or have a staff member call the police for you.

Let someone know you’ll be on a date.,
Agree to meet in a public place.,
Have a plan for getting home safely.,
Carry cash with you.",How to Escape from a Bad Date3," Make sure a trusted friend or family member knows where you will be, and when. That way, if things go wrong and you need someone to pick you up or give you a way out, someone will already have your back., It’s always easier to escape – or get help, if you need it – if you’re in a public venue rather than, say, your own home, or a secluded spot somewhere. Arrange to meet your date at a place like a restaurant or a bar., If things are going poorly and you need to make an escape, you don’t want to have to rely on your date to drive you home. If you don’t own a car or can’t drive yourself, be prepared to call a cab, use a ride service (like Uber or Lyft), or call a friend to come pick you up.

, If you need to leave in a hurry and don’t want to worry about settling the bill, it’s a good idea to have some cash you can put down for your part of the tab. Cash is also useful to have on hand in case you need to pay for cab fare."

Make sure to focus your energy on the other couple and not just your own date.

Pay attention to how she reacts to touch.",How to Figure Out if a Girl Likes You in Middle School2," You may notice that every time you touch her, such as grab her shoulder or lightly touch her hand, she might have many different reactions. For example, if she's shy or afraid to show that she likes you because she's absolutely terrified of rejection, she might move her hand away almost as soon as you touch it or give a small jolt when you touch her shoulder. If she's a more confident girl who wants you to make the first move, she's more likely to look into your eyes when you touch her or move her hand closer to yours when you touch hers. It really just depends on the girl.

Note changes in your physical appearance.,
Monitor your physical reaction.",How to Decide if You Are Attracted to Someone1," When you are attracted to a person, you may find yourself thinking about them more often than you think about anyone else and doing so beyond your control.When you are not attracted to someone, you will likely be indifferent. Ask yourself the following questions:


Do I frequently find myself wanting to be where they are?
Am I disappointed when they do not return my text messages or phone calls?;
, If you care a lot about your physical appearance, especially if it is more than usual, you are likely attracted to the person. You are demonstrating that you care how they feel about your appearance, and you probably care how they feel about you. Here are a few questions to ask yourself:Do I care more about how my hair looks?
Do I spend more time deciding what clothing to wear?
Am I wearing more perfume or cologne?

, Sometimes figuring out if you are attracted to someone is very easy because you have an immediate physical response that seems to grow within you and is sometimes felt in your mind, body, and heart. This may include nervousness or a feeling of having butterflies in your stomach (fluttering).


Note your heart rate and check your palms when you think about the person or when they are around you.
Without even being aware of it, when are attracted to someone you will act differently when they are around. The primary reason is because you feel self-conscious and you want to make a good impression.
This may sound strange, but believe it or not, as human beings we are drawn to others based upon their natural odor. Just like you may be attracted to a person’s physical characteristics, odor can foster attraction. Additionally, odor can cause you to remember events and think fondly about a person and the time that you spent together."

Process your feelings.,
Examine your physical preferences.,
Identify any deal breakers.",How to Decide if You Are Attracted to Someone2," Sometimes your emotions about another person can be so strong that they become completely overwhelming and you immediately know that something special is happening. When trying to figure out if you are attracted to someone, simply start out by asking yourself how happy you are to see the person. This can be an indicator of attraction.Laughing at all of the person's jokes can be an indication of attraction.
Smiling frequently can also be an indication of attraction.

, Be honest with yourself and think about whether or not you have any physical preferences. If you prefer someone who is tall, then you may not be attracted to someone who is short.Make a list of your preferences.


Physical attractiveness is subjective and what one person finds physically appealing is not always universal. You must gaze at the person’s overall appearance to figure out if you like what you see.
Physical appearance can include facial features (such as eyes, nose, lips, cheekbones), hygiene, hairstyle, attire, and anything else that affects their overall appearance.
You cannot always make a sweeping statement about your preference because you can absolutely be attracted to someone who is the exact opposite of what you usually find attractive. However, sometimes your personal preference will be an overriding factor.

, For instance, there are some people who do not find people who smoke attractive. While this is not a physical characteristic, it is certainly something that can affect overall attractiveness."

Share your feelings.,
Pursue a healthy relationship.",How to Decide if You Are Attracted to Someone4," Both men and women provide physical cues when they are attracted to another person. Major signs are dilated pupils, lifted shoulders, and feet pointed towards you.Women sometimes play with their hair, tilt their head, or become coy when they are attracted to someone.Men sometimes smile, sway, stretch, or gaze when they are attracted to someone.

, Go into the date without the label of ""date."" Get it in your mind that it’s a meet-up or a friendly outing. A different label will send a message to your mind and heart that whatever will be, will be. If love comes out of it, then it will be a pleasant surprise—icing on the cake.

Know some self-defense.",How to Defend Your Girlfriend," Before you do anything else, calm down. Your temper may flare up the moment someone disrespects your girlfriend, but if you act purely on adrenaline and testosterone, there's a good chance you'll only make the situation worse than it needs to be.Be aware of any internal or external factors that might be influencing your judgment, too. For instance, if you're at a bar when the incident occurs, ask yourself if you've had too much to drink and if the alcohol could be impairing your better judgment.
Even when your anger is perfectly justified, it still pays off to remain as calm as possible. It'll be much easier to prevent the situation from becoming violent if at least one person involved—you—can remain even-tempered.;
, Make sure that you're actually witnessing what you believe you're witnessing. Oftentimes, the truth of the situation will be immediately obvious. In some cases, however, you might be mistaken and there might not be any actual disrespect going on.


This is especially important when you walk into the situation halfway through. For instance, a guy might be attempting to flirt with your girlfriend without knowing she's already taken, or the guy she's talking with so intimately might actually be a relative you've never met. If you make a move without knowing any of this, the move you end up making could be the wrong one.

, You need to trust your girlfriend in two separate but related matters: trust her to remain loyal to you, and trust her to take care of the minor incidents herself.


Even if your girlfriend is making small talk with an obviously flirtatious guy, it doesn't mean that she's going to dump you for him. She could be trying to let him down gently. Trust her to remain faithful to you unless you have some concrete reason to believe otherwise.
On a similar note, if you do have concrete reason to doubt your girlfriend's fidelity, ask yourself if the relationship is really worth maintaining. If you have to fight to keep her, she might not be worth keeping.
Your girlfriend will probably be able to handle minor sources of disrespect without your intervention. After all, there's a good chance she had to deal with things like this before she met you, so she likely knows what to do. The harassing party is generally less likely to become violent when dealing with a woman, so letting her handle it can be a good way to prevent things from getting completely out of hand.

, Ask yourself why you feel the desire to step in. If you honestly want to defend your girlfriend's honor or safety, you're off to a good start. On the other hand, if you feel the need to defend or “claim” your territory, you might be acting out of jealousy rather than chivalry.Jealousy is a very human emotion that affects nearly everyone—men and women alike. Nonetheless, unchecked jealousy can be a very destructive force, and it's usually best to avoid acting on it.
If you aren't sure what your motives are, ask yourself what part of the situation bothers you. If you feel personally insulted, you might just be jealous. If you're worried about how distressed your girlfriend seems or how dangerous the situation appears, your motives are likely pure.

, Unless the first offense is unforgivably terrible, it's usually best to let it go. You might need to offer your girlfriend some reassurance, but don't confront the perpetrator just yet.


For example, if a passerby shouts an insulting, crude, or otherwise disrespectful remark at your girlfriend, it's probably best to let it go. Let your girlfriend know that you disapprove of the action and will intervene if the offender returns, but don't chase him down.
On the other hand, if someone tries to grab, strike, or otherwise physically threaten your girlfriend during the first incident, you'll need to step in and immediately put a stop to it.

, Stand up for your girlfriend once a single incident evolves into actual harassment. At that point, the perpetrator has already demonstrated that the abuse won't end until someone else forces it to end.


The escalation can be either verbal or physical. If the same guy keeps forcing unwanted attention or continues to make harassing remarks, it's obvious that he has no intention of quitting on his own. Defending your girlfriend at this point is both justifiable and honorable.

, When possible, it's also a good idea to get your girlfriend's take on the current situation, too. You may not need to act if she doesn't feel alarmed or bothered by the disrespect.Watch for nonverbal cues, too, especially if you aren't able to talk to her about it. If your girlfriend looks visibly uncomfortable or upset, be ready to act on her behalf.
You should also trust your own instincts. Some people are naturally more trusting than others, and if your girlfriend seems a little too trusting of someone who's giving you bad vibes, you might need to intervene even if she doesn't feel bothered by the attention.

, Step in between your girlfriend and the wrongdoer. By taking this stance, you can break the offender's line of sight. This sends both parties the message that you're prepared to defend your girlfriend if the need arises.


In essence, you're taking a “fighting stance” without appearing overtly aggressive. Making brief eye contact with the offender as you step up lets him know that you've got your eye on him, but don't stare him down or intentionally try to look threatening. Try to maintain a tone of calm, steady strength.

, Lean in close to her. Wrap your arm around her shoulders or waist. Take her by the hand, give her a quick kiss, or gently stroke her hair. Any simple yet intimate action should suffice.


Intimate actions like these are an extension of your “fighting stance.” The idea is to tell the offending party, in no uncertain terms, that you care for this girl and have every intention of protecting her from anyone who tries to create a problem.
Since the focus here remains on your girlfriend, though, it's not overtly aggressive. As such, it's less likely to evoke an aggressive reaction from the offending party.

, While rare, there are certain circumstances in which the offender may not realize he's done anything offensive. You might be able to stop the harassment simply by communicating with the perpetrator in a friendly manner.


For example, if the offender's judgment is impaired by alcohol or if he's just really bad at picking up on social cues, he may not have any bad intentions toward your girlfriend. Unless his actions undeniably fall into the category of harassment, it might be best to give him the benefit of the doubt.
Combine protective nonverbal actions with friendly speech toward the offender himself. Consider telling him, in a lighthearted way, that the girl he's pestering is your girlfriend and isn't interested in shopping around for a new guy.

, If the wrongdoer refuses to take a hint, you'll need to tell him directly that the harassment needs to end. Be as polite as possible, but remain firm and resolute.


Use strong wording, but try to keep an even tone of voice. Saying “you need to back off” will work better than shouting it. Losing your cool only encourages him to do likewise.
Avoid the use of expletives, too. Littering your warning with cuss words might make you feel better, but the raw emotion conveyed by those choice words might also incite him to violence.

, Look around for others who might be willing to assist you. In particular, check among the perpetrator's friends. It may seem counter-intuitive, but becoming the offender's buddy will be a more useful ally to have than a stranger.This is especially useful if the offender is drunk and his friends are sober. Check his friends' reactions when he speaks. If they grimace or otherwise look uncomfortable, they probably know that he's in the wrong. Asking them to help you defuse the situation before things get worse might encourage them to act accordingly.

, If the harasser refuses to back down, it's better to walk away from the situation before the fight turns physical. Knowing when to quit isn't a sign of weakness or cowardice.


It might be hard to know when the breaking point will occur, especially if you've never encountered a situation like this before. Some people will strike without warning. Most, however, do give some indication beforehand. If the offender's speech becomes increasingly violent or crass, or if his nonverbal language becomes more aggressive, it probably won't be long before he becomes physically violent toward you and your girlfriend.

, When things get really ugly, don't be afraid to call the police. Doing so is actually the best possible option if you believe this stranger to be a threat to the physical well-being of your girlfriend or yourself.


If the situation seems genuinely dangerous, don't leave your girlfriend alone, even for a reason that seems sensible. Both of you should greet the security guard or police officer; don't leave her behind and do so by yourself since she might be more vulnerable to an attack while you're gone.

, Picking a fight with the offender is never a good idea, but if he decides to throw the first punch, you will probably need to fight back. Consider learning some basic self-defense for this purpose.


Typically, you won't get into much (if any) trouble for committing an act of violence when you can prove that it was done in self-defense. Only go as far as you need to, though. If one punch is enough to stop the aggressor's attack, stop there instead of continuing to pummel him.

Become a high-roller in the National Thoroughbred Racing Association’s annual National Handicapping Championship.",How to Win at Horse Racing," Handicapping is the process of determining which horse has the best chance to win a race. It is a test of your creative intelligence, not systematic computation. To do this, you’ll need the Daily Racing Form, which you can buy upon entering the track.


The DRF is full of a whole bunch of stats and figures, which we’ll be discussing below. Once you know how to decode the racing form, you’ll have a pretty good idea of which horses will (or at least should) do well.;
, Beyer numbers often serve as a starting point in the handicapping process. They are the bold numbers found in the middle of each DRF, indicating the horse's past performances. Handicappers often use the horse with the highest last-race Beyer as their focus and eliminate horses that have never run a figure close to this horse's figure. There are two numbers: pace and speed.



Pace projections. By scanning the past performances, handicappers try to estimate the pace of the current race and determine which horse will benefit most from it. The first bold-face number, pace, shows whether the horse likes to be on the early lead or not.

Speed projections. This is not the same as pace. Speed (the 2nd bold-faced number) shows the horse’s ability to pass other less-speedy horses as they near the finish line. Speed does not equal consistency (which pace can).

, Distance is one of the biggest factors when it comes to betting. If you’re looking at a horse that tires out around six furlongs and you’re at the Belmont Stakes where it’s a whopping twelve furlongs, you probably don’t want to bet that horse.How has your horse run in other races of this similar length?


Distance, pace, and speed are very powerful in tandem. Looking at how your horse runs (and, as importantly, how she finishes) in different distances will clue you in to how she’ll perform in races of different lengths.

, This is called “track bias”: no single factor in handicapping can change the complexion of a race like a track bias. If wise bettors detect any kind of bias in the racing surface, they incorporate it into their decision-making. What is track bias? Every horse has their preferred surface, whether it’s turf or dirt. You want to know how your horse will perform on whatever your track is.


Don’t forget the weather! A little rain quickly turns that dirt into mud. Take into account how your horse has performed in this type of weather, not just the type of track.

, Is her last race a true representation of her ability? Is she likely to improve or regress on race day? Which horses raced against a bias last out and can be expected to offer a peak performance today? Horses, just like humans, are never 100% consistent.


One thing to consider is the size of the purse and where the horse is coming from. If the size of the purse is large, this is one classy horse – she’ll probably be pretty consistent (she didn’t get to the big leagues for nothing). And if she got flown in from somewhere, her owners paid a pretty penny to get her there, so they’ll probably break out all the stops to see her win.

, In the list of the horse’s previous races, you’ll see her previous post position. Sprint races around one turn usually favor outside posts, while route races (races with 2 turns) at longer distances often favor inside post positions.What’s this race? And what is your horse’s post position? Has she run a race like this in the past and done well?


You may want to consider other horse's post positions, too. If a certain horse seems to be speedier on the inside and for this race is on the inside, this horse will be serious competition.

, With your umbrella and binoculars in hand, get going to your track. Step out onto the track before the races begin – what’s it like? Find the bettor’s window, and sit down to read your DRF. There are a few other pieces you can get for purchase, too:’’A racetrack program.’’ This has information on all the horses, jockeys, trainers, and owners. The cost is usually $3.
’’Public handicapper selections.’’: If your racetrack or OTB (off-track betting) is covered by the local newspaper, they may pay a handicapper to make daily horse selections. The cost is usually 50 cents.
’’Handicapping tip sheets.’’ These are daily selections published by handicappers at the racetrack. The cost is usually $2.

Tracks often simulcast from other tracks, too. This means you can watch the races live in one track and watch ‘’and bet on’’ races at other tracks being simulcast on TV. Imagine the bank you’d make if you won both!



, This form is the most important weapon in a handicapper's arsenal. It provides detailed information on each horse running in the day's races. It costs $4 at most race tracks and is outlined in the above section. At first glance, it’s quite intimidating – but once you learn what all the numbers mean, it’ll be your best friend.Give yourself some extra time to sit down and study it. As you get better and better you'll need less and less time, but for now work at least a few races in advance. Being patient and doing your homework will increase your odds like little else.

, When you go up to window, you need to know what you want! Here are your basic options:


Show – your horse can get 1st, 2nd, or 3rd and you win
Place – your horse can get 1st or 2nd and you win
Win – your horse must get 1st to win
Quinella – bet 2 or 3 horses to finish 1st or 2nd, in any order
Exacta – bet 2 horses that must finish in 1st and 2nd in exact order
Trifecta – bet 3 horses that must finish in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in exact order
Superfecta – bet 4 horses that mush finish in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in exact order

, Let's say you bet $2 on a horse to win (which is the standard minimum bet). To determine how much you would win if she wins, take the odds of your horse and multiply the first number by 2 (your bet), then divide that by the second number, and then add $2 (again, your bet).Let's say your horse has 3/1 odds. You multiple 3x2 to get $6. Divide that by 1, which is still $6. Then you add $2. You would make $8 on a $2 wager.
Let's take a bet where lots of people are betting, like on a horse with 1/9 odds. You multiply 1x2 to get $2. Then 2/9, which is about 20 cents. Plus $2, and your winnings is $2.20.

, After you’ve gotten down all the big numbers, you also want to look at other tidbits of information in the DRF. There’s some information on there about each horse that can give them the edge to win. Consider:


If a horse was recently claimed, or bought. If someone is willing to shovel out a chunk of change for a horse, they probably have potential.
If there are any recent equipment changes. The owner is zeroing in on how to improve their horse's chances.
Look at her workout speeds. Are they consistent? If she's running at the same speed every day, she's probably in top form.
Consider the gender and breed. Generally speaking, males are faster than females. Only three fillies (females) have ever won the Kentucky Derby, for example.And better-bred horses will outperform others, too.

, Any good bettor sometimes bets big and sometimes bets small. To keep yourself going and to keep from being bored between races you're very excited about, have a smaller pocket to work out of. You'll be $2 here, $2 there, and then when that big race comes up, you'll turn to your other pocket, and bet $20.


Betting, quite frankly, in any arena, can be dangerous. It's always important to know when to stop. Having 2 separate pockets can help you keep your head above water, too.

, Remember this order: racetrack, race, dollar amount, bet type, horse number.So when you walk up to the window to talk to an actual human, this is the formula you follow. Here's an example:


""At Saratoga, I'd like to bet on the 5th race – a $4 exacta on horses 3 and 7."" Make sure to do this before the 5th race, of course. Check your ticket before you leave the window, just to make sure it's correct.

The racetrack is specified as many tracks are likely simulcast at the track you are currently in.



, Just like you would if you were playing poker, keep track of your own performance. Where do you seem to be making assumptions that aren't correct? What tidbits are you missing, resulting in betting on the wrong horse? What are you strong points? Knowing how you bet can help you overcome any personal weaknesses, too.


When you go to the track, bring a pen and paper with you or a type of scorecard, just like avid fans of other sports do. Keep track of the results in addition to how you bet to jog your memory later.
Establish what types of bets produce the highest returns for you and make them the focus of your wagering.
Determine what types of races you have the most success with and which you can't decipher. If you conclude that you seldom pick winners on turf, avoid betting on grass races until you improve your handicapping.

, You don't have to depend all on your own ingenuity and ability to see outside the box – this is a very established field, so take advantage of it. Read reputable books about the art of horse racing. Knowing the strategy behind it like the back of the hand is one of the best things you can do for your odds.


Of course, a lot of what's out there is just a giant scam to get your money. Research the author and preview the book before purchasing. Some people are out to make a dollar however they can.

, Some tracks hold monthly (or even more regularly) seminars or workshops on horseplaying. They'll be full of tips and tricks, where you can meet other aficionados, too.


To find this information, just inquire at your track. You're likely get put on an email list for their newsletter that will be full of the necessary information.

, There's such a thing as a ""parlay bet"" and it can make betting on the horses even more fun. If you're with a group, get everyone to chip in, say, $5. Then, each person picks 1 horse to show on a certain race. Place the first bet, and then if you win, place the next bet including the winnings. If you hit a streak, that $5 can add up very quickly.


Make sure the winnings (and the losses) get split evenly. Have everyone agree to a basic set of guidelines before participating in any betting. Some people may argue that they won while others lost – establish protocol before this happens.

, Of course you have to qualify, but if you do you could win $1 million dollars. To get to this level, this basically has to be your job. But don't quit your day job just yet!


Again, any type of gambling can be dangerous. Try to set yourself a limit – if you hit that point, you'll walk away. It's to easy to get into trouble in situations like this; always be looking out for yourself.
Remain dispassionate when betting. Increasing the size and scope of your wagers to try to recoup losses often only results in more losses. Even the best horse players sometimes lose; they accept it as part of the game. What winning horse players don't do is wager recklessly when their emotions get in the way.

Have fun in the ring.",How to Perform a Dressage Test," Wear a helmet, gloves, breeches and boots. It is best to ride in an English saddle, preferably a dressage or all-purpose variety,and preferably a snaffle bridle (or double if above elementary). If you will be riding at a show, check the dress code to avoid being disqualified.;
, Make sure you have a few copies. Try drawing the movements out on scrap paper or walking out the test as if you were your horse. Keep in mind when your competition is, as you will need to have adequate time to prepare and practice the test.

, Walk, Trot and Canter are just the basics, but the horse many be asked to halt, rein back, free walk, medium walk and do any other movements that may be asked of him. Also make sure that your horse can do whatever necessary in a somewhat stressful scenario, such as a show. You don't want all your training to disappear right before you enter the ring!

, You might consider videotaping yourself or having someone on the ground to give you feedback after you're done. Remember how each movement felt and where you had problems. Was the test too easy, or did you have problems almost all the way through?

, Try to avoid riding the entire test any more than once a week, as your horse will begin to remember patterns and may incorrectly anticipate your next move. Instead, practice each movement as well as about half of the one before and half of the one after. Think about your approach to each movement and how you set your horse up, then think about transitioning to whatever movement comes next.

, Where do you struggle? Write down the three hardest parts of your test, and discuss with your trainer or a friend any alternative exercises that could help you with the tricky movements. For example, if you are having a hard time leg-yielding from G to R, try coming off the quarter-line and leg-yielding to the nearest wall. Breaking up your training helps you and your horse improve more comprehensively.

, Hopefully, your problem spots have improved and there aren't any new ones. (If there are, just break the test up again and practice that movement.) Keep in mind how your horse responded to your aids in each movement.

, Don't keep drilling your horse on just your test. A day or two before the show, ride easy, confidence-building movements you know your horse can do well. At this point, you just want to make both you and your horse feel great about what you can do.

, so long as you aren't at a regional championship, you should be able to have a friend or your trainer read your test as you ride it. This way, you can be sure you won't make errors of course and can concentrate fully on riding the test to the best of your ability.

, Judges and horses alike respond to a big smile and a relaxed demeanor. Remember that you love riding, you love your horse and you love dressage!

Before you get all into competing or just doing dressage for fun, make sure your horse knows who you are and knows that it can trust you. You also have to make sure you have faith in your horse. If you don't think you or your horse can do it, you won't be able to.Learning dressage depends entirely on being able to create a strong bond with your horse. Your horse must trust you to give it appropriate commands and you must trust it to do what you ask it to.
To bond with your horse, try to spend a lot of time with each other in a way that reinforces the fact that you are the leader. Take your horse on walks and lead it by the bridle.Groom and bathe your horse and talk to it in soothing tones. Spending time with your horse while it grazes, hand-feeding it, and riding it are other ways to bond.;
, To practice dressage, you’ll need to make sure you have all the supplies you and your horse will need. This includes a dressage saddle, a saddle liner, stirrups, a bridle, and reins.If you can, find a mentor for help. Someone who already competes in dressage can make sure you have all the needed gear for you as well as your horse.
Make sure you also have a good pair of boots to wear while you practice your dressage. Inappropriate footgear can lead to injury.
There are other supplies that may be required for competitions – like a tailcoat for you or a fly hood for your horse.

, Keep your heels down at all times. This keeps your weight back and body positioned solidly in the saddle. Adjust your stirrups so that your knee is at about an eighty-degree angle. The balls of your feet should rest on the stirrup irons. Sit tall in the saddle without bracing your back. This will help improve your balance in the saddle.Keep the ball of your foot in the iron at all times. If you only put your toes in, your feet will slip out of the irons if your horse spooks and you will have no chance of staying on.

, Dressage is a sport that requires a lot of fitness from both the horse and you. You'll need to work gradually to build up the horse to the necessary level of exercise. You also don’t want to push the animal too much, as it could get hurt from overwork and injure a tendon or ligament.To get in shape, your horse will need to be trained 3 to 5 days a week for between 30 minutes to an hour per day. Just how much you work the horse depends on its starting fitness level.

, The first three gaits – walk, trot, and canter – should be forward and consistent. Both you and your horse should feel confident traveling at all three gaits in all circumstances. Becoming comfortable with various speeds requires patience and practice.Learning the differences in gaits should be the foundation of your training with your horse. Mastering these skills requires a lot of practice and will most likely take months of constant work. But, they will be the base for all further training you do with the horse.
When you show your horse in dressage competitions, you’ll need to demonstrate a mastery of the various gaits.

, The horse should have smooth, forward transitions, both upward and downward. Your horse should maintain balance, rather than falling onto its forehand, and it should not pull against the rein. Ideally, transitions should be mainly ridden off the leg and seat, with minimal hand/rein instruction.In dressage, coordination is absolutely necessary. So transitions need to be prompt and occur at the exact moment the rider wishes to change the gait.
To improve your horse’s transitions, you need to spend a lot of time practicing. Try transitioning from walking to trotting and then from trotting to cantering. You can also practice transitioning from a standstill to walking. Going back and forth between these different moves will help your horse learn, over time, how to successfully transition during a dressage performance.
Try to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour per day practicing your transitions and gaits with the horse.

, In Training Level, judges don't look so much for the collection that many people consider to be characteristic of dressage. Instead, they look for the predecessor to collection, which is willingness to accept contact and stretch into the bridle.How can you tell that a horse is stretching into the bridle? When you hold your reins still, you should be able to feel the horse's mouth without it hanging on your reins.
If you soften your reins forward, it should follow the contact down, neither pulling against the reins nor dropping the contact.
Consider asking an experienced dressage rider or trainer to watch you from the ground, to make sure you’re getting the correct contact. If you’re struggling, they’ll also be able to help you achieve bit contact.

, When you want your horse to turn, pull your waist up a bit in the saddle every time. Slightly turn your hips in the direction you want your horse to go. Push straight with your hips in the direction that you want to go.The longer you practice this method with your horse, the more perceptive your horse will become to your movements and intended commands. Eventually, you will only have to pivot your hips ever so slightly for your horse to interpret the response you expect from it.
Ask your horse to bend its body to follow any curve by supporting him with your inside leg and inside seat bone. Be careful not to overbend him; if you were to look down from above, the curve of its body should match the curve of the turn or circle.
Another way to think about this is to use gentle pressure with your inside leg and seat bone. Then, release with the outside leg while turning your hips. These cues together will tell the horse where you want it to go.

, If you want to show your horse in a dressage competition, you should consider getting professional training beforehand. A professional outside point of view will be able to recognize any mistakes you might be overlooking in form, technique, or commands.You should be able to contact a local equestrian club (or even your horse veterinarian or other dressage enthusiasts) for recommendations about who to ask for private dressage lessons for you and your horse.
Try attending a clinic for beginners with your horse if you can’t afford a professional trainer. You can also buy instructional DVDs or books illustrating what to do.

, Memorize and practice the USDF Training Level tests. Ride them for a certified instructor and ask them for some tips on what you should work on. When you take the tests, a judge will give you a scorecard with information on how well you and your horse performed during the test.Each test is conducted on an individual basis – with one horse (and rider) performing on their own for each level of the test.
The USDF tests your skills in some of the following areas: tracking right or left, free walking, halting and saluting, changing reins, and circling right or left., Here is the fun part. Research any schooling shows in your area and enter your horse in them. After you ride your test for the judge, you will receive a score sheet with an assessment of what you did well and what you scored poorly on. Try to take all criticism well, as the judge did take the time to write up the scoresheet for you.Remember that your first show is really just a test run since you’ve never done it before. Give yourself permission to do poorly because you are learning how the system works and what is expected in these kinds of competitions.
There are many national and international dressage competitions around the world including the US Dressage Finals, the Great American Insurance Group/USDF Regional Championships, and the North American Juniors and Young Riders’ Championships.

A standard dressage arena is 20 meters by 60 meters (or about 66 feet by 197 feet). A short dressage arena is 20 meters by 40 meters (or about 66 feet by 132 feet).Find a space where you will have 1-2 meters (about 3 to 6 feet) of buffer around the outside of the arena.A standard-sized or larger arena (100x200 ft) will give you room for a full jump course and for advanced riders to practice longer gaits with more space.;
, If your arena is dry, you can always water it. However, if your arena has bad drainage, you will spend lots of time and money to ensure proper drainage. It can also be a danger – if your arena doesn’t drain well, the footing will be too soggy to ride without risking injury. Put your arena on a high point in your property. It will make a big difference!, If you are planning on using the ring for show purposes, you will need to make sure that there is a place where you can set up the judge’s table. Try to find a place where the sun will not be in the judge’s eyes during early morning shows and where the judge can see all parts of the arena. Typically, the judge will sit on one of the “long sides” of the arena.

, Walk through the area you’ve chosen for your arena. Look for large rocks, debris, or any unevenness in the footing that could affect your measurement of the area or cause a horse to trip or spook.

, Are there trees that could drop branches into the arena? Is there anything nearby that could fall and spook horses? Is there anything that could drain or wash into the arena during a storm? Carefully consider the area around your location to rule out potential hazards., It’s really important that you have an exact right angle for your dressage arena, because your arena will be rectangular. In order to make a rectangle, you must make a perfect right angle on the ground, for the perimeter for the rectangle. To do this, you should make a 3-4-5 triangle. By the Pythagorean Theorem, if the sides of a triangle are in the ratio 3:4:5 (or 6:8:10, etc.), then the angle formed by the “3” and “4” sides should be exactly 90 degrees.


Put one stake in the ground. This will be one part of the corner of your dressage arena.
Lay two stakes out in what looks like a right angle. With your measuring tape, measure out a distance of about 3 feet, perfectly in line with the stake. Mark the 3 foot place on the ground.
Do the same with the 4 foot mark on the other side of the right angle. Measure from the 3 foot marker to the 4 foot marker. It should be exactly 5 feet. If it is not, adjust the stakes so that the 3 foot and 4 foot markers are exactly 5 feet away from one another.

, The long side of your arena will be either 40 meters or 60 meters, depending on the size of arena that you want and/or need. If you are using the ring for more advanced purposes (higher level competition) or want the standard arena size, you should mark out 60 meters. If you do not have space for the standard size arena or plan to use your arena more casually, you could mark out 40 meters. Ask your trainer which is better for you. Use surveyor’s tape or a measuring wheel to mark out this distance from the first stake that you’ve used to create your right angle. Put another stake in the ground to signify this distance.Tie string between the two stakes and measure the distance again, to be sure.

, The short side of your arena will be 20 meters long, no matter which size of ring you’re building. Mark out 20 meters with surveyor’s tape or a measuring wheel and put another stake in the ground there.Tie string between the two stakes and measure the distance again, to be sure.

, Now you should use the other two stakes as your initial starting corners and measure out right angles again. You should also still tie string around each stake and remeasure the distances to make sure that they are correct.

, You can make a dressage arena out of many different materials, but you probably want to purchase the fencing online from a specialty equestrian retailer or order it through a tack shop. If you do not want to spend that much money, you could use a short, low-cost wooden fence. Dressage arenas typically are no taller than a foot or so.

, Make sure that the fencing is straight and lines up with the string you’ve tied around the stakes. Make sure that there is a gate or an opening so that horses can get in and out of the arena. This gate is typically on one (or sometimes both) of the short sides.

, You will need one letter in the middle of each short side. Use a measuring tape to measure 10 meters, to the middle of the short side, and then put something there to mark it (like a rock or a stake).


Next, measure where the other letters will go. On a standard arena, put a mark 6 meters from the short side, then another mark 12 meters from that mark. Put another mark 12 meters from that mark, and then another mark 12 meters from that one. Finally, put a mark 6 meters from the other short side. In total you'll have 5 marks for letters.
Put marks in these same places along the other long side and also along the center line. So, you should have marks for 17 different letters on a standard arena.
For a smaller arena, the process is similar. Still put a mark in the middle of each short side. Then, mark a place on the long side that is 6 meters from the short side. Then put another marker 14 meters from that marker, and then another marker 14 meters from that one, coming down the long side (this one should also be 6 meters from the other short side). In total there should be 3 markers on that long side.
Put marks in these same places along the other long side and also long the center line. So, you should have 11 different letters on a small arena.

, Letters in a dressage arena, which are used for the purpose of memorizing and executing patterns, are always in a specific pattern. They are also different for standard arenas and small arenas. Placing your letters in the right order is very important. You’ll need them in practicing and memorizing your patterns, which will give you confidence when you go to a show with similarly arranged letters.


The easiest way to place dressage letters is to look at a diagram of the arena size that you want. These diagrams are available easily online.
The letters for a standard dressage arena are in the pattern, if you are starting on the short side and moving counter-clockwise, A (on the short side), K, V, E, S, H (all on the long side), C (on the short side), M, R, B, P, F (all on the long side). Then, on the center line, moving away from A, there are D, L, X, I, G.The letters and placement are a little bit different for a small arena. Going counterclockwise, you should still place A in the middle of the short side, then K, E, H (all on the long side), C (in the middle of the other short side), then M, B, F (all on the long side), and then, going up the center line from A, D, X, and G.

Always allow your horse plenty of time, either before or after meals, to keep your horse feeling comfortable and happy.Feed at least three hours before exercise.
Wait for your horse to regain its normal breath rate and temperature before feeding after exercise.
Your horse may suffer from colic if he ate too close to exercising or heavy activity.

Walk is the very basic movement, and is often judged with scrutiny.,
Encourage the horse to walk by clicking your tongue and by putting pressure on the lead.",How to Train for a Western Showmanship Class1," To walk the horse, you should stand at the near side shoulder (left shoulder). You should try to get the horse to move off before you do, as this looks better in a show ring.;
, Once walking, you should be standing between the shoulder and neck.

"
"
Click you tongue to encourage the horse to move forward.,
Once jogging, let them jog out.,
Make sure you are standing at the shoulder of your horse, try not to drag the horse, as in competition the class is judged on the forward and ease of the movements.

,
When jogging with your horse keep your shoulders level and glide, it may feel funny but the judges like it.

",How to Train for a Western Showmanship Class2," The Jog is a hard pace as many horses resist against the chain, so it is best to start training using a normal rope or nylon halter and lead.

, Don't hold them back, as once they have established the jog you can then train them to shorten and lengthen their strides.

,,"
"
Stop or halt by stopping your forward movement and giving a slight pull and release of the lead.,
Determine the cue for halt.",How to Train for a Western Showmanship Class3," The horse should stop beside you. You can also command to halt and them walk into the halt, depending on the patterns.

, Some horses respond to a simply whisper of whoa, others a tug. Some stop when you stop moving. Experiment but ensure you allow enough time for the cue to sink in and be able to work.

An alternative way to start training is to put your hand on the chest and apply pressure. The horse should walk backwards slowly but with impulsion and forward movement.

"
"
This is by far the hardest thing to teach, as some horses get it and others don't.,
Train by allowing the horse to turn on the off side hind leg.,
Allow 5 to 10 minutes for one turn or pivot, as if you go slow, the horse is less likely to rush and confuse its self.",How to Train for a Western Showmanship Class5," The same method applies for backing, but instead of moving entirely back with 4 footfalls, only two are used, and then a degree of turning.

, In showmanship, the horses are placed higher if they pivot this way, however they do not get punished for pivoting on the hind near leg. If they pivot any other way points are taken off the score.

, As you progress, increase the pivot time until you can do it in a click of your fingers.

"
"
You want your horse not to back up when pivoting.",How to Train for a Western Showmanship Class6," You should pull slightly forward while walking towards your horse's neck. It took me 3 months to train my horse, and got Reserve Champion that year. We started by teaching the horse how to cross the legs over and not worry about the hind. To push the shoulder over use a hand or spur to push it. As you get better walk your horse out of a pivot that they move their hind legs. Start at small portions of the pivot to earn your trust in the horse that they know what they are supposed to do.

"
"
Halt the horse, and stand to the side with your toes facing 45 degrees at their toe.",How to Train for a Western Showmanship Class7," Getting another person to walk around the horse and you, change from side to side in front of the horses head. At this point it doesn't need to be accurate, just to allow the horse to get accustomed to the sudden changes of position. After about 6 changes, finish on the near side and then stand facing forward, and get the horse to walk off.

Before entering for a showmanship class, you need to ensure that you have the correct horse equipment and attire.,
For Western showmanship you will need:


A Western hat
A neck piece (girls may wear a necklace or a scarf, boys wear a scarf or a bolo tie, this is optional.),
For showmanship your horse will need:


A Western halter (usually silver-plated) and a leather lead with a chain.

,
Make sure that your horse is trained, if your horse isn't trained in Halter, then you will need to train or get a trained horse to compete with.,
Practice the basic maneuvers, these include Backing, Walking, Jogging, Stopping, Setting Up (your horse's feet are in a square), Pivoting (these include 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, and 360 degrees), and sometimes Pull-turning (the horse pivots towards you).

,
Clean your gear.,
Arrive at the show about 30 minutes before the ring opens, this way if you have car problems or need to do some touch ups you have time to do so.,
Study your pattern, this doesn't mean just glancing at it and deciding you'll watch the other competitors do it and copy them.,
Warm up your horse and yourself.,
Enter the ring with confidence and presence.,
Complete the pattern as studied, if someone does something different to what you studied, do as you have learned, they might have gotten confused or missed a step.,
At the end of the class, wait patiently and make sure you stand with confidence up to when your dismissed, the judge is still judging.",How to Compete in a Western Showmanship Class," This is a crucial part of the class; presentation is everything.;
,
A Western shirt (boys wear a plaid western shirt or a jacket and shirt, girls wear a slinky and vest, or a jacket, or a show suit.)
A Western belt and buckle (can be plain or ""blinged up"" with crystals or diamante.) The buckle may be plain or jeweled.
Show pants
Western boots (youth are permitted to wear jodhpurs in Australia). Spurs must not be worn, and incur elimination.

,, Training tips and steps can be found in How to train for a Western Showmanship Class if your horse is already trained in Halter, than you can progress to the next step.

,, This is a critical part of the competition, the judge will not only be watching you complete the pattern and handle the horse, but will be inspecting your presentation of the gear. Cleaning also means washing your shirts and pants, polishing your boots and cleaning your hat.

, This is also the time to fix your hair and for the girls, your make-up. This is a competition of presentation, looks and performance; make sure you look like you know what you're doing. That's half the battle.

, If they mess up a step, then you will do the same and therefore will be placed lower than if you did the pattern properly.

, About 15 minutes before your event, practice the pattern and pin-point where you may need to put a little more 'oomph' into your cues. Then rest your horse until about 5 minutes before you enter the ring. This allows your horse to warm up but not become stale.

, The idea is to be confident and move with purpose. If you move sluggish and lazily, then you will not place as high. The steward will direct you to where you are meant to stand, the pattern should state this.

, It is your responsibility to learn the pattern before you enter the ring.

, After the placings are announced and awards given, congratulate the other competitors and exit with a smile rather than a grin.

"
Get a broke horse.,
Bathe your horse a day or so before the show, so the natural oils can replenish the horse’s coat.,
Clip his legs, muzzle, face, ears and bridle path, and pull his mane to about three inches long.,
You will need to “bang” your horse’s tail, or cut it blunt across the bottom if you are showing a stock horse.,
If showing a stock breed, you must band your horse's mane.,
Brush your horse well with a soft brush and re-clip his face, muzzle, ears and bridle path if you need to.

,
Dampen a cloth with a mixture of rubbing alcohol and water, and run this over your horse’s body and face to get all the fine dust out.

,
Spray him with a shining spray, except on the saddle area.,
Brush your horse’s tail carefully and tie in a tail extension if you use one.,
The padding under your show saddle blanket should be sufficient to be comfortable to your horse, but make sure that you cannot see the ""under pad"" on the sides of the show blanket.

,
Saddle your horse.,
Don’t forget to clean your stirrups and girth, too.,
Pin your number to your saddle pad or to your show shirt.,
Spray your horse with fly spray and then more shining spray.,
Rub his muzzle, eyes, ears and bridle path with highlighter.

,
Get yourself ready.,
Your show shirt should be nicely fitted to allow the judge to see your upper body position.,
A belt buckle should be worn, and while award buckles are best, there are many attractive buckles available at western wear stores that would suffice.

,
Ladies hair should be pulled back, and put into a bun, or up in your hat, taking care that you have no ""fly aways."",
Wear colors that are complementary to your horse.,
To prepare to enter the ring, bridle your horse, tighten your cinch and mount.

,
Ride around the warm up ring, and practice all of the gaits you will be performing in the ring - walk, jog, lope, stop, and back.,
After your warm-up, you can dismount briefly if you wish, or have a helper to ""touch up"" your horse.,
If possible, don’t enter the ring with a bunch of other people at the same time.,
Sit upright, but not stiffly, look ahead and smile.,
Remember to have a good time.",How to Do Well in a Western Pleasure Class," Western Pleasure is NOT a class for hyper, bucking youngsters. The horse should move smoothly and slowly at all gaits (walk, jog, lope & rein back). He should not look choppy, artificial, or forced into a “frame”. This may be the trend right now, but the horse associations are working to fix that. Do not ruin your horse and train him to go exceedingly slow, with his head on the ground. These horses are not happy horses. Your horse should have his poll level with his withers, and very easy, flowing gaits, and he should carry himself on his hind end. He should turn, stop and back up with little or no pressure on the reins.;
, You may put ""clothes"" like a slicker hood (sleazy) and sheet on to keep him clean until show time.

, Or, you can leave it long and natural, if you desire. It is correct to shorten manes on stock breeds like Quarter Horses, Paints, and Appaloosas. Breeds like Arabians (and Half-Arabians), Morgans, and Saddlebreds must be shown with a long, natural mane.

, To bang it, have a helper hold your horse’s tailbone as he carries it in motion (most horses carry it a few inches away from their body). Cut the bottom of the tail straight across level with the bottom of the fetlock. If your horse’s tail is not long enough, you can bang it a little higher, or you can use a tail extension.

, Take a small section about the width of your little finger and wrap a rubber band around it. To make the band lay flat, pull only on the bottom hairs of the banded section. Make sure the band color matches your horse’s mane. Band tightly, but not too tightly. You want the mane to hang flat against the neck, not stick up over their crest or out to the side. Slicker hoods can be especially helpful in making the mane lay down, and it is often a good idea to band a horse the night before and then have him wear the hood all night so the mane will be flat in the morning. You will have to make some adjustments and re-tighten some of the bands in the morning, but you will not have a mane that sticks up.

,,, Be careful of using too much spray with products like Ultra, especially if you are showing in a dusty arena. It attracts dust and makes it stick to the horse. Show sheen repels dust, but should never be used on the saddle area because it will cause the tack to slide.

, Remember that artificial tails are illegal for breeds that are shown with natural manes and tails like Arabians, Morgans, and Saddlebreds. Comb a detangler through the tail so no tangles appear in the ring.

,, Your saddle should be carefully cleaned and all the silver shined, but do this at home before you get to the show by putting the saddle on a saddle rack. You can use a damp cloth and toothpaste or silver polish to remove all the dirt and grime from the silver. If it gets on the leather, just wipe it off. Leather should be cleaned with a product like Lexol, which is pH balanced to clean your leather without damaging it or leaving a residue. Condition the leather after cleaning it.

, Clean and polish your bridle.

, Make sure it is straight. If you put your number on your saddle pad, be sure that you have a number on EACH side of your horse. You may be disqualified if you have only one number on one side of the horse. Usually, people who show stock breeds put their numbers on the saddle pad, whereas people who show the saddle type breeds like Arabians, wear their numbers on their back.

, Sand his hooves smooth and apply two coats of clear polish for most hooves. If your horse has black hooves, you can first apply a coat of clear polish, then a black coat, and a finally, clear coat. Apply a hoof polish enhancer to make them shine.

,, Be sure your boots are polished and your chaps are clean. Ultrasuede chaps are machine washable, and ""slick-out"" chaps can be wiped with a baby wipe or leather wipe. Wear fitted pants under your chaps as jeans are bulky and out of style (for women). Your pants should be the same color as your chaps (for women), but men may wear blue jeans under and color of chaps, and sometimes will wear black jeans under black chaps.

, There are many styles to choose from and western style and fashion tends to change quite rapidly. Search the internet or ask around to find out about current trends, or check ebay for show clothes for sale (keeping in mind that some are for sale because they are out of style.) It is a good idea to match your belt color to your pants/chaps. A different color visually cuts you in half.

,, Long, curly or straight ponytails are acceptable in western pleasure as long as the hair is not bouncing as the rider moves. If your hat is a little loose or it is windy, put a piece of sticky, double-sided tape on your forehead and press the hat to it. Bobby pins stuck into the hat near the ears is also a good way to keep a hat on. If you don't have any sticky tape and the bobby pins won't do the job, you can spray your forehead with hairspray to make the hat stick. The best thing, however, is to have a hat that fits.

, Generally, horses that are bay, black, or grey for instance look best in ""jewel tones"" like red, blue, and purple. Horses that are sorrel, chestnut, or brown look best in ""earth tones"" like chocolate, sand, or rust.

,, Do not try to introduce anything new to your horse, as this may upset him. Work just as you do at home. If possible, ride in the competition ring before the class so your horse can have a chance to see the arena and will be less likely to become upset or spook in this new environment.

, Wipe off any dust and re-apply the hoof polish enhancer, shining spray, highlighter (if needed) and brush his tail again. Wipe his hooves off when they are dry and wipe your boots as well.

, Hang back a little (or go first) and find a good spot on the rail to show your horse to the judge.

, Remember to breathe. If your horse acts goofy, try to deal with the situation quietly, taking care that you are not affecting anyone else's ride. The judge might not see small mistakes if you don’t make a big deal of it and just quietly fix it. Be very aware of your position in the ring and do not get in anyone's way. Stay a good distance behind the horse in front of you, and always pass to the inside. If your horse is really acting up such as bucking, rearing, or bolting, go to the center of the ring and make him stand quietly until the class is over. Do not get mad, school, or hit your horse. Consider waiting to take a horse to a show that has the potential to blow up like that. You would be making a bad impression of yourself to everyone watching (and the judge).

, Shows should be a fun and positive experience for you and your horse. To help calm nerves about winning, set personal goals. Say, “I’m going to get the correct lead, and I’m not going to lean back as he departs for the lope.” Then, you can focus on accomplishing your own goals, instead of on winning that blue ribbon. But, if you followed these steps carefully, you may be on your way to winning that ribbon!

Arrive on-time or early.,
Make sure you and your horse are comfortable.,
Check your entries before you start grooming your horse or getting dressed.,
Check your patterns.,
Tack up your horse in the appropriate show gear.,
Dress yourself.,
Check your horse's tack by ensuring the saddle is on correctly and that all leather that is flat on horse is indeed flat.,
Study your patterns.,
Warm up before you begin practicing your patterns.,
Practice your patterns.,
Ensure that you have a bottle of water handy for between classes.,
Ride your patterns with confidence.,
Repeat step 4 and make sure after each class you have a drink of water.,
Smile, breathe and have fun.",How to Prepare at a Western Horse Show," Get to the show well in advance of your first class. Even better, arrive at the show before the first event is scheduled to start so if any classes are scratched, there will be no chance of you missing your first class.;
, Provide your horse with a small bucket of water and breakfast if you were not able to feed him prior to putting him in the trailer. If your horse is blanketed, remove any top layers and only leave the blanket closest to his coat. This will allow him to become familiar with the temperature at the show and he won't get a cold back. Keep travel boots on him to prevent his lower legs from becoming stained.

, This will allow you to check for any scratches or any changes to the program and you will get an idea of how long until your first and subsequent classes. If there have been a few scratches, note what classes.You may need to hurry your preparation time. However, if they are few and far between, then you may only need to button up on your horse.

, At smaller shows they may often post the patterns and work outs in the morning, however, at larger shows you may get them prior to the day of the show or in a goody bag. Make sure all your patterns are there. If you are missing a pattern, go straight to the entry secretary and ask about your patterns, if in doubt, ask anyway. Some patterns may be used for multiple classes, but make sure that you can count the appropriate number of patterns for the number of pattern classes you have. Usually these pattern classes include:


Showmanship
Hack (may be given to you during class)
Hunt Seat Equitation
Western Equitation
Western Horsemanship
Trail

, If it's a halter class, put your halter on your horse and use the nylon halter and a lead, over the show halter, to secure your horse to either the horse float while waiting or you can wait along ring side holding your horse. Do the same for English and Western, ensuring you have enough time to do a warm up and to do a safety gear check. Even if the Club or show doesn't do them, make sure that you do one.

, Get ready for the appropriate classes. Each class has different outfits, from jodhpurs for English to show pants and chaps for Western, as well as halter jackets and spurs for riding. The worst thing is trying to look for the missing spur right before your class. By making sure it's all there ready, either in boxes labeled for each class, or in a box for each type of item (clothing, boots, spurs, etc.) it will make it easier and far less stressful.

, Run a hand flat along your horse's side or face, ensuring that the hair won't pinch. When mounted, check your girth and if you are not sure about gear checking, either ask someone to check the main things for you or make sure you have it cleared up prior to the show.

, Make sure that you only study the pattern of your next class. If you begin studying more than one pattern, you may get confused and mix your patterns up. Make sure you understand the Key or Legend and ensure that all direction changes are accounted for. If there is a problem with a pattern, either speak to a fellow competitor and if they too are confused, go higher, perhaps to the Secretary or the Judge. If the problem is with the pattern, an announcement will be made. Some judges may make a mistake, whereas some judges use different terminology for movements. Clarify this prior to entering the ring, because once you're in there, you can not ask for assistance.

, You don't want to give your horse an excuse to misbehave. Generally start at a walk and do a few large circles of walk, then trot and then, if you have time a canter or a lope. Be sure to watch what direction or where others are going, and only go the speed the steward allows you to. Some shows only allow a jog or trot as the fastest pace in a warm up ring for safety reasons.

, If you have time to practice your patterns, make sure you only study the first few patterns. If you have halter in the morning, only study the halter events. Usually the show will have a break before any other styles of riding, so you will have time to practice the other English and Western events. Begin with reading the pattern, and imagine how the workout would look. At home you would have practiced circles and changes of direction, so all you have to do is put them together. All patterns begin with a walk, so begin walking your horse, when the pattern asks for a trot or a jog, pick up the right diagonal (if in English and pattern says to rise). If you are required to halt, rein back or pivot, make sure you practice these too. Most of the time, the walk, trot, jog, canter and lope are easy, but ensure you practice any directional changes, rein back, pivots and halts. Take note of the direction for any of these, a 360 degree pivot to the right means a full spin or yield. Check your forehand and hind pivots.

, Dehydration doesn't help you, your horse or your memory. Most of the time you can buy a bottle of water at the show, but it's always best to bring your own from home. Try freezing it overnight if the show is during the spring or summertime, this way, you will be ensured of a refreshing cold drink. If it's in the colder months, perhaps take a bottle of tap water, that is not frozen or even take a flask with tea or hot chocolate. Coffee is not the best thing unless you really need it to wake up.

, Try not to watch a lot of riders prior to your go, at times you may get confused as they may be doing a more advanced pattern, other times, they may be doing the same pattern as you but may have done it wrong and therefore may make you doubt your practice session. Go with what you have practiced, and if for some reason you have not gotten it right this time, try again and learn from your mistakes.

, Not too much, or your stomach makes horrible sounds when you trot, but enough to replenish yourself. Make sure that you also provide your horse with small sips of water after a few classes and at lunch and any breaks. Only feed small amounts of food unless it's a lunch break. And only provide less than half a bucket right before a class. Make sure you also eat when you get the chance. Keeping your fluids up, as well as keeping your stomach fed keeps your memory active.

, Showing isn't about winning or losing, but it's about completing personal achievements and having a good time riding and showing.

Pick the right horse.,
Hire a trainer.,
Recruit supporters.",How to Barrel Race1," Your horse is the most important piece of your barrel racing team--other than you, of course. You and your horse should be equal partners and work together to learn to succeed at barrel racing. Some horses are more capable of becoming barrel horses, so you'll want to choose your partner carefully.The horse's health is the most important consideration. A potential barrel horse should have legs that are straight and a back that is strong.
If the horse has raced previously, make sure that his legs are free from external scars or bumps.
It's a good idea to have a vet examine any horse you are considering buying.
If the horse has previously worked with a trainer, try to contact him to learn about the horse's capabilities.
Consider the horse's stamina. A barrel horse should be able to keep up a fast pace for 6-8 miles at least 3 days a week.;
, It is possible to train for barrel racing on your own. However, as with any sport, you will likely be more successful if you hire a coach. An experienced trainer can work with you and your horse to improve your skills and learn to work comfortably together as a team.Look for a trainer who has experience barrel racing. Before you commit to working with one another, ask him about his prior record with racing.
Make sure you are compatible. Do you want a trainer who is very stern and regimented? Or would you work better with someone whose style is more flexible? These questions can be answered during your first meeting with potential trainers.
Look for a trainer with a keen eye. He should be able to spot mistakes from across the arena.

, Barrel racing can be very time consuming. It is fun, but also tiring. You might also have to regularly travel for competitions. If possible, recruit friends and family to be part of your ""team"". You'll have more fun if you have a cheering section at all of your events.


You might also need someone to help you care for your horse. Horses need daily attention, so that they can be properly fed, exercised, and groomed. Before committing to barrel racing, ask your family if they are willing to help out.
Make sure that you have a good vet to help you care for your horse. Look for a vet that is patient, caring, and has experience caring for barrel horses.

Improve your skills.,
Get the right attitude.,
Train your horse.,
Do specific drills.,
Practice the patterns.",How to Barrel Race2," Once your team is in place, it's time to start getting ready to barrel race. Your basic riding skills are the most important part of the foundation for becoming a good barrel racer. Take some time to work on becoming a more competent rider.


Work on the basics. Practice riding in a straight line and traveling in a circle in both directions.
Practice stopping and backing with your horse.
Practice your hand-rein habits. Remember to have soft hands rather than sawing at your horse with the reins.

, You will also need to get mentally prepared to race. Having a good attitude is one of the keys to success in barrel racing. Most importantly, you should work to increase your confidence.Confidence comes from practice and knowledge. The more time you spend working with your horse, the more confident you will feel. Listen when your trainer gives you feedback so that you can increase your knowledge.
A good attitude also means that you are diligent. Make sure to set aside adequate time each week to work with your horse. Ideally, you should enthusiastically train at least three days a week.

, Your horse needs to work just as hard as you. Remember, he is your partner, so it's important that he learn to improve his racing skills, too. Tire circles are one of the most effective exercise to use to train a barrel horse.


Place a barrel in the center of a circle of tires. The tire circle should be about 40-50 feet in diameter, with the tires placed 8-10 feet apart.
Work on circling the barrel from inside the tire barrier. As your horse improves, you can tighten the barrier.

, You and your trainer can work together to put together effective drills that can help you and your horse improve. For example, you can practice straight-line lead changes. This exercise is especially helpful if your horse favors one lead.


Lope for 5 strides on one lead, trot for a few paces, then switch leads. This technique can also be used to help you shorten or lengthen your horse's stride.
Another effective exercise is changing pace in a circle. You can use this technique to help your horse learn speed cues from changes in your body position.
Practice demonstrating to your horse that sitting lower in your hips and dropping your rib cage means ""slow down"", while leaning forward and tightening your inner thighs means ""speed up"".

, In barrel racing, the horse and rider must make a clover-leaf pattern around 3 barrels. The barrels are typically placed approximately 100 feet apart. The rider has the choice of going around the left or right barrel first.


Practice riding patterns around the three barrels. As you circle each barrel you will be leaning in towards the barrel.
Determine whether you and your horse work better (faster) going to the left or right first.

"
"
Warm up your horse.,
Sit correctly.,
Pick the pocket.,
Use your cues.,
Improve your record.",How to Barrel Race3," In order to keep your horse healthy, you need to warm him up before each race, the same way you warm him up before each workout. Give him plenty of time to warm up his muscles. Walk him, and give him a chance to run a little if he needs to.


Make sure to cool your horse down after the race. Warm up and cool down are critical for keeping your horse healthy.

, Your saddle position is one of the most important components in riding a successful race. As you go around a barrel, make sure to keep your rear end and your hips solidly in the middle of the saddle. This will help you maintain your balance as your horse picks up speed, and will keep you from pulling on the reigns to stay balanced.


Make sure that you keep your core tight. This will help you stay upright and in control. Your upper body actually shouldn't move much.
Maintain plenty of pressure in the stirrups. This will keep your body from moving up and down and distracting your horse.

, In barrel racing, ""the pocket"" is the area directly in front of and surrounding the barrel. This is the area where your horse will reduce speed in order to make a tight turn. Keep your eye on each pocket as you approach. Horses tend to run where their riders are looking, so this will keep him on track.After you circle a barrel, focus your eyesight on the next pocket.
When you enter the pocket, use your body cues to signal your horse to slow down.

, ""Cues"" are how you communicate with your horse. Giving him cues with your hands is one of the best ways to help him learn to speed up, slow down, and turn. Most barrel racers ride with two hands, meaning you will hold one rein in each hand.When you are circling a barrel, use your inside hand to steer your horse around the barrel. Pull the rein back towards your hip.
Use your legs to cue your horse between barrels. Squeeze your inner thighs and bump with your heels is he is too slow.

, Once you have learned to barrel race, your next step is to become faster. Often, a second or two is the difference between winning and losing this event. The more time you spend with your horse, the better you will learn to communicate. This will help you work better and faster together.It's important to train together, but it's also important to enjoy your time with your horse. Take time to go on trail rides with him.
Keep practicing. Work on the strength of your muscles and your horse's.

Create a fact sheet all about horses.,
Be realistic.,
Consider how the horse will be paid for.,
Develop a convincing argument for why you deserve to have a horse.,
Make sure you truly want a horse before you ask.,
Start in stealth.,
Prove to your parents how grown up you are and how responsible you are.,
Consider asking a close relative who is onside to also come and discuss getting a horse with your parents.,
Find a suitable time to talk to your parents about buying a horse.,
Tell your parents that you'd like to own a horse.,
Make a small presentation.,
Tell them that you know that owning a horse is an expensive exercise.,
Ask them to kindly think about your request.,
Deal calmly with a no.,
Deal calmly with a yes.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Buy a Horse," This should include such information as when horses need to be fed, how to ride them, their ancestral history and general facts.;
, Is a horse compatible with your lifestyle? Realize that horses are expensive, they require constant care and a large space to keep them in. You can't keep one in the backyard of a suburban house. Also consider who will benefit from the purchase––if your siblings also want to ride, then you've already got a stronger argument. If one of your parents is also horse-mad, this too will work in your favor.

, If this isn't coming from your own money, your argument will need to include why your parents should fork out the cost of a horse and its upkeep. It's a good idea to have a list of the things you'll do to raise money and help to keep the horse down the track.

, This argument should cover:


How the horse will be funded. For example, you'll start babysitting, pet sitting, walking dogs, doing extra chores, whatever you can do to start making some money.
How the horse will be cared for.
How the horse will be used.

, If this is just a passing whim and you've no real idea of the work involved in caring for a horse, you might end up not looking after it properly.

, Reveal your love for horses in everything you do each day. This lays the groundwork for your parents, who will already have been exposed to your horse-loving ways prior to the discussion. Make it clear that horses are all you think about (getting pictures, putting up posters, drawing them, etc.).


Ask if you can start taking horseback riding lessons, and start watching horse races and shows on TV. Show your parents that you're really interested.
Bring up the topic of horses casually. But don't whine about it otherwise that will prove you are not responsible and grown up enough to look after a horse.

, Do this by undertaking your chores without being asked, completing homework on time and keeping your bedroom tidy.


Take care of existing pets to show that you do care and are responsible enough.

, If so, have this person available when you seek to persuade your parents.

, Choose a time when they're not busy and there is time for a good discussion.

, Then let them know that you are aware of the responsibilities involved and that you'd like to give them a presentation on why buying a horse is a good idea for your family. You can give them your fact sheet as well.

, Explain the reasons that owning a horse make sense. For example, it's exercise and it will teach you (and perhaps siblings) responsibility, etc. If you want to show how serious you are about getting a horse, then research all the pros and cons of getting a horse and summarize it in a speech, report, poster, etc., and present it to your family.


Tell them that you won't ever ask for expensive toys and clothes because horses are expensive and your parents will need money if they are going to buy you a horse.

, Set out how you will help pay for it. As well as buying a horse, explain the costs of boarding fees, veterinarian fees, food, accessories, etc. and how you expect these will be covered.

, Suggest that they get back to you in a couple days (sound as grown up as possible), after they've had a chance to think it over.


Don't keep pestering them and whining abut it. This will just show them you're childish and not responsible enough for a horse.

, If your parents say no, ask for a clear reason. If they say, ""Because I said so!"", then ask them why they said so. Once you get a reason out of them, then start researching ways to fix the problem. Maybe they said, ""because we don't have any room for a horse."" The solution would be to board your horse at a nearby stable. Find places to board your horse near you and tell you parents about it.

, If they agree, be enthusiastic but don't leave it all up to them to do the work. Do some research on where to purchase the horse from. Show them this and ask for their help in making a decision.

Consider his breeding and pedigree.,
Many barns and breeders use prefixes for horses they breed.,
Know the traditions observed when naming horses.,
Come up with an original name.,
Fill out the registration application.,
Note when the registered name of a horse is set.",How to Name a Horse1," Often, breed registries have rules or guidelines for the registered names of horses. Run an online search for any rules that might govern the naming of your type of foal. (For rules on naming a thoroughbred racehorse, see Method Three).;
, Don't run the risk of using their name without permission! Horses' registered names may be derived from those of their sire and dam. You can run an online source for registered horse names.

, Consider taking the registered name of your horse from the registered names of the horse's parents. In horse breeding, lineage means a lot. Of course, naming your horse after his mom or dad could also have sentimental value.Cabot French Pepper and KVA Hi Time, for example, may lead to a foal named SP Peppertime (in this case, 'Cabot,' 'KVA,' and 'SP' are all prefixes used exclusively by the breeders for their foals).

, If you don’t particularly care about deriving a name from your foal’s parentage, consider coming up with your own name. Some factors you should consider when naming your horse include appearance, personality, and what you are hoping your horse will do.


Appearance: Does your horse have a unique marking, or a beautiful color worth naming him after? For a horse with a white streak down his forehead (known as a blaze) you might consider naming him Wild Fire or When Lightning Strikes.
Personality: Is your horse affectionate, wild, or just a tad mean? A nice horse could be named Honey, a wild one named Midnight Madness, and a mean one named GrumpsMcGee.
Occupation: Is your horse going to race? Get featured in parades? Give kids rides? Think about what your horse will do. If you are racing your horse, give her an attention grabbing name like Dream Supreme.

, If you are a stallion owner, you will be receiving a registration application in the mail when you breed your stallion. If you don’t have one of these applications, you can find the downloadable version online. The information you will need to know to fill out this form includes:


Date foaled
Breeding method
Embryo transfer date & number
Dam's name and/or registration number
Current breeding reports
Foal description including 5 photos
Six foal name choices
Other foal information
Tax ID or social security number

, This is when the horse is registered with the breed organization; be careful not to change a horse's registered name if he already has one-- most organizations frown upon this.

"
"
Look at the horse's registered name.,
Get to know your horse.,
Draw inspiration from movies, books, or TV shows.,
Let your horse help you decide.,
Visit a baby names website.",How to Name a Horse2," Many horses will receive their barn name from a shortened version of their registered name. Try different ways of shortening your foal’s registered name. Pick something that is easy to say.


For example, 'ABC A Hot Summer Night' might be shortened to Night or Summer.

, Observe his behavior to decide on possible names. Is he a bucking bronco? Does he love carrots? Don't feel limited to typical human names; horses often receive rather unique nicknames such as 007, Chubby, and BB.

, Perhaps you have a favorite movie horse that you’ve always loved (like the Horse of a Different Color in the Wizard of Oz). Run some searches on famous show horses, or horses that have played a part in history.


For instance, the horse Paul Revere rode on his midnight ride was named Brown Beauty. Sampson was the name of the tallest horse ever recorded, and Beau was John Wayne’s horse in the movie True Grit.

, Horses often gain a barn name for themselves - a nickname, for example, could result in a barn name, or a silly thing he does. Try coming up with a name that fits his personality or appearance - ""Snuggles"" for a friendly horse, or ""Blaze"" for a horse with a blaze.

, Even though they're meant for humans, you might find an interesting name for your horse there! Baby name books are another option. Most importantly, use your imagination! Don't disregard silly ideas; after all, it's your horse.

"
"
Do not pick a name that exceeds 18 letters.,
Avoid names that may be considered vulgar and offensive.,
Know what other categories of names should be avoided.,
Do not consider naming your horse after historic victors.,
Come up with a name that sounds good when yelled by hundreds of adoring fans.,
Be prepared to offer an explanation of your horse’s name if its not super apparent.",How to Name a Horse3," In the case of thoroughbred names, spaces and punctuation marks count as letters so you will old be able to have a total of 18 characters. For example, ThereAndBackAgain! is an acceptable name because it has 18 characters, but There And Back Again! is not because it has 21 characters (including spaces)., While this might seem obvious, what might not be vulgar or offensive to you might be offensive to someone else. Double check that the name you pick out does not have any bad connotations that are offensive to religious, political, or ethnic groups, or that are vulgar in anyway.


For example, The Great Farter might be a funny name to you, but could be found vulgar by others, or might be taken as an offensive dig at God.

, Thoroughbred racehorses are not allowed to have names that are all initials; they cannot have names that are clearly promoting a commercial or artistic cause; and they cannot be named after a living person unless there is a written confirmation from that person saying it is okay.

, Any horse that has won a major race will have his or her name permanently retired. However, other names of horses that have not won major races can be recycled.


For example, you cannot name your racehorse Seabiscuit, though you could potentially try naming your horse Seabisquick or some other play off of a famous horse’s name.

, If you want your racehorse to be a star, you’ll need a name that fans (and gamblers) can get behind. For this reason, it may be better to pick out a shorter name, though catchy names aren’t bad either. There’s something very charming about chanting the name Ruffian (which is probably why Ruffian is racing’s greatest filly).

, The Jockey Club, which is the organization charged with recording and approving the names of racehorses, may require you to explain the name if its not very clear.


For example, the 1977 Triple Crown winner, Seattle Slew, was named after the owners’ hometowns--Seattle, and the word for a swamp which in Florida is called a ‘slew’."
"
If you want to have your very own horse, you've got to have enough money to purchase one and buy the essential items and care.,
There's no point buying a horse if you have nowhere to keep him!,
If you are a beginner horse-owner, be careful if you want to get a horse from a rescue centre.",How to Own a Horse1," Be sure you know that you will be spending at least £2,000/$1,835 at first, then roughly £120/$184 a month after that (per horse), depending on livery costs and how much you want to spend pampering them. Horses are living creatures and need a lot of care and attention. Make sure you're responsible enough and have the time to take care of one.;
, Buy some land near to where you live or rent a place for your future friend at some nearby livery stables. Remember, always check out the place before you finalise any details. Broken fence posts, rusty nails and steep ditches that are partial to getting waterlogged can be hazards to not only your horse but you as well.

, Some of the horses may have been mistreated so they may react badly or dangerously to certain things or need special care. Though, if you are experienced, it is better to buy a rescued horse than one in advertisements. Make sure you know what breed and type of horse you want and what event you want to ride in. You might not want to ride lots of events, maybe you're getting a horse for a pet to just take out on trails and the like. Also, pick a breed that is capable of what skills you need them to learn.

Congratulations on buying your horse!,
Once your horse has settled in, time to really start having fun!,
It is not recommended to ride your horse until he has been in his new home at least 2 weeks, but you could maybe take him in the arena and lunge him to give him exercise every day you care for him.,
You don't always have to ride your horse when you go places together!",How to Own a Horse2," You may want to keep it nice and slow for the first few days, maybe just sitting with your horse and talking to him. You could show him his grooming supplies and tack so they're not so scary as they could be when you first bring them out. It's also the perfect time to name/rename him if you want, because his personality will eventually start to show.

, Gather all his equipment, you should have already bought the grooming products, appropriate tack, feed, hay etc. Groom him, give him a wash if it's a nice, warm day. Take time to make him look really beautiful for his first proper day between you two, as this is the day where your horse will probably start trusting you and making a good bond. It is recommended staying there all day until he's turned out or stabled for the night so you're around him as much as possible, however don't neglect your other responsibilities and forget about the horse!

, When it's time to start riding, find a riding teacher/instructor who will help you two get to know each other. Ask him/her for recommendations on what you should do as a starter.

, Give him a break, and with the head-collar and lead rope go for a walk. It's a really great way to create a bond and a good way to explore new places before taking to the saddle. Just remember your mobile (on silent!) and possibly a map: don't get lost!

"
"
Make sure to start tracking your horse's weight as soon as possible.,
Make sure you care for your horse at least every two days otherwise he may start to get lonely and may lose your bond.",How to Own a Horse3," If you find that he's starting to put on excessive weight, try riding him more and feeding him less while still making sure he's getting enough nutrients. If it's spring he's gaining weight because of the new grass coming through, consider keeping him stabled for a week or so. However if you do this you'll have to ride/lung him ideally once or twice every day. He's still got energy and needs to burn it, plus this will help him lose weight. On the other hand, if he's losing a considerable amount of weight, review how much you're feeding him and add more. If it's already a large amount, your horse could have a health problem, so get the vet out as soon as possible.

, Have fun with your new horse and always remember this golden tip: 'There's no such thing as a bad horse, just a bad rider.' Horses are living creatures just like us. They have the potential to seriously injure or even kill you, but will trust you and love you if you trust and love them back. So never be cruel or mistreat your horse!

Make sure the horse has proper shelter at all times.,
Provide bedding material for a more comfortable night's sleep.,

Make sure that important papers are in a safe and accessible place.",How to Look After a Horse," Your horse needs to have access to shelter throughout the year. This means dry, safe, and comfortable protection from rain, wind, snow, as well as from heat and biting insects.Shelter can mean anything from a windbreak, a shed, or a clean and dry run-in area of a barn.
You can also board your horse at a stable. This can cost anywhere from $100 to $500 a month depending on the type of stable (simple pasture boarding tends to be less expensive). Sometimes you can do chores around the barn in exchange for cutting down on the cost of boarding.;
, Although horses can sleep while standing up, they get much better sleep lying down, which requires adequate bedding. The bedding needs to be kept clean so that it doesn't cause problems with the horse. When you put new bedding in the stall, you should only fill half of the stall with bedding.


Straw is the inexpensive choice. It's also warm, and comfortable, but can contain fungal spores which can make your horse sick, so be sure you're monitoring your horse's health.
Wood shavings (dust free) are sometimes more expensive but can be a good option, because they are clean and hygienic and your horse won't eat them (thus not ingesting anything dangerous or harmful to them).
Hemp has started to grow in popularity, because you don't have as much trouble with fungal spores as straw.

, worth of food every day. Horses have relatively small stomachs and rather delicate digestive systems, so they tend to nibble and graze through the day, rather than eat one or two specific meals.You will want to feed them one half bale of greenish-colored hay, which will be approximately two percent of their body weight. The bale can be grass or alfalfa, or even a mix.
Supplement the half bale with grains, oats, or sweet feed twice a day. It's best to feed them around the same time each day.
Don’t feed them yellow, dusty, moldy, smelly hay or hay with fine dust, flakes or clumps of plant matter. This can cause colic and respiratory issues.

, Horses need minerals (which they get from salt) to help keep their electrolytes up. Electrolytes help manage the production and secretion of sweat, saliva, intestinal tract fluids, urine and mucus, the function of their nerves and their heart, as well as maintenance of their hydration systems.


While a salt block can be a good idea, not all horses will use one, even if they have a craving for salt. If your horse doesn't seem interested in the salt block, you can also add a couple tablespoons of salt to a horse's feed to make sure they're getting the right minerals.

, Horses need at least eight gallons of water each day. The water you supply should be fresh and clean. This means you'll either have to refill buckets regularly or make sure that a trough is cleaned out. Try to clean whatever water receptacle you do use at least once a week so that nothing nasty starts growing.If you use a watering bucket be prepared to refill that bucket at least twice a day.
Your best option is probably a watering trough supplied by a pipe, because then you don't have to deal with the water yourself. The pipe can freeze in winter, however, so make sure you pay attention to its care.

, Horses need space to wandering around in. They also need to be able to graze throughout the day. This may require you to plant your own pasture or to make sure you know what the pasture is like at the place you're stabling your horse.


Make sure that you're planting the right grasses. This depends on your area, the climate, and the time of year. If you're not sure about something make sure that you ask your local veterinarian.
Check for holes so that your horse doesn't hurt themselves. You also want to make sure that the fencing is good, that there are no holes for the horse to get injured or escape through. Wire is a good fencing material, but make sure not to use barbed wire, which can cause severe injury to horses.

, Mucking means cleaning. You have to remove the droppings from the bedding with a shovel and wheelbarrow and level the bedding. Make sure that the place you dump the droppings can't be smelled from the barn or stable area.


If horse is stabled you have to clean the stable at least three times a day.
Remove soiled bedding and once you’ve disinfected the floor, replace with clean, fresh bedding.

, If your horse is stabled you will need to groom them daily to maintain their healthy coat. You will need to disentangle their mane and tail and gently pick out any burs that might have formed.With a currycomb loosen dried mud or ground-in dirt. Start by using a stuff brush, then finish offer with a softer brush. Also be careful and use a softer grooming tool with your horse's head and the bony areas of their legs.
Give your horse a bath on a warm day. Make sure to use anti-fungal shampoo. Since the water repelling oils in your horse's coat are removed during bathing, you will need to bathe them when there won't be rain, or you'll have to put a waterproof blanket or sheet on them before turning them out.
Comb the mane gentle using a wide-toothed plastic comb. If there are any bad tangles make sure that you unpick them with your fingers. Using scissors will make a mess that takes months to grow out. Avoid pulling on tangles, because this will thin and shorten a horse's mane and tail.

, Your horse needs to be exercised everyday. If you can't get to it, make sure that the horse has the option to walk in a field, or you have someone else come and exercise them.


A horse needs space to walk and relax in to supplement the exercise you give them when you ride them. This is why having a pasture area is so important.

, Horses can easily develop problems with their feet, especially if they aren't being properly cared for. Make sure that they are being picked daily to get rid of any rocks or objects that might bruise their feet or cause thrush (a bacterial infection). You will also need to get a farrier (a blacksmith) to trim your horse's feet.


For shod horses (ones that have shoes) get their feet trimmed every six weeks.
For unshod horses get their feet trimmed every eight weeks.

, This is called ""floating a horse's teeth."" This is incredibly important, because teeth can become sharp and make chewing painful so a horse will refuse to eat. You'll need to have a veterinarian do this to your horse at least once a year.


Inspect your horse's mouth frequently so that you don't miss any signs of problems. Check to see if there are any sharp edges. Nasal discharge, coughing, and dropping food out of their mouth can also be signs that there is an oral problem that needs seeing to.

, You absolutely must have a veterinarian check your horse at least yearly. A vet will do things like give them inoculations, de-worm them, and look after their overall health. If you don't get your horse checked out it can lead to bigger problems down the road.


Your horse should get twice a year inoculations for parasite control: influenza, Rhinopneumonitis, eastern and western strains of encephalomyelitis, and tetanus.
Have the vet test and deworm horse periodically. Some things you can do to cut down on the probability of worms, or of them spreading: avoid having too many horses on too little land, try to have rotating pastures, and remove feces regularly.

, It's important to make sure that your pasture is free of anything poisonous to horses. If you're taking your horse out on riding paths, make sure you know what to look out for. If you suspect that your horse has eaten something bad, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.


Some spring and summer horse hazards: wilted maple leaves, black walnut (for example: as shavings in bedding), oak, yew, rose laurel, rhododendron, azalea, blister beetles (more common in the Midwest).

, You want to practice getting your horse accustomed to strange things like trailers and halters before you have a problem where you need to get your horse trailered quickly.Make sure that your horse is accustomed to being handled by people other than you. In the event of an emergency you might have to leave the care of your horse to someone else.

, You want to know who exactly you need to contact if there is a problem (your horse is sick, your barn is on fire, those types of things).


Knowing the layout of your area (such as your farm) makes it easy to direct emergency responders to the area of crisis and means you know exactly where to move your horse or horses in the event of an emergency (such as a fire).

, You want to be in contact with the people who might be able to help if something goes wrong and who can disseminate information in a quick manner.


This can help spread information quickly, especially of things like infections and diseases being spread among the horse population.
Get helping hands when needed. The more people you have on your contact list, the more people will be able to get to you quickly if you need helping hands.

, You absolutely do not want to have to go digging through your records to find your vet's phone number when your horse is having a crisis.


Make sure that you have your equine veterinary records in a safe, but available place.
Always keep the phone numbers for your vet, and for emergency services, and so on in a handy and easily accessible place.

, Most people will greet a horse by stroking his nose or face, but this is not the proper way to do it, unless the horse knows you very well and doesn't mind you touching his face.

Owning a horse is like taking care of a small child, and the costs associated with it can be very high. If you are looking to get a starter horse to help you get better at riding, you may end up spending $5,000 USD or less. If you would like a more mature horse and have aspirations to be a professional rider, the horse may cost much more.You should look up the costs of horses at stables in your area. You may be able to get a horse for $3,000-$4,000, depending on the horses available.You may also be able to work out payment in monthly installments, where you would pay anywhere from $200-$400 a month for the ownership of the horse.
If you already ride at a stable and have a horse trainer, you should discuss your options with your trainer. Ask your trainer how much a specific horse will cost you. Your trainer may also be able to recommend that you get a starter horse, or a horse that is more mature, depending on your riding level.
A free horse is never free. Don’t get tricked into this sales pitch.;
, Once you own your horse, you will need to factor in where you are going to board your horse and how much boarding will cost. You will pay a stable or a boarding facility to board your horse. The rates can range depending on the market in your area and if you opt for full care, where the facility feeds and cleans the stall for you, or self-care, where you do all the feeding and cleaning yourself.Boarding a horse at a facility with full care can cost around $200-$500 a month, depending on the market in your area. But if you opt for self care at a boarding facility, you may end up paying only $100 a month.Make sure you look at boarding facilities that are no more than 30 minutes away from your home, if possible. This will make it easier for you to get to and from the facility on a daily basis. You should then ask the facility questions, such as ""What is your full care option like and how much does it cost?"" and ""How much would self care cost at your facility?""
You should also ask the boarding facilities what their pastures are like and how long the horses get turned out for and when (night or day). Look at the stall size and consider how much stall you are paying for. Some stalls you can get are indoor/outdoor, meaning the horse can walk outside when he chooses or can be shut into his stall.
If you have land, such as on a farm or a large lot where you can keep the horse, as well as a barn or stable, your boarding costs may be much lower. However, this means that you will have to do much of the care and feeding of the horse yourself.

, You should also plan for the cost of food for your horse, as a huge portion of your budget will go to food. Your horse will need to eat about 1.5% to 2.5% of its body weight each day in hay and grain. Though hay and grain are not very expensive, you will need quite a bit of it to keep your horse well-fed. You should budget about $1,000 to $2,000 a year for the horse’s feed.You will need to also consider the cost of bedding for your horse. If you opt for full care at a boarding facility, bedding may be covered. If you do self care, you may need to provide hay for bedding for your horse, which will be an added monthly expense.
You should also consider the cost of supplements for your horse, as your horse may need to take certain supplements to stay healthy. Your veterinarian will recommend supplements for your horse, which can be expensive depending on the type of supplements your horse requires.

, When you purchase your own horse, you will need to invest in riding equipment like a saddle, a bridle, and grooming supplies. You will also need to pay for ongoing expenses like fly spray, grooming supplies, and horse blankets.If you currently have a horse trainer or instructor, you should discuss the costs of this equipment and supplies. You should opt for equipment that is high quality and long-lasting, as this will cut down on your expenses later.
Look into options at resale shops or online. You may be able to find gently used tack for much cheaper than buying it new. You can also wait for sales from online companies to stock up on tack at a discounted price.

, You should also factor in the care and maintenance of the horse, including the cost of farrier or hoof care. Your horse’s hooves should be trimmed and shod every four to six weeks. This can range from $350 to $1,500 for the farrier, depending on their skill level, the frequency of their visits, and how long it takes them to shoe your horse. This is in addition to the cost of applying shoes, replacing any damaged shoes, and purchasing special shoes to help with health problems.You should consider the cost of vet care for your horse. This includes the cost of check-ups, vaccinations, tests, deworming, and care for minor injuries. Vet care can average at least $1,000 per year, depending on the needs of your horse.
You should also factor in the cost of emergency care for your horse in the event of an emergency or major injury. The cost of this care could be high, depending on the nature of the injury.
You should also consider whether you want to invest in insurance for your horse. There are a number of companies that provide health insurance at a monthly fee, like human health insurance, that can help provide protection for some of these emergency situations and preventative care costs.

, If you are opting for self care of the horse at a boarding facility or on a home lot, you will need to set aside at least two hours a day, every day, for care and maintenance. You must be willing to commit to daily care, as you cannot simply take a vacation or skip a day when you feel lazy. Your horse will be depending on you for daily water and food as well as attention and care.You should consider your current schedule and determine if you have the time to spend two hours a day at least with your horse. This means you may need to wake up several hours early in the morning to care for the horse or spend time after school or work caring for the horse.
A horse is a pet that you need to go and spend time with in it’s home, unlike a dog that you spend time with without leaving your home. This will drastically change your daily schedule.

, You should also consider how often you plan to ride the horse and what your goals are as a rider. Are you an avid rider with enough time to ride the horse six days a week? Or are you a more recreational rider, with only enough time to ride the horse twice a week? At a minimum, you should try to ride your horse two to three times a week. You should make sure you have enough time to commit to a riding schedule where your horse gets enough exercise and personal attention.You cannot simply skip out on riding your horse for months at a time, as your horse will only do well and stay healthy if you give her love and attention. You will need to have enough time to ride her and bond with her as her owner on a consistent basis.
You could pay someone at the barn/boarding facility to come ride your horse on the days you cannot or when you’re out of town. However, this is yet another cost you need to factor into your overall budget.

, You should also consider the time you will need to commit to training the horse. Even if you buy a horse who has been broken and is ready to ride, you will need to commit time and money to doing basic training with the horse. You may hire a trainer to work with you and your horse so you have a set training plan in place.You may want to talk to a horse trainer and determine the time required to train a particular horse breed or a horse type, like a starter horse. You may ask, ""What kind of time would I need to devote to training my horse?"" and ""How many times a week should I train my horse?""
Make sure you factor in training time with riding time as well as time for care and maintenance. Taken all together, you may be looking at quite a bit of time spent at the stable with your horse every day.
Different levels of trainers come at different price points. Depending what your goals are as a horse owner, the trainer fees can get very steep very quickly.

, Horses can live up to 20 to 30 years, and they should be treated like long-term responsibilities. You should be prepared to commit years of care and attention to your horse, much like you would a long-term partner. This means you will need to show up and work hard to provide for your horse and keep her happy and healthy.The financial commitments as well as the time commitments means you should not enter into the purchase of a horse lightly. You will need to learn to balance the responsibilities of owning a horse with your other life responsibilities, such as your schooling, your personal relationships, and your career.

, You should be prepared for other long-term responsibilities of owning a horse, such as caring for the horse if she gets badly injured or becomes lame. Sometimes horses get injured and can no longer jump or trot like they used to. The horse may also develop a health issue that leads to lameness. As the horse’s owner, if it then your responsibility to decide how to best support your horse and your needs as a rider. Though you can sell or trade your horse in, you should also consider other options as an owner. If your horse becomes ill, injured, or lame, you should discuss your options with your horse’s trainers and your veterinarian, and try to find a solution where the horse is cared for and you are still able to pursue your riding goals.
If you find yourself in a situation where you need to give your horse up, discuss this with your veterinarian as they will know of retirement facilities, special needs barns, and people who are equipped to help out pasture pets. They will best be able to point you in the right direction and help you find the best solution for your lame horse.

, If you are still not sure if you are ready for the long-term responsibilities of horse ownership, you may decide to try leasing a horse first. You may do a full or partial lease for six months, where you pay a fixed fee for riding time on a horse. You may start with a lease so you can get a better sense of the time and financial costs of having a horse.If you feel you need more “horse time,” you may be ready to move forward with owning a horse. Leasing a horse for a period of time can help you realize if you are prepared for horse ownership.
Leasing a horse is also a great way to divide the responsibilities of horse ownership with another person. That way the horse gets double the love and you get a horse to ride.

Consider the following before choosing a horse.,
Decide whether you want a horse or pony.,
Decide on a specific breed of horse you would like to own.,
Keep an open mind about the color of a horse versus its behavior.,
Nonetheless, don't buy a horse if you are uncertain about its breed or color.,
Think about the future.,
Meet the horse you're considering buying and spend time with him at his current home.,
Enlist professional help in making this enormous decision.",How to Choose Your Horse,"


Do you have enough money and time for a horse? Horses are a serious investment.
Do you have the time to care for your horse?
Do you have a place for your horse to stay (such as a barn) or a place where you can board the horse?
Why do you want a horse (such as competition or pleasure)? Is that a good reason?
Are you ready to take on such a commitment? Horses can live for a long time--more than 20 years!
Do you have the necessary supplies? You'll need lots of stuff to care for and ride your horse, including tack, grooming supplies, and feed.
Do you have contacts? Every horse needs a good farrier and vet, and, in some cases, a skilled trainer. Having these phone numbers ahead of time can save your horse's life in an emergency.;
, Some people think a pony is a baby horse, but this is not true! Ponies are similar to horses, except ponies are generally smaller. Though ponies are smaller than horses ponies can seem more stubborn and it is sometimes a better choice to choose a horse with a better temperament then a pony just because of its size. The difference between a pony and a horse is their size, ponies being smaller than 14.2 hands (58 inches) at the withers, and horses are +14.2 hands.

, Some horse breeds include the spunky and highly spirited Thoroughbred horse, or a gentle giant like the Belgian or Clydesdale. Whatever the breed, be sure to research the breed to make sure it's the one you truly want.

, You may come across a horse that is both a breed and color you love, but if the horse is not well behaved, you might regret the choice. If you take home a horse with an excellent temperament, you will likely not regret your choice even if it is not exactly your favorite color or breed.

, Even though you shouldn't buy a horse because it looks right, you shouldn't buy a horse if you honestly dislike the way it looks. If you are buying a horse, you should take the time to find the perfect horse, instead of settling for one you don't like.

, Ask yourself, ""If I choose this horse and take it home, will I be truly happy and be able to love the horse? In years to come, can I look back on this moment and know I made the best decision?"" If the answer is no, don't buy the horse.

, See him in as many environments as possible, like his stall, the arena, and outside, and do everything with him you'd normally do at home, like tacking him up, bathing him, and, of course, riding him.


Look at his physical appearance. Make sure he is healthy and in good shape. Pay special attention to his legs and his face, especially his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. If something looks wrong, ask the owner about it. If he doesn't know, ask someone else to look at it.
Make sure he stays calm at all times. If he's nervous at home, where everything is familiar, consider if the extra fear he'll likely experience in a strange environment will be too much for you to handle.
Get to know his personality. Having a smart, kind horse will be much more fun than having a beautiful but spooky or mean horse.
Watch out for vices. Is he girthy? Does he crib? Does he kick at other horses? Carefully consider if you can handle every single one of his bad habits before you put your money - and your safety - on the line.

, No matter how experienced you are, you can always fall for the wrong horse and be left penniless and heartbroken.


Ask an experienced trainer to look at the horse and possibly even ride him. If you know the trainer well, ask him if he thinks the horse is a good match for you.
Get a thorough vet check. No matter how expensive, a vet check is always worth it. Even you don't want to spend $500 on a horse you don't even own, consider what it would be like to spend $10,000 on a horse you do own - and can't sell. Many owners will pay for this themselves to get a horse sold.
You could even ask the present owner to ride him for you. This way, you can see the horse under saddle, and if it has any issues, (For example: Bucking and/Rearing.) you could decide if these are issues you can handle! (if you have enough experience for this particular horse's Spirit!)

Discuss vaccinations with a veterinarian.,
Decide what vaccinations are needed for your foal.,
Figure out when to give vaccinations.,
Gather supplies and the vaccine.,
Get training from an experienced person.,
Recruit someone to help you.,
Fill the syringe.,
Pick and clean the injection site.,
Inject the vaccine properly.,
Dispose of the needle and dirty supplies.,
Care for the foal and its injection site.,
Look for adverse reactions.",How to Vaccinate Newborn Foals," When a new foal is born, it is a good idea to discuss what vaccinations it should get with a veterinarian. A veterinarian should have a good understanding of what diseases are common in foals in your area, whether the mother's health history and vaccination history should impact the foal's vaccinations, and how much vaccine to give in order to prevent common diseases.This discussion can happen during an exam of the foal or over the phone or email if your foal does not need a veterinary exam.
You can also just ask the veterinarian to come and give your foal its vaccinations. However, this will cost you more money than doing it yourself.;
, Even if a veterinarian suggests a variety of vaccinations, it is up to you to make the final decision. Balance your veterinarian's expertise with your desires and your financial ability to pay for vaccinations.


When making the final decision about what vaccines your foal should get, you can do your own research on common diseases in your area.
If there are diseases that are common in your area and they can be prevented with a vaccine, then it is a good idea to administer them.

, The vaccinations a foal needs should be given at very specific ages in order for them to be effective and in order to avoid negative side effects. Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for when to give specific vaccinations or follow a vaccination schedule supplied by an organization that you trust.Different vaccinations will need to be given at different times and some vaccinations need repeated doses. This means that you will likely need to give your foal many shots in the first couple months of its life.

, If you are doing the vaccinations yourself, you will need to get the vaccine from a veterinarian. Your veterinarian should allow it. You will also need supplies like a syringe and cleaning supplies to keep the needle and the injection point clean.If you are hiring a veterinarian to do the vaccinations, they will bring all of the supplies with them when they come to the procedure.
Discuss what size needle should be used with your veterinarian.
A new needle should be used for every injection. Keep this in mind when ordering needles.

, You should not inject a vaccination into a foal with no training or experience. Find someone who knows how to do it and get them to help you through the process.If it is your first time giving a vaccination shot, consider hiring a veterinarian and watching how they do it.
Remember that the health of your foal is important and doing intramuscular injections incorrectly can have an adverse affect on its health.

, Even if you know how to inject the vaccinations, you will need another set of hands to help. While you are injecting the vaccination into the horse, you will need someone to help keep it steady.


Ideally, you will have someone that the foal is comfortable with to help you with the process. This way, the foal is more likely to remain calm.

, You will need to transfer the vaccine from its bottle into the syringe. Take the cap off the needle attached to the syringe and place it in the hole on the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down and draw the vaccine in with the plunger on the syringe. Then push on the plunger on the syringe a bit back in to get all of the air in the syringe out.Lastly, pull the needle out of the bottle, tap on the syringe while it is upside down to loosen any air bubbles stuck inside, and gently compress the plunger on the syringe to get rid of any remaining air inside.
Pull in a few more cc's than you are planning on injecting. This will allow you to push a few out when getting air out of the syringe.
It is very important that you make sure that there are no air bubbles present in the syringe after putting the vaccine in it.

, You can inject the vaccine into the horse's neck or into the muscles around the tail. The neck is most commonly used and is best if only giving a few shots.Once you have decided where to give the shot, you will need to clean the injection area. This can be done by removing all dirt and debris and then rubbing the area with a cotton ball covered in rubbing alcohol.

, In order to give your foal the vaccine, you will need to do an intramuscular injection. This is an injection into the muscle mass of the horse. This is done by quickly plunging the needle into the muscle and then slowly compressing the plunger on the syringe. This puts the vaccine into the animal's blood supply.Before you do the injection, tap on the area with your finger. This will get the animal used to the feeling of the shot and will lessen its reaction.
A quick insertion of the needle is less painful for the animal than a slow one.

, Once you have injected the vaccine, you will need to pull out the needle and dispose of it properly. A used needle should be put in a biohazard container designed for sharp instruments, so that it doesn't accidentally prick another animal or a person. Any supplies that have blood or body fluids on them should also be disposed of in a biohazard container.


Biohazard containers and sharps containers are available online or through you local medical supply company.
A new needle should be used for every vaccination shot. This means that you will need to dispose of it instead of keeping it.
To find out where you can dispose of your sharps container when it is full contact your local waste disposal agency., After a vaccination you should care for the injection site and you should take it easy on the horse. A horse that has received an intramuscular injection is likely to be sore, so exercise it gently.While the injection site probably does not need to be bandaged, it should be kept relatively clean. For example, don't allow the horse to roll around in a dirty stall right after the injection.

, Once you give your horse a vaccination you should keep an eye on it for a day or two afterwards. Look for swelling or irritation around the injection site. Also pay attention to general signs of illness, including lethargy and lack of appetite.If it is the first time you have given your horse a specific vaccine, you should keep a closer eye on the horse.

Find and go to local stables, local horse breeders, tack shops and even in the local newspaper or Internet that may have any advertisements or know of any horses for sale.,
Try to find an older horse that already has been well-broke to the saddle (preferably a ranch-type horse).,
Take a one-on-one look at the horse.,
Ask if you can ride it to get a feel of how it moves under you and whether you like the feel of him between your knees.,
It is also a good idea to watch it being groomed and tacked up.,
Go home and think about your decision.,
After you are positive that the horse is perfect for you, confirm about the price of the horse.,
Take the horse home and put him in his new paddock with fresh water, hay and/or grass.

,
You may want to put him in the round pen or something similar and give him a good bit of exercise after all this.,
Leave him be for a day or more until he gets totally settled in.,
Contact your local large animal equestrian vet and/or the owner if your horse suddenly goes down with colic or goes off feed.",How to Find Your Dream Horse,";
, You can also look for a horse that you know or your local riding instructorknow, if you have already taken riding lessons and/or are familiar with some horses that have been up for sale. Or, if you know one or more local horse breeders, you can contact them as well about any well-broke horses that they may be aware of or know about.

, Look the horse over as it stands where it is and when you get it to trot around on the lunge-line. Study the horse's conformational qualities, especially with the feet and legs, and also the topline, the neck and head. A horse with sound feet and legs and a strong topline is a good horse that will take you almost anywhere you want to go.

, It's best to do this with the owner as well as with your riding instructor or an experienced rider that knows you well enough to judge your riding abilities.

, If you like the way the horse handles grooming and being saddled up, ask if you can do the grooming and tacking yourself to see how the horse reacts around you. Your riding instructor or experienced horseman-friend should be there as well to assess whether the horse is within your level of horsemanship.

, Don't buy the horse right away, as it's possible that the horse will not be the perfect one for you. It is also likely that the horse may react much differently around you when in a different setting, like in its would-be new home and when the owner and/or your instructor is not around. You may want to think about requesting with the owner to bring the horse to a more neutral setting (away from the horse's home) to do another analysis of its behaviors and actions towards you.


If the horse is not up to your standards, or you do not feel comfortable that it is the perfect one, then look elsewhere.

, You may have to barter a bit with the seller if the horse is priced too high or low priced for what it's worth. Don't over-guess the price either, as since this is your first horse, you will be less familiar with how much a good horse should go for than the owner or your riding instructor will be.

,, This is a time to join-up with him/her and establish your dominance (since, after all, this is your place, not his/hers), and give him a sense of ""migration"" from his old home to his new home, just like what wild horse herds would do when they had to move from an old grazing an area to another a fair distance away. Don't work it too hard, as this could increase the stress level for the horse and cause it to go off-feed.

, Each horse has their own time and levels of coping with the stress of leaving their own home and getting used to their new one. Your horse may only take a day to settle in, or he may take a couple weeks.

Your vet's number should be on speed-dial no matter what in the first place.

Create a purchase and upkeep budget.,
Be a solo owner if you want more control.,
Purchase through a syndicate if you want less risk.,
Talk with your tax advisor.",How to Buy a Racehorse1," It is possible to buy a racehorse for $1,000 or even $100,000 plus. Look over your finances and consider how much you are willing to reasonably spend. Then, add into that budget an amount for yearly care and training. You can expect to spend upwards of $25,000 each year for boarding, training, medical care, and other costs., This is where you buy a single horse outright with your own funds. You’ll reap all of the rewards for winning, but you’ll also take on all of the risks of the investment. This is a nice option for owners looking to purchase an entry-level horse in order to get to know the art of ownership. It is often the ownership approach of owners who also double as horse trainers., This is a type of ownership where multiple people divide the costs, and the rights, to one or more horses. Most syndicates operate under a very specific set of guidelines, so it is important that you really understand these terms before agreeing to anything. You’ll also need to be comfortable with splitting the process of decision-making.In many of these arrangements, the syndicate management handles the process of choosing a stable, trainer, jockey, and all that a horse needs to thrive.Investment terms are not usually lifelong, but instead typically last anywhere from three to five years. During that period, you will likely be billed on a regular basis for your percentage of the horse’s upkeep.Corporate ownership is another version of a syndicate. This is where you use a horse to promote a particular company or brand., Many horse owners choose to treat their purchase as the groundwork of a limited-liability company. This gives them a chance to then structure their taxes around profits and losses. Meet with your tax advisor and discuss how this purchase could affect your overall tax profile and come up with a strategy prior to buying."

Work with a bloodstock agent.,
Identify a target purchase age.,
Make a private purchase.,
Attend a claiming race.,
Go to an auction.,
Invest in a harness horse if you want more frequent racing action.",How to Buy a Racehorse2," This is a person who will guide you through the purchase process by talking with you about what you want in a horse. They will then seek out suitable horses that fit your needs and help you to make the final purchase. They usually charge a fee of somewhere around 5% of the horse’s purchase price for their services. Working with an agent is an especially good option for someone relatively new to horse ownership.Find a bloodstock agent by attending local horse auctions and talking with other owners. Or, look for contact information via industry magazines or websites.

, The majority of sellers go with yearlings, otherwise known as one-year-old horses. They are generally cheaper to buy and still have a great deal of room to grow. However, this can also mean that your investment is even more of a gamble. Others try “pinhooking” where they buy yearlings and intend to sell them for more money in a year’s time., These types of transactions are often the result of networking between a potential buyer and willing sellers. So, keep your eyes open if you are in the market for a horse and spread the word via local horse barns and breeding farms. With a one-on-one purchase, there may be some room for negotiation on the price and it is possible to learn a great deal about the horse’s background. But you must make sure that you trust the seller and the information provided.Don’t walk away from the purchase without getting a final and formal “Bill of Sale.” This document should specify all of the conditions of the sale, including any guarantees of health. Local laws often require that sellers give a document of this type to buyers.
As you complete the purchase, feel free to ask the seller as many questions as you like. For example, “Why are you selling this particular horse at this particular time?”

, This is one of the most common ways to purchase a racehorse. You attend a race in which the horses entered have prices established beforehand. If you agree to pay that horse’s set price, then you get to walk away owning it. Working with a trainer or agent is particularly important for these types of buys as they can get you inside information about each animal.There is an element of chance involved in claiming races as well. If more than one person decides to make a purchase offer, then the winning claim is chosen at random at the end of the race.
You also have to hope that your newly purchased horse makes it through the post-race period in sound health, which is usually the case.

, Horse auctions take place around the world and it is possible to bid for an animal in person, via an agent, or even through online channels. Sales are often organized around categories of horses, including yearlings and tried racehorses. Most auctions circulate a catalogue well in advance of the auction date listing the horses available and their details. Doing your research in advance can let you know which ones are of interest to you.Prior to the auction, either you or your agent will be able to take a closer look at the horse. In many cases, a vet inspection is allowed as well.

, Your mind may instantly go to thoroughbred racing, but there are other types of equine races that may be equally interesting from an investment standpoint. Standardbred (or harness) racing involves a horse pulling a two-wheeled cart steered by a jockey. It is often cheaper to get into harness racing and with more frequent races you’ll get to see your horse in action more.For more information, contact the Standardbreds Owners Association near you.

Educate yourself about the industry.,
Pick a pedigreed horse.,
Get a vet clearance.,
Be realistic about your potential earnings.,
Participate fully in the racing lifestyle.",How to Buy a Racehorse3," Go to farm and track websites and browse through all of the available links. Get subscriptions to industry publications and visit ownership-themed websites, such as the Daily Racing Forum. Professional horse association websites can also offer some great resources, like the “owner education” areas of the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association site., If you are looking for a horse that can run the long race, then a study of pedigrees, or a horse’s blood background, is one way to assess staying power. A solid bloodline also provides a safety net of sorts because you can always make money off of breeding rights if they don’t perform well on the racetrack., When you find a horse that interests you, it is critical that you have them examined by a vet of your choosing. The vet will look over the animal’s medical history, while performing a physical examination of the limbs, eyes, lungs, and heart. They may even request x-rays of any areas of concern.Some horses will come with a guarantee of sorts that they do not suffer from any observable breathing or lung problems.
The vet will likely spend some time just observing the horse’s overall behavior to see how it interacts with other animals or handlers.

, Purchase a horse for the enjoyment of the sport and you will be happy with your investment in the long term. If you buy a racehorse for the express purpose of winning large purses, then you’ll want to harden your heart against disappointment. Each year less than 2% of active racehorses bring more than $125,000., It is important that you look at your purchase as a non-traditional investment. You’ll get the most enjoyment out of your purchase by embracing the culture surrounding horseracing. Attend the races and events. Get to know the trainers and jockeys. Be invested in the process and it will make winning or losing more worthwhile."

Be realistic about what is needed ahead of time.,
Don't be afraid of used items from people you trust.,
Consider swap-meets or trades.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner1," If you can keep an eye on sales throughout the year and know what you're going to need ahead of time, you can find great bargains when the sales are on. Items such as feed, wormers, gear and supplements will be on specials at different times through the year and knowing what you need can allow you to stock up when the sales are on.


When winter coats are on special, for example, buy them even though winter is several more seasons away. The horse isn't fussed about fashion statements.;
, Friends and trusted fellow horse owners may be able to sell you their used items at a fraction of their original cost. Another way to get great secondhand gear is to look at online sellers who have excellent reputations.

, Organize an event for fellow horse owners in your area to bring unwanted, surplus or secondhand gear along to trade. This can include horse equipment, riding gear, clothing and maintenance gear. You can either do direct exchanges or pay small amounts of cash to make it fair when there are no exact trades for one party.


Clean any gear you're putting into a swap-meet. You'll want the items to look appealing and in great condition.

Feed the best quality you can get.,
Buy winter feed early.,
Care for your pasture.,
Buy some feeding supplements from the local shops.,
Find cheap sources of additional food.,
Measure the food allowances.,
Keep your horse healthy to ensure optimal use of feed.,
Fill hay nets and prepare feeds ahead of time.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner2," Feeding cheaper, but poorer quality feeds is a false economy, as you will have to feed more and it risks your horse’s health by lacking the necessary nutrition. To obtain feed of quality status on a budget, buy in bulk. The best way to do this is to get together with a group of friendly horse owners in your area who are willing to pitch in for the cost of feed by the pallet load. This isn't just about bagged foods––molasses can be purchased in large drums, although you'll need to have strong people and good logistics in place to move this container.


Shop around. Look online and phone around for the best available deals. Tell the feed retailer that you're happy to buy in bulk if you can.
Ask for advice from a nutritionist. Many feed manufactures have free helplines. Make sure you are spending your money on the best feeds and not over feeding expensive supplements.
Always use up perishable food by the use-by date. Only buy as much or share in as much bulk-buying as you know you'll use up in time.
If buying molasses in bulk, have the feed retailer load it on the truck with their forklift, then have all your cooperative participants come around with their smaller containers to fill straight from the truck. By the time they're done, the drum will be much easier to move!

, Winter feed prices increase as winter proceeds, so the more you've purchased early on, the more money you'll save. If you don't have the cash to buy all you need at the end of summer or in autumn, get a small loan from the bank. Even paying back the loan with interest will tend to prove cheaper than buying more expensive food during winter itself but be sure to do the sums with your bank adviser first. Again, using other horse owners to pitch in and buy in bulk and share storage space can be a great way to keep down the costs and improve the community spirit among horse owners!

, Pasture is proper grazing, not just a paddock for turnout. If you are lucky enough to have some, treat it as a crop. Poo-pick, rotate, cross-graze, rest, roll, harrow, re-seed and manure. Keep your horses off it in wet weather. Ask a local farmer for advice if you don't know how to grow great pasture.


If you live in a climate where the horses continue to access the paddocks and grass over winter, be considerate of the grass that is there. If horses tread on that grass when it's wet, they'll destroy that valuable feed. Instead, try using makeshift electric fencing to move them away from choice areas of winter grass so that you can feed it to them. On the dry days, let them eat direct from the grass to supplement their diet.

, Cider vinegar, oils, garlic and salt can all be bought more cheaply at local shops then at feed merchants. If you get together with other horse owners, you may be able to buy wholesale.

, Ask shops, supermarkets and market stalls if they have any fruit or vegetables they can’t sell, or need to sell quickly. Ask farmers and allotment holders if they have a surplus of their harvest that they can’t eat, store or sell. These will probably be oddly-shaped, damaged or small. Don’t accept any items that are rotten or diseased though; if you find these, either compost or dispose them as appropriate. And be aware that horses shouldn’t eat all types of fruit and vegetables. Don’t give them citrus fruit, tomatoes, or potatoes (cooked or raw). Remove any stones from peaches or plums. Most other types are fine, including the more exotic like figs and bananas.


Feed carefully selected kitchen scraps, like melon rinds and pulp from the juicer. These should be stored in the fridge and fed to the horse quickly after producing them.
Grow your own vegetables or herbs. If you have room, you can grow a selection of vegetables for yourself and your horse. You can grow herbs easily in pots. Mint is loved by most horses and is easy to grow.

, You can waste a lot of feed if it's not measured beforehand. Not only is overfeeding a waste but it can lead to an overweight horse. Weigh feeds before giving; use scales to weigh each feed.


Avoid filling hay nets. Feeding from the floor is healthier and faster, but wasteful. Feeding from a large rubber bin or enclosing a corner of the stable with plywood, gives you the benefits of feeding from the floor, without so much waste.

, A healthier horse will get the most from his feed:


Keep your horse suitably rugged. This will reduce the amount of energy the horse uses to keep warm/cool and help him keep condition with less feed.
Worm your horse regularly (as well as every horse he is turned out with). Get an egg count regularly. Ask your vet about the best worming programme for your horse and area. Feed the horse, not the worms.

, This will save time later and make it easier for other people to feed your horse for you.

"
"
Give your horse an extra bucket, so you don’t have to refill them so often.

,
Fill the bucket in the stable.,
Install automatic waterers.,
Save water by using an adjustable nozzle on your horses.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner3,", Attach a hose long enough to fill the buckets without removing them.


Extend the plumbing to allow filling of bucket from the stable.

, These must be checked and cleaned regularly but they can save a lot of time daily.

, This means that you'll reduce the amount of water coming out. Also check leaky taps and trough ballcocks to prevent unnecessary water loss.

"
"
Consider the layout of the yard.,
Spring clean regularly, once or twice a year.,
Find repairs that need doing, and do them as quickly as possible.,
Sweep the yard when it’s dry rather then wet.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner4," Know how long it takes to walk from the tack, feed and rug rooms to the stables, and from the stables to the muck heap. Draw a plan of this to see if there are any ways that you can reconfigure things to speed up the access and time taken. Or, find more efficient ways of completing each task so that you're not doubling back all the time.

, Things will run more smoothly on a day-to-day basis and makes it easier to keep the yard in good shape in between.

, Small repairs usually turn into big repairs if you leave them. Fill in potholes that might tip over the wheelbarrow, re-hang gates and doors that are difficult to open and close. Keep a list of repairs you've noticed and attend to it at least weekly. Carry a hammer and wire-cutters when walking the yard and bang in or remove loose wires and nails that are sticking out. This will reduce the chances for torn horse covers and horse legs, saving you a lot of money for little effort.

, This will leave less debris and mud heaped up and makes it a less messy job for you.

"
"
Keep your horse at livery and you’ll have the flexibility of the ultimate trade-off of money and time.,
Ask about grass livery.,
Ask about working livery.,
Ask for work at the yard for a reduced fee, but don’t be surprised if you are turned down, or if the reduction is small.,
Organise a rota for mucking out, turnout and feeding, with the other liveries so you can get some mornings/afternoons off.

,
Buy in bulk with other horse owners, or the whole yard.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner5," Different types of livery require different amounts of work. DIY requires more work then Assisted, Part or Full livery, but is cheaper. In this case, you'll need to juggle financial savings with time savings and go with whichever benefits you most.


Consider travelling time from home/work when choosing a livery yard. This should be factored in to avoid excessive time loss.

, This is a cheap form of livery, but is only available where there is enough turnout, and sometimes not over winter. Not all horses suit living out full time.

, If the horse is suitable for the job, some riding schools will offer a reduced livery fee in return for the horse being used in lessons.

, Keep an eye out for seasonal jobs or repairs the you are skilled at, such as repairing fencing, jumps, gates and doors, spring cleaning and painting, rug cleaning or driving a tractor to help with field maintenance or hay making. The yard manager is more likely to need help at these times.

,, Feed, hay/haylage and bedding usually has to be delivered so you can spilt delivery costs too. Sometimes the yard owner does this for the whole yard.

"
"
Find cheap or free insurance.,
Reduce the insurance costs.,
If you choose not to insure your horse, at least get third party liability.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner6,"


Join an organization that gives free insurance. The availability will depend on where you live but typical organizations that might provide free insurance include horse societies and jumping or eventing associations.
Buy online. Some insurance companies give online discounts.
Pay increased excesses in return for reduced premiums.

,


Have your horse security marked, namely, freeze-marked, microchipped. Your insurance company may give you a discount for having had this done.
Insure the horse for less then his worth. You will get the same veterinary cover cheaper, but will get a reduced payment if your horse dies or is stolen.
Insure only the basics. These include personal liability, and possibly vet fees.

, Put some money aside every month for unexpected veterinary fees and keep a good credit rating so, if necessary, you can go into debt.

"
"
Don't skimp on health professionals for your horse.,
Buy a calendar for the tack room to help keep on top of worming, shoeing and vaccinations.,
Schedule with other horse owners.,
Get a vet check regularly.,
Learn basic equestrian first aid.,
Talk to your farrier about going barefoot.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner7," In most cases, trying to save money on the professionals will turn out to be false economy because healthy horses save money in the long run.

, These are important to avoid expensive complications later, and last minute appointments sometimes come with an additional fee.

, Vets, dentists and farriers charge for call out but this can be split between owners if you schedule the same date for visits. All horses can be brought to a central location to bring down the costs and it's a good excuse for everyone to get together to discuss all things horses. Be sure to ask the vet, farrier or dentist for a ""bulk"" price in advance so that everyone is aware of the cost savings.


Provide coffee and a piece of cake to make an event of it.

, Scheduling these checks with annual dental treatments and vaccinations will save on the call out charge and your vet may give a discount package. Catching any health problems early will save time, money and heartache in the long run. You may be able to also get a discount on you insurance.

, This will reduce the amount that you have to call out the vet mistakenly, or for minor problems.

, This doesn’t suit all horses or management systems, but if successful, barefoot horses have less foot problems and only need trimming, rather then trimming and shoeing.

Buy the best you can afford.,
Buy on sale.,
Buy synthetic tack.,
Buy regular essentials from local shops.,
Clean, care for and store your equipment properly.,
Stop loss of items.,
Be resourceful with DIY repairs and fixes.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner8," Buying the cheapest products is a false economy. Canvas or ballistic nylon rugs can last 10 years or more, while cheaper rugs may not last a season.


Buy from recommendations. The best is sometimes hard to find. Ask other owners about products they have used and liked.
Buy expensive equipment co-operatively. Things like clippers are expensive but are used infrequently so are easily shared. Alternatively hire them out to others to re-gain some of the cost.

, Be alert for the sales and buy when they're on. In particular, buy at the end of the season, such as getting winter rugs in spring.

, It's cheaper and easier to care for and store.

, This can include Vaseline, sunblock, after-sun, baby wipes, nappy-rash cream (this is interchangeable with udder cream) buckets, brooms, shovels and hair brushes. They will be cheaper from local shops than products aimed exclusively at the equestrian market.


Use disposable nappies as a poultice. They can be used as a very effective and cheap poultice for the hoof.

, Bang excess dirt off tools, air and wash rugs, clean your tack and cover it in a breathable cover. Store equipment under cover, in a well ventilated area. Well maintained equipment will last longer.


Keep leather tack well-conditioned.
Use rainy afternoons as a time to clean equipment while you talk with your horse.

, Loss of equipment can be costly and replacing costs money. To stop this from happening, here are some solutions:


Mark your smaller equipment, like the grooming kit, with your horse's or your own name, to help stop things going missing, especially in a livery yard.
Put your name on lead ropes and halters. They're easy to borrow and forget to return but with a name on them, this becomes a reminder to would-be borrowers that they need to return them.
Mark turnout rugs with your postal code in big letters. Although this isn’t attractive, turnout rugs are expensive, easily stolen and usually not covered by insurance.
Keep a check list for checking off after events, to make sure you've gathered up everything prior to leaving.

, Being resourceful means that you can repair and make your own equipment to save costs. Some suggestions include:


You can make the old horse cover last a long longer with some simply DIY repairs. Many small tears in these coats can be repaired simply using a hot glue gun. Even taking the cover along to a saddler or canvas-repair worker can be much cheaper than getting a new coat.
Restore waterproofing yourself. Purchase waterproofing agents off the shelf; some are sprayed on, some brushed, so follow the instructions provided.
Use a rug underneath to increase warmth of an older cover. Old covers can become rugs when they've had it as a cover.
Remove buckles, leather straps and other items before tossing out old covers. These can be used to repair other covers.
Make your own equipment and horse care products. Everything from horse hoof oil, shampoos, coat enhancers to cleaning equipment can be made yourself. Rope halters and hay nets are examples of equipment you can make at home.
Make your own jumps. Use tires and milk crates as makeshift wings.

"
Turn out your horse as much as possible.,
Buy tools that will work best.,
Choose the best type of bedding for you.,
Put a tarpaulin outside the stable door.,
Muck out all the stables at the same time (either yourself or with others).,
Position the muck heap within easy reach of the stables, but downwind, out of sight of the neighbours, and with access to a road.,
Consider managing a deep litter bed.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner9," This will reduce mucking out, and your horse will be healthier.

, Mucking out tools should do the job well, without causing you pain or difficulties:


Buy tools that suit your build. Try them in the shop first. If you have a small frame, tools designed for children or teenagers might suit you better.
Buy tools suitable for the job. Depending on the type of bedding, you may want a four-pronged fork or a shavings fork.
Buy a large wheelbarrow to reduce the amount of times you need to go the muck heap.

, This means it must be suitable for your horse, easy to handle, easily composted or cheap, depending on your priorities. The cheapest beddings are those that are a by-product of another industry. Shredded paper and cardboard are the most common, but they are difficult to handle. Commercially packed wood shavings are easy to handle, but often compost badly. Straw is cheap and the best for composting, but is often dusty, so is unsuitable for some horses.


Install rubber matting. This is initially very expensive, but will reduce the amount of bedding you need to use, saving time, money and reducing the size of your muck heap.







, Skipping all the muck out on to that is often easier and faster then aiming for a small muck skip.

, The yard will only have to be swept once, and if you have a trailer, the muck can be taken away together.

, Consider the footing as well as the distance. If you have a trailer, the muck heap can be further from the stables.

, This involves removing only the dropping and putting fresh bedding on the top when necessary. This reduces the daily workload, but the whole bed will have to be stripped weekly (semi-deep litter) to yearly.

"
"
Muck out directly in to bags (bedding, haylage or feed bags).,
Compost the muck heap.,
Contact farmers and nurseries to see if they want it.,
Advertise at allotments.,
Spread it on your own land.,
Pay someone to take it away.,
Burn it.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner10," People are more likely to take it away if it's bagged, but you probably won't be paid for it.

, This involves some maintenance, but the resulting compost will be in high demand, and you could even sell the resulting compost.

, They will probably have the equipment to collect it directly from the heap. The older the manure, the more demand there will be.

, With less room manure will have to be bagged and at least partly composted (3 months - 6 months is best) to sell or give it to allotments. If you have a car, you can offer to deliver it to them for a fee.

, If the land is used to graze horses it must first be composted to kill any parasites, but this is the best way to manage your muck heap as it will also save on fertiliser costs.

, This is expensive and wasteful, but removes the need to handle and dispose of it, and is necessary in some areas.

, This is an effective and cheap way of getting rid of manure, but it is wasteful, polluting and illegal in some areas.

Train the horse to lift both feet from the same side when you pick them out, to save having to go around the horse.,
Carry everything at once from the tack room to the stable.,
Use both hands to groom.,
Groom only where tack goes to remove anything thing that might rub the horse, rather then do a full groom.,
Use a hairbrush to brush out the tail and mane.,
Brush mane/tail conditioner into the tail and mane regularly.,
Use baby wipes to clean the face and dock areas.,
Clip your horse in winter.,
Hog or pull the mane.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner11," Young and unbalanced, or old and stiff horses might find this hard., If your horse has minimal tack, you may be able to carry everything in you arms, if not there are tack trolleys to help you, or you can use a clean wheelbarrow. You must have somewhere safe to put your saddle when you get to the stable. You could install a folding saddle rack outside the stable., Have the dandy brush in one hand and the body brush in another. Tuck the handle of the metal curry into your belt or waistband so you can use it without having to hold it. Wear full-chaps or over-trousers to avoid getting your jodhpurs/breeches dirty., This is very good if you need to get to a lesson quickly, but you should do a full groom every day so that you can bond with your horse (even if it's a lesson horse) and find health and body problems sooner rather then later., It’s faster than using a mane comb. There are expensive tail brushes on the market, but a cheap or old hairbrush works just as well., This will make it easier to brush out and keep clean., There are also useful at shows to give a last minute clean to the horse’s coat, tack or your boots., A clipped horse is easier to groom and cool down then one with a full winter coat. The horse must be rugged to be kept warm. Partial clips are a compromise, where only some of the coat is clipped off. Do not do this, however, if you are not riding your horse consistently, and make sure you know very well how to clip a horse., A pulled mane is easier to care for. Hogged manes (clipped off) need no care at all, but only suit some types of horses like cobs. Only pull a horse's mane after a work-out so that his pores are open, and the hairs come out more easily. You should also learn how to do this from some one with experience."
"
Turn out as much as possible.,
Lunge the horse.,
Use an exercise sheet.,
Cover the horse with a cooler or anti-sweat rug to reduce cool down time.
",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner12," This gives gentle exercise and reduces the amount you have to ride., This gives more intense exercise that riding. Twenty minutes of lunge work is the equivalent to an hour ridden work., This will keep muscles warm and reduce warm-up time. It can also be used during grooming and tacking up.,"
"
Start a transportation sharing arrangement with other horse owners in your area.,
Hire your horse float.",How to Save Time and Money As a Horseowner13," When a float is going to an event and there's a spare spot for another horse, ring around to see who needs the space. In turn, that person then owes you a trip to another event, and so on. You can share fuel costs and any other associated costs, as well as having someone to keep you company on the way to the event and you'll also be doing your part for reducing emissions into the atmosphere., Instead of owning it, consider hiring it. Or start a shared float-owning cooperative with fellow horse owners so that everyone shares the cost of purchase and maintenance of the floats at all times."

Inform your trainer that you are in the market for a horse, and ask if she/he will help you look.,
Start looking for horses everywhere.,
Once you've found a contender, set up a date to go visit the barn where the horse is stabled, and ride him or her.,
Once you've decided on your favorite of the horses you've ridden, or if you just like one, it is wise to take it to your barn on trial.,
If you've decided after your trial that you still want this horse, have a trusted vet come out and perform a vet-check.,
If the horse's results come back without problem, or with very minor problems, and you still like him, then you need to really start thinking about if this is the horse you want to spend your money on.",How to Buy the Right Horse," Your trainer is the person that knows your riding best, and if anyone can find you the right horse, she can. Most trainers charge what is called a ""commission fee"", which is usually 10-20% of the horse's price, that you pay to your trainer, for helping you look. When you have decided you're looking, decide what kind of horse you want; breed (that is really optional to most), temperament, what type of riding they are best for, etc. After that decide what you're using the horse for; if for children, showing, or pleasure. Think and think and think until you have worked out all the kinks and unknowns, like how far you are willing to travel, your price range, etc. Then you can start shopping.;
, There are a few main ways. Try the Internet, websites like www.dreamhorse.com, www.bigeq.com, www.equine.com are all fantastic sites where horses are for sale. But don't limit to search engines. Look for the websites of barns in your area, and check out their sales' pages. You can also call other trainers, some don't have webpages, and see what they have.Go to horse shows and look for ads posted by the rings, or on the Porta Potties, or anywhere. Always keep an eye out. Don't be afraid to suggest a horse to your trainer--they might tell you that's a great horse, or they'll point out something that makes them think it might not be all too good for you, and that's okay. You'll learn more about what they think is right.

, It is also good to have your trainer ride, but that is your decision. Make sure a trainer, or someone who knows riding well can come with you to this visit! Keep in mind that just because you've tried a horse doesn't mean to stop looking. There is no guarantee that horse is right. Honestly, the more horses you try the better. It is a good idea to take a camera/camcorder and photograph or video yourself riding the horse. This way you can look at it later and compare multiple horses you've seen.

, This way, you can ride it at your home stable, and see how he/her is for more than one ride. Sometimes a horse goes on trial from anywhere to a week to a month, although two or three weeks is a common time period.

, He will do a number of tests, to see if the horse is lame or has underlying problems. There are many different things you can have done, so talk to your vet. Keep in mind that people still buy horses that fail their vet checks, and a smaller number of horses actually pass. If the horse you vetted failed, and you still like it but don't want to make the investment yet, think about proposing a lease for a few months. This way, you can see if the horse will go lame.

, Horse are very expensive animals, and they often go up for sale for a lot of money. Sometimes you can negotiate with the owner to try to lower the price to something more affordable for you. Even if you can easily afford it, try to negotiate, it is very possible you could save some money.

Decide whether you want a mare, a gelding, or a stallion.,
Ask around.,
Schedule an appointment to see a horse.,
Bring somebody along with you to evaluate the trail horse.,
Look the horse over from a distance.,
Evaluate how well the horse reacts to handling.,
Evaluate how the horse moves.,
Analyze the horse's ground manners.,
Decide what your demands are in terms of conformation, appearance and physical ability.,
Check the horse's medical history.,
Consider the horse's age.,
Ride the horse a number of times.",How to Buy a Trail Horse," A gelding, or a castrated stallion, is perhaps best suited to most riders, as it is less dominant than a stallion and doesn't pose the hormonal challenges some mares do when they're in season.;
, Ask friends and local breeders if they know anybody who has a trail horse for sale. If word of mouth doesn't yield any results, try the classifieds in local papers, equestrian magazines, or on the Internet.

, Before making your choice, you should have the chance to thoroughly evaluate the horse.

, Make sure the person you bring along is knowledgeable about horses and can offer an objective opinion. If possible, bring along a video camera to make a video of the horse. This way, you can watch the video later at your leisure to help you make your decision.

, Before you approach the horse, look it over from a few feet away. If it looks well balanced, sound of body and calm, continue with your evaluation. If it doesn't look good and seems nervous, sick, or otherwise unsound, leave.

, Ask the owner to touch the horse on its head, neck, flanks and belly. Watch it move and look for signs of discomfort or skittishness, such as a bobbing head, pinned ears, or a swishing tail. Determine whether the horse's reactions look trustworthy.

, Ask the owner to walk it and ride it. While the horse walks, trots, canters and gallops, watch for signs of lameness and check the range of motion and the length of stride. Determine whether the horse's movements look safe.

,


See whether its posture is relaxed or uneasy. If you can see the white of the horse's eye, its nervous or panicked.
If the horse is relaxed enough, stand to the side of the horse and use a progress string (promise string), a 6-foot braided nylon rope with an eye at one end and a leather popper at the other, to tap the horse on the forelegs to direct its attention. This way, you can evaluate the horses reaction to handling.
Make a sudden movement in front of the horse and see how it reacts. Stand at least 5 feet (1.5 m) away from it, in case it rears up or tries to bolt.
Evaluate if the horse can stand still, how it handles getting in and out of trailer, and how calm it is during bathing and clipping.

, Though everybody wants a pretty horse with perfect conformation, this doesn't necessarily mean the horse will perform better. Determine what conformation or appearance flaws you can live with so long as the horse is a good trail horse.

, Obtain a copy of its medical history from the owner, and ask your own vet to give the horse a physical to find out if its in good health and whether there are any structural complications of which you need to be aware.

, An older horse can still get many good years, while a young horse will need time to become strong enough to take a rider and go on long treks. Because not all breeds develop at the same speed, you should have your vet evaluate whether your horse is fit to ride and how many years you can expect to enjoy together. Most horses can't be ridden until they're 2 years old, but they still require years of intense training. For a trail horse, it's often to be advised to choose an experienced horse that's over 10 years old. Many trail horses are in their 20s and some even make it to 30 years, so age is a question of your preference and the horse's health.

, Ask the horse's owner if you may ride the horse in order to see how you interact. Ultimately, your interaction will be one of the most important factors when buying a trail horse.

Think about whether or not you're ready to share a horse/pony.,
Think about what kind of horse or pony would be right for you.,
Be prepared to make a financial contribution.,
Websites such as equine adverts and horsemart have a huge amount of equine classifieds full of people searching for sharers for their horses.,
Social networking is also a great way to find a horse or pony.,
Is there a yard in your area that would seem a good distance for you to travel to a couple times a week?,
Be patient and polite, yet persistent.,
Arrange a trial date.,
Be clear on all the scenarios that could arise.,
Put it in writing.",How to Find a Share Horse," Although sharing is not nearly as large a commitment as owning, it is a step up from just turning up at a riding school and having a lesson. You'll be expected to be able to muck out, groom, tack up, untack, feed and ride all by yourself. This also includes dealing with any problems that arise! Usually there won't be the owner there to help you, so it's very important you know exactly what you're doing.;
, At most riding schools, you'll ride a different school pony every time, and naturally you'll have a favourite. What is it about this horse that you like? Think about the qualities in a horse that would make the experience of sharing the most fun for you. If you're tall, would you need a taller horse for example? Do you like jumping? Maybe a horse that's good at what you like to do would be best for you.

, Nearly always, you'll pay something ranging from £10 - £20 per day to share the horse. While this may seem like you're paying to do someone's work, you're actually riding as well, and at a riding school this would cost you much much more!

, You can narrow down the search to places in your area, horses of the right size, etc. Once you find a horse that seems to fit your criteria, go ahead and message the owner, introducing yourself and your ability.

, There are now groups on Facebook for all equestrians in a certain area, such as ""Yorkshire Horse Riders"" for example. You can join these groups and advertise yourself to any possible owners in need of a sharer.

, Make a poster again advertising yourself, and ask to stick it up on a noticeboard there.

, If you've made a good poster and presented yourself and all your skills well, many owners should contact you. Now it's time to make the polite rejection to those who have horses that don't appeal to you, or are too far away. It's also time to get excited if a horse sounds just perfect! Always be polite and patient with an owner you are speaking to, you want to come across as somebody who will be flexible and look after their horse in a way they'll like. However, if somebody has a horse you really like the sound of and seems to fade out the picture, definitely pursue them but not to the point where you become a nuisance.

, Suggest to the owner that you come and try their horse one day. This will be a day when you go up to the stable, have a look around and ride their horse. It gives you the opportunity to have a taste of what spending a lot of time with this horse at this yard would be like. Owners are 9 times out of 10 completely fine with this.

, It's better to hash this out in the beginning than to discover you had different assumptions down the line.


If you're going on vacation for a week and can't look after the horse at that time, how much notice will the other person need in advance?
How will you make sure that you don't both show up to ride at the same time?
What are the standards for caring for the horse?

, Both parties involved should sign it. Give a copy to the other party, and keep a copy for yourself.

Enroll in riding lessons.If you haven't had riding lessons before, you’ll need to take some.,
Decide where you’re going to house your horse.Horses need their space.,
Get a farrier.,
Learn to read horse ads.,
Decide your budget.,
Learn everything you can about horses.Educate yourself on their health, care, feeding, and other habits.",How to Buy Your First Horse1," Lessons from a professional horse trainer will provide you with the know-how to stay safe and confident when riding your horse.


Check the American Riding Instructors Association for a detailed database of riding instructors near you.Community Education and smaller, rural colleges often offer high-quality horse-riding programs.
Ask your instructor lots of questions. If there’s anything you’re unsure or confused about, rely on your riding instructor’s expertise to help guide you. Get the instructor’s advice about which saddle is right for you, as well.
Get private lessons, not group lessons. That way you’ll get more personalized attention to your riding style and habits.
If you can’t locate a professional horse trainer, you should at least link up with someone who is familiar with horse-riding who can give you ongoing, detailed lessons.;
, You should have a clean, comfortable stable where your horse can be housed comfortably. A barn with an individual stable is the best bet. Alternately, you might be able to convert a large shed into a personalized stable for your horse. If necessary, build a small barn for it.


Your horse’s pen should open onto a large fenced-in space where the horse can trot, and where you can practice riding.
Do not buy a horse in an urban space.

, A farrier is someone who makes and fits horseshoes. Horseshoes are important for protecting your horse’s hooves. Having a good farrier is will keep your horse’s hooves healthy and strong.Get advice from your riding instructor or veterinarian about where to find a good farrier.

, Horse ads have their own language. For instance, you should look for a horse described as “bombproof,” meaning that it is not easily startled. You should avoid horses described as ""gymkhana prospect,"" or ""endurance prospect."" These terms -- as well as “barrel prospect” -- indicate the horse is hyperactive and difficult to control.Other, more obvious keywords that you want in a horse include “steady,” “reliable,” and “calm.”
Horses described as “serviceably sound” may have health problems.

, Horses can be expensive. Thoroughbred racehorses can cost upwards of $50,000. However, you should never invest such a sum in your first horse. Even a racehorse can be purchased for much less, closer to $35,000.If you’re purchasing a horse simply for fun and taking pleasure rides, you’ll probably be able to get a good starter horse for around $5,000. The actual purchase price of your horse, however, is just a small part of your total budget. You’ll also need to factor in several other costs which vary depending on your area, including:


training
riding lessons
insurance (if you want a racehorse)
farrier
veterinary care
feed
equipment (saddle, tack
stabling costs
trailer hitch (if you intend to travel with your horse)

, The more knowledge you have about horses, the better equipped you’ll be to make an informed decision when you’re ready to buy.Although nothing can compare to hands-on experience, arming yourself with knowledge beforehand can help you avoid common first-time horse buyer mistakes.
Once you’ve learned all you can, decide if you’re ready to own a horse.A horse is not like a fish or other small pet that needs minimal care and attention. Horses need lots of love and affection, an adequate space to run and gallop, and lots of food. Depending on the age of the horse, it might also need training. Be sure you can provide these things before buying a horse.

Have received Title to all eligible animals previously adopted.
Be financially able to properly house, feed, and provide veterinary and farrier care for the animal(s).;
, The corral should not be too large (more than 50x50), as animals are easier to gentle in smaller corrals.
All fences and gates must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) high for wild horses over the age of 18 months. Five foot high fences are allowed for gentled horses, yearlings, and burros.
Fencing material should be 2x6 inch wooden planks spaced no more than 1 foot (0.3 m) apart, rounded pipes, poles, or similar materials that do not pose a hazard to the animal. Small mesh, heavy gauge, woven wire fencing with a 2x6 inch board along the top, center and bottom is acceptable. No barbed wire, no electric wire, no T-posts. Once gentled, the animals may be maintained in pastures or in box stalls with daily turnout.

, Shelters can be three-sided shed attached to the corral, or box stall in barn attached to corral, allowing animal(s) to move freely between the corral and shelter. Shelter or stall space should be at least 12x12 feet per animal.

,
Standard covered stock trailers and horse trailers large enough for 4 or more horses are generally acceptable, contingent on final approval prior to loading. NO 1-Horse Trailers.

Buy an older horse.Many first-time horse buyers imagine that it would be great if the horse they buy can learn along with them.,
Get an experienced horse.While age and experience usually go together in horses, they don’t always.,
Get a gelding or mare.",How to Buy Your First Horse2," However, horses that have already been trained and are familiar with people will cause the least problems for you. Younger horses, on the other hand, can be rambunctious, finicky, and difficult to handle.


If you’re buying a horse for a child, a good rule of thumb is that the age of the child and the age of the horse should add up to 20. For instance, if your child is 10, the horse should also be about 10.

, An experienced horse -- one that has been ridden and trained already -- will be more amenable to a new owner. Avoid buying a horse advertised as “green” or “in need of finishing.” These are horse-riding euphemisms for inexperienced horses.

, A gelding (a castrated male horse) might be your best bet. Horse owners find that they are more predictable than mares. A mare could also make a good first horse, but they tend to become difficult to handle during menstruation. Evaluate each animal based on its own merits. Whatever you do, never select a stallion for your first horse, as they tend to be too wild and unruly for novice horse-riders.If a mare is advertised as “in foal,” it means they are pregnant. Do not buy a pregnant mare, as a foal will be an extra expense for you, and you won’t be able to ride the mare until some time has passed after it gives birth.

Find a reputable seller.You can typically buy a horse from the person you get riding lessons from.,
Have someone check the horse out with you.Just as you would when buying a car, it’s a good idea to bring along someone who knows what to look for when buying your first horse.,
Have a vet look the horse over.Before you buy the horse, it’s important to ensure it is healthy.,
Arrange a trial period to try out your first horse.Horses sometimes act differently when they are taken away from their home stables.,
Avoid buying a horse online.,
Avoid buying at auction.If a horse is sold at an auction, it’s usually because the owner couldn’t sell it in a private sale.,
Draw up a contract.As with any significant transaction, you should draw up a contract with the seller.",How to Buy Your First Horse3," If your instructor doesn’t sell horses, ask if they know someone who does. Talk to friends and colleagues who own horses and find out if they’re happy with their horse. If they are, ask them to recommend the person who sold them their horse.


As a last resort, if you’re still having trouble locating a seller, check the classifieds in your local paper or online at Craigslist and similar sites.
Use Equine Legal Solutions’ checklist at http://www.equinelegalsolutions.com/uploads/4/0/2/5/40254925/hbc.pdf to help you identify important information and ask relevant questions before visiting a particular horse. For instance, you might want to inquire about the horse’s medical history, temperament, training, and competition record. Many of the questions you ask will be specific to your own personal preferences in a horse, so think carefully about what information you need to make a good decision.

, Bring a trusted friend or family member with you to look over the horse or horses you’re thinking of buying. They’ll help evaluate:


the horse’s gait (should be measured and regular)
the horse’s temperament (the horse should not bolt out of the gate as soon as you open it, and should not twitch or shy away when groomed or touched)
how well a particular horse would suit you based on your build (a bigger person needs a bigger horse, and vice versa)
the horse’s general health and activity level (should be inquisitive, alert, and playful but obedient)

, Buying a sick horse means you’ll end up making a greater investment in medicine and veterinary care than you need to.


Don’t have the seller’s vet look the horse over for you, even if they offer to throw it in for free. You might not get an objective evaluation. Instead, choose your own vet to look the horse over.

, You can often lease a horse for six months or more. Use this trial period to learn more about the horse’s temperament, habits, and personality.


If you want to arrange for a shorter lease, ask the owner for a lease period that suits you. Shorter leases of 7 to 30 days could be possible.
The owner may want a written agreement and may ask you to supply insurance on the horse. They may also want to inspect the space where the horse will be kept.
You might be able to lease a horse from your riding instructor.

, On the internet, you can buy almost anything, including horses. Many people check out horses they might want to buy via online videos and pictures. However, as a first-time buyer, you’d do well to buy a horse locally.As you gain more experience with horses and horse-buying, you might choose to buy a horse online.
If you do buy a horse online, always make a trip out to see the horse with a veterinarian before finalizing the purchase.

, This means that the horse is lame, sick, or too old to be sold to experienced and knowledgeable buyers. Plus, buying a horse at an auction means you won’t get to ride it or get much sense of its temperament before making the purchase. If you choose to buy a horse at an auction anyway, be sure you know what you’re getting into.


Check the terms and conditions of the sale. Most horses at auction sales are sold “as is,” meaning you won’t be able to make a return if you don’t like it.
Read the documentation for the horse at the auction. Auctions usually provide X-rays and a veterinarian’s report on the animal for potential buyers. Read it carefully so you can make an informed decision.
Familiarize yourself with the auction’s dispute procedures. This way, if you do decide to pursue a return, you’ll know how to do so.

, The contract must include the sale price, warranties, and any other stipulations made by you or the seller. You should both sign and date every page of both your copies.


If the horse’s owner has sold horses before, you can use their contract, but look it over with a lawyer or with someone you trust who has bought horses before.

Decide what you will do with the information on the foal’s gender.,
Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian.,
Learn the limitations of the procedure.,
Obtain the proper supplies.,
Use the transducer to scan the unborn foal.,
Determine the gender of the unborn foal.,
Observe the external genitalia.,
Do not use the 'nail test.'",How to Tell the Gender of a Mare's Unborn Foal," From a business perspective, the gender of the unborn foal can have many implications. Commonly, the gender can influence whether to keep or sell your mare.For example, you may decide to keep the mare if she is having a filly (female), or sell if her she is having a colt (male).Some horse owners may also consider selling a mare’s weanling based on the gender of her unborn foal.The gender of the unborn foal can also influence decisions concerning appraisal and insurance coverage.Horse owners may want a filly or colt by a particular sire. For example, if a mare is pregnant with a filly by a particular sire, but the owner wants a colt, the owner may want to breed his or her mare to the same sire again to try for a colt.Discuss the potential options with your veterinarian. You should decide what is best for you, whether it is from a business or personal perspective.;
, During your mare’s pregnancy, there will be only one window of time (day 60 to 75) during which the unborn foal’s gender can be determined with nearly 100% accuracy. Because of this, it will be important for you to schedule an ultrasound appointment with your equine veterinarian during this timeframe.Before scheduling the appointment, refer to your breeding records to determine the first day of your mare’s pregnancy.
Your veterinarian may want to perform the ultrasound at his or her clinic. Confirm the location of the ultrasound when scheduling the appointment.

, It is very important to understand that ultrasonography will only determine the unborn foal’s gender. It should not be used to control the gender. In other words, if the unborn foal’s gender is not what you desire, you should not terminate the pregnancy and quickly re-breed your mare to try to obtain the desired gender.Keep in mind that, by the time the unborn foal’s gender can be accurately determined by ultrasound, your mare will be too far into her gestation to re-breed her in time to have a normal foaling date the following year., Your equine veterinarian will perform the ultrasound, and will thus supply the necessary instrumentation to perform the ultrasound. Supplies include an ultrasound machine, a five-megahertz transducer, and a portable viewing stand.Your veterinarian may also bring a printer to print out the images.The ultrasound machine will transmit high-frequency sound waves through the transducer. When the sound waves hit a barrier between body tissues (e.g., soft tissue and bone), they will get reflected back to the transducer and then relayed back the machine to produce a two-dimensional image (called a sonogram).Because your mare will need to stand still during the procedure, your veterinarian may want to use fly repellent to keep away any distracting flies., Your veterinarian will insert the transducer into your mare’s rectum to view the unborn foal. Before trying to determine the gender, he or she will first scan the unborn foal in its entirety.Be aware that an ultrasound may reveal that the unborn foal is not alive.If your veterinarian determines that the unborn foal is dead or dying, he or she will discuss how to handle the miscarriage.

, After scanning the entire unborn foal, your veterinarian will then look for a particular body part—the genital tubercle—to determine the gender. Although the genital tubercle is visible by ultrasound as early as day 40 to 45 of your mare’s pregnancy,it will be most easily visible between days 60 and 75.


At around day 55, the genital tubercle moves from its original position towards other body parts. It will move towards the umbilicus in colts and towards the anus in fillies—this will be most clear via ultrasound after day 60.The tubercle will eventually develop into mature sexual organs: the penis in colts and the clitoris in fillies., External genitalia can be observed via ultrasound around day 110 of your mare’s pregnancy.Be aware, however, that external genitalia can be difficult to differentiate from surrounding soft tissue.Because of this, determining gender using external genitalia is not as accurate (about 80% accuracy) as identifying the genital tubercle’s location., The 'nail test' is a myth on how to determine the sex of the unborn foal. To perform the test, you would take a section of hair from the mare's tail and tie a nail to it. You would then hold the section of hair near your mare's hips.The myth is that the foal is a male if the nail swings back and forth in a straight line, and female if the nail swings in a circular motion.This is not a scientifically accurate method, and should not be used to determine the sex."

Volunteer to work at a local stable for a few weeks. This will give you a better idea of what owning horses is like, and that there is work involved; even when it's nasty weather for feeding outside horses.

, Let your horse-loving friends know that you're looking for a horse, and also tell them what you're looking for in a horse. Tell your riding instructor also; often he'll have clients that are selling a horse, and he may be able to help you try out a particular horse.


The sooner you let your friends know you're looking for a horse, the better. Oftentimes finding the right horse isn't a timely task, and better to start looking for the right fit sooner rather than later.

, From equine liability to whether there is a local tax on livestock that can reproduce (mares & stallions) to fire code laws for stables, it helps to know all the laws.

, Find and learn about boarding facilities, tack shops, feed stores, farmers that produce hay, vets, and farriers are in your area, and where the nearest equine hospital and horse ambulance service is.


Make sure that you have access to several hay suppliers, as a horse goes through around 2% of his body weight in hay daily. Visit your horse friends' barns and ask them where they buy their hay, also inspecting its quality.
Get the contact information of multiple farriers in case your regular one is busy.
Find a reputable equine vet. Find one that knows what he's talking about and also is friendly and explains things about keeping your horse healthy.

, Price the following and consider the sum: Are you ready for a horse financially?


Feed (hay, supplements)
Halter, lead rope
Saddle, saddle blanket, bridle, bit
Grooming kit
Water buckets

,, Keeping your horse on your own or rented land should be done only by knowledgeable and experienced horsemen. Livery/boarding yards are better for first-time horse owners. Look for ads in local papers, equestrian magazines and on the Internet. Ask in local tack shops and riding schools. If a yard (stable) has no spaces, ask them to recommend another yard.

, If it's rough board you'll have to feed and water your horse and clean his area daily. If it's full board, all you have to do is pay! Choose one that meets your horse's needs (e.g. safe, all-year turnout) and your needs in a comfortable environment.

, Spaces are rarely available at good yards and fill fast. Be prepared to pay a weekly/monthly fee to reserve a space until your horse arrives.

, This can include height, gender, age, health, discipline, training, breed, pedigree, and price.


Don't sacrifice health in a horse for your favorite horse color.

, Tell people like instructors, farriers, vets, and tack shop owners. These people have a lot of contact with various horse owners.

,


Animals shelters can also provide you with contact information of farm animals, including horses, that need new homes.

, Be careful, though; many horse dealers aren't too trustworthy.

, The average family horse will often make great horses for new riders.

, Don't forget to ask the following.


Confirmation of everything in the advert; age, height, color, breed, etc.
History and breeding
Competition and medical history
Reason for sale
Any vices or bad habits (biting, kicking, bucking, cribbing)
The horse’s current management
Any security markings and registrations (microchipping, breed societies)
If tack/equipment is included or can be bought cheaply from the current owner
How well the horse travels

, Ask many questions to avoid wasted trips to unsuitable horses.

, If you feel wary of the 'owner' really owning the horse, see if you can check any security marks to see if the horse was stolen. There are several databases for stolen horses; check them if you feel so inclined.

,



First visit: Arrive a little earlier than agreed and try to see the horse caught and handled. Ask to see him in different situations depending on what you want to do with him and what the owner has claimed the horse can do. Inspect tack if that is included in the agreement.

When viewing, ask the owner to ride the horse before you try it. If the owner will not ride, regardless of the excuse, do not ride the horse.



Second visit: If you think the horse is worth a second visit, take an experienced friend or professional with you for the next visit. Someone that knows your level of riding, like your instructor, is preferred. Be prepared to pay for the time of a professional. See about negotiating the price with the horse's owner.

Don’t choose a horse just because it’s cheap. A problem horse is not for a beginner and will cost more in the long run.
Less attractive horses, horses with superficial scars or growths, horses of a less popular color and part, cross or unknown breeds, often go cheaper while not being less suitable, unless you intend to show.
Think about your horse five years or so from when you buy. Its not about today and tomorrow, its about the many years you will spend time together.

, Don't merely accept the horse and hand over the money.

, Though many people do not like having their horse on trial it makes the decision a lot easier. It allows you to ride the horse for two weeks, keep him at your house, and also allows you to show him and see how he performs. Discuss this with the owner of the horse; you may be able to come up with a decision.


Most trials are a one or two week term, but some can be up to one month or more. In this time you are responsible for the horse in every way.
Find or write a proper legal agreement for having the horse on trial. Include stating how the horse should be cared for, where he should be kept, what activities he should be used for, and what will happen if the horse becomes sick or injured, or dies while in your care. Also include lines for your and the owner's signatures.

,, Even if you are asked to pay for the tack, this will save you time. Many horse owners are more willing to give you tack and equipment or transport the horse for you than lower the price. However, make sure you have a knowledgeable horseman check the tack on the horse first to see if it fits.

, It may also save you to pay in cash and all at once instead of in payments.

, You can also ask your instructor to act as a reference. Show the owner proof of any equine achievements, such as competition wins or qualifications.

, Agree on a price, subject to vetting, and ask to put down a deposit (10%-20% of the price is very fair) to secure the horse from being looked at by other buyers.


Tell the owner if you don’t want the horse. It is polite and lets them know what’s happening.

, This is expensive but most insurance companies demand a health certificate, and often you'll need one to cross county or state borders.

, Keep these papers in a safe place where you won't lose them.

, This is optional but definitely advised.

, Buy feed from the current owner if necessary.

, Either a paddock or stall will work as long as the horse is separated from other horses for the first week or two. Get any basic equipment for feeding, grooming, traveling and some rugs if the horse needs them. You may get some of these with the horse.


Keeping your horse in a stall or pasture adjacent to other, friendly horses is ideal. This will let your horse meet the other horses will still being kept separate and away from harm.

, Usually a riding instructor or horse friend will allow haul your horse for you for a certain price. You can also haul the horse yourself if you have a trailer. Learn the local law of transporting horses and see if your driving license will work.


Many states (and even counties) will require a negative Coggins test and brand inspection before allowing you to cross their border.

, Keep to the horse's old routine as closely as possible for the first week.


It may take more than a week for the horse to feel his normal self again. Give him/her space but enough attention so the horse doesn't feel abandoned.
Remember that you'll need to slowly adjust your horse's diet over a period of 1-2 weeks.

, If you are keeping your new horse at your home, get him or her a buddy - perhaps an old retired horse, a goat, a miniature horse, or another similar creature. Horses are very social and it is near-abusive to deny them socialization.

, Train him, give him attention, and care for him. Treat him right and he'll do almost anything for you.

, Loaning a horse is similar to adopting one, but the owner will be a private owner. Loans can be long or short term.

, Sharing a horse involves caring and riding a horse for part of the week as well as making a financial contribution to the horses up-keep. The horse is usually owned by one person.

, This requires a signed contract, a monthly fee, and also commitment. Usually a leased horse will stay at the leaser's place and be ridden, fed, and done everything else with by the leaser. Some leases are longterm, others are short.

, This requires a lot less of a commitment but the horse won't be yours. It's similar to sharing a horse but no money passes hands.

If you see your foal doing these things, he is most likely ready to be weaned.;
, The natural weaning process generally begins when the foal is around six months old. If the mare has a health issue that makes it difficult for her to produce milk or care for her foal, weaning can be started from four months of age. However, before five months, the foal's digestive system is not fully developed so he may have a hard time processing solid food.


If the foal is weaned at this very young age, the foal risks not getting all the nutrition he needs, and his growth may be checked. This means he may grow slowly, fail to gain weight, and not reach his full physical potential at maturity. However, if the mother is sick, this may be a necessary risk.

, A foal that is ill needs the nutritional support offered by his dam's milk. A sick foal is also less likely to eat solid food, and thus deprives himself of much needed energy, minerals, and vitamins.


In addition, the stress of weaning can weaken the immune system at a time when it is needed to fight infection.

, Adequate preparatory groundwork will help to acclimatize the foal's digestive tract and decrease his stress while he is weaned from his mother’s milk.

, By around 10 to 12 weeks of age, the foal's nutritional needs for growth will most likely go beyond the amount of milk the mare can produce. Because of this, the foal will most likely start looking for alternative food such as hay, grass, or grain. This behavior indicates that the foals digestive system is changing to allow him to break down things other than milk.This may be delayed if the mare is producing lots of the milk, keeping the foal's stomach constantly full. He may not feel the need to explore other foods.

, Just as there are puppy and kitten foods, so there is creep feed for foals. This dry concentrate is designed to be easily digested and meet the nutritional needs of growing foals. The general recommendation is to feed half to three-quarters of creep feed per day for every 100-lbs of foal body weight.

, A common time to introduce creep feed is one month before weaning. Ideally the food is offered in a creep pen so that the amount consumed can be measured. A creep pen is a corral with a narrow entrance so that the foal can enter but the mare cannot; this allows you to know with certainty that any food that has been eaten has been eaten by the foal.


If you place the creep feed in the field or stable, you will have no idea which horse has eaten the feed and it can be difficult to know if the foal is taking in sufficient feed for his needs.

, Horses are social animals and if the foal is removed from his mother and has no companion, his stress will be magnified, making him less likely to eat.


The time to introduce him to new pals is about a month ahead of weaning, so that he is familiar with their presence when his mother disappears.

, One ideal companion a gentle horse that is unlikely to kick out and injure the foal (to this end it is a good idea to remove the horse's shoes).


Some horses make better ""nannies"" than others. A gentle gelding, an elderly mare, or miniature horses are less likely to be physically intimidating to the young horse.
The temperament of the nanny is also important—you want a gentle, accepting animal, rather than a strongly territorial animal that may see a foal as competition for resources and bully him.

, A foal of a similar age is also an ideal companion because the two animals may play together and learn social skills from one another. Also, they can be weaned at the same time and may turn to one another for mutual support at this stressful time.

, There are two methods of weaning: abrupt and gradual. Abrupt weaning refers to the sudden removal of the foal from the dam.The gradual weaning process more closely mimics weaning in the wild. During this process the foal is prepared for the final separation by experiencing periods of separation over a certain amount of time before he is actually separated.

, Gradual weaning requires a considerable investment in time, however, the process is closer to what happens in nature and therefore less stressful for all involved.


Abrupt weaning, on the other hand, is potentially more stressful for the dam, foal, and you. Stress causes the production of adrenaline and cortisol. This suppresses the immune system and lowers the foal's natural immunity to infection. The foal's immune system does not fully mature until he is 12 months of age, and therefore the stress of weaning can predispose a foal to problems such as gastric ulcers or a chest infection.

, The first factor is how much space is available to you. Abrupt weaning requires you to keep the dam out of the sight and earshot of her foal. This requires tens of acres of land and possibly stabling well away from the fields. If you do not have this facility then you either need to consider sending the dam off site to another yard, or a different method of weaning.

, Another factor is if the foal is used to being handled or not. If the answer is no, then abrupt weaning may be best. Once the dam is removed the human influence replaces her presence, and is established as the source of leadership for the foal.


However, if the foal is used to being handled then removing him from the dam's presence for short walks around the paddock prior to weaning greatly facilities gradual weaning.

, If abrupt weaning is handled in an insensitive manner, (such as not providing a companion for the foal within 24 hours, and keeping the foal isolated in a stable without any company company) foals are more likely to develop obsessive-compulsive behavioural disorders such as crib-biting or weaving.


These behaviors are akin to a child sucking their thumb. The repetitive nature of the rocking from side to side releases endorphins (morphine like chemicals) which gives the foal a natural high. He becomes addicted to the sensation and if the weaving becomes established, it is a very difficult, if not impossible, habit to break.

, In order to properly perform an abrupt separation, you must remove the mare from the foal’s sight and ear shot. You can do this by putting her in a holding stall, or by removing her to a different field or barn.

, As soon as the foal calms (this may take a few hours to a day, depending on the individual) re-introduce his playmates. The presence of other animals will help reassure and settle him. Horses are herd creatures. Being alone for long periods will only add to the foal’s stress so when he is calm put him back with animals he knows.

, Foals react differently. Some may settle quite quickly, but the majority cry and call for their mother—sometimes for hours. Some become very agitated and may try to escape and follow her.


When the dam is removed there is a greater risk of the foal hurting himself in a field or paddock. There are more potential places to injure himself such as fences, ditches, hedges, and water troughs, thus the safety of a stable is the preferred option. Remove anything that the foal might hurt himself on, such as a water bucket.

, One option to decrease the chances of your foal reacting badly to the separation is to ride the mare in the same field as the foal weeks before the separation. He then has the choice to run behind, or stop and graze with her in eyesight. This gives him the idea that his mother cannot constantly be at his side but it is nothing to worry about.

, Do this four to six weeks before the final weaning. Exercising the dam also helps the mare’s body to stop making milk. This makes her more likely to rebuff the attempts of an older foal (6 months plus) to suckle by giving him a gentle nip and sending him away. This can help make the gradual separation easier.


While riding the mare, you can also consider introducing the foal to a friend. If he is distracted with his new playmate, he will be less likely to panic when his mother leaves.

, If the foal is adequately prepared for the mare’s departure, then most foals are more relaxed and not worried by her absence. Even those that are upset make the adjustment, and accept she is no longer available for snacks, in the space of a few hours.


Some foals, on the other hand, may react badly and attempt to charge the fence, escape, or cry.

, Monitor the foal's growth before, during, and after weaning. This can be done by recording the foal's height and weight (or if you do not have the facilities to weigh the foal, use a tape measure around his girth to record the gain in body mass) on a weekly basis. Feed companies provide charts as to the expected gain over time in order to check the foal's progress.


If he is putting on too much weight then a decrease in his ration is appropriate, if he is not gaining sufficient weight then consider getting him checked by a veterinarian in case health issues are interfering with his appetite.

, When the foal is removed from the mare, the dam’s milk takes time to dry up. Abrupt weaning gives the mare’s body less time to do this. If the mammary glands get overly full, the mare runs the risk of developing mastitis, a bacterial infection. To keep your mare healthy:


Check for signs of mastitis every day. Signs include hot, painful, swollen mammary glands. If you notice any of these signs, contact the vet right away.

, Lowering the mare’s calorie count can help to keep her from developing mastitis. This is because a lower calorie count gives the mare less energy for milk production.

, It also helps to keep the dam out of earshot of the foal because his cries trigger prolactin release which tells her body to produce milk.

A clean, grassy pasture is more hygienic than a dirty stable, and the bacterial challenge to the newborn foal's immune system is lower.
In addition, there is more room in a pasture for the mare to move around, which facilitates the birthing process;
, Not just any piece of scrubland is suitable for birthing a foal — the pasture needs to be clean of feces, and be grassy and firm underfoot. The land also needs to be free of hazards such as barbed wire or ponds that the newborn foal could injure himself on.


You will also need good weather conditions to birth a foal outdoors; it is not nice for the mare to foal outside in heavy rain, plus the newborn foal will rapidly chill which could predispose him to illness.
You also need a pasture near to a light source such as a lamp or a fluorescent tube so that you can watch the mare's progress in case she gets into difficulties.
If she does need help, it can be difficult to catch her on open ground.

, The advantage of birthing in a stall is that you can keep a closer eye on the mare, and she is readily accessible if she experiences any problems.


It is easier to monitor her in the stable, and you will find it easier to disinfect the foal's navel or to clear any membranes from his mouth, if necessary.
The stable is also nice and sheltered, so it does not matter what the weather is outside when the mare is ready to give birth.

, In order to birth the foal indoors, the stall needs to be large — at least 14 foot (4.3 m) by 14 foot (4.3 m) — so that the mare can move around. Unfortunately, not everyone has access to a stable of this dimension.


The stall must be disinfected and filled with fresh, clean straw. Make sure to use straw rather than wood shavings, because the latter may stick to a damp newborn foal and get into his eyes.
A dirty stable also provides a challenge for the newborn foal's immune system and makes him more likely to pick up infection.

, Ahead of the delivery date, it's a good idea to assemble a foaling kit. Put the essentials in a bag such as a rucksack and be sure to leave it somewhere easily accessible. Listed below are basics for a good foaling kit.

, On a piece of stiff card (paper can get soggy, or blow away) write down the contact details for your veterinarian.


This should include the clinic number, the out-of-hours number, and the number of a second surgery in case your vet is unavailable when needed.
Also write down the number of a friend who is prepared to assist you if unforeseen circumstances arise, for example if you need to put the mare in a trailer and drive her to a clinic.

, Keep your cell phone fully charged and leave a charger in the foaling kit. The complete foaling process — from the first stage labor to the delivery of the placenta — can take up to 24 hours, so you need to have a back up plan for charging a flat battery.

, 80% of foalings happen at night, so be prepared and pack a torch along with some spare batteries. A head-mounted torch is ideal, because this leaves both hands free to assist if the need arises.

, A note pad and pen will be necessary to take note of the key timings, such as:


When the first stage of labor started, when the mare started pushing (second stage of labor), the time of delivery, the time the foal first suckled, and the time of placenta delivery (third stage of labor).
This is invaluable information that can help the veterinarian decide if intervention is required or not.

, You may be in for a long night, so don't forget a few home comforts such as a flask of tea or coffee, and some sandwiches.


When things get going it can be just 10 minutes from the time that the foal's front hooves start appearing to the foal being being born, so you don’t want to be somewhere else boiling the kettle and miss the main event.

, A camping stool is also a good idea, as it can get uncomfortable standing up for hours, or sitting on the ground. Likewise it can get chilly at night so a spare fleece, or a rug to cover yourself, could be welcome.

, It is the mare's job to lick the newborn foal dry after giving birth, but if for any reason she is incapacitated or distracted, you may need clean towels to rub the foal down immediately after birth.

, You will need a clean bucket with a lid to keep the placenta in after the mare has passed it. This is because the vet may want to inspect the placenta to check it is all present and that none was retained by the mare.

, It's a good idea to have a halter and lead rope easily at hand in case you need to move the mare for any reason, like if she needs to be taken from the field to indoors, or from the stall to a trailer to be taken to the vet clinic.

, It is useful to have a pack of sterile examination gloves, preferably obstetric ones (which are longer) in case you need to touch the foal during the birthing process. This reduces the risk of introducing contamination to the foal or the mare's vulva.

, A dilute solution of Betadine (an iodine-based antiseptic product) should be applied to the stump at foal's navel within an hour of birth.


The navel is where the placenta nourished the foal in the womb, but in the newborn it also provides a route of entry for bacteria into the foal's abdomen.
The navel should dry up and fall off within 3 to 4 days after birth, but in the meantime protecting it against ""navel ill"" (a bacterial infection in the exposed stump) is a good idea.

,, Secure it there by wrapping vet wrap around it. If the mare is a draft type, or has long feathering, be sure to wrap feathering and legs as well.

, If it is, gently wipe it clean with some warm water and soap.

, You shouldn't ever use shavings with a mare about to foal because the shavings could get up the foal's nostrils.

,, Hopefully your role in the foaling process will just be to observe the fact that everything is going smoothly. By far the best chance of a successful birth is if the mare does all the work, and you assist only if necessary.


However, you need to be informed enough about foaling to recognize when there is a problem. Therefore, it is essential to be familiar with what constitutes a normal foaling.
In order to prepare for the foaling process, you should ideally shadow someone whose mare is having a foal. If that is not possible, at the very least do some research online and read books, so that you know what to expect.
It's even more important to be able to identify what isn't normal, so you know when to call the vet.

, Giving birth is tiring and some older mares lack the energy to complete the process. If the has been in the second stage of labor for hours, lying down, pushing hard, looking at her flanks, and then she stops, this is cause for concern. It can be a sign that the uterine muscles are exhausted and no longer contracting. If this happens then she may well need oxytocin to restart the process, so contact your veterinarian immediately.

, During the second stage of labor (the active pushing part of labor), you should call the veterinarian immediate if you see a dark red, ropy swelling at the lips of the vulva. The mare may have premature separation of the placenta or be trying to pass it ahead of the foal. This deprives the foal of oxygen and is considered an emergency.

, The word ""dystocia"" means an abnormal birth. The regular order of a foal's delivery is first one front hoof appears, then a second, followed by the nose, head and shoulders, before finally the whole foal is delivered. If you see anything other than this sequence then the foal may be incorrectly positioned and could get stuck. Phone the vet immediately.

, The foal should gasp and breathe immediately after delivery. If the foal is not breathing, make sure the birth membranes are cleared from his mouth and nose. Try rubbing him vigorously with a towel, while someone else phones the vet.

, The third stage of labor is the delivery of the placenta. This is usually complete within 2 hours of the foal being born. If the placenta is not delivered, then contact your vet. A retained placenta can lead to a serious infection, or septicemia.

During these months, each cycle will last 18 to 23 days and the mare will be in heat for about 5 of those days.A mare’s cycling may begin as early as March and end as late as October or November. Some mares may have a transition period before the start of the cycling season or at its end, causing them to show signs of being in heat for weeks at a time.The part of a mare's cycle when she is not in heat is called diestrus.Rarely, certain medical conditions (ovarian tumors, equine Cushing’s disease, uterine infection, poor nutrition) can cause abnormal cycling behavior.;
, During the course of one reproductive cycle, your mare’s behavior will ebb and flow. Recording her behavior—the good, the bad, and the ugly—each day will help you estimate where she is in her cycle, especially when she is in heat. Make recorded observations specific. For example, instead of writing ‘She misbehaved,’ write the details of her bad behavior (‘didn’t follow instructions,’ ‘tried to kick’).Keep the diary for about a month. Remember to include your mare’s behavior around other horses, especially stallions.This will help you and your veterinarian devise a strategy for managing your mare when she is in heat.
Make the journal a team activity. Whoever is around your mare (yourself, trainers, caretakers) should record her behavior. It may even help to make a video recording of her behavior., Mares can display a range of behaviors during their cycles. Behaviors associated with estrus include elevating the tail, ‘winking’ the vulva (vulva opens and closes), and squirting urine and mucus during a squat. A mare in heat may also decrease her overall activity level.Gait abnormalities can also occur when a mare is in heat.You may find that your mare is very distracted when she is in heat. She probably won’t follow your instructions very well when you are riding or training her.When she in heat, your mare may also become more irritable and easily startled, as well as very sensitive to the touch. Ovulation can be painful, making your mare more sensitive.Be aware that some of her bad behavior may actually be associated with her coming out of heat., If your mare's behavior when she is in heat becomes dangerous to herself, other horses, or you, consider taking her to your veterinarian. He or she will evaluate your mare for reproductive soundness and determine whether reproductive abnormalities or other medical conditions are causing your mare’s dangerous behavior.Your veterinarian will likely take blood samples and perform rectal palpitations on your mare to accurately determine where she is in her cycle.It may take several veterinary visits before your veterinarian can accurately diagnose your mare and devise an effective treatment plan.Your mare may also need veterinary evaluation if her heat-related behaviors are affecting her ability to train and compete.
Bring your daily journal to your veterinary visits.

, Hormone therapy is a great way to deal with a mare in heat, particularly if her heat-related behaviors are negatively affecting her training schedule or ability to compete. Progesterone has been shown to be the most effective hormone to suppress a mare’s heat, but estradiol (a form of estrogen) and oxytocin can also be effective.Following examination, your veterinarian will be able to recommend the ideal hormone therapy treatment plan for your mare.


Since these synthetic hormones mimic your mare’s naturally circulating hormones, it is unlikely that you will run into problems with competition drug rules.However, you should still check the rules before starting your mare on hormone therapy.
If your mare's heat-related behaviors are merely annoying, and don't have a major impact on her training or competitiveness, then hormone therapy is probably not necessary.

, Naturally, progesterone is highest during diestrus. The synthetic form of progesterone will keep your mare in diestrus and prevent her from entering estrus. The most common form of commercially available progesterone is Regu-Mate, a daily synthetic progestin.Regu-Mate comes in an oral formulation, which you can either add to your mare’s feed or administer directly into her mouth via a syringe. The oral formulation is oily and can be messy, so adding it to her feed may be a little easier.Regu-Mate is also injectable. However, the daily intramuscular injection could cause soreness and scar tissue development at the injection site.With the injectable formulation, it will take about 24 hours to see an effect.Heat is usually suppressed within 3 days with the oral formulation.You can stop giving Regu-Mate at any point. When you stop giving it, your mare will return to heat within about 5 days.You must wear nonporous gloves when giving your mare Regu-mate! It can absorb into human skin and cause abnormal cycles in women, as well as infertility in both men and women., On its own, progesterone may not be very effective in reducing your mare’s irritability or other behavioral issues when she is in heat.This is because progesterone does not stop your mare’s ovarian activity, meaning that follicles can continue to develop in her ovaries. The addition of estradiol 17ß would suppress follicular activity and thus may help address the behavioral problems.A progesterone + estradiol hormone therapy regimen can be given in either a short- or long-acting formulation.Your veterinarian will let you know which would be best for your mare.

, Oxytocin is another hormone that can prevent your mare from coming into heat by keeping her in diestrus. It is an injectable formulation that should be given twice a day for 14 days after your mare has ovulated (your veterinarian can help you make that determination). Oxytocin can keep your mare in diestrus for up to 30 days. She would likely tolerate the daily injections because of the small amount of drug that you would inject.Oxytocin does not have many side effects and may actually be less expensive than other hormone therapy options., There are some other therapeutic options for dealing with a mare in heat. For example, you could give your mare herbal supplements. However, herbal supplements have not undergone rigorous scientific testing, and can have variable effectiveness. They may also violate medication rules in sporting associations, so check with these associations before giving your mare herbal supplements.There are a number of herbs you could consider, including chaste tree berry (hormone level regulation), European angelica (reduction of unpleasant hormone-related symptoms), red clover (estrogen-like effects), and motherwort (reduction of irritability). Talk with your veterinarian before giving your mare herbal supplements.
Surgical removal of your mare’s ovaries (‘Oophorectomy’) is another option, but should be a last resort.Although your mare will stop cycling, she may still exhibit heat-related behavior.Implantation of small, sterile marbles into a mare’s uterus has been shown to suppress estrus.The marbles can keep a mare out of heat for up to 90 days, but this method has variable effectiveness., When your mare’s hormones are surging, it will be difficult for her to focus on tasks that she would normally be able to do quite easily. In addition, she will not want to be as active when she is in heat. For these reasons, you may need to adjust your mare’s work schedule when she in heat.


Pick exercises that can help her focus, such as jumping combinations or changes in gait or direction. Give her something that she already knows how to do, since she probably won’t be able to learn anything new while she is in heat., With your mare being extra sensitive to touch while she is in heat, especially near her hind end, avoid approaching her from where she cannot see you.If your mare has a winking vulva when she is in heat, the constant opening and closing of her vulva could lead to an uncomfortable condition called pneumovagina (air enters the vagina). Pneumovagina can make your mare very irritable, so it would be best to stay away from her back end as much as you can., Depending on your method for grooming your mare, you may need to readjust it while she is in heat. If you do not do so already, begin grooming her at her neck and shoulders, where she will probably not be too sensitive to your touch. Slowly and carefully, work your way back to her flank.Pay close attention to your mare’s body language when grooming her. If she is growing increasingly agitated, especially as you work your way back on her body, stop your grooming session.

Foal should pass the meconium (first feces) within three hours., This is always the first thing to do with a newborn foal.

, You can do this using a clean film canister or small, paper cup. This should be done as soon as possible to help prevent bacteria from entering the foal's abdomen.


Do not cut the umbilical cord. It should break by itself soon after birth, or with the mare's help. If it doesn't fall off within 10 minutes, call your vet for further instructions.

, Begin by rubbing it all over and carefully using a finger to desensitize each 'opening' (ears, mouth, nostrils, rectum, etc.). This is the beginning of the foal trusting and bonding with you, which will help in the long run.

, The most important aspect concerning a newborn foal is to be sure that it begins nursing soon after it is up and walking.


The foal should be standing within one hour, and nursing within two. If it isn't, consult your vet.The first of the mare's milk contains colostrum, which is rich in the antibodies that the foal needs to develop a strong immune system against common diseases, as long as the mare had been current on her vaccines prior to foaling.
The drinking of the colostrum must be done within the first 24 hours of life, as that is the only time period in which the foal's stomach will be able to absorb and process the antibodies. Without colostrum, the foal will be extremely susceptible to many conditions, especially upper respiratory viruses (Flu, Rhino, etc.).
Most foals have little problem with figuring out how to nurse, as long as the mare is tolerant of this new creature! If there is any question as to whether or not the foal is nursing correctly, give your vet a call.
If the foal is low, or has had no colostrum, it is imperative that she/he receive an IV transfusion of antibody-rich plasma, to obtain these much-needed antibodies. Once the vet has determined that the antibodies are present, you know that the foal will have a relatively disease-free start in life.

, Your new foal should be seen within one to two days of foaling, and the dam examined at that time too. Your vet will be able to determine if the foal has the proper antibodies with a simple blood test, which can normally be done on-site.

, Open pasture with shelter is the ideal situation. This gives the foal room to run and move, which is essential for early muscle and body development.


The pasture should be well fenced (non-climb fencing is recommended) to prevent the foal (and/or dam) from escaping or getting caught up in the fence, which can cause serious injuries.
This also gives the foal the chance to start browsing grass, etc., which will further help in developing their digestive system as it gets closer to weaning time (normally at 5-6 months).

, If the mare is current with her vaccines, there is no need to vaccinate the foal until 3-4 months of age. The most common foal vaccines are 4-Way (Eastern/Western Encephalitis, Tetanus and Flu), and depending on the foal's environment, Rhino, West Nile and Strangles vaccines can be given at this time as well. It is extremely important that the vaccines are repeated (booster shots) 3-4 weeks following the initial vaccines.

, As far as deworming your foal, it's normally best to start at 3-4 weeks of age, depending on environmental conditions (clean stalls, pastures, proper husbandry). Your vet can also perform a fecal analysis on your foal to see what type and how many, if any, internal parasites are present.

, The more time you can spend handling your foal (getting her/him used to their feet being picked up, halter being put on and off, and generally being touched all over), the better your experience will be in the long run. Of course there are myriad books written on how to properly train foals, but that subject is for another topic.

Let yourselves enjoy, trust, and get to know each other, and that will start the foundation for a long-term fulfilling relationship."

Look for a lip tattoo on racing horses.,
Learn the symbolism used in horse tattoos.,
Research your horse's brand.,
Look for clues in your horse's name.",How to Research a Horse's Bloodline3," Horses that have raced on a track in the United States will usually have a tattoo on their upper lip. If your horse has this kind of tattoo, you're in luck. The Jockey Club offers a free tattoo lookup service.You can use this service either by contacting the Club directly or via its official site., The upper lip tattoo used for racing horses almost always follows a recognizable pattern &mdash: first a letter or symbol, then a series of numbers. There are a few things you can learn from this ""code"" even if you don't contact the Jockey Club:


If the tattoo starts with a letter, the horse is a thoroughbred. The letter corresponds to the year of its birth. Click here for a guide to which letter matches up with each year.
If the tattoo starts with an asterisk, the horse is an appendix horse (a cross between a thoroughbred and a quarter horse).

, The symbols used in a horse's brand can reveal clues about its age, breed, birthplace, and more. Ranches and farms often have their own unique brands — other times, breeders use systems of symbols to encode information into the brand. Unfortunately, since brands vary widely, there isn't a single convenient way to figure out what your horse's brand means, but a quick search engine query or a call to your breed registry should get you started.

, When it comes to horses, there can be a surprising amount of information in a name. While not all names carry significant meaning, many horses are named after an important sire (male ancestor). Some are even named after the location where they were raised. This varies greatly by breed and bloodline.


As an example, Shire horses will often use the name of the barn or farm they were born at as part of their names.

Check the mare's behavior around stallions.,
Watch your breeding mare for signs of heat.,
Have a veterinarian perform a transrectal palpation.,
Have a veterinarian use ultrasound to determine whether the mare is pregnant.",How to Check a Mare for Pregnancy1," A mare who is suspected to be pregnant can be brought into contact with a stallion fourteen days after contact with the stallion to observe whether her behavior indicates possible pregnancy. If the mare is pregnant, she will likely refuse the advances of the stallion and not show her rear to the stallion as she would during heat.Although it's good to be aware that a mare that is not in heat may also refuse the stallion's advances for other reasons.;
, Some mares raise their tails, open and close the lips of the vulva, and squat to squirt urine or mucus in addition to becoming generally difficult during their heat cycles.If the mare shows these behaviors 21 days after having been potentially impregnated, she is not pregnant., A veterinarian can perform a transrectal palpation 16 to 19 days after the mare has been with a stallion. The vet puts his or her hand in the mare's rectum to check the uterus for indications of pregnancy. These indications include the size and/or shape of the uterus and the nature of the swellings on her ovaries., An ultrasound requires the vet to insert a probe into the mare's rectum to take pictures that can confirm pregnancy. From 16 days, the pregnancy can be detected, and at 55 to 70 days they might be able to determine the sex.The ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the uterus and can monitor the heartbeat of a fetus.
Ultrasound is the preferred method of telling whether a mare is pregnant, as it is the most reliable."
"
Have a blood test performed on your mare.,
Give your breeding mare a urine test.,
Confirm pregnancy test results.",How to Check a Mare for Pregnancy2," A pregnant mare can be checked for pregnancy hormones to determine pregnancy. This is especially useful when the mare is too irritable for non-chemical methods of determining pregnancy or when the rectum is too small for physical evaluation.Have a veterinarian take a blood sample. The vet will send the blood sample to a laboratory and have it tested.
Test the level of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) 40 to 100 days after your mare has been with a stallion.
If your mare was pregnant but lost the fetus, the PMSG test may give inaccurate results.
Analyze the level of oestrone sulphate 100 days after the breeding. Oestrone sulphate levels increase with the presence of a foal, but go back to normal if the fetus is aborted.

, When checking mares for pregnancy, oestrone sulphate can be found in the mare's urine. A urine test can be performed by a veterinarian or using a home test.Obtain a home pregnancy testing kit from a feed store or online.
Test your breeding mare's urine 110 to 300 days after they have been with a stallion.
Cut a 1 gallon (3.8 L) or 2-liter liquid container in half with a knife. Use the bottom to collect your mare's urine.
Follow the directions on the pregnancy test kit to analyze your mare's urine. It takes 10 minutes to obtain the results.

, Using chemical-based tests can indicate that your mare is pregnant, but it is good to have another test performed by a vet—whether chemical or non-chemical—to ensure the foal has not slipped the foetus. Also, chemical-based tests are sometimes used improperly, so a positive result should be confirmed by a veterinarian."
"
Make sure that you have a large paddock for the mare to graze and exercise, in the coming months before birth.,
Realize that the coming months are important for the growth of the foal.,
Look into the correct vaccination schedule for pregnant mares.,
Pay attention to safety and nutrition.,
When the mare eats, only feed enough so that she'll eat it then walk away.,
Exercise your mare.,
When the mare is about a month to foaling, move her to a smaller yard where she can run around, but that is more sheltered and is fenced in to protect from wild dogs etc.,
Recognize the signs of late-stage pregnancy.,
You will probably miss the birth of the foal as they usually foal in the early hours of the morning between 12 and 5.,
If you find that the mare has foaled, ensure that the placental membrane is entire - spread the membrane out on the ground, there should be one large tear where the foal emerged.,
Ensure the foal is alive and walking.,
Make sure the foal drinks and urinates.,
At first you may want to keep the foal and mare in a small yard, but after about 3 days, move the foal to a bigger paddock and let the foal exercise.

,
Leg deformities are common in young foals and some are much helped by extending the confinement time.",How to Care for a Pregnant Mare," This bigger paddock will be the mare's home for the first 8 and a half months. This paddock should have 24/7 access to water, shelter and adequate fencing.;
, If the mare has inadequate feed, nutrients and water, the foal may be aborted due to dehydration or any other natural cause. Conversely, a fat mare is more likely to produce a foal with angular leg deformities and she will be much more prone to difficulty foaling. Light regular exercise is good for a pregnant mare!

, The mare needs pneumabort at 5, 7 and 9 months to prevent abortion from rhino. Rhino is brought in by new horse's, lives in the ground and can be In the water. One month prior to foaling she should be wormed and have a five way spring vaccines, rabies and West Nile. She should also have Potomac fever and botulism, depending on where you live. This will ensure she passes on the right immune cells to the foal.

, The mare needs not be watched 24 hours a day. But she should be checked daily to make sure everything is running smoothly. Her feeding program should consist of forage or bulk and foods rich in protein, energy, minerals and vitamins. For a mare of 15 hands a diet would consist of approximately: 7kg per day of high quality roughage (GOOD quality hay). If she is grazing plentiful high quality pasture this can be reduced. A balanced concentrate mash containing chaff, a good quality mineral supplement and a high energy/protein feed. Many feed suppliers offer a balanced 'mare mix' that only needs to be mixed with chaff. Follow the directions with feeding rates - some feeds are more concentrated than others, so just 'giving her a bucketful' is not the right approach. Her needs will change as the pregnancy progresses, follow the advice on the product packaging.

, Have adequate roughage (hay or pasture) so the mare can eat as she pleases - horses are 'trickle feeders', and should have access to roughage AT ALL TIMES. Avoid feeding your mare in the morning and evening and her having nothing in between - if she does not have access to pasture, feed hay in a small-weave hay net to extend the feeding time as much as possible. This applies to all horses, particularly in stables, and reduces the incidence of gut ulcers and colic.

, If she is a riding horse, you can ride her lightly up to basically when she foals, but it's totally up to you. Alternatively you can lunge her, and groom her to get the blood circulating. If the mare is used to affection and attention, she will be less likely to be aggressive or nasty when the foal is born. Handling her teats and underneath her belly is a very good idea - mares unaccustomed to this kind of contact may kick at the foal when it tries to nurse!

, At this time, increase her feed slightly, but do not add anything new, as this may upset her system and cause colic, etc.

,


About 2 weeks before foaling, you will see her pregnant belly move from a hanging position to a position that fills out her flank area.
When she has about 1 week to go, you will notice her udder increasing, some mares you won't depending on how many foals they have had.
About 4 days before, the foal would have moved back into the position to be born.
About 24 to 48 hours before birthing, the mare's teats will become waxy. This precedes the first milk, or 'colostrum' which contains the immune cells vital to your foals health. Foals are not born with immune cells present in the blood - they receive them from the mare's colostrum. If you follow the correct vaccination routine for the mare in the months leading up to the birth, she will pass on all the immunity your foal needs. As the mare gets closer, the 'caps' might fall off and milk may trickle out - you may see it as a gummy coating on her legs. If your mare runs a great deal of milk before she foals, she may pass all of her colostrum and deprive the foal of it's essential immunity. This leaves the foal weak and highly susceptible to infection. Your vet can easily check your foals immunity levels with a blood test at 24 hours of age. If you suspect that your mare has passed all her colostrum before foaling, ask your vet for a serum glutaraldehyde test (IgG test), it is cheap and easy to do, and can make a great deal of difference to the early health of your foal.

, But if you're lucky enough to see it, keep in the background as you may cause her to stop pushing and alter the natural process. Do not startle her with camera flashes or a crowd of people watching. She will become restless as she is preparing to foal and may pace the fence, paw at the ground and roll repeatedly. Eventually she will lie down and begin pushing in earnest. The first thing visible should be some of the bluish white membrane, then the front hooves of the foal with its nose resting on top. From this point it should take a maximum of around 20 minutes for the delivery to take place. Any longer than this, or anything other than front feet and nose presented, and you should call your vet. If the membrane is bright red the mare is having a 'red bag' delivery, meaning the placenta has separated from the uterus early. This means the foal is no longer receiving oxygen from the mare through the placenta, and can be severely compromised. (see Neonatal Maladjustment Syndrome or 'dummy foal') It is important that the foal is delivered as quickly as possible in this case. Call the vet.

, Any pieces missing my be retained inside the mare causing severe infection and blood poisoning. Your mare will display colic symptoms and a rapid rise in temperature in the next few days if this is the case. The membrane should be a healthy pink colour, a green or yellow cast can indicate placentitis, and brown muck means that the foal has passed some meconium during the birthing process, usually a sign of a protracted or difficult labour. If the membranes are turned inside out a red bag delivery is very likely. Sometimes it can take a while for the mare to pass the membrane - never pull the membrane from the mare as this can tear it or cause her to hemorrhage. If it is dragging on the ground or tangling her legs it can be tied up into a ball with twine.

, Your foal should begin trying to stand quite soon after foaling, and should be nursing within two hours at the most. Check its reactions and look around the paddock for sticky black manure (called Meconium), which is the first manure the foal passes just after birth. This can be difficult to pass, particularly for colts as their pelvis is narrower. If the foal displays signs of a retained meconium (repeated straining, flagging or agitated switching of the tail) administer an enema or call your vet to do so.

, If it doesn't, watch for the next 24 hours and if nothing happens, call a vet to look at the foal.

,, If your foal has lax tendons ('down on its bumpers' - the foal will walk on its heels or even pasterns or fetlocks, and the hooves will tip upward with toes off the ground) box or yard rest is advisable to stop it running about and damaging its legs. This condition will resolve itself as the foal strengthens. Contracted tendons, where the foal is 'knuckled over' and walks on its toes, may require splinting to reduce the risk of pulling tendons and ligaments from their attachments.

Be prepared to call in a veterinarian.",How to Breed a Horse," Know that there is a considerable amount of cost involved with breeding a horse. There are fees for the stallion to breed with the mare, plus insurance costs to protect you should the mare kick out and damage the stallion, plus transport costs to get the mare to the stallion and back. Bear in mind that she may not become pregnant on the first attempt and so this may need to be repeated.


Instead of using a stallion, you can also opt for artificial insemination. This process, in which semen is inserted directly the mares uterus, will require you to pay for the semen, which stallion owners sell, as well as the procedure to implant it.;
, Be aware there are veterinary costs involved to check that the mare is well enough to establish a pregnancy and is free from uterine infections, for pregnancy diagnosis, vaccination against equine herpes virus, tetanus, West Nile virus, and equine encephalitis, during pregnancy, and the cost of covering any complications with foaling., All in whole do not go into breeding from some misty eyed idea of ""it would be nice"" but have a solid reason for producing a foal. For example, any difficulties during foaling can lead to long-term problems or death of the foal, so if you are breeding for the first time it is advisable to send the mare to a foaling facility where she can be kept under constant surveillance during the last month of her pregnancy.. These facilities are expensive and you can expect to pay around $300-500 for the foaling plus the cost of her board for a month.Indeed, you will also incur additional costs for consumables, such as feed (in the last third of pregnancy), stabling, bedding, and electricity.
Then when you have a live healthy foal, it is going to be at least two years until you can saddle the animal, and you have no guarantee of its temperament, so it may not be suited for the purpose for which you bred it.

, The mare is a seasonal breeder, which means that increasing daylight length stimulates her brain to produce hormones that bring her into heat. The mare typically cycles (has heat periods) from spring through to late summer or early autumn.It is possible to artificially manipulate the mare's reproductive cycle by stabling her and exposing her to electric light in winter, which can bring on her heat cycles. This is sometimes done with thoroughbred mares, whose foals are intended for racing, as their birth date has implications for which racing classes they will be entered in., The best age to breed a mare for the first time is once she has finished growing herself, at around three to four years of age. It is possible to breed from 18 months, but this places a lot of demands on the body of a mare that is still growing itself. At the other end of the scale, it can be more difficult to get a mature mare to fall pregnant for the first time.

, The ideal time for a foal to be born is between May and July, when there is plentiful nutritious grass available for the mare to graze on which will benefit her milk supply. Thus, the best time to breed the mare is around June, July, and August, so that she foals 11 months later. , When using a stallion to cover a mare, the owner of the stallion will want to know that the mare is clean and does not have any transmissible equine reproductive diseases. They will expect the mare to be swabbed prior to mating.


This is done by a veterinarian who swabs the vagina, usually during a heat cycle.The swab is sent to a lab where any organisms are cultured and identified.

, Make sure your mare is in the prime time of her heat for reproduction. Each estrus cycle takes around 21 days, with the mare being in estrus or 'heat' for an average of 6 days in every 21. She ovulates and is therefore most likely to get pregnant one to two days before the end of the heat, but this does vary with individuals.


For the maximum chance of conception ideally the mare would be covered by a stallion on day 2 or 3 after the beginning of heat, and continue on alternate days until the heat finishes.
It can be tricky to know when a mare is coming into season. Some stud farms employ the use of ""teaser"" stallions who the mare can see but not reach. When she is in heat her hormones make her more interested in seeking male attention and so she may become flirtatious towards the male.
In addition, a female horse coming into heat may show signs, such as increased interest in other horses, a change in temperament that is often characterized as moodiness, and increased frequency of urination., It can be difficult to visually detect pregnancy, especially in stockier wide-framed mares. A swollen belly may not be evident until the final third of pregnancy, and even then, weight gain from additional food can be mistaken for a foal. The development of mammary glands is used in other species to indicate pregnancy, but again this may not happen in the horse until a month before foaling, and even then ""bagging up"" can be the result of a false pregnancy.To detect pregnancy a veterinarian can perform a transrectal ultrasound exam. A special probe is inserted into the rectum and the scan directed toward the uterus. This can be done from around 12 - 17 days after mating, to look for changes associated with pregnancy.If this option is not available then a blood test can be run from day 45 - 120, which looks for the presence of a hormone, equine chorionic gonadotropin, that is a marker of pregnancy. It should be noted that no test is foolproof and it is possible to get false positive results, however a negative test is definite confirmation that the mare is not pregnant., Pregnancy lasts just under a year and is on average 340 days with a leeway of 20 days in either direction considered normal. The mare should be fed her usual ration during the first two-thirds of the pregnancy. This is because being overweight at the time of birth is a major factor causing complications during foaling.


The mare can be ridden during the first two-thirds of pregnancy, and indeed keeping her fit and well is an important part of building her stamina for foaling, which is an extremely physical event.

, Carrying the growing foal will put a lot of strain on the mares body, so during the last third of a mare's pregnancy you should treat her more delicately. Don't ride her and feed her more food, which she will need to grow the foal.

, Mares usually foal at night, and seem to need dark and quiet in order relax enough to foal. The first stage of labor, where the uterus tones up and prepares to push the foal out, is characterized by restlessness and pacing, swishing the tail as if irritated, and general crankiness.


During this time the position of the foal changes, getting ready to be presented into the birthing canal.
You do not need to intervene with the horse at this point. It just means that you need to keep a closer eye on her once she goes into labor.

, As the mare gets ready for second stage labor and pushing the foal out she will frequently break into a sweat.During this stage of labor the mare will lie down with her legs extended and push hard. She may stand and lie down again repeatedly during the process, until the foal is pushed out.


Close observation is advisable during this stage, either by remote camera or by an observer sitting quietly out of the way with a torch., If the mare is straining hard with not progression of the foal for 20 - 40 minutes then immediate veterinary attention should be sought. It is best to have a veterinarian on standby for just this type of emergency during the birth.

"
"
Find a place where the mare should foal.,
Be prepared if the mare decides to foal early.,
Sometimes it may help to get a foaling prediction kit to determine when the mare is really about to foal.,
Give the mare privacy.",How to Deliver a Foal1," This can range from out on pasture or in a small enclosure like a shed, corral or box stall.


A foaling stall should be at least 14' by 16' or larger to minimize the risk of the mare lying too close to the wall during her labour.
If the mare has to foal in a stall or shed, it must be thoroughly cleaned.

Take out all old bedding and scrub down the entire stall (floor, walls, everything) with disinfectant. Then sprinkle the floor with lime before putting on new bedding.

Straw is best as bedding, because it won't stick to the foal as easily as wood chips or sawdust will, nor will it get into his/her nostrils and get sucked into his/her air passageways, nor get swallowed by the mare when she cleans him/her off.

Wood products may carry a bacteria called Klebsiella which can cause uterine infections.






Remove all obstacles from the stall, from feed tubs to buckets or anything else that may get in the way of the mare during her labour.
Clean the mare's udder, belly, rear and upper legs or any place that a foal would nuzzle when trying to find the udder, with warm water and chlorhexidine to reduce contamination to the foal.

This is especially useful if there has been any cases of E. coli and other foal-hood diseases on the farm. Washing her just before foaling also greatly reduces risks of diarrhea and septicimia in the foal.


Pick up all manure several times a day so the mare has no chance of getting dirty.
A level grassy pasture is a good place to consider, especially if the mare is foaling during the time of year where the pasture isn't muddy or full of snow or both.

Make sure the pasture is free of brush, rocks, old nails, machinery, ditches or even puddles of water.

Foals have been known to drown in tiny pools of water, and get stuck on their backs in a dry ditch. Foals can even die if they have their backs under a fence and can't get up; mostly because the mare choose to foal right beside the fence.


Consider the advantages and disadvantages of foaling out on pasture:


Advantages:

Less risk of infection
More natural environment where mare can seek her own privacy and be less upset and nervous
Better exercise and muscle tone for the mare
More natural bowel movements than a confined mare would have on grass hay and grain because she won't be as constipated when giving birth.



Disadvantages:

Difficult for you to keep constant watch on her
Foaling on pasture not advisable in bad weather or in winter.





;
, Usually mares that foal for the first time may start labour earlier than those mares that are more experienced.


Mares that foal in the spring or summer may have a shorter gestation period than those who foal in winter months (January, February or March). Most vets believe that the time of year is the largest factor affecting length of pregnancy in all mares.
Some mares are set on their own schedules, and this can be more reliable than her age, how many other foals she's had, and the time of year.
Illness or infection can cause a mare to foal earlier or later than normal, if the fetus has been nutritionally deprived due to poor placental attachment in the uterus.

If she's 3 or 4 weeks past her due date, have your vet check her out to make sure there's nothing wrong.



, Things like test strips for checking the mare's milk before foaling, TV or security cameras installed in the stall to monitor the mare 24/7, Baby Buzzer (Locust Farms, Kirkland OH), the Birth Alarm (Kincardine, ON) or the Foal Alert (Foalert Inc., Acworth, GA) are some things to try out if you don't want to be spending nights in the barn waiting for the mare to pop.

, It is best to observe her quietly from a place where she cannot see nor hear you. A mare can get easily upset of people are always hovering around her, and naturally would rather have her foal where it's quiet, secluded and peaceful. This is why most mares like to foal at night.

"
"
A month before the mare foals her udder starts looking fuller and larger especially at night when at rest.

,
Around 2 weeks prior to foaling udder remains larger, filled with milk, and will also look shiny.

,
A few days before foaling, the muscles on each side of the tail head around the hooks (pelvic bone) sink in.,
The vulva starts to look loose and relaxed and even swollen.,
Secretions from the teats may start.,
Mares that begin labour process will show changes in her attitude or behaviour.,
Mild uterine contractions prepare the dam for delivery.",How to Deliver a Foal2,",, That's because the muscles are relaxing and drooping away from the base of the tail.

, Often it will look larger and more floppier than normal.

,


This is called ""waxing,"" and is often the most common signs that a mare is near, within 24 to 36 hours of foaling. Waxing is a congealing of secretions from the teats that are forced out to the end of the teat. There are always exceptions, though.

Some mares may not even start waxing or bag up until right after birth. Others may have a huge bag for weeks and be waxing for days as well.

The funny thing is, the most predictable thing about mares is that they're always unpredictable!





, She may try to find a place in a far corner away from the rest of the herd, or stand with a faraway look in her eye.


She may also become restless, pacing around, then eating a little, then pacing again.

If you suspect she's in early labour, check on her every 10 to 15 minutes.



, The uterine contractions help get the foal positioned properly for birth so the head and front legs are aimed at the birth canal, towards the rear of the dam.


Pelvic muscles relax more fully, the tail rises, and her sides above her flanks appear more caved in. This is the time that the foal is shifting position.

"
"
The dam will be more nervous and restless than initially in during the early labour stage.

,
As active labor comes about, the mare will be switching her tail, pacing more, pawing, or nosing at her flank.,
The mare may be getting up and down once the contractions come faster and more intensively.,
The water sac will appear first, amber-coloured.,
The birth of the foal usually doesn't take long, often within 5 to 30 minutes after the last stage of early labor began and the water bag showed.,
For large foals or hard birth,s you will need to pull the foal, if you can.",How to Deliver a Foal3,",


This is the time to bandage up her tail, using a clean bandage or nylon stocking or pantyhose to prevent the foal from picking up dirt on his way out of the birth canal.
Also supply fresh bedding (making sure it's soft and deep enough for her and her foal) and, if there's time, gently washing her teats, udder legs and buttocks with soap and water and a mild disinfectant if they're dirty.

Leave her be, but still keep checking on her (without her seeing or hearing you).



, She may give birth laying on her side, or up on her feet, depending on how she feels.

, The sac may have burst inside her, with instead amber-coloured liquid streaming out from her vulva.

,



Cows can safely be in active labour for longer than 20 to 30 minutes but it's different for a mare. If she's taking longer than 30 minutes to foal, assistance is needed immediately.

Mares at this point are pushing so strongly that they can kill their foals or push only part of it through her uterus.

Either the foal is presented wrong (dystocia), or it's too big and not coming through the birth canal readily.




Foals in normal presentation come front-fee-head first. A clear whitish membrane filled with fluid will appear then in a moment, the feet should be visible within.
The foal's nose should appear tucked between them.
Usually the feet are not even; this is because foals often come through the birth canal one shoulder at a time.
Once the shoulders come, then the rest will follow.

, If the large foal is presented normally but unable to fully get through the birth canal, loop obstetrical/calving chains on the foals forelegs, and pull with the contractions.


Pull out and down (if she's standing), or out and toward the mare's hocks, keeping in line with the birth canal.

If it's an exceptionally hard pull, you may need to have one person on each leg of the foal.



"
"
Call the veterinarian if you suspect your mare is having trouble foaling due to dystocia.

,
Get the mare up, if possible.,
Don't wait for the vet to arrive.,
Wash your hands, glove up and lube up.,
Reach in through the vagina and determine what presentation the foal is in.,
The sooner you get the foal out, the better!

",How to Deliver a Foal4,", Put a halter on her and pull on her head or tap her hindquarters to encourage her to get up.

, No matter if it's a simple problem that is easy to correct or a more serious and complicated problem, you will have to try to correct it while you wait for the vet to arrive.


Most serious malpresentations will result in a dead foal.

, Cleanliness is a priority when handling the birth of foals.

, These are the following types of malpresentations, from the simple to the more complex:



One foot turned back: The foot may be flexed at the knee or at the fetlock, and will be easy to correct, by simply pushing on the leg that has already appeared, at the same time pulling on the missing one. If you can't find the missing foot, however, you will need vet assistance or try to get it back up yourself.

Wash up and lube up again, then go in and push the foal's nose back into the uterus and try to reach farther in to find the missing leg. Once you have gotten the leg flexed up enough that you can grasp the hoof with your hand, cup the hoof in your hand and bring it in and up so that it is under the foal's neck and over the pelvic rim.

Once the foal's back to normal, you can start pulling on the foals legs. Check and double check that the nose is in the right place and not pushed back too far.





Nose but no feet: Usually a foal in this position is one that is already dead. Push the foal back in the uterus far enough that you can manipulate both legs into the birth canal. Then pull the foal out.

Head turned back: Only attempt this if your vet cannot get there within the next 20 minutes. Push the foal back into the uterus with one hand and find the head with the other. The head may be turned back or down to one side. Try to get hold of the lower jaw and pull the head up into position. Often foals with this malpresentation die by the time they come out.

Belly presentation (Three or Four Feet at Once): This is a rare condition, and may only be discovered until you've already started pulling on the foal, thinking it is just a large foal. This type of dystocia is pretty well impossible to correct. A Caesarean section may be the only option to get this foal out, or if it's already dead, the vet will have to cut the foal in pieces.

Rotated transverse foal: This position, though rare (but more of a problem in draft mares) is where the foal is upside down and the head is turned back, often twisting in and upwards so much so that it is impossible to correct. Each part of the foal's body is also often in the uterus. The uterus can be tipped so that the foal cannot be reached from the birth canal. A C-section is the only way to safely deliver this foal.

Backward presentation: The foal can still be delivered, but more quickly so that he won't suffocate or inhale any of the surrounding fluid before he's completely out. You need at least two people to help you with this: one to hold the mare up, and another or two to help pull out the foal. Put OB chains on the rear legs of the foal, one half-hitch above the fetlocks and another below the hock joints, and pull with all your strength when the mare strains. Don't stop when the mare stops, as you need to get this foal out as quickly as possible to have it come alive. Get him breathing as soon as possible once he's out.

Breech: This presentation is much worse than a normal backwards presentation. This is because nothing protrudes as the mare is in labour, and when you reach in, all you feel is rump and tail. You need to get both back feet up so that you can get the foal out. To do this you will need to try to reach the hock and flex it as much as possible. Reach for the cannon bone and slide your hand to the foot. Cup the foot in the palm of your hand and bring it up over the pelvis into the birth canal. Repeat with the other leg and foot. Then follow the procedure above for delivering a backward foal.

If the feet cannot be reached either by you or the vet, a C-section will be necessary to deliver the foal.


Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta detaches too early and appears first before the foal. You will see a dark red mass coming out instead of the clear white amniotic sac. You will need to break through the thick membrane with your hands to get to the foal, then reaching into the birth canal to get a hold of the foal's legs and quickly pull him out.

,"
"
In normal unassisted births, a foal born live will break the sac on his own when he shakes his head.,
Get the foal breathing as quick as you can, clearing mucus away from his nose with a suction bulb.,
Once new momma and baby are delivered and the foal is breathing normally, leave them alone.,
Disinfect the navel stump with iodine.,
The afterbirth should soon follow 15 to 45 minutes later after birth, sometimes taking around 2 hours to be completely shed.,
Bag up the afterbirth immediately, then spread it out on a table to let it dry and have a look at it to see if it's intact and a health coloration or not.,
If all is well and both the mare and her foal are healthy and happy, enjoy watching the foal grow into a healthy new horse!

",How to Deliver a Foal5," If the membrane has not broken around his head, break it and make sure he's breathing.

, You may have to hold him upside down for a few seconds to get the fluid out. Tickle his nostril with a clean piece of straw if that doesn't work. Or, slap his ribcage if even that won't work. You can even try positioning him so that he's sitting on his chest and his head and chin is resting on the ground, allowing the fluid to run out. If any of those methods won't work, give artificial respiration to get him going.


Artificial respiration is done by cupping your hands firmly over his mouth and nose and breathing into his one nostril steadily and gently, letting his chest rise, then fall, then breathing in again. Keep going until he can breathe on his own.

, The mare will lie there for around 10 to 20 minutes before she gets back up and starts cleaning off her new baby.


A few minutes of rest is Nature's way of making sure the foal gets his full blood supply from the placenta before the mare gets up and tears the umbilical cord.

, With a small jar of iodine, immerse the cord completely without spilling any on the foal.

,


If it takes longer than a couple hours for the mare to expel the placenta, call your vet immediately.

NEVER try to remove the afterbirth from the mare, as this could lead to serious uterine infection.



, It should look like a pair of trousers that has one leg smaller than the other (with the ends of the legs closed), and only one tear at the ""waist"" where the foal came through.


If any part of the placenta is missing, it'll usually be the tip of one of the ""trouser legs.""
If the placenta weighs more than 15 lb, it is abnormal and may be diseased, something that you should get your vet to check out for you.

"
Make sure that the paddock is safe for a newborn.,
Make sure there is a shelter from prevailing weather.,
The area should be big enough that the foal can run and play as this helps the foal increase its muscles and allows it to find their legs.,
Now, on that note, make sure you have a small paddock that you have access to, in case you need to treat the mare or foal.,
The fence should be high enough that the mare can not jump the fence, foals and weanlings often jump fences to be with other horses, so it needs to be at least 150 centimeter (59.1 in) tall or 1 and a half meters.

,
Make sure the feed troughs are safe and have no sharp or pointy bits.,
Water should also be available.,
Okay, now that the area is suitable, you can begin to care for the foal.

,
When feeding the mare and foal.,
Okay, they are the basic feeds, you can also buy pre-mixed mare and foal feeds, which are excellent, depending of you wish to mix your own or to simple scoop and feed.

,
When feeding, provide the mare and foal with enough to fill 2 small buckets.,
By using a dollop of molasses, you encourage the foal to nibble at the feed.,
We all know the saying ""What goes up must come down"", well, in horses, ""What goes in comes back out"" Grown horses usually defecate about 12 times a day, depending on climate, feed and workload.,
Now, you're probably thinking, if I worm the mare, the worms will be gone?,
You are now set to care for a foal.,
Also, make sure you remove any obstacles such as rugs, (on or off horse) as the foal may become entangled.,
Many people throw a ball or something for the foal to play with, this is good, as the foal will be less likely to crib or windsuck, even at this young age.

",How to Care for a Foal," Ensure there are no gaps in fences that the foal can get its hoof stuck in. Ultimately, you should either have a paddock with small chicken wire, or with post and rail. The foal shouldn't go too close to the fence, but they do silly things!;
, A simple shelter with a door would be sufficient, but ultimately a stable would be far warmer, and protect the foal from the sun, rain, wind or the cold.

, If you watch a newborn, they are leggy and look like their on stilts. Imagine if they were confined to a small paddock with no room to run.........which would you prefer???

, The foal may need vaccinations or the mare may need treatment, a smaller paddock means you don't have to run after the mare whist scarring the foal.

,, Usually a rubber dish or a tyre feeder are great. You can also use a bathtub, making sure it has no sharp edges.

, The larger the facility the better, the mare and foal should have adequate water, and be unrestricted access to it. Water allows milk to be produced and water is another liquid the foal will drink. Although the foal won't drink it like the mare, the foal will play with it with its nose, and will introduce water to him, and when its time to wean, he'll know what it is.

,, you need to reduce certain feeds and increase other feeds. Depending on the current weight of the mare, breed and age as well as if you are showing the mare and and foal or if the mare is a broodmare, will suggest what feeds to feed. The following feeds are a basic recommendation for a basic feeding ratio. Bear in mind that some feed wouldn't suit certain horses and that it depends on access and availability.




Lucurn chaff or alfalfa: This provides the mare and foal with the correct amount of calcium, which makes the milk and helps the foal develop.
Oaten or wheaten chaff: This is simply a bulking feed, commonly used as a filler. It provides little or no essential vitamins or minerals. And can be given without any restrictions. It is non-offensive.
Cereal flakes etc- This is basically your wheat mix or cereal which we eat for breakfast. However, it has no fruit etc. You can buy this product in Australia from most feed companies. In America i am not sure if you can buy it, ask your feed stockist and they may be able to help.
Grain is often a feed that is reduced. However, it puts the weight back on the mares, and the foals often are much better and gain weight faster.
Vitamin supplements: This helps to improve the milk and helps when weaning the foal.



,, You can wet the food or moisten it, which makes it more palatable. Make sure though, that you remove any left over feed at the next feed time, as when wet the feed with become sour and may cause colic.

, This makes it easier when weaning also.

, Foals only defecate about 6 to 12 times a day, sometimes they hardly defecate at all. Watch the foal and if it has manure around its bottom and looks to be constipated, seek veterinary advice. Okay, back to defecation, you should remove manure every day, as this will remove the worm population. Foals often will eat the mare's manure-though gross, it's completely normal. When they eat it however, the worms are passed onto the foal. So removal of manure stops the cycle of worms.

, TRUE! But make sure you get a wormer paste that is suited for foals, even though you are not worming the foal, the wormer will be passed onto the foal through the milk and the manure. A wormer that has no boticide is best. But seek advice from vet or experienced breeders as wormers differentiate depending on area or country.

, Just make sure you keep an eye on the foal and the mare. If you think that something is wrong, go with your gut instinct.

, As well as buckets with handles, wire or rope.

Make sure you want to start a horse breeding farm.,
Gain experience and knowledge on how to work with horses.",How to Start a Horse Breeding Farm1," Note that there are challenges that you will face, including financial, physical, and emotional consequences. It is important to know how to deal with those.

If you've owned one or more horses, you'll already be aware that there is a lot of work involved and that it's a rather expensive undertaking. Breeding horses will increase the work, the expenses, the worry and the long-term attachment to your business in ways that simply owning a horse doesn't really prepare you for.
You will also have to immerse yourself in such aspects as marketing, detailed and reliable checking and referencing of the horses' background and breeding information and keeping track of all your income and expenses, meaning that you're going to experience a lot of administrative input on top of the horse care, as a business operator. A brief overview of the advantages and disadvantages of turning your hobby into a business will help you to decide if this is what you really want to do. Here are some suggested pluses and minuses to help you form your own list:



 



Advantages: If you love horses, working in a business that involves them means that you'll be doing what you love, often an important element of a successful small business. Moreover, if you're already knowledgeable, you'll be well ahead of others starting a business from scratch in products, goods or animals about which they know nothing. Some other advantages include:

The opportunity to ride horses regularly
A chance to be around your horses constantly
Caring for foals

Selling horses for more money––while optional if you're operating as a stud farm, this tends to be a necessity to prevent overcrowding, to remove horses that aren't getting along and to keep your business well funded. This can be a source of pride in knowing that your horses are going elsewhere but it can also be a very emotional side of the business
Operating as a stud farm, offering the services of your stallion(s), offering your mares where appropriate and perhaps offering boarding and foal raising facilities. This can be a very rewarding aspect both financially and as a source of pride but it's also fraught with the potential for liability and worry.



Disadvantages: There are numerous disadvantages to owning a horse breeding farm, including start-up costs for land, stables, equipment, feed and the horses. You will need to have quality breeding horses, or risk nobody wanting to purchase the horses, and this initial outlay can be very costly. You won't necessarily see a good return for your cash outlay for several years, meaning that you'll have to run a tight business and make do for a while. Other disadvantages include:

The constant need for high quality, expensive horse food; you might consider whether it's possible to grow your own or to buy as a co-operative with other horse owners in the local area.
The requirement for adequate equipment, supplies, and tack, which will quickly add up financially. When starting up, make use of sales, discounts from belonging to professional organizations and used items through auctions and other sales. If you're smart and lucky, you might find a horse breeding business that is closing down and has stock to sell off (of both the product and animal kind).
Increased regular vet visits––more horses means more potential for problems, including general health maintenance such as deworming and shots, everyday injuries through to disease and major injuries. Emergency treatment will also need to be accounted for as a possibility at least once a year, so set aside adequate funds and plan good insurance coverage.

Increased regular farrier visits will be required to ensure that all of the horses' hooves are maintained in top condition; presentation of breeding horses is your customer's reassurance of quality, so you cannot skimp on this, ever.
Increased workload and responsibility. It's self evident that more horses means more work, including more mucking out stalls.
Need for ongoing legal and financial advice to ensure that you won't be out of pocket for things out of your control or for a poorly run budget.

;
, It is extremely important that you know how to properly handle, care for, and understand horses. You don't have to be able to ride a horse, but if you can't, then you'll need to hire someone who can to keep the horses in shape and well trained as most people will only buy horses that have been ""broken in"" for riding (foals being the exception). In fact, buyers may consider it a little odd that you run a horse breeding operation without actually knowing how to ride a horse, so unless there is an issue of disability involved, it's recommended that you learn to ride. And just in case you're a bit green with horses, here are some skills you should have set in place beforehand:

"
"
This size should be determined by what you can afford but also by what horses need–-plenty of space to run and plenty of space to separate horses that shouldn't be breeding at particular times or who shouldn't be together, such as two horses that don't get along.,
Search the pasture and remove all sharp and otherwise dangerous rocks, barbed wire, and poisonous plants that could hurt a horse.",How to Start a Horse Breeding Farm2," Also, check zoning regulations before considering any property, to make sure a horse breeding operation is an acceptable use. Your best bet is to buy fertile land with lots of green grass/hay/alfalfa; otherwise, your expenses will increase because you need to bring in lots of feed. Local agricultural organizations will often test land for you to help you identify the species of grass growing on it, and any other relevant issues such as the mineral content of the soil. If you plan on keeping horses on pasture all year round, the grass needs to be rich in vitamins and minerals and non-toxic to horses. It also needs to grow back quickly! On the other hand, if your climate means that the horses need to be kept indoors over winter, you'll need suitable barn accommodation with easy mucking out facilities and at least a small outside area for exercising during the warmest part of cold days.


Horses need approximately 1000 square feet per horse. More space is always better than less.
You'll need at least two separated areas of land, one for the stallion(s) and the other area for the mares. If you have more than one stallion, you'll need more separate areas, as keeping two stallions in the same pasture is not a good idea in most cases, especially since farm lots rarely replicate the wide ranges of wild horses. Moreover, there is a distinct need for rotating pasture, to allow pasture to recover and to release the horses onto fresh pasture regularly, meaning that you will need more pasture than you might first think.
It would be preferable if the land you bought already had a barn, outdoor shed (for your horses in winter), a place to park a horse trailer, and any other necessities. If not, you'll find the costs add up very quickly on top of the land purchase.
Ask about the water supply––look for a guaranteed, quality supply, where there is a plentiful and sufficient amount of water. Creeks, ponds, dams and the like are good sources of water, but you'll need to ensure that algae growth isn't an issue in the warmer months. On the other hand, too much water can water log the pasture, ruining its feeding potential and causing problems for the horses walking in puddles and muddy conditions.

,

Check for holes in the pasture. It would be best if there weren't any gophers or other animals/rodents which dig holes in the ground, because if a horse (or any large mammal, for that matter) steps in these at a fast pace, there is a risk of severe injury. If there are holes, consider whether measures to eliminate the cause of the holes is viable or not.






Areas with snakes need to be checked for snake habitat in the pasture. Snakes and horses don't mix, so by reducing the habitat preferences of snakes, you can reduce the potential for snakes hanging about around. Some things that may help are not having wood/log piles, junk heaps, and any other such place that encourages rodent breeding, which attracts snakes.






Check for possible toxic plants. Trees are an important shade source but they can also be a liability if they produce toxic berries, seeds or leaves. Identify plants on a property using a field guide before making a purchase decision. You might be able to remove an offending tree but a whole copse of trees or a pasture filled with weeds starts to be a lot of work without a guarantee that you've found all possible toxic plants. To see a list of common plants poisonous to horses, see http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?aid=1784.






See How to prepare a pasture for horses.

"
"
Equip the land and built areas with a barn, water supply, outdoor sheds (for horses in pasture), and any other necessities.,
Provide your land with good quality fencing.,
Organize the necessary supplies, such as grooming gear, a lead rope, a halter, and buckets/tubs for feed and water.,
Organize your horses' feed.",How to Start a Horse Breeding Farm3,"


Shelter is essential for hot, sunny days during the warmer months. If you rely on trees as part of the shade, ensure that they're not toxic. Trees also need protection from chewing, including removal of chewed branches to prevent infection to the trees. A shade shed should be built in pastures lacking in shade trees. This can be as simple as a high roof on four posts or a shed with three sides; it can be made very inexpensively.
Orient any shelter so that it heads away from prevailing cold winds and to make the most of cooling summer breezes (usually south facing in the northern hemisphere, vice versa in the southern hemisphere).
If you do need to build before starting the business, get firm timelines and signed deals as to costs of building. Most building projects inevitably cost more than initially thought. Moreover, get a variety of estimates rather than relying on just one builder. And only use registered builders affiliated with a recognized building association.

, This is extremely important, as you don't want your horses escaping or getting hurt on the fencing. Good fencing costs money but it's not worth skimping because injuries and loss can amount to a lot more than money outlaid on suitable fencing from the beginning.


The best fencing of all would be a tall, thick, and wide hedge with a wooden fence in front of it. However, as most people don't have the time to do this, a good quality wooden fence works just fine, as does metal bars. Wooden fencing comes in many kinds, such as post-and-board, post-and-rail, etc. and needs to be maintained. Using wood that is non-toxic and enduring, you should expect a good 15 to 20 years life from a well-cared for wooden fence. The trick is in maintaining it––borers can attack such fencing and bored horses like to chew it. Keep a regular eye for insect damage of wooden fencing and replace it regularly; as for chewing, you can try running an electric wire along the wood to condition the horses into leaving the fence alone. Many people resort to vinyl coated white wooden fencing because it needs less painting maintenance.
Another option is electric fencing. Provided it is properly earthed and made with quality wire using at least three to four rows, it is a cost-effective and usually safe solution. Most horses will shy away from it after a few shocks. However, sometimes it can scare a horse enough to destroy the fence, so care needs to be taken with particularly wild or frisky horses.
Do not ever use hog wire fencing for horses. Horses (and other wildlife like deer) can accidentally get their legs caught in it.
Barbed wire should not be an option for keeping horses. Barbed wire was designed for cows, not horses. Horses can be seriously injured, perhaps permanently, if they get caught in barbed wire.

, Also make sure you have equipment to clean the paddock/pasture and any other areas the horses will spend their time. Equipment includes a spade or a shovel and a rake if your horse is stabled. When replacing the bedding, you will need either a bucket for transporting the bedding or a wheelbarrow. Buy good quality tools, either new or used, as good equipment works better and lasts longer, making it cheaper in the long run., Horses need a lot of food to maintain their body condition. If a horse is underweight, she needs more to put the weight on, if she is overweight, she needs less feed. Know what the horse was fed before you bought it; horse's diets need to be adjusted over a period of several days. Remember that how many oats you give the horse depends a lot on how strenuously she is working. The basic components of a horses diet include:



Forage - Horses eat roughage to keep them warm. When buying hay, look at the quality––you want something that is nutritious but is not going to pass right through the horse. Try to get grassy hay, or an oaten hay. If you do get alfalfa (lucerne) hay, try to get a second or even better a third cut, as the hay will be more stalky and will not be too rich.

Concentrate - Horses in a paddock usually will eat grass and will require hay to help keep their body condition. However, some horses require hand feeding every day, twice a day, or every other day depending on the horse. The best mixture of chaffs is alfalfa and oats or wheat. The alfalfa chaff will provide high protein and calcium for your horse, and the wheat will provide a source of bulk food. This is when the horse will eat to stay full but the food does not put on or take away nutrients. This is used when you want to fill a horse up faster without adding heat and energy to the food.Older horses with bad teeth generally should receive a fair amount of chaff too, as they don't have to chew so much and still get the fibre and energy they need. Other than that, this also helps with maintaining a healthy appetite.
When feeding your horse chaffs (especially made from alfalfa), first mix in some water and crush it into a gruel. This will help prevent choking.
Also, don't feed your horse chaffs right after exercising, or she may choke because of lack of saliva to break down the chaff and make it go down smoothly. So before giving your exercised horse chaff, first let her drink some water and get rehydrated.



Supplements - Pellets and grain are good ways to put on weight and maintain it. They are also handy when you require a boost of energy for a show or your horse needs a lift. Boiled grains are best as they help to put weight on and during the colder months help to keep the horse warm. If you don't want to fuss around with boiling them, go for a steamed or crushed variety. Wholegrain needs to be broken prior to consumption, as the grains expand when contact with moisture has been made. If you're new to feeding and want something super easy and cost efficient, go for a Pelleted Mix. There are a lot on the market, and it can be difficult to find the right one for your horse. The best thing to start with is a lucerne pellet or a cool pellet. These feeds are add no additional energy and they provide a range of vitamins and minerals. After a while you can try different products until you find the perfect fit.

Find out which breeds are selling well in your area and beyond.,
Purchase the horses.",How to Start a Horse Breeding Farm4," Depending on what your customers want in a horse, you might consider breeding gaited horses, laid-back horses, or competitive horses. Of course, most horses are good in a variety of things. Do more research than you think is necessary––don't simply rely on your own current knowledge. Find out who is selling good stock at the moment, which horses are renowned for which traits, the types of issues you're likely to be faced with in caring for that particular breed of horse, etc. Go and talk to existing breeders for their advice, updates and tours of their facilities. Visit horse sales as an observer to get a feel for purchasing horses and how the auctions work. Go through horse farms for sale to see what is available and the prices being fetched. Doing thorough research will ensure that you're well informed and that you're making the right decision about the breed that you're choosing.


Don't jump into breeding rare, exotic breeds unless you've had experience with them. Start with a breed you know a lot about and have spent time handling.
If you choose a very popular horse (such as a Quarter Horse), you will have to compete with more breeders to sell, therefore lowering the prices. However, if your aim is to provide quality in all respects, plot this out as part of your business plan and keep to the plan when purchasing, breeding, caring for and selling these horses, so that you are on track to building a solid, good reputation as a reliable and trusted breeder. In business, provided you are focused, aware of your competitors' moves and consistent in producing quality outcomes, you can usually always provide a better service than other people in the same business.
If you want to breed racing horses, this requires an enormous outlay of money and should only be started by someone with excellent, firsthand knowledge of the racing industry or you risk making big and costly mistakes.

, It doesn't matter which breed you're breeding, but obviously some horses will cost you more, and some horses will sell for more. Before you buy a horse, make sure it's registered, a purebred, and has good bloodlines or ancestry. This means sighting papers and checking contractual clauses confirming the ancestry of each horse you purchase. In terms of how many horses you start with, that should be determined by your research, your land space and your budget. Initially it's probably best to start small and see how it goes rather than over-extending yourself only to find out you can't manage it.


If possible, buy a stallion too so that you can breed your mares for free. Beforehand though, make sure you know how to correctly handle and care for a stallion. If you're not yet ready to own a stallion, that's fine and it's good to recognize your limitations––it's far better to find other solutions initially than to get in over your head. Look for suitable sires in the local area and be sure to have a decent form of horse transportation (which you will need anyway, for vet visits and shows).
Research the pedigree of the horse you're interested in. Since a horse's lineage can affect the quality of her breeding outcomes, an in-depth knowledge of pedigrees for that certain breed is necessary. Pedigrees are basically a family-tree for horses, and they should list the dam, the sire, the grand dam and grand sire, and so on. Reputable horse breeders will be able to include this in the terms of sale of your new horses.

"
"
Care for your horses and keep them in shape.",How to Start a Horse Breeding Farm5," Ride them often, but be careful not to get them hot and sweaty when riding in winter (unless you're in an indoor arena) as your horse could very easily become sick or get a chill.


If you'd like to ride in the wintertime, consider investing in a heated indoor arena. These are also nice places to ride untrained horses, give lessons to children, or ride a horse at a canter for the first time, as if you fall you'll only land on sawdust, and your horse won't be able to run off.

"
"
Sort out an appropriate feeding regime before bringing your new horses to the farm, based initially on what the horses have been used to and then gradually shifting them to your preferred diet for the horses (if necessary).,
Do a safety check of the stable regularly.",How to Start a Horse Breeding Farm6," When a new horse comes to an unfamiliar surrounding, it is best to leave her alone for at least a couple of days until she settles in. To help the process along, make up a yummy appetizing treat to ease the transition. This could be a basic chaff and grain mix, or you could go all out and make something original, such as Bran Biscuits or a sweet feed mix. Whatever you choose, don't get into a bad habit of overfeeding, as the horse will be a little stressed to be in a new surrounding, you don't want to upset her stomach and you don't want her to start expecting too much food and putting on weight. If the horse doesn't eat the meal, don't force it. She is in an unfamiliar surrounding and everything is new and different. The water will taste different, the food will smell different, so let her adjust and have the food there just in case she's hungry.


Find out what the horse was fed before you bought her; horse's diets need to be adjusted over a period of several days or more depending on how much it'll be changed. Sudden changes can bring about gas, diarrhea and more serious complications.

, If you plan on keeping your new horse in a stable either at night, most of the day or even for an hour or two, you'll need to make sure it is safe. Make sure there is a sufficient water source, a large bucket will do if only stabled for a few hours, if stabled at night or all day, invest in a water trough or automatic waterer. Provide adequate bedding such as straw or wood shavings. Keep in mind that the bedding should be an approved horse bedding, as some by-products of woods and timber can be toxic to horses.

Breed your mares to a stallion once it's the correct time to breed.,
Imprint train your new foals.,
Continue breeding, training, riding, and selling your horses.",How to Start a Horse Breeding Farm7," Make sure that your mare(s) are in heat before you try breeding them.

A good way of telling if a mare is in heat is to put her in a padded stall with a 'teaser' stallion in the padded stall next to her. If the mare moves her tail to one side and sidles her rump towards the stallion, that means she's probably in heat. However, if she starts lashing out at the stallion, that means she probably is not in heat.






Choose a stud with a good pedigree, good achievements, and good ability. Also, people like purebreds a lot, and also horses with good conformation for what they'll be doing. Seek and accept advice from current horse breeders who have an excellent reputation with other horse breeders; check with your local horse association for more information. Most breeders will be happy to share information, as they're as keen as you to maintain high quality standards and to see more healthy horses.






Breed your mare to a stallion that's similar to the mare. It's been known that if you breed, for example, a very short mare to a very tall stallion; the foal may have deformed lungs, legs, and so forth, and may have to be put down. However, if you breed two horses that look very much alike, you should get foals with no deformities, plus, the foals will look alike! Do a lot of research and advice seeking about the best approaches to breeding. Don't take anything for granted!







, It is critical that you acquaint the foal with humans, as this will make the horse easier to train. A well-trained horse is also more valuable, and will likely be friendlier and easier to work with.

, Always care for them and be kind––both horses and the customers can sense a confident, kindly and approachable breeder.


Be sure to get involved in showing your horses. The prizes or awards are a vital part of promoting the worth of your horses. Showing of horses is a vast topic in itself, so do lots of research, asking of questions and get involved.

Name your horse farm.,
Make a website for your horse farm.,
Promote your business.,
Last but not least, enjoy the journey.",How to Start a Horse Breeding Farm8," Make it something creative, yet sophisticated if possible.

, There are quite a few free web hosting places, so you can just use one of those if you don't want to pay a fee. However, now that you're a business, it is not the time to be quibbling over small amounts spent on advertising to bring in more customers. A quality website will make a good impression, something that will set you apart from breeders who can't be bothered spending time with online awareness––people expect to find all the information they're looking for in an easy-to-read and professional website, so give them what they're looking for.


Keep all of your prizes and important information right there where customers can see the accolades and information! Don't hide behind modesty––customers want to know your horses are prize winners.

, You should be setting aside some of your budget to advertise your existence, your specialization and your availability as a horse breeder/boarder/trainer. Use Google ads and Facebook ads for online reach. Advertise in relevant horse interest and horse association/club magazines. Ensure that there is a decent sign advertising your business at the front gate. And use every media opportunity in the local press that comes your way!


If you like writing and photography, and have the time, maintaining a blog about your horse farm, along with horse breeding advice, can be an excellent form of outreach that will gain interested followers who might just turn into customers now and then!

, Breeding horses is hard work but it's rewarding, especially if your life is dedicated to horses. You will find yourself emotionally attached to the horses, to what happens to them and to the business as a whole. Most of all, provided you run a tight budget and keep within your means, you will hopefully find it is a healthy and financially rewarding business as well. You might not make millions but if you're doing what you love and making ends meet plus a little more, then it can be a good earner and as your expertise grows, you can use this expertise to teach, write, advise, etc. as well as breeding the horses.

You can also choose different flexibilities depending on what you and your horse like. Finding one or two different curry combs to use on your horse will help keep it clean, help blood circulation in the skin, distribute oils, and give your horse’s coat a nice shiny glow.Be aware that rubber combs shouldn’t be used on a horse’s face, ears, or legs.
Throw these in the wash rack for bath time if you like.;
, Another version of the curry comb you and your horse might like is the curry mitt or pimple mitt. These pimpled gloves are great to use on sensitive horses as well as sensitive body parts like faces, bellies, and lower legs. You can also use them on other body parts if you like.


Fold your curry mitt in half to get into your horse’s nooks and crannies. For example, you could use this in the horse’s “armpits” to clean out sweat stains and massage the area.
Throw curry mitts into the wash rack for bath time if you like.

, Like curry mitts, jelly mitts are also very versatile. They generally are different sized pimples or nubs on each side for different parts of your horse’s body. Unlike other curry combs, you can also use jelly mitts on a horse’s lower legs.Try using a jelly mitt to loosen hair on saddle pads. The stiffer nubs are also good to remove dried poultice from your horse’s lower legs.

, In addition to standard types of curry combs, there are different shapes, textures, and designs. These are usually for specific body parts or to do things like massage a horse’s fascia and muscles.If your horse has specific physical needs or you even just want to give it a treat with something like a massage curry comb, keep one or two of these handy.Consider any problems or specific health needs your horse has. Does he or she have tight muscles from training for competitions? Try a cross fiber groomer to help loosen up your horse’s fascia and muscles. You could also try a specialty mitt for sweat stains if the horse trains frequently or lives in hot climates.

, Some curry combs are made of hard and inflexible metal that scrape up hair and dirt well. However, they can be too harsh on a sensitive horse and shouldn’t be used to brush any bony areas like the shoulders, hips, and legs. Consider using a metal comb in conjunction with a plastic or rubber curry comb for the best results.Use the metal comb on your horse only if it likes it. Otherwise, consider using a metal comb to scrape hair and sweat from saddle pads or to clean rubber or plastic curry combs.Be aware that metal curry combs don’t do well in water, so you may not want to use them at bath time.

, Before you start curry combing your horse, tie it up in a safe place. Leaving your horse loose in a stall or without a halter can leave you without any control if the animal tries to turn around or escape from you.Consider giving your horse a treat for allowing you to tie it up. This may also help it stay calm during the curry combing session.

, Grasp the handle and use your thumb and fingers to hold the comb firmly. If you are using a mitt, slip your hand into it completely and ensure that it won’t slide off during your combing.Make sure any straps on the curry comb are secure and not broken to ensure optimal use. The same goes for the nubs on plastic combs. Broken parts may hurt you or your horse.

, From the way that you curry comb your horse to how you move around the animal, remember to use gentle movements. This can prevent harming or startling your horse and ensure a pleasurable experience for both of you., If your horse is young or needs more frequent cleaning, it’s important to give your horse time to get used to it. Providing your horse with positive reinforcement and gentle handling can help you more easily get through a curry combing session and teach your horse to love getting clean.Try and curry comb your horse any time you ride it. This gets it in the habit of being groomed and can help him or her stand still for longer grooming sessions or even to get new horseshoes. It can also help you detect health problems.
Give your horse a treat at the beginning and/ or end of a curry combing session. Offer the horse a lot of praise for good behavior. Make sure to take your time so that your horse doesn’t sense any urgency or irritation. These behaviors can help your horse get used to curry combing and associate it with positive feelings.

, Just like humans and other animals, horses often love the feeling of being groomed. This is especially true if you take your time to lovingly groom your horse. However, you may notice that your horse reacts differently to certain combs, which can cue you into what he or she prefers in terms of the curry comb. Try and focus on this comb to help your horse enjoy the grooming process.Notice if your horse leans into you, which is a sign that he or she is enjoying that particular comb.
Look to see if your horse’s ears are turned out to the side, which is a sign that he or she is relaxed. Likewise, a dropped head can also indicate relaxation., Starting at the top of your horse’s neck, use the curry comb in circular motions on your horse. Work with the direction of the horse’s hair as if you were giving the animal a massage.Press firmly but gently when currycombing in the direction of the hair. Use lighter pressure if you’re going against the horse’s hair. Don’t be surprised if your horse leans into the curry comb because it likes the feeling!
Use caution when going back and forth in a scrubbing motion. Some people suggest not using a scrubbing motion while others think it’s acceptable if done gently., Work your way around the rest of the horse’s body, taking care around bony and sensitive areas.Avoid using the curry comb on the head and mane, lower legs, or other especially sensitive areas for now.Check to see that the curry comb is bringing up dirt and dead skin to the surface of the coat. If none is visible, consider going over the area again to prepare it for removal with a body brush.Use a different curry comb, such as a jelly mitt or pimple mitt, if your horse appears sensitive to the plastic curry comb.

, A horse’s stomach, or girth, and back often collect the most sweat and dirt. Make sure to focus a significant part of your time to curry combing these areas.


Remember that the girth is often very sensitive. Consider switching to a jelly or pimple mitt to remove sweat and dirt. If this doesn’t effectively bring up hair, dirt, and sweat, try using a rubber comb with deeper nubs.Check the areas where your horse’s saddle sits on its back. Make sure to give this area a lot of attention, too, since sweat and hair can build up underneath the saddle.

, A horse’s spine, elbows and legs are very bony. Because of this, they require special care when curry combing them. Use a pimple mitt, jelly mitt, or specialized mitt to curry comb these delicate areas.Use the same firm but gentle pressure to curry comb the spine, legs, and elbows. Don’t brush too deeply on these parts of the horse’s body as they don’t have as much muscle and fat as places like the neck or girth.
Brush sensitive areas in the direction of the horse’s hair, just like you would do with other parts. Remember to avoid using a scrubbing motion, which may be especially uncomfortable on sensitive or bony areas.
Be especially careful when curry combing the horse’s legs so that it doesn’t kick you. Use the most gentle pressure here so that you don’t startle the horse.

, Unclip your horse from the lead or where you’ve tied it up so that you can effectively curry comb its face. Hold the curry comb in one hand and your horse’s face in another as you gently work your way around the face.Make sure to avoid the delicate eye area and the horse’s mane.


Work your way from the horse’s neck to the jaw, nose, behind the ears and brow band. Pay special attention to these areas because remaining dirt can cause discomfort under the horse’s bridle.
Put the head collar back on or tie up the horse again so that you can finish your curry combing session.
Use a regular or body brush to comb the mane. Dampen it with some water to remove excess debris and keep the mane flat.

, You may find that the curry comb fills up with hair, dirt, dried mud, or sweat as you brush your horse. Occasionally “emptying” the curry comb by banging it against a hard surface can help you more effectively groom your horse.Empty your mitt only if necessary. In most cases, debris will simply fall out of mitts without banging it against anything.

, Use a body brush in a flipping motion to remove all of the hair and dirt brought up through curry combing. Make sure to start at the neck and work your way all over the horse’s body. This can make your horse’s hair supple and shiny.Make sure to brush in the direction of the hair. Clean out the brush every few strokes by combing the rubber curry comb with a metal version.

Instead, position your body so that you can reach the horse easily and also move away quickly if the horse gets agitated or begins kicking.Be mindful at all times that a horse is a strong animal with significant kicking power.
Horses also get spooked pretty easily and have several blind spots.
Always have an exit strategy in mind so that you know what to do if the horse spooks or kicks out.;
, It’s important that you wrap your horse’s legs in the correct position on their legs so that the wraps provide maximum benefit and so that you avoid injuring your horse’s legs. Wraps should be placed on the cannon bone, which is between the knee and fetlock joint.The knee is the big, knobby joint in the middle of the leg.
The fetlock joint is the knobby joint near the hoof.
The cannon bone is the straight section of leg located between the knee and fetlock joint.

, Place the wrap on the inside of the first leg at the top of the cannon bone. You’ll begin to wind the wrap around the horse’s leg, always making sure to wrap from front to back, and only tightening or applying pressure at the front of the leg. Bring the wrap down below the fetlock joint (the bottom joint) so that it’s protected as well, and then wind upward again.You want the wrap to feel snug, not tight.
Your wrap will make an upside-down “V” shape over the fetlock joint if it’s done correctly.
A useful phrase to remember is “Always wrap to the back"".
Think F.B.I.O. – Front to back, inside to outside.
Close the wrap with the Velcro tab, which will secure the wrap in place and keep it from slipping.
Never use duct tape or another immobile tape to secure your wrap as this can provide severe damage to the tendons underneath.

, As you remove the wraps from your horse's leg, never roll them back up as you unwrap. Re-rolling adds extra time that you’re by your horse’s feet, and also adds an additional tripping hazard for your horse. You want to get the wraps off your horse's legs as quickly as possible, and once you are safely away from his/her legs, you may roll and store the polo wraps.Reroll them exactly opposite as you unrolled them so that they’re ready to go next time.

, You need to use wraps that are free of debris and dirt, and you also need to make sure that the horse’s legs are clean. Trapping any debris or particles in between the wrap and horse’s legs can cause irritation, and if left on too long, abrasions. Before you apply a wrap, inspect your materials and the horse’s legs.Gently brush or wipe any debris or particles away that might irritate your horse’s skin.

, Put a lead on your horse’s head and then tie them to a steady object or have someone hold the lead for you. This prevents the horse from moving around too much while you’re wrapping their legs, keeps them pointing in the right direction, and keeps you safer if the horse should kick out.You can tie the lead to a fence, gate, or even the stable.

, If possible, your goal should be to apply even pressure as you wrap the bandage around the legs. If you need to tighten it more, make sure to only apply that tightening pressure as you go around the front of the leg.


Applying pressure at the front ensures a firm wrap, but applying pressure around the back can actually pinch the horse’s tendons and cause injury.Use two hands when you apply the wrap so that you can guide it as you circle the horse’s legs. This will also let you apply pressure around the front and prevent pressure from being applied to the rear of the leg.

, There are several boots and wraps available to protect your horse’s legs and feet and each are appropriate for specific functions. Polo wraps are great for mounted work, such as riding, jumping, and longeing. Polo wraps aren’t to be used when the horse is in the stall or in turnout, because the wraps can unravel and the horse might step on the wrap tail, which effectively creates a cinch and can cause bad injury., Because polo wraps and standing bandages look similar, some supply stores mislabel them. If you’re buying your wraps from a reputable supply store, this shouldn’t be an issue. Make sure that you’re getting the right dressing for mounted work to help prevent injury to your horse.Polo wraps are made of thicker material, like fleece, and standing bandages are made of thinner woven material, like cotton.

, Anymore, polo wraps come with 2-inch Velcro tabs sewn on to each wrap, although you may find some older wraps that don’t have the Velcro tabs. Opt for wraps that have the Velcro sewn in so that you don’t have to rely on tape, such as duct tape, to hold your horse’s wraps on.Velcro also makes the wrapping process quicker and easier for you and your horse.

, You might want your horse to have flashy wraps, especially if you’re doing your mounted work in front of others. Whether you’re performing or practicing, you have a variety of color options, such as red, pink, green, and even patterns like argyle and camouflage. Your local supply store may only carry standard colors, so look online and get creative with your color choices.You can find a wide range of color and pattern options from online suppliers.

, You can make your own wraps fairly easily and relatively inexpensively. Purchase 3 yards (9 feet) of fleece, and cut into 5-inch strips. Fold the corners on one end into a point and sew them in place. Then sew on 6-inch strips of Velcro to each end.The Velcro strips will be on opposite ends of the strip, as well as opposite sides of the fabric.

Stretchy bandaging can be helpful, but make sure that you don’t pull it too tight as you wrap.

, You should always apply at least 1” of clean padding before wrapping the leg with a bandage.Make sure the padding is applied in even, smooth layers. Wrinkles can cause pressure points that can cause injury., Wrap clockwise on the right legs and counterclockwise on the left legs.

, Commercial quilted wraps are available, or you can use regular cotton to wrap a layer at least 1” thick. Thick padding offers your horse protection from bumps and injury.Soft materials are good because the shipping wraps will be on the horse for a while, and you don’t want your horse’s skin to get irritated.
Apply the padding so that it is even and flat. Avoid large wrinkles or uneven layers.
Make sure that the padding extends below the coronary band of the hoof. This is the small “ridge” that goes along the upper border of the hoof., Flannel bandages about 6” wide are excellent for creating a shipping wrap.Fleece polo wraps are also a good choice.Look for bandages that are slightly stretchy.

, This will be roughly just under the horse’s knee. Wrap the bandage in the same direction as the padding. This will help you avoid putting too much pressure on the tendons.Wrap the bandage downward, overlapping by about half the width each time.


Use moderate tension when wrapping. You don’t want the wrap to be too tight, but you also don’t want it to loosen or fall off in transit. Your horse could trip or get tangled in loose bandages.Check for the appropriate tension by slipping your finger beneath the bandage. You should be able to get your finger in between the bandage and your horse’s leg without too much effort.

, A shipping bandage will help protect your horse’s lower leg if it is applied correctly. It should cover the heels, coronary band, and lower leg.Make sure you wrap the bandage over the bulbs of your horse’s heels. This way, the bandage will not “ride up” during the trip., Following the same spiral motion, wrap the bandage back up the leg to just below the knee., Fasten the bandage with crossed bandage pins. For extra protection, wrap masking tape in a downward spiral around the leg."

, Begin at the inside of the leg and wrap to the outside. Wrap clockwise for the right leg, and counterclockwise for the left leg. Wrap down the horse’s leg in a spiral pattern.Use a self-adhesive bandage or polo wrap to make this process easier.
Use the techniques in Method 2 for proper bandaging.

, Use slightly more tension as you wrap the horse’s fetlock. Bring the bandage back up around the leg. Wrap around the fetlock twice more., Wrap up the leg in a spiral pattern. Decrease the tension as you reach the top of the bandaging."

The leg may become inflamed and warm to the touch. In these cases, vets may prescribe a “sweat” bandage to help reduce fluid build-up and inflammation in your horse’s leg.Do not apply a sweat bandage to recent or open wounds

, Your veterinarian may recommend a particular poultice. You can purchase commercial sweating preparations or make your own. Ask your vet for suggestions if you choose to make your own. Common ingredients include:Epsom salts
DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide)
Nitrofurazone ointment
Mineral oil
Petroleum jelly
Glycerin or glycerol

, In addition to your sweating poultice, you will need to gather the following items:


Soap and water
A towel
Rubber gloves
Lightweight plastic wrap (e.g., kitchen cling wrap, packing wrap)
Sheet cotton, roll cotton, or leg quilts
Bandages
Stretch adhesive tape

, It is essential that you thoroughly clean and completely dry your horse’s leg before applying the sweating poultice.Poultices that use DMSO are particularly prone to carrying any substance on the surface of your horse’s body into the wound. Make sure all of your equipment is clean. DMSO can also irritate damp skin, so dry your horse’s leg thoroughly before you apply it., Even microscopic cuts or scratches can become irritated by sweating poultices.If your horse has very furry legs, clip the fur in the area where you plan to apply the sweating poultice. Do not shave the leg, as this could nick or scratch it.

, Wearing gloves, apply the sweating poultice all over the appropriate area of the leg. Apply liberally, but keep the layer even. If you apply too much, it will seep out of the wrap.Apply the poultice from the area under your horse’s knee to its fetlock., Wrap a thin, even layer of plastic wrap around the poultice. Try to avoid too many wrinkles.The plastic will help seal in the heat, producing the “sweat.”

, Wrap layers of cotton or leg quilts around the plastic wrap. The padding should be at least an inch thick. Keep the layers smooth and even., Use a support bandage that is at least 2-3” wide.Start at the midpoint of the leg and wrap in a spiral pattern.
Begin at the front and work to the back of the leg. Wrap the bandage counterclockwise for the left leg and clockwise for the right leg.
Wrap the bandage so that each layer overlaps the previous layer about halfway.

, Do not pull too tightly on the bandage. This could cause further swelling in the leg. Try to keep the padding smooth and even as you wrap.Do not wrap the bandage too loosely, either. The fabric of the bandage should stretch about halfway to its maximum extension as you wrap it.
Check the tightness by placing your finger between the bandage and your horse’s leg. If you can’t slip your finger in between the bandage and the leg easily, you have wrapped the bandages too tightly.

, A horse with a sweat poultice should be confined to its stall or a small run. This will keep your horse from overexercising its leg while it is wrapped.

, It’s important to check the bandage several times a day to make sure it is still in place. Check for swelling, irritation or redness in the bandage area.If you see swelling around the bandage area, remove the bandage.
If your horse becomes distressed or upset, irritable, or begins to gnaw or paw at the bandage, check the bandaged area. Consult with your vet.

, Do not leave a sweat on your horse for longer than 12 hours.If you need to apply another sweat, allow the leg to “rest” for 12 hours first. Then reapply the sweat.

, It’s important to wash away any remaining sweat poultice after you’ve unwrapped the sweat bandage. Usually, water will do, but you can also use a a small amount of a mild shampoo."

Fill in each stencil individually.,
Pat around the area to shake off any excess glitter.

,
Repeat this process until all shapes have been painted and glittered.,
This might work when its cold, but I tried it and as soon as the horse started to sweat, the gel just ran!",How to Make Horse Body Glitter," The benefits of making it usually outweigh buying the product. A benefit is that you know what is going in the product, and can avoid things that your horse might be allergic to. It is also simple. You will save money, as most horse glitter gels are around 25 dollars for a 4oz bottle. You can make as much as you want, because it is cheap to make.

, Spot test on your horse's coat to make sure that your horse is not allergic to it. You also need to buy a packet of loose glitter. You can also add as much as you want to the tub of hair gel. If you just want fine glitter, add a little bit, and add a lot if you want more. Keep the horse glitter gel in the tub of hair gel. This is a benefit as it is easy to get a brush or a finger in the tub and it comes with a cool screw on lid!

,;
, (If you use a more complicated stencil, it will be harder to put it on and sometimes hard to make out what it is.

, Make sure that they are symmetrical and that they are mirror images of each other.

, Also, do each shape in the stencil individually. Start with the design closest to the top of the horse, use a paint brush to spread the Elmer's glue into the stencil after filling in the shape sprinkle in the glitter.

Do your best.",How to Keep Your Job As a Stable Groom," Hay, wheelbarrows and water buckets are heavy, and only get heavier throughout the day. There is a lot of pasture to walk, horses to ride, and a long aisle way to sweep. Grooming and tacking up fifty horses can make your arms fall off. Get yourself in shape. Now.;
, If they say that you must wear black boots while working, then you’d better be wearing your black boots. It doesn’t feel good at all to be fired over things you didn’t know about.

, Did you think you just had to brush this horse and muck that horse’s stall? Well, turns out, you also were supposed to sweep the aisle, turn the filly out, feed the cats, brush the two horses out back, and rake the arena. To avoid that kind of confusion, ask your boss to give you a written list of everything you are supposed to do and when you are supposed to do it. Take it home, type it up, laminate it, and keep it with you. And get to know about the horses there. Its important to know the actions and attitude of each horse so that you know how to react or what not to do. And read up a lot about horses. ex. how to groom horses, how to muck out stalls...etc. that is also very important!

, This way, you can see how every thing's done, like where the manure is dumped, how often the stalls are picked out, which horses go where, and how the gates work. It’s an opportune time to ask questions, so don’t act like you know everything. Pretend you’re starting (almost) from square one. This way, you won’t miss any important bits of information (like, at this barn, you change the bedding every day, or wipe down the tack after it’s used, or pick out the horse’s feet before bed, or other things they might just assume you know).

, Late grooms can never be counted on, and are, consequently, fired. Heavy sleeper? Get an alarm clock.

, That means working jeans or breeches, comfortable, waterproof, horse-safe boots, a plain shirt (a polo works nicely) and appropriate gloves. Add a baseball cap, if it’s appropriate for the barn and season, and a belt, if you need it. No jewelry, except for a watch, and wear your hair out of the way, in something sensible (ponytail). No designer anything, even for you fashion-conscious city slickers. Even if a few other grooms are wearing wacky clothes, you’d better avoid them. When someone has to get fired, it’ll be them, not you. Professionalism impresses.

, Don’t drink, smoke, chew tobacco, get tattoos, pierce yourself (exception, ears), dye your hair like a chameleon or do anything else that may cause them to pass you off as a nut case.

, No one likes a depressed person hanging around their barn.

, Horse dust, dirt, manure and shavings get stuck in the most unattractive places, and a day at the barn (plus a little sweat) doesn’t exactly make you smell delicious. Your dog will think otherwise.

, When they ask you to sweep the aisle, sweep it very well. Picking out a stall means get it really clean. Don’t go overboard, but if you exceed their expectations (and keep doing it), they’ll love you all the more (think promotions).

, Don’t take too long on a particular task. Do it well, of course, but learn how to do it quickly.

, Don’t know how to clean a stud’s sheath? Don’t pretend, tell the boss. They’ll be happier if you’re frank with them, rather than pretending you know everything until something goes wrong. That’s a sure-fire way to get kicked out.

, Not only does it make your job easier and less stressful, but when people start asking you questions (and they will), you’ll feel a lot more confident about answering them. For instance, the little kid that wonders just how much grain her pony really needs. And the amateur that doesn’t know how to put that blanket on her horse. Etcetera.

, Offer to help if someone needs it. Help carry their tack to the trailer. Say hello, learn their names, and say something nice every time you pass them. Bake them something for their birthday (and Christmas, New Year’s, etc. ). Compliment their horse. If everyone loves you, they’ll want you to stay longer. And the boss won’t fire you if everyone always tells him that the new groom is so nice.

, If you try your heart out, good things always happen.

Calm yourself and your horse.,
Palpate for tightness.,
Perform compressions to relieve muscle pain.,
Use the effleurage technique.",How to Massage a Horse1," This may not make sense at first but horses are very perceptive when it comes to human emotions. So a calm you equals a calm horse. If you feel agitated, wait to perform the massage at another time.Before you begin to brush your horse, gently rub under his eyes with your index and middle fingers in circular motions. This will gain trust and keep him calm.;
, This is a good move to help loosen up the muscles in the horse’s back/spine region. Make sure you position your horse so that the hind foot on the side you are working on is slightly behind the foot on the other side; this will position the muscles properly.Use your palm directly on the muscle, pushing in gently and releasing. Your touch should be soft, but firm.
Work your way down the muscles. If the muscle does not give under the pressure of your touch, then it is tight and needs working on.
If your horse moves away from you, this probably means that the method is working because horses instinctually move away from pain. So if the muscle is tight and you put pressure on it, this will probably be a little uncomfortable for your horse.

, This method is beneficial for spreading out condensed muscle fibers and increasing blood flow in the muscle tissue. Begin in the middle of the horse’s back, just behind the withers.Use the open palm of your hand to apply moderate pressure compressions in a rhythmic pumping action.
Continue this pattern as you gradually work your way down the length of the muscle towards the back of the horse.

, This is a type of gliding stroke typically used down a horse’s spine to help massage stiff and sore muscles. Make sure you stand behind the stroke so that you can use your weight to lean into the horse.Take the open palm of your hand (you can use one or both hands at a time) and stroke down the horse’s back in a gliding motion.
Make sure you lighten the pressure if you go over any bony areas.

Add leg massages to your grooming routine.,
Use essential oils.,
Repeat regular grooming every day.",How to Massage a Horse2," Use a rubber mitt to rhythmically rub the horse’s legs, one at a time, while grooming. Move the mitt in a circular motion so that you are really able to get a good massage into the muscles.Make sure you go slowly enough that the massage is effective. If you work too quickly, the end result will just be a superficial rubdown and not a massage that affects the deep tissues of the muscles.
If you want to get a deeper massage into a particularly tense area, you can go back over this trouble area using your fingers instead of the rubber mitt.
Watch for signs that the horse is uncomfortable (like pulling away from your touch, wide eyes, etc.) as this is probably an indication that the massage is doing its job.

, If the massage techniques alone don’t seem to be working sufficiently, rub essential oils in sore or stiff spots as well. Use your fingers to gently massage the essential oils into your horse’s legs, focusing specifically on the sore spots.Lavender is a good oil to choose for its additional soothing qualities.

, Maintaining a regular grooming routine will help prevent muscle soreness, especially in the legs. It will also help your horse stay more calm and focused during massage sessions.


Don't press too lightly, as horses have much thicker skin than humans. A light brush over will not be as thorough as a vigorous grooming session.

Watch for physical symptoms.,
Notice changes in performance.,
Look for personality alterations.,
Get professional help.",How to Massage a Horse3," There are many telltale symptoms of muscle pain in horses. These physical signs include flinching away when you attempt to saddle them, traveling with their head elevated, or trailing their hind end instead of stepping under themselves.These symptoms usually indicate that your horse has some muscle pain and would benefit from a massage.

, A clear sign that your horse is in need of a massage is when they seem to be performing at a lower level than normal. This can include things like resisting lateral work, cantering less often than usual, or a decrease in coordination.


When humans experience a stiff back or sore muscles, they have trouble performing their daily tasks in the same way. Horses are no different.

, If a horse is in pain, they will usually act differently. Watch for signs in their behavior like resisting being saddled, decreased interest in treats, or lessened interest in activities they normally enjoy.If your horse seems depressed or less interested in things than usual, you should check with a vet to make sure they aren’t sick. But also consider that they might need a massage.

, If you are having trouble giving your horse a massage, you could consider looking into hiring a professional horse masseuse or being trained by one yourself. There are plenty of workshops hosted by professionals in the field to help you get the training you want.These kinds of training seminars are great if you have a horse that is resistant to your basic massage techniques or who seems to flinch away in pain when you attempt to massage it.

Try to, as much as possible, rub the horse down with a soft rag to promote the natural oils.

,
Wash the day before show day.,
Sand the hooves to get the dirt and other yucky bits off - be careful not to sand down too much.

,Hair around the face has probably grown back a little bit, so trim/shave the unwanted hair (This also makes it easier to apply make up)

",How to Groom a Miniature Horse for Show1,",, Depending on the length of coat and colour you want to achieve will determine when to clip - Usually people may clip about 3wks prior to show day.

, When the horse is moving around in his stall or pasture, the rugs should be always massaging the coat, creating a nice shine. Use one thick, soft cotton under rug, a heavy winter rug and a canvas to protect the other covers as a rule of thumb. Also, wrap the tail and put the tail in a tail bag.

, This heavily reduces any kind of yucky spots appearing.

, Be careful not to overdo it as it will dry out the coat. Use a human leave-in conditioner in the horse's mane and tail everyday.

,, NEVER on the morning of the show! It gives time for the natural oils to come through.

Halt your horse with a secure tie.,
Start your grooming process from the horse's neck.,
Stay in the safe position.,
Don’t let the horse turn his back towards you.,
Don't assume that all horses will be aggressive.",How to Groom an Aggressive Horse," Quick release knots aren't a proper hitching method for these type of horses; they soon learn how to release themselves and get away from you. Make sure you halt the horse with a proper tie and that it doesn't have more that 30–40 centimeters (11.8–15.7 in) to move its head around, so he won’t be able to bite you when you are standing right beside his belly (not giving the 30 centimeters space to horse’s neck is necessary will result in more resistance from the horse.);
, Even with a secure tie, the horse can still bite when you're at the neck, so you want to grab the halter with your hand and groom with other one. Whenever the horse wants to bite you, just push its head away, and with a calm and firm voice say “No”.


Horses test everything to make sure that they haven't got it wrong; therefore it might try a couple of times to turn his neck towards you and bite you. Don’t push his head around all the time cause it makes it uncomfortable; apply pressure whenever it’s necessary.

, This is right beside the horse's belly, where the horse’s head is unable to reach you if you apply the secure tie correctly. Now you can let go of the halter and continue grooming the horse’s belly and hindquarter.

, While you are grooming the horse’s belly and hindquarter, it might try to turn his back around to kick you, and that is total opposite of what we are trying to achieve here. So whenever he moves to do so, push his body away by pressing your body at its side and force it to stay in its space. Use a firm ""No"" again.

, Some horses are very sweet and kind, they like to groom you back - as they do it in nature . As long as there is no biting, it’s OK and none of the above steps are needed. Following the above steps for this type of horses will teach them bad behavior .

, Using a soft body brush or a tail brush, hold the whole tail in one hand and gradually push the brush through small sections of tail at a time. Comb the top of the tail and sides with a mane comb.


If the tail is thin, or the hairs on the side are too short to plait, you can use a pulling technique to make the tail look presentable instead.

, Before beginning, you will want to make the hairs shinier and less slippery. Dip a brush or sponge in water and brush the tail with it to dampen it. Alternatively, dip your fingers in egg white or a hair gel for horses.


You only want to dampen, not completely wash the tail, as it can make the hair harder to manage.Do not use ordinary hair gel, as some horses are allergic to it. Do not use coat polish or detangler, as they will make the tail slick and hard to handle., After dampening, you will want to be sure the hair is ready for plaiting. You should be able to comb the tail without hitting any snags.

, You do not want to pull the hair downward while plaiting. This can cause the plait to come loose or look untidy.If you have a particularly tall horse, use a step stool.

, You should start with two small bunches of hair, about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) each, from either side of the base of the tailbone (dock). Take the left and right sections in your hands, and hold them taught., When finished, the left hand one should be on the right. This will help keep your work clean, and give you a good start away from the horse's skin.

, Take a third section of hair, roughly the same size, from either side. Cross this new section over the now-middle section, so that it is now in the center. Next, cross the opposite section over the new center section. You should end up with three strands to the left, middle, and right again, similar to how you started.

, Work about two thirds of the way down the dock. As you continue braiding down the tail, add additional bits of hair to your left and right strands before crossing over. Press inward each time you cross, to keep the plait tight over the dock.The key to a successful plait is maintaining even pressure the whole time. Don't pull hard downward, but keep a steady, small tug of pressure along the direction the tail flows.
You can give the dock a quick squeeze to feel where you are along it.
The extra strands you take should create a ""ribbed"" appearance on either side of the tail., Braid your three strands together, this time without adding additional hair from the side. This braid will not hold the tail as they other strands did.


The rest of the skirt, or long tail hairs, will hang freely beneath the plait, although the ""ribs"" of the upper plait will help prevent loose hairs.

, Now that you have the plait fully made, you need to tie off the end to keep it in place. Using a needle with yarn or thread, stitch the end tight.You can also use an elastic band.


If you are intending to use the plait in a show or competition, be aware the trend is toward threads that match your horse's hair color., There are several ways you can complete the plait. The most popular style is the loop, though there is also the quicker wrap technique, or the fancier, though more difficult, pinwheel., The loop is the most traditional way to finish off your work. Pick up the tip of the plait and pull it under the dock plait to form a discreet loop. Make sure the braid is snug against the upper dock plait. Pull the yarn ends through the ""ribs"" of the upper plait and tie the two plaits together.If you used yarn, you can instead grab the dangling ends of yarn with a latch hook or your fingers to pull through.

, This is the quickest way to finish the plaiting. Start by wrapping the braid once around the dock. Tuck the end of the braid under the loop you just made, and pull through down away from the horse. This won't be as tight as your braiding, but tense enough to not loosen immediately. Tie up the loose braid to the wrap, using either yarn or thread., Leave the braid unfinished, or undo the last few crossovers. This should leave two unused lengths of hair. Roll the plait over itself tightly up the length of the tail, forming a flat circle of plaited hair. Keep the two unused lengths of hair separate, dangling on either side of the wheel. After you have rolled up the remaining braid, cross the extra lengths of hair between the wheel and the plait, then loop and gently tie them around the plait., This will keep the plait stiff and keep loose hairs down. You don't want any spiky hairs, or other pieces out of place., Your horse may itch, and try to rub off the plait. This could tear the hair and ruin your work. You can cover it with a tail bandage, long sock, or stocking to keep it tidy and protected. A tail bandage is better, just make sure you remove it gently.

Use only tools and products that are meant for your horse’s tail.,
Gather your supplies.,

Keep your horse out of the pasture or paddock if his tail is wrapped.,
Watch for signs of rubbing.,
Keep your horse’s tail clean.",How to Apply a Horse Tail Bandage," Don’t use products meant for humans, like human hair brushes. Use a wide-toothed horse comb to comb out your horse’s tail and gently remove debris and knots.You might even consider using only your fingers to detangle your horse’s tail. Combing and brushing could cause hair to be pulled out, which could hinder the growth of your horse’s tail. Try a detangling product and your own two hands as an alternative to combs and brushes.;
, Use a gauze tail bandage. Make sure that when you begin, the straps, Velcro, or tape of the bandage is properly rolled inside, so that when you unroll it as you apply it, you will be able to properly tie or secure the bandage.


Get a wet brush and a small bucket of water. You will use this to dampen the hair at the very top of the horse’s tail before applying the bandage. Brushes meant specifically for using while wet on horse tails and coats (also called wash brushes) are available online or through your local tack store.You may want to use your horse’s stall door to protect yourself from being kicked. If you are concerned about being kicked, stand outside the stall door with your horse backed up to the door, and reach over the door to apply the bandage., This will do a few things: flatten the hair and allow for you to lie the bandage flat against the tail, and also keep the bandage from slipping down the tail.Make sure you don’t make the tail too wet. You just want to dampen the hair enough to flatten it and clean it. You could clean the tail and brush it out properly prior to applying the bandage, as well. Keeping the hair under the bandage free of dirt and debris will minimize any irritation the horse might experience when wearing the bandage., Start very high up—as high as you can. Bring the corner flap of the bandage around the front of the tail. Then, wrap the bandage around to secure it in place.Angle the corner of the end of the bandage up toward the top of the horse’s dock (tailbone). This way, when you wrap the bandage around, you will have a corner triangle piece sticking up. Fold this triangle down over the wrap, and wrap the bandage around again over that triangle. This will secure the bandage in place.

, Overlap about 2 or 3 centimeters of the bandage with each pass. Make sure you are putting even pressure on the tail as you make your way down. Uneven pressure or tightness of the bandage could put unwanted pressure points on the tailbone and cause irritation, or constriction of blood vessels.Your wrap should reach the bottom of the tailbone. You should be able to feel where the tailbone ends, but it is generally about three-quarters of the way down the tail. If you still have some bandage leftover when you reach the bottom of the tailbone, move back up the tail with the remainder of the bandage. Just be sure not to let the bandage bunch up or apply extra pressure in certain spots.

, Most horse tail bandages will come with straps sewn into the end, or velcro fasteners. Tie straps into a bow and gently tuck the loose ends into the bandage to keep them from coming loose.Don’t tie the bandage too tightly. This will cause a pressure point on the tailbone, or potentially hinder circulation of blood vessels in the tailbone. These can cause serious complications. Take care when securing the bandage in place. You should be able to lift the bandage enough to get one finger underneath it. If the bandage is bunching up anywhere, unwrap it and start over, taking care not to let it bunch up.

, Untie the bow, and make sure the straps are completely undone. If you tied the knot too tight, carefully use scissors to snip the knot open., Tug the bandage down towards the end of the tail. This is why it is important that you completely undo the straps or fasteners. Once you get the bandage down from the top of the tail, it should slip off very easily, almost like a tube.Don't remove the bandage in one go as described if you have bandaged over a plaited tail. The bandage must be unwound. Trying to remove it in one go will ruin the plait and may cause discomfort to the horse.

, After being wrapped in a bandage, be gentle with your horse’s tail when brushing. If the bandage was too tight or had any bunches in it, it may have put pressure points on your horse’s tailbone, and his tail may be sensitive.


Give your horse’s tail a thorough inspection for any signs of injury after removing a bandage, especially if it has been on for a prolonged period of time. Locate any sensitive spots on the tailbone, and check for bald spots., He may get the bandage itself caught on a fence post or gate, and this could have a damaging result. If your horse’s tail is wrapped, it’s best to keep him in his stall until you remove the bandage.Your horse may get the bandage on his tail caught on something and, as a result, become startled or panicked. He could potentially pull to free himself, and the pressure put on the bandage could injure his tail.

, If your horse’s tail is irritating him for some reason, he may rub his tailbone against stall doors or fence posts. If you notice this behavior, make sure you identify the source and work to remedy whatever is irritating your horse’s tail.Pinworms are a common cause of tail rubbing. These are a parasite that lives in the horse’s anal area. Its eggs cause irritation and itching, which will then cause the horse to rub its tail for relief. A vet can diagnose this problem. Treating this issue is as simple as implementing and maintaining a deworming routine.
Treat any hotspots that rubbing may have caused. There are special creams and sprays that you can apply to any hotspots that might develop on your horse’s tail as a result of rubbing.

, Dirt and debris in your horse’s tail could lead to irritation, and consequently, could cause him to rub. By keeping your horse’s tail clean and moisturized, you can minimize the amount of irritants.Try using an antibacterial shampoo. These types of shampoos will better kill and eliminate common types of fungus and bugs that often cause skin irritation when caught in your horse’s tail.

When you are finished grooming, give your horse a gentle pat on his rump and tell him how good he was.",How to Keep Your Horse Calm While Grooming Its Tail," Earn his trust. You will both be better off if you get along. And your horse will be a lot more accepting of you messing around behind him if he knows you will never hurt him. But, that isn't always enough for some horses. So, keep reading.;
, Watch his ears the whole time -- if they flatten, step away in case he kicks.

, That way, he will know where you are and he will also know (by your tone of voice) that you mean no harm.

, Step away if he kicks. Once he seems comfortable with your presence, gently pick up his tail and begin grooming. Again, watch out for flying hooves!

, Then, if you wish, feed him a treat. Then, continue with the grooming.

Separate a section of your horse's mane to be pulled - about three inches.,
Take the section of mane that you are pulling in one hand, holding the longest hairs in the section.,
Take the un-bunched part and wrap it around the comb, giving it a good, firm pull where you want to shorten it so that the hair is pulled out at the roots.

,
Brush the entire section again, and repeat until all of the hair in that section is the desired length.

,
Repeat with the rest of the mane, making sure to brush it out every so often to verify that it is even in length.

,
Remember to praise your horse for being so patient!

",How to Pull a Horse's Mane," Take the remaining mane, if you think it will be in the way, and secure it with either a clip or large rubber band.put the other mane aside.;
, With the comb, comb the hair in the opposite direction of growth - upwards, towards the neck, so that most of it bunches up.

Watch the horse walk and trot to determine footfall.,
Lace--clean and reset (cut away parts of the hoof wall) the crack and then drilling very small holes on each side of it.,
Repair and stabilize the hoof crack.",How to Treat Hoof Crack," They will consider your horse’s conformation and what you are asking him to do as an athlete, along with scrutinizing the footing that you’re working him on--is it hard or uneven? Recognize that you might need to institute environmental changes--such as eliminating extremely wet, dry, or filthy turnout or bedding conditions—before your vet and farrier can remedy the hoof cracks.


Knowing what type of feed and supplements the horse receives will also help them determine if your horse is on the correct diet to support his hooves (several studies have found that biotin supplementation, for instance, can improve hoof quality). In short, consider all of your horse’s management and lifestyle factors to help determine the cause and, thus, prevent recurrence.;
, They run stainless steel wire through the holes, connecting the wires at each end and tightening them by twisting the ends together. 


Another method of repairing hoof cracks involves wire and very small screws. The practitioner places screws into the hoof wall on either side of the crack. He or she weaves the wire back and forth around the protruding screw heads.
Many times the treating veterinarian or farrier applies special hoof-patching glue over the screws so they do not work their way out of the hoof wall. Veterinarians and farriers commonly use such polymer and acrylic patching materials or “glue” to stabilize and repair hoof cracks. They some of these materials with fiberglass to create stronger patches over or around the hoof cracks.
Keep in mind that a crack that has been bleeding, infected, or filled with bacteria or fungi should never be covered with any type of repair material unless the veterinarian or farrier adds a drain for medicating the area. Covering an infected crack will most likely make matters worse, creating a breeding ground for the offending bacteria or fungi.

, Your farrier and veterinarian might have particular methods they prefer to use for different types of cracks. Balancing the horse’s hooves so his weight is more evenly distributed around the limb’s center of gravity is a major factor in repairing the crack(s). In some cases trimming the foot is all that’s needed to remove the crack or to get the horse on the road to recovery. More severe cracks might require corrective shoeing and stabilization techniques, such as adding clips on the shoe to either side of the crack and placing implants across the crack.


It is very important that you seek a farrier and veterinarian who are trained in diagnosing and repairing hoof cracks. Many farriers are qualified--through experience as well as continuing education opportunities offered by state and national associations -- to repair hoof cracks, with some specializing only in hoof crack repair. If you suspect your horse is lame because of a hoof crack or if there is infection or bleeding in the crack area, call a veterinarian to meet with you and your farrier.

Work slowly and carefully.",How to Trim Horse Hooves," Before you get started you will need to collect the tools required for trimming a horse's hooves. These tools will all serve a different function and all are required to properly clean and trim your horse's hooves. Make sure you have the following equipment:Gloves to protect your hands and fingers as you work.
Hoof nippers will be used for the actual trimming of the hoof.
A rasp is used to level off any rough areas of the hoof.
A hook knife can help you dig out any material that is caught in your horse's hoof.
Farrier chaps are optional, but offer protection to your legs while trimming your horse's hooves.;
, Hard, dry hooves are extremely difficult to trim and attempting to do so will only frustrate both you and your horse. Before you trim the hooves make sure to soak them in water, making them much easier to work with.Have your horse soak their feet in water or mud for around 15 to 20 minutes.
If you live in a dry location, bring a spray water bottle with you and moisten the hooves as you work.
If the hooves dry out during the trimming process, take a break and soak them again.

, Before you start trimming the hooves you will need to make sure they are clean. This allows you to get the best view of the hoof and will inform you of which areas need the most attention. Use your hook knife to remove any dirt or other material that may have become lodged within the hoof.Hold the knife with the blade pointing downwards, opposite to how you would hold a steak knife.
Keep your wrist straight and use your whole arm to make your strokes.
The hook knife can also be used to cut away areas of the frog if it has grown across the sole., Before you start trimming your horse's hooves, you should learn the parts of the hoof. Learning the parts of the hoof will help you to know which areas of the hoof need to be trimmed, how they should look, and how best to trim them.The outer hoof line and wall surrounds the exterior of the hoof.
The sole of the hoof is the entire area inside of the outer hoof wall.
The white line is just inside the outer hoof line.
The frog makes up a large portion of the hoof, starting at the heel and ending in a point at the center of hoof.

, After your horse's hoof has been fully cleaned and soaked, you will be able to assess which areas need trimming and how best to trim them. Each hoof will be different every time you go to trim them. Carefully look over your horse's hoof and decide your best course of action.


Look for areas that are cracked that might need to be trimmed.
Judge how long the the outer hoof wall is.
Decide if the front of the hoof will need to be trimmed.
See if the outside hoof wall is asymmetrical in any areas.

, Using the proper position when trimming your horse's hooves can help both you and your horse to be more comfortable during the process. Holding your horse's hooves correctly can also allow you greater control over the hoof and let you get the hoof as level and well shaped as possible. Always use the proper position when trimming your horse's hooves.Hold the front leg by lifting it up and back, towards the horse's chest. Rest the hoof on your thigh.
Lift the back leg directly up and place your own leg in front of it. Bend over and reach down to work with the hoof.
When lifting the horse's leg up, always make sure it is bending with the natural motion of that joint.
Don't try to lift the hoof if the horse isn't cooperating.

, To trim the hoof you will use your nippers. Nippers are similar to large nail clippers for your horse's hooves. The nippers are used to remove excess length in the outer hoof wall. Using the nippers is a good way to quickly remove parts of the hoof, roughly shaping it before finely trimming the remaining areas.Place the clippers on any long areas of the outer hoof wall.
Clamp the clippers down to cut the long areas of the hoof wall away.
Work slowly and make sure you are trimming to the length you need.
Trim the front of the hoof at a 45 degree angle to avoid a sharp toe.

, As you clean and trim your horse's hooves, they may become unleveled or rough in some areas. The rasp is a steel file that is used to correct any unleveled areas of your horse's hoof. Dragging the rasp across the hoof will remove some of the hoof with the stroke. Use your rasp to file down any leftover rough areas or spots that your nippers might be too large for.Don't rasp both heels at the same time as this can cause them to become uneven.
Keep your strokes short at first until you gain more control and have more practice rasping.
Keep your strokes as flat as possible in order to keep your horse's hoof flat.

, After you have leveled the outer wall of the horse's hoof, you will need to trim the sole of the hoof down until it is below the outer wall. This will help keep pressure on the outer wall of the hoof rather than on the sensitive inner sole.The outer wall of the hoof should be longer than the sole.

, After you have cleaned the hoof, trimmed it, and made sure it is level, you will want to look over the hoof one last time. This will be a final check to make sure any problematic areas have been dealt with, that the hoof has been fully cleaned, and that your horse's step is level.Check for symmetry in the hoof.
Try to make the hoof even on all sides.
The bottom of the horse's outer hoof wall should be flat.

, If you are interested in learning how to trim and care for your horse's hooves on your own, you might want to consider taking an instructional course. These courses can help you learn the parts of a horse's hoof, how to clean them, and the best ways to keep them trimmed evenly and safely.

, There are some cases where it might be better to hire a professional to trim your horse's hooves, rather than attempt to do it by yourself. Hiring a professional can reduce the risk of harm to your horse during the trimming and get your horse's hooves a perfect trim.If your horse has an injury or health issue with a hoof, you should hire a professional.
If your horse has unusual or uneven growth patterns to its hoof, a professional can work to make sure your horse's hoof is even.

, It may be tempting to try and trim all of your horse's hooves in one session but taking breaks and coming back to the task can be a better idea. If you are just learning how to trim your horse's hooves the process can be stressful and tough on both you and your horse. By taking breaks you can still get practice and make the task as enjoyable as it can be for both of you.If you are new to trimming your horse's hooves, try trimming only two per session. Trim either the front two or the rear two.
If you get tired or annoyed while trimming your horse's hooves, take a break and come back to it later.
Never lose your patience with your horse. If your horse views trimming as an unpleasant experience, it will be less willing in the future to cooperate.

Ensure that the health of the horse your plan to ride is up-to-date.,
Obtain the proper show clothes.,
Examine your grooming utensils and products to be sure you have enough of everything.,
Clean your tack thoroughly the day before riding your first dressage test.,
Pack the trailer the day before the show with the cleaned tack, clothes, and grooming utensils that you will need at the show.

,
Arrive at the show several hours before your ride time to properly groom the horse and prepare yourself.

,
Schedule at least 30 minutes in the warm-up arena to prepare your horse and for you to relax before your scheduled ride time.

,
Contract with a reader to be at the arena at your ride time.",How to Prepare for Your First Dressage Test," Although you may be performing the tests under an instructor, performing under a judge will help you see which movements of the test are your best, and which will need some work. The judges will often make comments on your score card that will help you improve when you next ride in front of a judge.


Look for a show that has different divisions such as open, amateur, and youth. This way you can enter a class that fits your specific riding level.
Shows may be found in your local horse publications, which are found at feed and tack stores. The back of breed magazines will also list the shows for that breed, often divided up into geographic areas. You may also look for shows online or ask your instructor to recommend a show.
You may want to look into performing your first dressage ride under a judge at a schooling show. These types of shows are often less formal than the open shows and are designed to help beginning riders become comfortable with what is required at a dressage show.;
, Booklets may be purchased through dressage equipment supply catalogs or online at various dressage associations. Dressage tests change every 4 years, and the last changes were published at the beginning of 2011.

,


Work on the geometry of the dressage tests. Make straight lines down the center line, halt squarely at the X, make correct 20-meter circles, and change gaits on command.

, This may include vaccinating the horse against common ailments and getting a health paper if you will cross state lines. Do this at least 4 weeks before riding your first dressage test.


Check your horse's feet, and have them trimmed or re-shod as needed. Do not try to trim or shoe the week of the show in case the farrier ""quicks"" the horse or drives a nail too close to the white line, causing the horse to go lame.

, You need a dressage coat, helmet, stock tie and pin, white breeches, white gloves, and boots. Many of these things can be borrowed for the class you are riding in, such as the tie, pin, and coat. However, good fitting boots and helmet are very important for your safety and should fit correctly.

, In dressage, the horse's tail is left free flowing; however, the mane and forelock will need to be braided and you will need rubber bands the color of the mane as well as combs, gel, or yarn.

, Clean tack will create a good impression for the judge, and if you do it the day before, this will save you work and worry on the day of the show.

,,,, A reader will read the test to you as you ride. A reader can be anyone, such as instructor, but make sure your reader is familiar with reading tests during a show.


Even though you may have memorized your test for the show, you may want to have a reader just in case. It is very easy to become nervous, lose your focus for a moment, and forget where you are in the sequence of movements. The presence of a reader allows you to hear the next movement in case this occurs.

Get a veterinary exam.",How to Ease Your Horse's Sore Hooves After Trimming," If your horse seems to be suffering as a result of hoof trimming, first consult with your barn, your veterinarian, and local tack stores to find an experienced and professional farrier that is highly recommended to take care of your horse’s hooves. This is the safest, most responsible way to approach the situation.
, If you are interested in trimming your horse’s hooves yourself, undergo proper training from an experienced and highly trained farrier (professional horseshoe applier) or veterinarian. There are a lot of bones, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue structures to take into consideration when trimming and adjusting your horse’s hooves., If your horse's hooves are trimmed improperly, it could be causing some discomfort. A horse's gait requires a delicate balance on the ground. If the horse's hooves are trimmed unevenly, it could throw off the horse’s gait and cause some discomfort.For example, when trimming the bottom of a horse's hooves one must make sure that the bottoms are completely level to the ground. Any deviation from parallelism will put an awkward force up through the horse's legs when it takes a step.

, If your horse's hooves were cut down too far when they were trimmed, you will need to let them grow out. This is the only way that the sensitivity on the hooves will diminish. Go to a horse supply and accessory store and purchase booties with gel soles. Put the gel booties over the hooves to help the horse feel more comfortable walking while you wait for the hoof wall to grow down.


Luckily, horses’ hooves grow pretty rapidly. Typically, you should have a horse’s hooves trimmed every four to six weeks. That means that within a few weeks, hooves that were trimmed too close should have grown out., One way to help a sore hoof is to put a horseshoe or a pad on it. The horseshoe will protect the horse's hoof from contact with items on the ground, such as rocks and sticks. The pad will reduce the impact that gets put on the hoof when your horse walks.A horse that is having shoes put on will have their hooves trimmed differently than a horse that is going without shoes. With this in mind, consider hiring a farrier to trim and put shoes on a horse that is having soreness issues in its hooves.
There are a wide variety of pads that are made for horses hooves. These are made from a variety of materials but are often plastic or leather. Pads protect the hoof while it is sore but are not a permanent solution for the horse's pain.

, Some horse's hooves are prone to soreness due to their structure, so they need to be trimmed more carefully and less aggressively.If you have a farrier trim and shoe your horse, be sure to have a conversation with them about the pain your horse is experiencing and how that can be avoided next time the horse's hooves are trimmed.

, In order to identify a problem with your horse’s hooves, you should watch how your horse moves. A problem is usually easiest to identify when your horse is trotting, as opposed to walking. This is because a problem will not usually show up when a horse is walking unless it is really bad.In order to figure out if something is off with your horse's gait, you should know what it looks like when it is correct. In addition, become familiar with how your horse's whole body moves when it walks and trots and how it sounds when the horses hooves hit solid ground. These things can help you identify when there is a problem.
Be sure to ask a knowledgeable friend, farrier or veterinarian for help if you are unsure about whether your horse is sore or not. Don’t wait to see if the problem gets worse.

, Tenderness in a hoof will cause your horse to try to avoid using it. When you are watching your horse move, look for differences in the amount of pressure it’s placing on each hoof.If a hoof is sore, your horse will change the distribution of its weight to keep pressure off of that hoof. This can change the horse's movement dramatically.
Your horse may also cock and rest its hoof more frequently if it’s experiencing soreness.

, If your horse has a sore hoof it may bob its head while trotting. Normally, a horse doesn't need to move its head for balance when trotting because the symmetry of each hoof hitting the ground keeps it balanced., Look for problems in your horse's hooves if you suspect a sore hoof. Make sure that the hoof was trimmed properly and that there are no other problems causing the horse discomfort.


When a hoof is properly trimmed the outside wall will be cut down and then leveled first. Then the inside sole will be trimmed down so that it’s lower than the outside wall.
One reason the horse's hoof might be sore is if the inside sole is too high and the horse's weight is being placed on the sole and not the outside wall.

, Other than improper trimming, there are a variety of problems that can cause soreness and discomfort in the hooves. These include:Thrush
Laminitis
Puncture wounds and abscesses

Bruises from stones or pavement
Cracks

, If you cannot figure out why your horse is experiencing discomfort then you may need to get a professional opinion. A veterinarian will usually give your horse a general physical exam, will look at the horse's hooves, and look at its gait in order to identify the problem.

If you do not have anyone to help hold your horse, you may want to tie your horse to a stationary object.You want to make sure that your horse doesn't try to move away while you're lifting her feet, as this could cause injury to your horse and to you.


Be sure to use a quick-release mechanism or a quick-release knot when tying up your horse for hoof maintenance.;
, Where you stand is crucial when you're going to perform hoof maintenance. If you're standing in any way behind your horse's foot, she could easily kick you, which can cause you significant injury or even death.When lifting the front legs, stand perfectly in line with your horse's front leg, facing her rear. Stroke your horse's neck with the hand closest to her body. Use your other hand to run down the back of your horse's leg and grasp the cannon bone, right above her ankle.When lifting the hind legs, stand with your shoulders in line with your horse's hip bone, and remain facing the rear of your horse. Keep the hand closest to your horse firmly in place on her hip. Use your other hand to stroke her rear and gently run your hand down to the cannon bone (just above the ankle)., For the front legs, press against the horse's shoulder with the hand you were using to stroke her neck. For the hind legs, press against the horse's hip with the hand you were using to stroke her rear.When you properly apply pressure to the cannon bone, your horse should shift her weight to the other leg that you are not holding., Once your horse shifts her weight to the other foot, move your hand from the horse's shoulder or rear to the front of her ankle on the foot you're trying to lift. Gently cup the hoof in your hand. Then release the hoof, praise your horse, and offer her a treat., This should be done several times in a row until your horse learns what you're expecting of her and is no longer startled. Be sure that your horse knows where you are in relation to her body at all times, and be careful to avoid getting kicked., Once your horse is accustomed to having her cannon squeezed and lifting her leg on command, grasp the hoof and hold it in place., While holding your horse's hoof in place, use a hoof pick to pry away any large debris, such as rocks, grass, and manure.Use the hoof pick to gently pry debris out of your horse's frog (the cloven V-shaped part of your horse's hoof).Work the frog from heel to toe, being cautious not to accidentally poke the frog itself.Use the side of the pick to scrape the surface of the sole and the outer edges of the hoof., Once you've picked away large objects with the hoof pick, use a stiff-bristle brush to gently scrub away mud, dirt, and sand.Once you've picked and brushed the hooves, you should be able to clearly see the sole of your horse's hoof.Don't be alarmed if your horse's frog appears tattered or worn. Horses shed the frogs of their hooves one to two times each year., It's important that you thoroughly clean each hoof every day, especially after riding or performing field work with your horse., Thrush is a bacterial infection, typically acquired from standing for prolonged periods on wet or dirty ground. Thrush should be treated with an over-the-counter medication, and the stall should be thoroughly cleaned and dried to prevent future occurrences of thrush.Signs of thrush include:


foul smells in the frog of the hoofa dark ooze secreted from the froga ""cheesy"" texture on the frog, Inspect the sole of the hoof closely. If your horse stepped on something sharp that subsequently fell out, you may not notice the wound until an abscess forms. If you find a foreign object that is still stuck in the hoof, it's important that you do not pull it out. Call your veterinarian as soon as possible to have the vet examine your horse's puncture wound.If an abscess has formed, you will most likely notice it during inspection. In addition to visual signs of an abscess, your horse's hoof will probably feel warmer to the touch, and her digital pulse will most likely throb stronger than usual. Have your vet inspect the abscess as soon as possible to prevent infection.If both of your horse's front hooves are warm to the touch and throbbing with an unusually strong pulse, and your horse is shifting from side to side uncomfortably, call your veterinarian immediately. Your horse may have laminitis, which is fatal if left untreated., Horse hooves often experience minor, ""superficial"" cracks that do not cause any real discomfort or harm. However, some cracks can develop into bigger, deeper, more painful cracks. If you notice a crack, it's best to stay ahead of the problem and let your farrier or vet know where the crack is and how big it is. Either your farrier or your vet should be able to tell you whether the crack needs to be addressed or not.Keeping your horse's hooves shoed can help prevent cracks and abscesses from forming., Flares, or hoof walls with an incorrectly-trimmed edge, should be rasped off every two weeks or as often as necessary. The walls of each hoof should be straight without any irregular flares on any sides of the hoof.Use a rasp in a side-to-side motion across the quarter section of the hoof walls until all quarters are flush with the ground., When trimming hooves, balancing the hoof is one of the most important concerns. Make sure that the the hoof wall's inner and outer size and shape are equal.If you have never trimmed a horse's hooves before, it's best to have a vet or farrier show you how to trim the hooves. An even better option would be to have the farrier perform the trimming, to ensure that you do not accidentally injure the horse.

, Hooves will generally need to be trimmed every 10-12 weeks for light-use, unshod horses. Some horses, depending on use level, will need to have their hooves trimmed every five to seven weeks. Each horse's needs will be different on a case-by-case basis. Consult with your vet or farrier on how often your horse's hooves need to be trimmed., Before you can shoe a horse's hooves, you need to ensure that the hooves have a balanced trim. If a hoof is unbalanced, you may have to rasp the walls until the walls are straight and the quarters are flush with the ground., There are many materials that horse shoes are made of, though typically a shoe will be steel, aluminum, or plastic, depending on the horse's anticipated use and activity levels.Once you've selected a material, you'll need to measure the shoe to your horse's hoof.


A good-fitting shoe should run the circumference of the hoof wall, covering the heels without extending out past the edge of the hoof. If a shoe sticks out past the edge, the horse may accidentally step on the rim of the shoe, and it could get pulled off or dislodged., Horse shoes are usually fastened in place using short nail clinches. Use square clinches that are not too coarse, and fasten the clinches approximately 3/4 inch up the wall of the hoof.If you are unfamiliar with how to fasten a horse shoe to a horse's hoof, have a farrier or qualified vet show you how to shoe a horse hoof.

Talk to your vet.,
Keep the horse’s feet well trimmed and balanced.,
Maintain your horse’s weight and muscling.,
Watch for signs of pain.",How to Do Dressage Training for Arthritic Horses1," Before you continue doing dressage training with an arthritic horse, you should talk to your vet. Only your vet can assess your horse’s individual needs and whether or not the horse should continue with dressage training. The vet may also suggest injections or supplements to improve joint function during dressage training., An arthritic horse’s feet should be well trimmed and balanced, especially if it is participating in dressage training. This will ensure that foot angles are as correct as is possible. Get a radiograph performed on your horse’s feet to ensure balance and proper angles., It is important that an arthritic horse that does dressage training is at an appropriate weight. This will ensure that weight is distributed evenly across joints and bones. Talk to your vet about the appropriate weight for your individual horse., Keep an eye on your horse for signs of pain and injury. Look out for heat and swelling in your horse’s joints. You should also be aware of changes in gait or increased stiffness. If you notice these symptoms, talk to your vet before continuing dressage training."
"
Accept the need to adapt the program.,
Pay particular attention to more taxing movements.,
Exercise caution with certain transitions.,
Reconsider lateral work.",How to Do Dressage Training for Arthritic Horses2," Doing dressage training with an arthritic horse will be different from training a healthy horse. You will need to pay close attention to signs of pain in your horse as well as augment particular movements and transitions.

, If your horse has arthritis, you will need to exercise caution with gaits, movements, and transitions that are harder on the horse’s joints and connective tissue. For example, extended trot and canter pirouette can cause added stress for arthritic horses., Learning how to transition between movements is an important part of dressage training. However, if your horse has arthritis, you may need to avoid transitions that skip between gears, like walk-canter-walk. Instead focus on transitions like trot-canter-trot or a simple lengthening., Lateral work including half pass, reverse, haunches-in, and shoulder-in can be hard on your horse’s joints. While it is okay to do lateral work with your horse, you should exercise caution. For example, a half pass does not need to be overly steep or entirely collected every time your horse trains."
"
Do dressage training year-round if possible.,
Make sure the horse warms up for at least ten minutes.,
Give the horse a longer cool down.",How to Do Dressage Training for Arthritic Horses3," It can take longer for an arthritic horse to return to dressage after time off. Instead of doing dressage training seasonally, consider doing it all year long. This will help keep your horse’s joints and muscles moving and maintain its flexibility. If an off season is necessary, try to limit it to no more than one month., If your horse has arthritis, there is a good chance that it will take them longer to warm up than a horse that does not have arthritis. Before doing any dressage training, you the horse should get in a walk that is at least ten minutes long., An arthritic horse will need to cool down for a longer period than a non-arthritic horse. This will ensure that the horse’s heart rate and breathing have returned to normal. A longer cool down will also enable the horse’s body temperature to regulate, and its muscles and soft tissues to relax."

Clean the hooves.Before applying hoof oil, the hooves will need to be clean of mud.,
Obtain a hoof oil brush.,
Check the care label before applying.,
Apply oil to the top of the hoof.,
Apply oil to the bottom of the hoof.Your horse should be tied up, preferably in a stable.",How to Apply Hoof Oil1," You can brush any grime off with a moist rag or a stiff brush. If the hooves are especially dirty, wash them. Pat the hooves dry if you get them wet.


Use a horse pick on the bottoms of your horse’s hooves. A horse pick is a small device which can remove mud, rocks, and small objects which may have become lodged in the grooves of your horse’s hoof.
Check the hoof for loose horseshoes. Have your horse reshod if you see loose nails or objects lodged between the hoof and the shoe. Loose nails might also be sticking out the top of the horse’s hoof.
If your horse’s hoof is punctured, do not pull out the sharp object. Contact your vet immediately for an evaluation.Signs of abscess, thrush, or punctures should be brought to the attention of a qualified vet. Cracks should be monitored. If they lengthen, your horse might need to see a farrier or vet.
Never apply oil to a dirty hoof; this will seal in dirt.;
, A hoof oil brush is a small brush with hard bristles.It resembles a paint brush and is used to apply hoof oil to the hoof. You can obtain a hoof oil brush online or, possibly, at your local pet store.


Some brushes come with a cover to keep the brush clean and prevent oil from dripping on other items in your horse-care kit. If your brush does not come with a cover for the tip, wrap it in a clean cloth when not in use.
Rinse your brush out after use. Always keep your brush and other grooming tools clean and organized.
Some hoof oils come with a brush attached to the inside of the lid. These are convenient in that you do not need a brush or a pan to pour the oil into.

, Every hoof oil is a bit different. Some are good for horses that spend most of their time in the field and are groomed infrequently, while others are primarily for well-groomed horses that spend more time in the stable. Some are better at keeping moisture in, while others are used more often for keeping moisture out. Dressings, conditioners, and other variations of hoof oil contain different ingredients. With any hoof oil, though, ensure you are using a type which meets your specifications and always follow the directions.


Consult a vet, farrier, or other expert on horses with hoof concerns.
Shake the hoof oil bottle before use to ensure it is mixed evenly., Dip your brush in the hoof oil and lift it out. Allow the brush to drip out a bit into the bottle or a small, clean pan. When the brush has slowed its dripping, begin applying the oil. Starting at the top of the hoof (where the hairline ends), move the brush across the hoof in vertical stripes. Coat the whole hoof with a thin, even coating of hoof oil.Some people who participate in horse shows like to apply horse oil to the top of the hoof just before a show in order to give the hoof a polished look. However, using hoof oil for cosmetic purposes is not recommended.

, Face the opposite direction as your horse and turn slightly toward it. With the hand that is closest to the horse, lean against its flank. With your other hand, reach down and squeeze the ankle slightly. Your horse should lift its leg up. After getting the leg up, use your hoof oil brush to cover the bottom of the foot in hoof oil.


Well-trained horses are quite compliant, but if your horse is not, stop applying the hoof oil and let it rest its leg before trying again.
Hold your horse’s foot at about the level of your knee. If you hold it too high, you’ll throw the horse off balance; hold it too low, and it will make the horse think you are done, and he or she might pull away from you.
Do not let the oil pool in the hoof, but ensure the entire surface of the sole is covered.
Hold each hoof up for a minute or two after applying the oil to ensure it dries properly.
If your horse is wearing horseshoes, cover as much of the hoof’s bottom as you can with the hoof oil. Try to apply the hoof oil when your horse is getting its shoes changed to ensure complete coverage.
There is no regular frequency with which you should apply hoof oil to keep your horse’s hooves properly dried. Use hoof oil when you notice your horse’s hooves becoming soft or spongy. Check them regularly for their texture and talk to a farrier if you have any concerns.

Call your vet immediately if you detect any nails or sharp objects stuck in your horse’s feet., A hoof oil brush is the tool used to apply hoof oil. Before applying hoof oil, visit your local pet store to find a hoof oil brush.Don’t agonize over choosing the “right” brush. They’re all basically the same.


Your hoof oil brush should remain clean. Wash the brush lightly in water and pat it dry.
Hoof oil brushes are often included in the hoof oil bottle. When you lift the cap off the hoof oil bottle, you’ll see a long stick-like tool with bristles on the end. This is the included hoof oil brush.

, There are many types of hoof oil. Each type has specific directions and ingredients which vary slightly. Carefully selecting the hoof oil you need requires reading the directions and ingredients on your hoof oil’s label. If your hoof oil is not used primarily to keep hooves moisturized, exchange it for another which is better suited to keeping hooves within their normal moisture range.


Be wary of hoof oils that claim to improve circulation or help hooves grow. These effects are secondary or minimal at best., Place some old rugs in the depression and soak them thoroughly with plain water. Place a hanging bag or feeder in front of the horse so that it must stand in the wet depression in order to eat.


Do not soak your horse’s feet too often. Excessive soaking can cause your horse’s hooves to become too soft. In wet climates, soak your horse’s hooves for about 10-15 minutes before applying hoof oil. In dry climates, soak for about one hour twice each week.Experiment with your horse to find the ideal frequency for soaking.

, Apply some hoof oil to the brush. After lifting the hoof oil brush directly out of the hoof oil, wait a few seconds before using it on your horse’s hooves. This way, excess oil will drip off your brush and you will not waste it or apply it too heavily. Then, cover the tops of your horse’s hooves with hoof oil.


Starting from either side of the hoof, run your brush across it in straight lines. Move from the top of the hoof toward the bottom, being careful not to get any oil on the horse’s hair near the ankle.
For instance, you might choose to start applying the oil from the left side of your horse’s hoof. Run the brush towards the right side of the hoof and stop when you reach the edge. Then, moving back to the left side of the hoof, brush a parallel row just below the first. Continue in this way, moving across and down the top of the hoof from one side to another.
Reapply hoof oil to the brush as needed. When you notice your brush no longer leaves hoof oil in its wake across the hoof, you will know it is time to apply more to the brush.
Your application should leave a thin, even layer of hoof oil on the surface of the hoof.Don’t use hoof oil just to give your horse’s hooves a shiny appearance. It should only be used when you have a problem keeping your horse’s hooves moisturized properly.

, Rotate your body at a forty-five degree angle toward your horse. Lean the hand closest to the horse against its flank. Reach down with your other hand and give the horse a gently squeeze on its ankle. Your horse will then lift its leg, allowing you to apply the hoof oil to the bottoms of the hooves. To apply the hoof oil, dip your brush in the hoof oil. Let the brush drip out a bit into the bottle of hoof oil. Then, cover the bottom of the hoof in its entirety.


If your horse is shod, apply as much hoof oil as possible to the exposed surface of the hoof sole.
You can start and end your application of hoof oil to the sole of the hoof from anywhere you want. For instance you could start from the center of the hoof and work your way out, or start from the outer edges of the sole and work your way in.
Keep the horse’s foot at roughly knee height.
Allow each hoof to dry by holding it up for a few minutes after using the hoof oil.

, If your horse has very dry or cracked hooves, soak them and apply some hoof oil two to three times each week. When your horse’s hooves improve, apply the hoof oil just once each week. Be careful not to over-moisturize your horse’s hooves. If you notice the hoof becoming spongy or soft, reduce the frequency with which you apply hoof oil."
"
Only use hoof oil if your horse has a problem with its hooves.,
Use hoof oil to keep moisture in.,
Use hoof oil to keep moisture out.",How to Apply Hoof Oil3," Hoof oil affects the ability of the hoof to absorb or evaporate moisture and must be used carefully.Applying it or any other compound unnecessarily can actually cause problems for your horse., If your horse’s hooves become too dry, they might become cracked or brittle. Hoof oil can alleviate these problems. In dry conditions, soak your horse’s feet and then apply a layer of hoof oil in order to help it better retain moisture., In wet conditions, hoof oil can help your horse’s hooves stay dry and prevent them from becoming too soft. Place your horse somewhere dry -- a dry stable, for instance -- until the hooves are fully dried. After applying a coat of hoof oil to the dried hooves, keep your horse stabled until the oil dries too."

Attend the other three legs.",How to Pick a Horse Hoof," Before you can start, you need to make sure your horse is calm. You should also make sure he does not want to wander off. You need to start in a calm area, because it is not possible to get your horse to stand on 3 legs if there is a lot of excitement around him.


You should tie your horse up. Make sure the rope that is holding them isn't too tight. This is so that, if the horse panics, he won't hurt his neck by jarring it against the bridle.
Make sure that the rope isn't too short, which could cause discomfort or panic. Also make sure the rope isn't tied too long, as the grazing instinct might take over and throw off the horse's balance if he lowers his head.;
, When you approach the horse, introduce yourself, and let the horse know you have good intentions. Give him gentle strokes on his neck and shoulder and speak to him softly. Stand near the shoulder of one side and turn your body to face his tail. For a horse that may kick, make sure that your body is positioned comfortably and safely.


When you plant yourself next to your horse, have your outside leg slightly in front of the other for better balance and efficient maneuvering.Get into a routine with the horse so that he recognized what you're about to do. This will make it easier on you because he will be more likely to cooperate.
It is a good idea to start with a front leg so you can gauge the horse's mood whilst being further away from the more dangerous back end., When you are firmly standing beside him, run your hand down your horse’s leg, then tap at the back of his leg. This should warn the horse what you are about to do, which will give him time to square himself up. You want to make sure your horse does this, because if the other three legs are positioned too awkwardly, you will not be able to pick his hoof.


He won't pick up a leg if he feels unbalanced, so give him a chance to sort himself out., Once he is settled, give your horse time to lift his foot. You can squeeze the leg above the fetlock, which is the hinge joint above the hoof, if the horse doesn't automatically pick up the leg at the first command.Have patience and be gentle, as this may take some convincing if the horse is not responding.


If he still won't pick up his leg, gently lean against his shoulder. This sometimes helps to push his balance to his other side. Be careful to do it slowly so he can shift his weight.
If all other attempts to get him to lift his leg have failed, gently squeeze his chestnut, which is the hard, oval growth above the knee on the inside of the leg. Be gentle and wait a second for the leg to lift. You should release it as soon as you get a response.
If nothing else works, talk to him and make clicking noises with your mouth to make sure he is paying attention. If a normally obedient horse will not raise a leg, check for lameness.

, Once you get him to raise his hoof, hold the hoof in one hand. If he tries to pull away or put his foot down, hold the toe of the hoof and lift it towards his elbow. Support the hoof with the hand closest to the horse's body, leaving the hand furthest from the horse to wield the hoof pick. This allows you the best position to put your body against the horse, and feel what movements the horse is making.


This also helps the horse to have confidence, because he knows exactly where you are and feels more secure.Some horses are much happier if you do not hold the pastern, which is the area below the fetlock and above the hoof., Once you finally get the horse’s hoof supported in your hand and your horse relaxes, you can release the strength of your hold on the leg. You don’t have to pull it so hard once he relaxes into the position. As soon as he does, you will only need minimal effort because the hold takes very little strength.


If you relax, he is less likely to stamp his hoof down.
Once the horse standing calmly on 3 legs, you can actually start picking the hoof.
’’Do not’’ pull the horses leg out toward you. You want to keep it in its natural place. If you pull it in an unnatural way, you will cause the horse serious pain., Once you have the horse hoof in your hand, you can start the picking process. Begin by removing any material from the frog, which V or triangular wedge shape that protrudes from the horse's heel towards his head, with your fingers or a brush rather than the pick. The frog is a sensitive part of the hoof that has a blood supply and nerve endings. It should be treated like any other sensitive part of the horse and handled with care.


The frog sometimes shreds. If it looks tatty and ragged, gently tug it with your fingers. If it doesn't come away, it is probably pieces of the frog and you should leave it to come away by itself.
If necessary, call a qualified farrier or hoof trimmer to trim it for you. If the frog is flaky, never be tempted to cut it back yourself. You can quickly go too deep and cut into living tissue, which could then cause your horse to go lame. , When cleaning, use the point of the hoof pick to gently loosen any stones and pry them free. Never dig the point into the sole or hoof. You should only use the point to gain leverage on stones. Use the edge of the hoof pick to loosen dirt, mud, and debris. Work away with steady strokes until you can see the horn that forms the horse's hoof.


It is best to work from heel to toe, to prevent accidentally damaging the heel area or stabbing yourself with the hoof pick.
Always work the hoof pick away from the frog. This means that you should start close to the frog and move the hoof pick away from it. This prevents accidentally piercing the frog with the pick.
Never apply pressure down towards the hoof, always use a wiping or swiping type motion, parallel to the hoof so as not to risk penetrating it., While you are picking the heel, you should look at the state of the horn, which is the layer of tough skin that surrounds inside of hoof wall.The horn of the hoof should look dry and be free from cracks or moist discharges.


If you see cracks, fissures, or a discharge, either in the form of pus or white, foul smelling discharge, contact your veterinarian immediately., These areas are along the cleft of the frog and around the white line area. These areas may get small stones stuck in them, which can be irritating and cause serious damage if left unchecked. Also check for thrush, characterized by a flaky white powder on the horse's hoof or frog. It will flake when scratched with the hoof pick. It's a common and potentially fatal hoof disease caused by wet or muddy conditions in a pasture or stall.Much like the horn, you need to check to make sure the frog looks dry and there is no discharge or smelly material exuding from it. Place your palm over the frog to ensure it is not hot. A warm, tender frog is a sign of inner infection which needs prompt veterinary attention., Once you have gotten all the debris out of the hoof and you have checked the horn and the frog, you need to make sure that the hoof is in good shape. Check the sole of the hoof, which should be hard and concave. You also need to ensure that the hoof is balanced and not in need of trimming. The horse should be able to stand squarely with all hooves in contact with the ground.


Check for bruises and cracks within the hoof. If the horse is reluctant to put one hoof down, this could be a sign of pain or discomfort. If you notice this, pay particular attention to that leg when you check the hoof., If your horse has shoes on, make sure the clenches, which are the nails that hold the shoe on, haven't risen. You will most likely know if they have risen when the clenches slice your hand. Try to shake the shoe to make sure that the shoe is not loose. Put the hoof down gently.


If the shoe is loose, book a qualified farrier to replace it as quickly as possible. Put a hoof boot or bandage over a loose shoe to keep it in place until the farrier can come.
Some horses do best with shoes, and some do best barefoot. Find a qualified farrier to discuss which is best for your horse.

, If your horse's hoof is extremely dried out, feels overly rough, or is in need of conditioning, you can add some hoof conditioner. There are many different brands of hoof conditioner or salve, such as Equine Squire Drawing Salve or Hoof maker, that can help rejuvenate your horse's hoof.You can make your own conditioner for your horse's hoof with coconut oil. You can also add one part aloe vera and one part glycerin to two parts coconut oil for a more intense conditioner for your horse's hooves.If your horse has an infection or other bacteria infection in her hoof, you can also get ointments such as ichthammol to help relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and kill germs., Once you have completed the full examination of one leg, you need to repeat the same procedure for each leg. When picking the rear hooves, stand right against the side of the horse's rump with your back to the horse's head facing towards his tail. ‘’’Never’’’ stand directly behind the horse. If he kicked out, you would be seriously injured.


Take care not to surprise the horse. You should run your hand down his back, over the rump, and right the way down the hind leg to his fetlock. Ask the horse to lift the back leg in the same way you did the front. Because you are standing to the side of the horse, should he kick out, just let go of the hoof and you will not get hurt.
You should try to check the legs in the same order each time."

You will also need a pulling brush for thinning the mane, a banding comb, a hair clip or two, and some sort of product to get the mane sticky.Quick Braid is a great product, but cheap hair gel will work in a pinch.
You may also need a step stool depending on the height of your horse, or your own height.
Organize your tools in an easy to reach place.;
, If you’ve never banded your horse’s hair before or it has grown out quite a bit since your last attempt, it will be easiest to cut off most of the mane before you start the process. Use your scissors to cut the mane to be about six inches long - it doesn’t have to be perfect or even. You’ll do a second trim when you finish banding to remove any remaining length and to even it out.

, Brush through the mane with your comb to remove any tangles or knots. You can dampen it with a bit of water to make this easier. If your horse’s mane is very thick, using a pulling brush to thin it out at this point. Apply your Quick Braid or gel until the hair feels workable, but not too sticky. Comb the product through the mane so it is applied evenly.


You don’t have to thin your horse’s mane unless it is particularly thick.

, Start at the end of the bridle path, and part out your first section of mane. Using your banding comb, for a pro mane, use only a section as large as a tooth of the comb. For a quicker mane, make it the width of two teeth. Use your hair clip to hold the remaining hair out of your way.

, Take a single band and wrap it neatly about the selected section 3-4 times or until the band is snug. The band should be level with the edge of the horse's crest so that the bands will echo the shape of the crest as you work along the mane.

, Reach under the band and take a small section of hairs and part it in two. Using both hands, take one piece in each and pull the pieces gently - slightly downward and to each side. It should look like you are making an upside down ""V"" under the band. Pull gently on these pieces upward along the neck, toward the crest, until the band pulls snug against the horse's neck., Move onto a second section of hair, following all of the aforementioned steps for dividing, banding, and securing the band. Try to line up the band so that it is even with the first one, giving the most clean and sleek appearance.

, Work down the neck following the pattern of banding you’ve created with the first two. Make sure that all of the sections of hair are of an even thickness, and that all the bands line up together. You may need to re-wet the mane regularly as you work.

, Depending on personal preference and the class you are performing in, you may have a specific mane length in mind. Typically though, the mane is cut to be 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) long total. Start at the first band near the bridle path, and cut the man off in a clean line with the scissors. Work down the mane cutting each individual band, making sure that they are all even lengths., Wet it down as you did the mane and apply product. Use the banding comb to help you separate the forelock into three sections. Braid the forelock down about an inch and then band it up right where the hair from the bottom of the forelock grows. Tighten down the band just as you did the mane.

, Spray or sponge on some Show Sheen (or a similar product) when you are finished to add gloss and shine to your completed mane and forelock. Be careful not to apply it too thickly though, as this may counteract your attempts to appear sophisticated and leave it looking greasy."

In order to do this, you may need to use a detangling product, such as Cowboy Magic, which you can purchase at many equine supply stores or through an online retailer.Mane conditioner or silicone cosmetic sprays are often helpful when it comes to detangling a horse's mane.;
, Before you comb or brush your horse's mane, be sure to work out as many tangles as possible using your hands.Remove any foreign objects including burrs, twigs, and hay with your fingers first. Then, section the mane off into 3 or 4 sections to be combed. Work through these sections with your fingers first, holding the base of the mane with one hand and separating with the other.


Never use a comb or brush until you've detangled the mane with your fingers first.
Holding the hair in one hand while you pick, comb, or brush with the other will help you pull less at the roots of the hair while working out knots and tangles.Use slow, smooth motions as you work out tangles. Yanking and jerking will cause your horse discomfort and may lead to breakage.

, Once you've gotten the majority of tangles out with your hands, your horse's mane is ready to be combed. Use a comb that's specially designed for horse grooming, as a human's hair comb will have teeth too close together to adequately groom your horse's mane.Start at the bottom of the mane and work your way upward towards the top of your horse's head.
Keep hold of the mane at the base as you comb with the other hand. This removes the pressure from your horse’s neck and transfers it to your hand.
Go over the entire mane until you've removed all tangles, burrs, and loose hairs.

, There are many different tools that can be used to groom a horse's mane. Brushes are used to work mud and debris out of your horse's hair, while combs can help pull out loose hair and work out tangles. When cleaning an already detangled mane, you'll most likely rely more on brushes.Use brushes with a range of bristle sizes. Brushes work loose particles of dirt that correlate to the diameter of each bristle, so use wider bristles for larger particles and thinner bristles for smaller ones., Brushes with medium- to very stiff bristles (like a dandy brush) work best for heavier patches of caked-on mud. Softer bristles work best at removing fine dust particles. They can also help distribute natural oils from the horse's skin, keeping the hair soft and silky.Apply enough pressure so that your brush loosens dead hair and dirt from close to the skin.
Use short, quick strokes and move the brush in the direction your horse's hair lies.

, Part of a proper grooming regimen should involve cleaning your horse's mane. Use a shampoo designed for horses, which you can purchase at an equine supply store or through an online retailer. You should bathe your horse about once every week or two, but don't bathe your horse more than once a week to avoid drying out its coat.Shampoo should be applied to the mane about once each month.Focus on shampooing the roots of the mane rather than scrubbing the ends of the horse's hair. Shampooing the outer layers of the mane can lead to weak, dried out hair.Make sure you thoroughly rinse out all the shampoo suds from your horse's mane, including deep down at the roots. Leaving suds behind will make your horse's coat itchy and it may rub until bald patches form., Conditioner helps keep your horse's mane soft and easy to detangle. Using the right conditioner will make it easier to brush out the mane when you groom your horse. Leave-in conditioners work best at preventing your horse's hair from drying out, though rinse-out conditioners can also help your horse's mane.Condition your horse's mane every time you shampoo it, which should be about once each month.Mix two parts conditioner and one part detangler.
Apply the conditioner to the outer and middle layers of the mane without going all the way to the roots. Too much conditioner at the roots can cause more dust and dirt to get clumped in and form tangles.
Comb the conditioner through the mane.
If you're using a rinse-out conditioner, be sure to leave it in for several minutes to absorb before rinsing out the mane.

, A thick mane is more likely to get tangled and trap dirt, making brushing and braiding difficult. The mane should be a uniform thickness that lies between four and six inches (10 to 15 centimeters) in length and lies flat against the neck.Some horse manes can be thinned just by using a metal mane comb. However, this depends on the length and thickness of your horse's hair.
Long, loose hairs can be pulled by hand up the crest of the neck. However, this can get uncomfortable on your hands and may take a lot of time.
The remaining hairs can be combed back down towards the horse.
Make sure you work with an experienced groomer who knows how to pull mane hairs. Pulling hair is painful if done improperly, but when done correctly it should not hurt your horse., A shorter mane reduces the risk of tangles and allows your horse's mane to lay over more evenly. You can use standard scissors, hair clippers, or thinning shears to shorten your horse's mane. Choose a tool that works best with your comfort level.If you're not familiar or comfortable with cutting a horse's hair, you may want to work with a groomer.
Search online and read customer reviews to find a reliable groomer near you.

, When you braid your horse's mane, you'll need to be aware of how wide each braid is. The hair closest to the withers (the ridge between the shoulders) gets stretched the most when a horse bends and stretches, so you'll want to make those braids the narrowest. Braids further up the mane can be made a little wider.There are many different ways to braid a horse's mane.Some of the most common include:


Hunter braid - involves weaving yarn into each individual braid, then tying each braid to itself using the yarn.Running braid - resembles a French braid and requires a longer mane length. This braid comes undone somewhat easily, so it should be braided just before a class or competition.
Continental braid - requires a very long mane length. It involves banding the mane and then banding each individual section together until the whole mane resembles a net with loose ends.

If it is summer or hot out, you may want to spray the horse with fly spray.",How to Groom a Horse1," Although some horses are trained well enough to stand still while grooming, many will feel the natural need to move their feet and shift around. Keep your horse in place by tying the lead rope above the height of his withers. Use a quick-release knot, securing him to a post, or have a friend or colleague hold the rope.


If you're tying your horse to a ring or post, always use a quick-release knot. A horse that spooks while he is tied often tries to escape by pulling back against the rope with all of his force. This is dangerous for both you and the horse. He may break his neck and you may be seriously injured.
You may wish to keep a Marlinspike in your grooming kit, which is a tool that can loosen too-tight knots or cut a rope in an emergency.;
, To pick up her foot, run your hand down her leg and gently squeeze her tendon. If she doesn't lift her foot, lean against her shoulder, squeeze her leg, and use your other hand to quickly grab your horse's hoof. Using a hoof pick, start at the heel of the foot and pick forward to the toe, carefully removing all rocks, dirt and debris. Make sure to clean the grooves on either side of the frog, the V-shaped part of the hoof. You should neither pick the horse's frog or dig deeply into the grooves. If the frog is unhealthy, that is, it is very black, squishy, soft and foul-smelling, be very careful with the hoof pick and have your farrier or veterinarian advise you.By picking out your horse's feet, you can help prevent lameness by removing stones or foreign objects like a nail or screw that could pierce the frog or cause bruising. Picking the hooves out before riding is essential, especially if your horse is wearing shoes.
A shod foot does not clean itself when a horse moves, so cleaning can make walking much more comfortable for your horse.
Picking your horse's feet can also help remove and prevent thrush, a sticky black fungus that develops around the frog.
The best times to pick your horse's feet are before and after a ride.

, Rubber curry combs are made to loosen up dirt, mud, and bits of things caught in your horse's coat. Currying should always be performed before brushing for the best results. Use the curry in vigorous, small circular motions over the horse's muscles, and be extremely careful on bony areas like the face, spine, and legs.


On one side of the horse, work your way from the neck, to the barrel, and all the way to the rump. Then, repeat on the other side of the horse. If your horse is a riding horse, remember to to brush well in your horse's girth area.
The curry comb should be rubbed in a circular motion in the direction opposite of the hair growth. This will pull up loose hairs and dirt that otherwise would just be brushed over.
If you find “itchy spots” on your horse, he may make a funny face, pushing his nose away from his lips, or he may even try to groom you. Be careful; if he wiggles his nose on you, he may also try to nip you just the same way horses groom each other. A horse doesn’t understand that grooming you could hurt you, but your skin is much thinner than a horse's. If he tries to groom you, just push his nose away and know you found an “itchy spot” and he really enjoyed that good scratch.

, A dandy brush is a hard-bristled brush used to take off the dirt and hair brought out by the curry comb. Brush in short, straight, flicking motions to allow the bristles to get all the way through the coat and whisk the dirt out. Start at the neck and work towards the tail. It's not recommended to use a hard brush on the horse's legs, as they are much more sensitive than the body. The legs are bony and narrow and it is uncomfortable for the horse if brushed too hard with the dandy brush.Do not use on the face, ears, mane, tail, legs, or any clipped area, as this can cause the horse to be in immediate discomfort.
If necessary, use a soft cloth or sponge on any sensitive parts of the horse where the dandy seems to bother or irritate her.

, The soft brush, as its name suggests, can be used on all areas of the horse as a result of its texture. You should still be careful and gentle around the face and around the eyes, ears, and muzzle. The soft brush removes any remaining surface dust and hair. Finish up your body-grooming by brushing down the entire body, including sensitive areas like the face and legs.


If you want to use a separate brush for the face, use a face brush. They are designed for brushing horses' faces. They look like miniature soft brushes and are much easier to fit on a horse's face.

, Take a damp sponge or washcloth, wipe your horse's eyes, and clean out his nose. Use a different sponge/cloth/wipe for the dock area (under the tail). Because these areas are constantly moist, dirt and mucus build up and need to be cleaned out. Always remember to be gentle when doing this; these areas are sensitive.


Use different brushes, sponges, and cloths for each horse if you are grooming multiple horses. Infection and skin fungus, like ringworm, can be spread by sharing grooming tools.

, Use a wide-bristled mane comb or brush to get tangles out of the mane and tail. Before you start, use your fingers to separate the hairs caught in large tangles. Hold the whole tail/large section of mane in one hand (to avoid tugging) and brush it out with the other. Continue taking small pieces from the side of the tail until you have brushed the whole tail.


When brushing the tail, stand to the side of the horse. This way, if the horse kicks out, you are in a safer position and less likely to be hurt.
Make sure to talk to the horse and keep your hand on the horse to keep her attention on you.
If you want to use a hair product, use natural mane/tail sprays that are all-natural rather than silicone-based. Spray it on and work it in; other than helping with the detangling, it will moisturize and make the hair look shiny., Flies can be a major irritant to your horse. They can build up around the face, spread infections, and large flies, called horse flies, can bite and cause pain. The flies will most likely annoy you, too. Just spray the solution on the horse, being careful to avoid the face. There are both natural and chemical fly sprays on the market.

",How to Groom a Horse as a Beginning Rider," In many stables, each horse has a grooming kit of its own, or in others, brushes are placed in a central location and shared. Find out how your stable stores its grooming gear, and either take the grooming kit, or get what you'll need -- at least one currycomb, dandy brush, soft brush, face brush/cloth, hoof pick, and comb.;
, These come in many different styles, but are essentially a sturdy rubber or plastic brush with little points sticking out. The purpose of the currycomb is to loosen the dirt and dust in the horse's coat. To use it, brush the horse's coat in circular motions.

, Do this by brushing in the same direction, to smooth out the horse's coat as well. Start with the dandy brush, which has stiffer bristles, and then clean up with a softer brush. You can also use the soft brush on the horse's legs, if your instructor gives you permission.

,, Remove the dirt, manure, and other debris that may be stuck in there. This is done with a tool called a hoof pick, that can come in many different styles, but usually has a pointy end for removing stuff and often a brush as well. To pick up your horse's foot for picking, run your hand down his leg, squeeze the lower part slightly, lean on his shoulder, and pull up. Your instructor will help, if necessary. Then, hold the hoof comfortably and begin cleaning it.
Hoof picking is one of the only parts of grooming that really involves anything besides common sense. When You pick up the horse's foot, you'll see that's oval-shaped, with a ""V"" in the middle. The ""V"" is called the frog, and it is very sensitive. Do not touch it with the hoof pick, but clean in the crevice around it. Carefully dislodge any stones, if you find them, and get all the dirt out.

, Use conditioner, if you're having trouble and your instructor suggests it.

, You must always do this from the side, so that you'll be less of a target if he kicks.

You can also cross behind him by simply crossing well beyond the reach of his legs.
Don't ever try to cross in front of a horse. You can get tangled in his rope, trip, or be crushed or kicked if he jumps or moves forward., Your horse has blind spots directly in front of and behind her. To avoid surprising her, make sure you approach from an angle or the side so she can see you, and announce your presence in a calm voice., Your horse will be reassured by calm, slow, deliberate movements. This also gives you a chance to watch for his reaction — if your horse shows signs of agitation when you touch a specific spot, you know to be more gentle or leave that spot alone., Your horse may accidentally step on your foot, and if you are barefoot or wearing sneakers or sandals, your foot will get crushed (horses generally weigh over 1,000 pounds). Wear sturdy boots that will protect your toes.

, Your horse has the nature and speed of any prey animal when startled or frightened, and you need to be ready to get out of the way if she gets scared. Sitting, kneeling, or lingering around your horse's feet may not only make her nervous, it may make it more difficult for you to move to safety.Instead, you can crouch, squat, or bend over if you need to get low on your horse's body."

Leave standing room to braid the mane on the right side of the horse, which is traditional for hunter and dressage competitions. For jumper competitions, you may braid the mane on whichever side it falls naturally., Before you begin, there are a few steps that can make the process easier:


Sweep hay and other ground cover away from the horse so you can find dropped objects, especially if you are using a needle.
Place a stool next to the horse if you cannot reach the horse's neck easily. Working with the mane at waist level might be easiest.
Put down a container for your tools, or wear an apron or overalls with a large pocket.

, Take a soft body brush, and dip it in water, egg white, or hair gel for horses, to keep the mane flat and easy to work with. Brush gently to remove all tangles.

, Continue on to any one of the sections below, or use these tips to decide which you want to try:


The band method makes easy, dangling braids, best for short manes.
The yarn method is harder, but makes sturdy, attractive looped braids.
Sewing creates small ""button braids"" often used in dressage. You'll need to use bands or yarn first before you can sew these on.
A running braid is quick and easy, but not suitable for competitions.

"
"
Divide the mane into equal sections.,
Braid the first section tightly.,
Fold the braid tip and secure tightly with an elastic band.,
Repeat down the length of the neck.",How to Braid a Horse's Mane2," Using a mane comb, comb the mane into narrow sections. Start at the top and work your way down. As you get further down the mane, the hair gets thinner, so your sections will become gradually wider in order to ensure evenly sized braids. Secure each equal section with a loosely wound elastic band.


For practice braids, choose a band color that stands out. For competitions, choose a band color that matches your horse's mane.
Traditionally, an odd number of sections are used. Use more sections for horse's with short, wide necks, and fewer sections for horses with long, thin necks.

, Remove the band before braiding, and begin at the top. This can be a basic braid or a French braid. For a basic braid, divide the section into three pieces and alternately weave the left and right section over the middle.


Pull the hair down as you work, not toward you, so the braid lies in the right direction.Dampen the section again with the body brush if it is difficult to work with.

, Fold the tip of the braid back under itself a short distance. Secure the tip of the braid with a tightly wound elastic band.


If the mane is long, fold the braid tip a second time before securing.

, Repeat with each section, trying to make it as neat as possible. Optionally, place a small dab of egg white or hair gel for horses over each braid to help keep it in place.


Never leave the braids in overnight without protection (see Tips). After removing them, brush the mane out with water.
Optionally, if you want a tidier and showier braid, move on to the section on sewing button braids.

Repeat along the length of the mane.,
Decide on a braid style.,
Use the latch hook to pull each braid up to the top.,
Loop the yarn tails around the braid.,
Tie the yarn tails halfway down the braid.,
Snip off the ends of the yarn.",How to Braid a Horse's Mane3," This method requires a latch hook and yarn. You can buy both at a craft store.

If you prefer button braids to dangling braids, you'll need yarn, strong cotton thread, and a needle instead.

, Separate a section at the top of the mane, 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide. Clip the rest of the mane with an alligator clip until you're ready to work on the next section.If the mane is too thick to braid easily, the sections can be as narrow as ½ inch (1.25 cm)., Braiding in the yarn will be much easier if you keep the horsehair wet. Work in water, egg white, or hair gel for horses with a comb or your fingers.

, Braid the mane as you would human hair, dividing it into three plaits and weaving the left and right around the center. Stop when you are about halfway down the length of the mane.


Pull down along the horse's side as you braid, not out toward you, or the braid won't lie flat.If you want your braids to look as professional as possible, count the number of crossovers in the braid before you stop, so you can use the same number for each section.

, Start with a piece of yarn about one foot (30 cm) long.You'll quickly find out whether you need a shorter or long piece for your horse.


Once you know how long a piece to use, you can save time by laying the yarn back and forth to the correct length, and cutting it into strands all at once.

, Fold the yarn over so the tips meet. Place the middle of the yarn over the braid, at the last crossover you did before stopping.

, Perform the next crossover as you would normally, but lay it over the yarn loop, trapping it beneath the hair.

, Divide the yarn so one strand is with the left section of mane, and the other is with the right.Continue to cross the braid over as usual, pulling downward to keep the yarn and mane taut. Stop when there are 4 inches (10 cm) of hair left hanging.

, Grasp both strands of yarn dangling below the braid, and loop them around the braid tip. Pinch the braid tip together, then thread one yarn end through the loop and pull into a tight knot. Leave the remaining yarn dangling below the braid.

, Optionally, you can trim the hair strands beneath the yarn knot. Take care not to cut the yarn, and trim at an angle with a sharp pair of scissors to create a clean point of hair., Repeat the steps above for the rest of the mane. Each braided section should use the same amount of hair. If the hair thins out toward the bottom of the mane, compensate by making wider sections.

, You have three options at this point:

Leave the braids as-is. (Not recommended for competitions.)
Continue to the next step to complete the yarn loop.
Tie off the yarn, cut off the extra, and skip down to the button braid section.

, Push the end of the latch hook through the top of the braid, at the neck. Hook the dangling yarn tails, and pull them up until the braid tip touches the top of the braid, and the yarn tails extend past it. Repeat with each braid, so you have a series of looped braids along the mane.


Do not pull any further. The braid tip should not push through the top of the braid, just rest against it.

, Remove the latch hook and set it aside. Pick up the two yarn tails on a single braid. Loop one yarn tail under from the left and the other from the right, crossing each other under the braid next to the neck.

, After crossing the yarn under the braid, switch the hands you're holding them with. Bring them together again halfway along the braid loop, and tie them together at the top side of the braid. Tie one knot over your thumb, then slip the yarn tails through where your thumb are. Tighten the first knot, then tie a second above it to make a strong double knot.Repeat with each braid.


Each knot should be in the exact middle of the braid, or the braid will slant.

, Cut the dangling ends of the yarn with a pair of scissors, leaving about ¼ inch (6 millimeters). Repeat for each braid, and you're ready for a show.


See the Tips section if you need to leave the braids in overnight.
To remove these braids, just snip the yarn knot and gently pull the yarn through the braid. When all braids are removed, brush the mane with a wet body brush.

Braid the mane using bands or yarn.,
Thread a needle with cotton thread.,
Sew up through the tip of the braid.,
Fold the braid tip up and sew it to the base.,
Fold the braid again.,
Sew back and forth through the base.,
Repeat until sturdy.,
Loop the thread around any stitch.,
Knot the braid.,
Repeat for the remaining sections.",How to Braid a Horse's Mane4," Follow the steps in the band or yarn section to create braids in your horse's mane. At the end of it, you should have a line of braids running down your horse's neck. While there are no rules determining how many button braids to use, different competitions follow different fashion fads:Dressage competitions, where button braids are most popular, use 11, 13, 15, or 17 braids.
In show hunter competitions, 40 or more tiny button braids are a more favored style.
In jumper competitions and other situations where style does not earn points, braid however you like, or not at all.

, Find a sturdy cotton thread that matches your horse's mane color, or use a brightly colored thread for an easier practice session. Thread the needle, then tie a knot in the thread to keep it from slipping out.


You can buy ""plaiting thread"" for this purpose, but any strong cotton thread will work.

, Push the needle through the tip of the braid and pull it through. Do this two or three times in the same direction, until the thread is securely lodged in the braid., Fold the tip of the braid under the rest of the braid, to rest against the horse's neck. Secure the tip of the braid to the base of the braid by pushing the needle and thread through.

, If the braid still dangles down in a line, roll the middle under the braid to form a ball. This is the ""button braid"" look we're going for, also called a ""rosette braid"" or ""dressage braid.""

, Push the needle through the left side of the button braid, as close to the neck as you can work without risk of poking the horse. Pull the needle back through the right side of the braid base, then push it through the center.

, Bring the needle back over to the side of the braid you're next to. Repeat the last step at least two more times, pushing it through the left, pulling back through the right side, then pushing out again through the center.You are done when the braid is tight and secure, and there is no loose thread.


These balled-up braids can rest on top of the neck (better for long, thin necks) or fall slightly onto the right side (better for short, wide necks). You can control their position by how tightly you sew them, but don't stress too much about this while you're learning.

, Loop the thread around one of your previous stitches, but don't pull it all the way tight. Leave a small loop.

, Thread the needle through the loop and tighten to create a knot close to the base of the braid. Cut the thread with a pair of scissors, as close to the knot as possible.

, Repeat for each section of the mane. checking to make sure each section has roughly the same amount of hair.


See the Tips section for how to protect the braids overnight. When it comes time to remove them, snip off a stitch on the left side and a stitch on the right with a pair of scissors, carefully avoiding the braid itself. Brush the mane down with a wet brush after all braids are removed.

It is most important that you and the horse get along, that the horse is capable of doing the job asked of him, and that you are able to handle his level of training. Good, sound, sane horses are available at every price, so don't break your budget on an expensive horse, especially when you are first starting.;
, If you already own a horse, find a discipline that he is capable of doing. If you will be purchasing a horse, you have a little more leeway. Research online about the many different horse sports available, and choose one that you and your equine partner will both enjoy.

, Even if you had read every single book about horses, you would still need a trainer to help you with riding, and especially with showing. A good trainer will train you, as well as the horse. Be sure they understand the discipline that you have chosen.

, A small, local show is often the best for your first time, because there is less stress on both you and the horse. Contact the show organizer, and explain that you have not competed before. They will be more than happy to guide you through the process.

, Give your horse a good bath the day before the show, making sure that all white markings are spotless. Groom the mane as your discipline requires: either braided, banded, clipped or natural.

, For most disciplines, you will need your saddle, saddle pad, girth, stirrups, bridle and reins. For some, you will need special equipment, like breast collars, martingales, double reins, and other things. Be sure to check with your sport's rulebook for the required equipment.

, For most English disciplines, you will need light-colored breeches, boots, a belt, a light-colored shirt, stock tie, pin, dark riding jacket and a helmet, while for most Western disciplines you will need riding pants, chaps, riding boots, a riding shirt, belt, buckle and hat. Don't forget to check your sport's rulebook for the specifics!

, Some show managers require you to arrive within a certain time bracket, while some don't mind if you come only for your class. Shows can run ahead of schedule, however, so come a few hours early!

,, Sometimes, the rings are open for use if you arrive early enough. Walk or ride your horse in the ring you are starting in, if possible, to get him accustomed to his new surroundings.

, Dab on some hoof oil or hoof polish. Wipe on highlighter or baby oil to your horse's muzzle and eye area. Spray his coat with a shining spray and brush through his mane and tail one more time.

, Have your friend help you pin your number on.

, Breathe, and don't get nervous. Don't drill your horse, either. Just do simple, relaxing exercises to help him warm up and relax.

, Visualize yourself riding perfectly, take a deep breath, and go!

, Judges love a genuine smile, not one that is plastered on. Enjoy yourself, and believe me, your smile will be genuine when you leave with a bright blue ribbon around your horse's neck!

, It is good to practice before the show so you know what you are doing.

Learn about the different materials from which lariats are made.,
Determine what length of lariat is appropriate for age and size.,
Choose a diameter for the lariat.,
Understand the lay of lariats.,
Know where to buy a lariat.,
Set up your target.,
Stand 15-20 feet (6.1 m) away from your target.This gives you ample room to swing your lariat without accidentally catching the target before you throw it.,
Create a loop in your lariat and hold it in your dominant hand.,
Slide your hand away from the eye by at least 18 inches.When you start twirling the rope overhead, you do not want your hand to be too near the eye so that the loop moves freely.,
Hold the excess coils of lariat in your other hand.,
Raise your dominant arm overhead, holding the loop, and begin to swing.,
Maintain your grip on the loop and the spoke.,
Twirl the loop at a speed fast enough to allow you to control its direction.,
Choose the correct moment in the swing to throw the lariat.,
Jerk the lariat taut after it lands on the target.",How to Rope," Over the last several decades, lariats have been made from a variety of different materials that are suited for different purposes.


Original lariats were made out of rawhide and had a creation process that took a couple of weeks.However, rawhide lariats are not the best choice for practical uses, like roping cattle.Manila is a popular option, as it is strong and sturdy. However, manila tends to alter flexibility with the weather. Reportedly, manila ropes become stiff when they are wet and limp when they are cold.<ref.http:
Nylon is another popular option, as it is strong and does not have any of the issues with weather that manila does. It also comes in a variety of sizes.Poly ropes are popular today, as well. They have a synthetic core that is covered with a polypropylene coat and tend to conform to the roped object or animal quicker than other types of rope.;
, Lariats come in various sizes, and some lengths are too much for a child to handle, while others are too short for an adult to use.Lariats that are 20-30 feet in length are appropriate for children.
Lariats that are 40-50 feet in length are appropriate for adults.

, The standard sizes are 5/16 inch and 3/8 inch.The 5/16 inch lariat is described as “scant,” while the 3/8 inch is described as “full.”
The scant rope is likely easier for children to handle.

, Lariats have three fibers that are twisted together. How tightly the fibers are twisted is what is called the “lay.”Extra soft
Soft
Medium
Hard
Extra hard

, Lariats can be bought in a few different places, some of which seem unusual for the purpose.


Rope stores
Western stores
Hardware stores
Tack stores
Online stores, like Amazon and eBay

, There are a variety of different targets you can use to learn how to rope.


A post
A plastic steer head secured to a post or stand
A roping dummy
A box

,


Lean your weight on the balls of your feet, as if you are sitting on a saddle with your feet in the stirrups.

, The size of the loop depends on personal preference.Run the end of the rope through the honda, which is the eye in the rope that slides the loop open and closed.Some ropers prefer to start with a small loop and allow it to grow in size while they twirl it overhead.
Other ropers prefer to start with a large loop of approximately seven feet in diameter and keep it that size while twirling.

,


However, do hold a bit of the excess slack in the same hand as your loop. This helps you to keep the loop open.
This stretch of the rope is called the “spoke.”

, Leave enough slack to give yourself room to lift the loop above your head, twirl it, and throw it.At least six feet of lariat between the two hands is recommended.
Hold the coils in such a way that they will easily slip off of your hand when you throw the lariat.

, The twirling of the lariat is the hardest part to master, because many people have a hard time learning how to make the twirl happen with their wrist.Move only your wrist, not your whole arm. Think of your wrist as an axle, as if the rope was a wheel revolving around your wrist.Correctly twirling the lariat with the wrist allows the rope to slide through the eye a bit so that the loop widens. This is especially necessary if you choose to start with a small loop.

, While you are twirling, you do not want to let go of these two things. They should already both be held in the same hand, per Step 4.


Your grip can be loose enough to allow the loop to widen, via excess slack rope sliding through the eye, if you start with a small loop and need to make it bigger as it twirls.

, A loop that moves too slowly overhead will lilt and fall, and you will not be able to control where it goes.


This is important as you prepare to throw the lariat at your target., Although you twirl the rope with your wrist, the throw is completed with your arm. There is an ideal time to throw the rope.


Wait until your swinging wrist makes its way from back to front; as it is doing so, take a step forward. Bring your hand forward and down to shoulder height, with your hand facing the target and your palm facing down. Extend your arm to its full length, and release the loop to soar at the target., It is best to do this with the same hand that threw the rope, as your other hand is holding the excess rope (or, in some cases, your reins, if you are on horseback).Do this by turning your throwing hand over the rope, grasping it with your four fingers, and sticking your thumb out toward your body. Then pull the slack taut back toward your body.

, If your horse is white or has quite a bit of white or grey on him/her don't be afraid of giving them a second bath. Otherwise you just need to make sure they are squeaky clean with no manure stains or other noticeable things. On white horses, they sell specific products to clean their coats more and deeper, since you can see all the dirt because of their light color. It is always a good idea to give them a bath the day before the show because this can be quite time consuming.

, This is optional for schooling shows but may come in handy for the judges scores. If you horse is in a stall and will not dirty or mess up the braids, put them in the night before. Again this is very time consuming. If he might, get up a little earlier and do it in the morning of the show.

, If you plan to wear them to the show (not recommended) you might just leave them out to put them on before you leave. Remember to prepare for what events you are entering. Its no fun to walk into a western pleasure class dressed for jumping.

, DEEP CLEAN! Polish boots and wash clothes. Wipe helmets and iron coats. Lay them all in a box or bag you can put into the vehicle very quickly if time pressed. Best if put in clothes or boot bags. They even make helmet bags. You can get these at your local tack shop for a reasonable price.

, Clean your tack and polish everything to the extremes! Soak your bits and check your horse. Organizing always made everything easier, so make sure you put everything in its place and remember its there, for you will probably need it at the horse show.

, Set aside some books and games you can do while driving over there. Its better to play games and not think about the show because of experience I know how you always think of what could go wrong. If not think of what you can do with your friends. And who you will cheer on. Think of how much fun you are going to have.

, You may also want to load it all in the trailer or truck the night before so it is less time in the morning.

, It may be really hard to sleep do to anxiety. Don't worry about it. Picture yourself holding up the trophy or ribbon for 1st. Think of positive things and you will dream of positive things and have a better experience at the show.

, Go out to you horse and check him/her for manure stains and any signs of illness. It is a good idea to groom the horse before you put their hauling equipment on. Load the horse fifteen minutes to half an hour before you have to go, depending on the horse's ability to load. Check everything again. Make sure you aren't forgetting anything and check the trailer. Put in a little hint of hay for you horse and away you go.

, Go get your number from the secretary's booth. Thirty minutes to forty five minutes before you class, get dressed and do your hair. Spray some hair spray in you and your horse's mane / hair. Put on your horse's tack and let them walk around and see the environment.

, Then you can walk around and warm up your horse so his/her muscles don't tear.

, Its just a class. You ride, the judge scores, if you didn't win, there are TONS of other chances you will have. If you are disappointed at your score. Don't get mad at the judge. Tip your helmet and walk out when dismissed. If you are really mad and need to let it out, do it in the bathroom or in the empty horse trailer. If you really believe the judge scored you wrong, ask the secretary to talk to her at lunch break. It is unlikely but you could try to get the reason you scored what you did. Some judges even go up to you and tell you what you did wrong during the class before ribbons are awarded. That tells you what you did wrong and what to keep doing.

Form two teams with four players on each team, who are all on horseback.,
Know each player's and the team's assigned handicaps.,
Arrange a horse to each player.,
Understand how the game is timed and controlled.,
Learn how the game is played.,
Familiarize yourself with defensive playing techniques.Defensive techniques help players keep the opposing team from scoring in their goal.",How to Play Polo1," The four players are split into “attack” and “defense” roles, based on their number, which is indicated on their jerseys.Player 1's primary focus is on scoring goals for the team, which is an offensive position. This player often has the lowest handicap, which refers to the player's skill level.Player 1 also has the responsibility of covering the opposing team's Player 4.Player 2 is also focused on scoring, as an offensive position, but he/she takes on more responsibilities of playing defense than Player 1. Player 2 has to cover the opposing team's Player 3, as well.Player 3 has a multitude of responsibilities, because he/she is typically both the best player on the team and the team captain. Roles include scoring, playing defense, determining strategy, and covering the opposing Player 2.
Player 4's main responsibility is playing defense for the team, and he/she can move anywhere on the field.He/She has to cover the opposing team's Player 1.;
, Polo competition committees exist in each country where the sport is played, and these committees determine both players' and teams' handicaps.


Handicaps range from -2, which refers to beginners, to 10, which refers to highly advanced.Handicaps are referred to in goals, e.g. a team has a handicap of 20 goals.
Polo competition committees use handicaps to assign teams to different levels of play, with low goal polo at a total handicap of -8 to 4, medium goal polo at 4 to 16, and high goal polo at 17 to 40. These levels are further divided to match teams of similar experience levels., Horses used for polo are referred to as “ponies,” although they are usually full-sized horses.


Ponies are allowed to be in the size range of 14.2 hands to 16.0 hands, which is measured at the horse's withers. A hand is measured in four inches, so ponies can be 58 to 64 inches in height.
Ponies should weigh between 900 and 1100 pounds.
Polo ponies are chosen for stamina, agility, maneuverability, and bursts of speed.They are often Thoroughbreds or Thoroughbred crosses.
Polo rules dictate that ponies must be given breaks in the game, so each polo player must have at least 2-3 ponies for low goal polo up to one pony per chukka, or time period, for high goal polo.Ponies can play for a maximum of two non-consecutive chukkas per polo match., Polo has several time periods, as well as mounted umpires and referees.A polo match has 7-minute time periods, which are called chukkas. The overall play time is about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, or 90-120 minutes.
High goal matches have six chukkas.
There are 3-minute breaks given between chukkas, and there is a 15-minute half-time, as well.
Each game has two umpires and a referee, who intervenes when the umpires cannot come to an agreement. There is also a flagman at each goal post who signals when a goal has been scored.
Outdoor polo is played on a field that is 300 yards long by 160 yards wide. Each end of the polo field as an 8-yard wide goal with 10-foot high posts.

, Game play is fairly straightforward, as long as the techniques and rules are understood.Players use a long-handled mallet and play with a small, solid plastic ball.
A polo match begins with a throw-in, which is when an official rolls the ball in between the teams, who are lined up in numerical order opposite of each other (i.e. Player 1 across from Player 4, Player 2 across from Player 3, and so on). Throw-ins also occur when play resumes after a time out.
Right of way in polo refers to the line of the ball while it is in play (i.e. the direction in which the ball is rolling as part of play). The player who last struck the ball has the right of way. Opposing players are allowed to ride alongside the player with right of way, as long as they do not hinder his/her path.
A goal is scored by driving the ball into the opposing team's goal with the mallet. Teams switch end goals after each goal is scored in order to account for wind advantage.
Umpires can call fouls for dangerous riding or improper use of the mallet. Penalties can range from a free hit to a free goal for the opposing team.
Overtime is called “sudden death” and occurs at the end of the last chukka if the two teams are tied. The first team to score wins.,


Players can block an opponent's swing by hooking their mallets. Players can only do this when they are on the same side that the opponent is swinging or if they are directly in front of or behind the opponent.
Ride-offs are allowed at 30-degree angles and at the horse's shoulder. A ride-off is used to break an opponent's concentration by riding alongside him/her, connecting with the opposing horse's shoulder, and and leading the opponent away from the ball.

Create two teams with three players on each team.,
Ensure that each player has at least two ponies for the match.,
Understand how arena polo is timed and controlled.,
Learn the rules of playing arena polo, since there are some differences from outdoor polo.,
Know what can cause fouls and penalties to be awarded.",How to Play Polo2," Unlike outdoor polo, arena polo only requires three players, mostly to keep the safety of the horses and riders in mind.The players' jerseys should indicate their number as Player 1, 2, or 3.
Having alternative players is allowed for each team, and the substitute players must be qualified to play.
Players' handicaps usually rise by one for arena polo because it requires different skills. This means that if a player's outdoor polo handicap is 1 goal, then his/her arena polo handicap is 2 goals., Arena polo requires fewer ponies per player.Players can alternate two ponies for each chukka, giving one a break while the other is ridden for the current chukka.
Ponies can be any breed or size for arena polo.
Ponies must not be blind in either eye and must be able to be controlled for the entirety of the match, or they may be excluded.

, While these rules are similar to that of outdoor polo, there are some differences.Arena polo has four 7-minute chukkas, with 4-minute breaks after most chukkas. The end of the second chukka is followed by a 6-minute break.
A bell or signal will sound 30 seconds prior to the end of each chukka.
Game officials include two umpires, a referee, a timekeeper, a scorekeeper, and goal judges. However, it is the responsibility of the umpires to signal when a goal is scored.
An arena should be 300 feet long by 150 feet wide, with goals at each end that are 10 feet wide by 12 feet tall.

, Most of the game is played the same, but since it is played in a smaller space, a few differences arise.


A goal is scored when the ball hits the boards within the goal area and counts as one point. A small, air-filled ball with a circumference of 12.5” to 15” is used.
The match begins with a throw-in, which is when an official rolls the ball in between the teams, who are lined up parallel to each other. The throw-in occurs after the umpire does a coin toss, with the captain of the winning team choosing which goal their team will defend first.
A goal is scored by driving the ball into the opposing team's goal with the mallet. Teams switch end goals after each chukka.
The player with right of way must follow the line of the ball (i.e. the direction in which it is rolling as part of play), and if the line of the ball changes, other players who may be in the way must be given time to clear the new right of way. Players are not allowed to obstruct the right of way unless they are far enough away from the player with the right of way to avoid collision.
In the event of a tie, play will resume with the usual time periods after a 10-minute interval. The first team to score will win.

, This system is also slightly different from outdoor polo.An umpire can call a foul on any violation of the rules of play. When a foul is called, the umpire must call a time out to announce the foul to the players.
There are a variety of different penalties that can be awarded based on the foul committed. These include a free goal to the fouled team, free hits at varying distances from the goal, removal from part or the remainder of the game, disqualification, and forfeit.
Players may not argue with the umpires when fouls are called, and vulgar language or disrespectful attitudes are not tolerated.

"
Wear the appropriate gear for play.,
Follow the rules of the game.,
Avoid participating in any recreational drug or alcohol use prior to play.,
Stop or do not participate in play if a player is physically impaired.,
Learn how to ride a horse prior to play.,
Ride your pony safely and carefully.",How to Play Polo3," Polo requires a particular uniform, which helps to protect players. There are also safety requirements for the ponies.


Helmets are a must for safety. They offer protection in various scenarios, including falling off the pony and getting hit with a mallet or ball.
The outfit includes a long-sleeved jersey with riding pants and boots. In many cases, players are not allowed to wear sharp spurs or gear with protruding buckles or studs.Ponies must wear boots on all four hooves and bandages on all four legs for protection from the ball.Players are not allowed to use a bridle with blinkers on their ponies. Blinkers obstruct the view of the pony., The rules are meant to keep play safe for both players and ponies, and there are some key rules to highlight.


Players may not touch another player or pony, including tack (e.g. saddle, blanket, et cetera), with his/her mallet.Polo must be played right-handed because left-handed players are thought to have less accuracy.It is important that polo ponies are well-trained and easily controlled. If a pony misbehaves and gets out of its rider's control, it is a danger not only to its rider but also to other players and officials.
Swing the mallet at an appropriate distance from other players or officials. Swinging it in close range could cause a foul., For obvious reasons, this inhibits a player's judgment and puts himself/herself at risk, as well as the other players and officials.

, This includes a variety of issues, and it mainly refers to incidents that happened before or during play.Broken or fractured bones
Dislocated joint sockets
Concussions
Illness, such as a virus, infection, or influenza

, Many players learn how to ride while learning how to play polo, but it is best to have a basic understanding of how to ride.


Take riding lessons with a polo club or at a stable that offers lessons.
Understand how polo ponies are trained, which is to be reined with one hand and to be highly responsive to leg cues.Become familiar with all ponies that you will ride during polo matches. Each pony has its own temperament.

, Dangerous riding is worthy of a foul and could cause disqualification from the match, in addition to putting other players and officials at risk.Riding an opponent's pony into the side or end walls
Riding the head of a pony into an opposing player
Interfering in the right of way of another player with the potential to cause a collision
Bumping off, or riding off, at an unsafe angle or speed
Riding into the hindquarters of another pony
Zigzagging in front of another player

Make sure you have your horse saddled half an hour prior to your show jump round.,
Keep an ear out on the load speaker, about 15 minutes prior to the start of your rounds, they will announce that the course is open for competitors to walk.,
Make sure you are wearing the appropriate riding attire.,
Start at the very start.,
Walk to the first jump.,
Continue to the second and subsequent obstacles.,
Repeat the number of the obstacle as you approach, and at each jump, make sure you point and voice out the number of each jump.

,
Determine what jumps would cause the most difficulty, and work out the approach and get-away lines.

,
Make sure, that after you have walked the course once, you walk it again, unless your absolutely sure you know the pattern.,
Warm up and then wait patiently for your go, allowing 2 riders prior to your round is good, that way, you can trace the course out, and see if a particular jump is causing difficulty, or if there is a bog forming where all the riders go causing the horse to baulk.

,
Wait for your number or name to be called, and approach the start line.,
If you do forget the course, come back to trot and go the last jump you remember jumping, and continue jumping.",How to Memorise a Show Jumping Course," In doing so, you are maximizing warm up time and you will also have enough time to watch a few competitors before your go.;
, Use this time to your advantage.

, You must take and wear anything that you will be using, (Helmet, spurs, jodhpurs, shirt, boots and a crop if you use one). Many people ask to borrow yours as they may have forgotten there's, don't do this as if you don't have yours with you, you may get disqualified.

, Many riders will begin at the first jump, but if you start at the start line, you can figure out the best approach for your first obstacle, therefore setting up the whole round.

, However, do not walk over it, as this is cause for elimination. Remember where you met the jump, walk around and place your heel against the other side of the jump. As you walk towards the first jump, memorise the strides twice.

, As you walk and stride the course out, make sure you continuously look back upon the course you have already walked, this makes it stick firmer into your memory.

,,, Step each jump out as though you would on your horse, as even if you take the whole 15 minutes (or time allowed to walk the course) don't worry, you will be more prepared than the rider who didn't even walk the course)

,, It is best to do a warm up lap of the jumps when the judge rings the bell, after the bell, you have 45 seconds to start the course. Follow the lines you memorized and as you jump each jump look towards the next one and keep record of the obstacle you just negotiated.

, If you are totally lost, dismiss your self,, but not prior to giving the course a second go. Even if its wrong, you will have jumped, which is better than not trying at all.

, By listening to music, it will calm you down. Make sure you put music that will calm you instead of music that will hype you up.

, The last thing you want to worry about is where your number is, so make sure everything is organized before the day of the show.

, Whether it's a friend or a stress ball, be sure to keep yourself busy when you have down time so you won't focus on the nerves.

, You don't want to be scrambling around trying to get your horse ready when you realize your class is next.

, The last thing you want is for your horse to spook at something. Also pay attention to how your horse reacts so you can decide if they need to be longed.

, The last thing you want is for you to get sick because you ate too much. But also, don't eat too little because that can also cause discomfort.

, A genuine smile will positively affect the judge's opinion of you. It will also make you happier and less nervous.

,
Scrub a moisturizing shampoo deep into the coat with a rubber currycomb, lifting out the scurf (dead skin) and dirt.,
Wash out the feet, between the legs, and any ‘hidden’ body parts that may not usually get washed.

,

When your horse’s tail is just dry trim it to the correct length for your discipline.,
Cut the bottom straight across at the appropriate length: just above the fetlocks for dressage, and mid-cannon height for jumpers and hunters.,
Clip the long, straggly hairs on the sides of the dock to form smoother lines when the tail is raised.,
Trim the mane to the correct length for banding or braiding.,
With a pair of sharp, well-oiled clippers, clip your horse’s muzzle, bridle path, eye area and ears as close as you can.,
When your horse has dried, cover him with a sheet to protect your work, and paint his hooves with a conditioner.,
When you arrive at the show band or braid your horse’s mane.,
For banding, take a small section of hair, about half to three-quarters of an inch wide, and wrap a band tightly around it, close to the crest.,
If you are braiding, take a small section of hair, about an inch wide, and hold the rest of the mane back with a big hair clip.,
If you are showing in saddle seat or park classes, braid a thin, colored ribbon into your horse’s forelock, and another one into the first lock of hair.,
After doing the mane, braid the tail if you are showing in hunter or jumper classes.,
Brush out the tail, and apply a spray detangler if you did not braid.,
To add a thick appearance to the tail, hold it out and lightly spray it with a coloring spray (like Shapely’s Show Touch-Up).,
Spray a shining spray (like Absorbine Show Sheen or Ultra’s Finishing Spray) onto the tail once the color spray dries to add a show-ring shine.

",How to Groom a Horse for a Show," Not only does it prevent against infections and sores, but also improves the health and appearance of the coat and skin. Daily currying and brushing, picking out and conditioning hooves, and occasional baths help keep your horse in top form. It is a good time to check them over for and cuts/bruises, get their coat shiny and soft and gets their blood moving, bond with your favorite critter, and it's also good exercise for you.;
, Some people also put corn oil or flax seed oils in the horse's feed three weeks before the show to add shine to the horse's coat. Corn oil or rice bran also helps horses gain a little weight.

,, It is best to divide the horse into quarters, and then scrub and rinse each qua moving on to the next.

,,, Make sure you rinse out every bubble, to prevent the skin from itching.

, Do not condition the mane if you plan to band or braid. Leave it in for the next step…

, Rinse well.

,,, Hair polish is not ShowSeen. It is a leave-in, one-time, strong acting polish that adds a layer of lasting shine and dirt protection to the coat. It is not sticky, and does not wear out easily. (An example is Ultra’s Hair Polish.) If you cannot get hair polish, a product like Show Sheen is an acceptable substitute.

, Have someone hold the dock at the angle that your horse carries it in motion, because a tail always looks shorter when it is moving.

, Arabians, saddle seat, park and most breed class horses are left with a natural tail.

, Look on the sides of the dock, and you will see two half moons where the hair does not grow. For clipping, you only need to enlarge those half moons and cut off the straggly hair. Do not cut too much. It is better to cut too little and still have a tail left to work with! Do not clip the tail if you are going to braid.

, Currently, the fad is to trim a Western horse’s mane to about three inches long, but some are breaking the trend and riding with it long and lush. Reiners, leave the mane natural. For braiding, trim it to around four inches long. In Arabian classes, leave the mane natural, but clip a bridle path about a third of the way down the neck. It is also frowned upon in the show ring if you just cut the mane. You should always pull it so that it looks natural.

, Clip the long hair on his legs and throat, as well. Some breeds are not shown clipped, so check with your rule book for details about your breed. If you plan to do a full body clip on your horse, you should do that 2-4 days before show day, so that any of your mistakes can grow out. Just don't do it too far away from the show, or your horse will look a little straggly.

, That will help form a nice surface for the hoof polish to go on.

, You should do that the day before if you know that your classes are in the beginning of the show, or get their early, with enough time to braid without being rushed. Just make sure you cover the mane so that the horse doesn't rub it out.

, Do not snug it too tightly, or you will break hairs, cause discomfort to your horse, and have a mane that sticks up straight. You can use mane mousse to control stray hairs and keep your work neat.

When you are finished, trim the bottom of the mane to about three inches long, as it is the custom currently, or leave it untrimmed, long and lush. Don’t forget to band the forelock!







, Braid it tightly. About halfway through the braid, start braiding in a length of yarn (about the length from your elbow to your thumb) with the two ends hanging down. Finish off the braid with a rubber band. Flip the braid under itself and pull the loose ends of the yarn through.

Separate them and criss-cross over the loop-like braid, and then tie behind the braid in a secure double-knot. Cut off the loose ends, and continue down the mane. Braid the forelock in a french braid, and then continue like you did the regular braids. (for more help, check out the braid a horse’s mane page)






Dressage riders braid their horses’ manes into button braids, which are thicker and rounder, like little buttons. These are done by braiding the hair and finishing it off with a band. Then, with a plastic needle and thread, sew the braid into a neat, round button.







, Match the ribbon to your bridle and clothes.

, Starting at the very top of the dock, braid the side hairs in a tight, delicate french braid down the tailbone. Just before the tailbone ends, stop adding hair sections and continue in a regular (not french) braid until you come to the end of the hair you are holding. Tie it off with a band, and then sew the thin braid into a pinwheel at the bottom of the french braid.

, Touch up the bottom with scissors if there are straggly hairs.

, Make sure the color is as close to the tail’s original color as possible, and do not spray too thickly. When done properly, this really makes a thin tail look lush.

,,,, Follow with a soft cloth dampened with a solution of half water, half rubbing alcohol. The water gets out the fine dust and the alcohol speeds the drying time. When the horse is dry, spray on a good coat of shining spray, but not in the saddle area. To apply it to the face, spray some on a piece of chamois and rub in gently.

, Dust off any extra.

, Do not sand too much – just enough to make the surface a little smoother. Think of it like buffing your nails.

, Use black on black hooves, and clear on any other colors. If you don’t feel comfortable with using black, just use clear. It looks good on any horse!

,, Not while you’re warming up, of course.

,,, to the muzzle, eye area, ears and bridle path. Baby oil works well too.

Braid and trim your own horse.,
Take some food or buy food from local shops rather then vendors.,
Share transport with other people.,
Look at what's available locally before going further afield.",How to Make Horse Shows More Affordable," Although you can pay professionals to do this for you,. It is easy to learn how, even if it won't look as good at the start. If you have always done your one braiding and trimming by the time you get to higher levels you will be as good as the professionals.;
, Take lots of bottled water.

, If you want to go to a competition more than a few miles away you will have to transport your horse in a horsebox or trailer. These are expensive to buy, run and maintain and also to hire. Asking some one who is going to the same competition as you is best as you can act as each others grooms and both benefit. Otherwise you can cash in a favour and ask if they would be willing to drive your horse, or let you borrow their rig. Make sure you are comfortable manoeuvring the trailer around before you take it out with your horse inside.

, Showing around the area means cheaper towing fees, and its great for the environment, too.

"
"
Consider bringing your horse to the first show just to be there.,
Stay with your horse at all times.,
Try to park your trailer/van in a quieter spacey area of the park with more space if you cannot stall your horse.,
Unload your horse and lead him directly to his stall and give him some hay.,
Head on over to the show.,
Deal with negative reaction quickly.,
Lead him around and let him get used to things.,
Lounge your horse in an area with horses around, but not in it.,
Before your class, ride in a quiet arena.,
Finally, join a different ring where other horses are also being ridden.",How to Get Your Horse Used to a Show Atmosphere," This means not entering your horse in any classes but going through all the relevant procedures, such as transportation, housing in a stall, feeding during the day, allowing the horse to see lots of people, getting your horse used to the noise, etc.


Give your horse treats to reward him each time that he does something good.;
, When it is your horse's first show, staying by his side will help your horse to feel relaxed.

, Do not cramp him.

,


Do not put him in a strange stall until you have carefully checked it for nails and dangerous objects.
Have it bedded, with a bucket of water, and a hay net before you put him in it.
You may want to use a shank across his nose or under his chin as you lead him from the trailer. Also, use trailing boots.

, Keep your horse occupied with toys and hay.

, If your horse starts neighing, let it slide unless it gets really serious. In this case, it may not be a good idea. Wait for a moment of calmness and stop the trailer. This shows that good things (trailer stopped) happen when he is calm. Go over to your horse, wait for calmness once again, and then pet him. If he neighs, back away. When your horse has stopped freaking out, try again.

, Do this after he has had some time to settle in his stall and has had a few treats and some hay. A little neighing is OK, but make him pay attention to you.


Be kind and firm. He may get overexcited.
Make sure to give him plenty of space, and let him see everything around him. The walk should end on a good note, meaning stop when he is behaving well, if you can.

, That way, he feels safe, especially if you plan to ride him. When he is calm on the longe, then move him to where the horses are.


Do not use a horse show as a venue to longe (lunge) your horse if he is not safe on the longe at home. Remember, if you can not control your horse, you have no business taking him to a show endangering other people who paid good money to come.
The longe should be no more than 20 minutes.

, Walk, trot, and canter. Halt. Pet him and tell him he's good.


Sit up straight, and try jiggling the reins. Nudge him and gently say walk, but do not be a passenger. That means, do what you want, do not let the horse control you.
If you see any improvement at the walk, try a slow trot.
More improvement? Try some collection. When you succeed, slow back to a walk and try a canter.
If your horse misbehaves uncontrollably, bring him to a walk and wait until he is calm, then hop off. Pet him a little, then try again, much, much slower.

, Practice passing the other horse. Again, end on a good note.

"
"
Let your horse get used to the showgrounds and get it familiar with anything that could possibly be a spook factor.,
ensure that you know which arena(s) you will be competing in.,
If you stay calm, your horse stays calm.,
When schooling day rolls around, check before hand to see which ring(s) your horse will be going into.

,
While you're schooling, make sure to end on a good note.,
Keep in mind that a horse is a horse.,
When your horse is getting a little spooky, keep trotting until they're more focused on you.,
If it's a dressage show, make sure your horse is familiar with the judge's box.

,
Ride or walk your horse to the judge's box (while it's empty) and let it examine the box thoroughly.

,
Lunge and/or warm up thoroughly your horse before the first class.,
Flexing and a lot of transitions keep your horse occupied and supple before your classes.,
Make sure you have all the papers necessary in order for your horse to show.

",How to Make a Horse Relaxed at a Horse Show1,";
, If you can, ride in your assigned arenas to let your horse check it out. This is also a good time to sort out any objects or places that may cause your horse to spook.

, Remember to keep taking deep breathes and let your horse have a rider it can be confident in.

,, It might not be something huge, but getting your horse to walk past the scary fence post once is better than spending an hour making sure your horse is 'bombproof' to it. Know when enough is enough.

, What may be nothing to you is a possible threat to your horse. Slowly confront your horse with the object instead of yelling or getting frustrated. That will only get your horse anxious.

, Half halts, gait transitions and many small circles in different places in the arena can keep your horse focused on you, not distractions that might spook it. Also do things like getting the hind end over to prevent bolting.

,,, If your horse has jitters, you'd want to get them out before you start showing.

, you don't want them entering the arena stiff-muscled.

,"
"
To help yourself -and your horse- stay calm and collected for your classes, take deep breathes and tell yourself to ride just like you would at any other schooling day at home.

,
Remember to keep a deep seat, quiet hands, and heels down.",How to Make a Horse Relaxed at a Horse Show2,", It helps if you can picture certain places in your course or pattern to remember these things- for example, if you were running a barrel racing pattern, at each barrel remember; Seat, hands, heels

"
"
It's not the ribbon, it's the ride.,
Realize that if your horse is injured, but could still pull through a class or two, it's your job to understand your horse's limits.

,
Whatever you do, be sure it is for the best, not only for you, but your horse as well.

,
One-Day Shows are the best for a young, green horse--that is, if they're properly run, because of the more laid-back they are, and their short length.

,
If you have a green horse, check out the show grounds before you enter, to make sure they're safe.

,
Book a stall, and enter in a bundle of classes.

,
Take your horse on a relaxed hack the day before.,
On the day of the show, you can lunge your horse(s) after unloading to stretch their legs out and get some of the jitters out.

,
We all know the horses that are just jittery or spooky by nature, and sometimes you just have to let your horse be a horse (within limits).,
If your horse is tense and over alert to it's surroundings, take it for a ride away from the rest of the competitors and horses.

,
If the management allows it, ride in the ring before show time to see how your horse reacts.

,
If not, enter in a walk-trot class or something similar, just to see how your horse reacts.

,
If there isn't enough times to put your horse back in the stall, go for a walk or get moving.

,
Don't go too far away though--you could miss your round!

",How to Make a Horse Relaxed at a Horse Show3," Ride for your benefit, not your trophy collection's.

,,,,,, If you're all practice and no rest right up to the day of the show, it's only by nature that your horse will be anxious

,, There's a difference between a horse that naturally prances and a horse who's being a brat.

To begin with, usually only an accredited judge is allowed to judge and award ribbons, but for name's sake, you are more than allowed to judge on the outside of the ring.,
Look at the horses or ponies as they enter the ring.,
Look at each horse and decide on manners -- which horse do you think is the most well-behaved?,
The judge will then say ""You are now being judged""; you will then see the riders begin to ride with absolute concentration.,
As the horse moves into a trot, watch the way the horse moves.,
When the riders are asked to canter, watch very carefully; each rider asks for and begins to canter; the take off is a good way to tell which horse is listening and which horse is just there to look pretty.,
The horses will be asked to change direction and do the same paces.,
The judge will then ask the horse and riders to line up in a troop side by side.,
In the end, compare your notes and pick your best horse, (1st) then pick the worst two horses (write which one was worse than the other).,
Once you have your horses figured out, ask the riders to move their horses into the positions you said.

,
Even though each class (ex.,
There are three basic body types: Super, Cube, and Tube.

,
Super is the ideal horse (NOTE: there is no such thing as a perfect horse): a long sloping shoulder, short tight back, long underline, long hip, prominent at the withers, sloping (though not overly so) pasterns, deep heart girth, long neck, straight legs, flat clean bone, free true mover (tracks straight, doesn't paddle or rope walk), and a clean throat latch; if you're totally confused by all that, the horse that is easy on the eyes, and seems to flow from part to part, wins.

,
Cube is what I tend to think of as a stereotypical boxy pony; they are long in the back, short in the hip and underline, muttony over the withers, straight in the pastern and shoulder, thick through the throat latch, fine round bone, cow hocked (hocks point towards each other; in order to move correctly, a horse needs to be slightly cow hocked, not overly so though), sickle hocked (the entire rear leg looks like it curved, hence the name ""sickle"", when viewed from the side), short choppy stride; if none of that made sense, imagine that little pony you once owned that looked like a box with a head and tail.

,
Tube, is the opposite of cube (think excessively long bodied).,
Now that we've covered the hard stuff, here are the bare bones of judging a halter horse.,
Each class has its own specific areas where more emphasis is placed; there are far too many to list here.,
Stock horses (Quarter horses, Paints, Appaloosas) place the most emphasis in the muscling, particularly in the gaskin, chest, forearm, and stifle.

,
Arabians place more emphasis on refinement, breed character, and light airy movement.,
Hunters in Hand, one word: movement.

,
I barely scratched the surface on judging - continue to read, attend horse shows, and challenge yourself to be a better judge!

,
If you can get to the horse early, do so, and watch the horse get caught and haltered.,
Look at the horse without a saddle or bridle, and try not to touch the horse at first, as you want to see how the horse stands without a poke.,
Look at the vitals (eyes, nose, teeth, under tail, hooves, ears, belly, etc); you want to make sure it's not sore or has any wounds.

,
Ask if you can ride the horse.,
Halt the horse and then go from there.

,
Tailor your questions to the type of horse you want.,
(Note: Only do this if you are experienced and have reins.),
If you love the horse, ask to have it on a week's trial.,
Look at the horse overall.,
Know the characteristics of the breed.,
Consider 5 key characteristics: balance, structure, muscle, quality, and breed.

,
Consider 6 balance keys: topline, back, croup/hip, girth, shoulder, and neck.

,
Look for any structure problems:


Any kind of travel problems
Any kind of deformity

,
Acquaint yourself with 7 additional muscle mass points:


Chest or pectoral region
Forearm
Shoulder
Loin
Croup
Stifle
Gaskin

,
Know 6 quality characteristics:


Head
Throat latch
Feet
Bone structure
Leg position
Calmness

,
Keep breed and gender characteristics in mind, such as:


Quarter Horses will be heavier built than Riding Ponies
Stallions compared to Geldings will be toned and spirited
Geldings should be relaxed but well toned and muscled
Mares will be fine and have a feminine' disposition.


",How to Judge a Horse,";
, The class will have specific guidelines, e.g. Hunter Class, Ridden Pony Hack, Led Appaloosa or Western Riding. Make sure you know the guidelines as well as a little about what each rider is being asked to do. Often, a western rider makes a better western judge compared to a jump judge judging a western event.

, When it comes down to a tie, behavior counts!

, As the horses walk around the ring, watch how they move. Are their feet bumping into each other? Which horse is holding his head high, resisting the bit? Are there any horses that are being naughty or seem to be grumpy? Keep these horses in mind (most judges have a steward that writes notes or the judge has a pen and paper writing notes down).

, Is he moving with ease? Is the horse running through his gate? Which horse seems the most pleasing?

, Does the horse strike off on the right or wrong lead? How long does it take the horse to establish an easy canter?

, Watch this lead also, as horses sometimes like one way better than another, and often your first pick may simply not like the lead and his chances are thrown out the window.

, Here you can tell which horse is well-mannered and who is grumpy around other horses. While the judge is looking at this, she will have a set course in mind to test each horse. Being on the sideline, it's hard to know what the judge is asking of them, but by watching, you can tell if the horse was meant to canter or was meant to halt rather than bolt.

, Now, compare each horse, eliminate the bad and replace with the better (it's very sad when a judge says ""No, you're last"", while in a ring).

,, Showmanship, Hunter in Hand, Stock Halter) has a different set of judging criteria, there are several basic rules and body types.

,,,, They are long and weak in the back, rafter hipped, narrow and shallow bodies (it's worth noting you measure body depth by how much body is beneath their point of elbow), overly prominent at the withers, overly long ewe neck (ewe neck means the top of the neck dips down creating the ""U""), and rope walked; if none of that made sense, think of a ""grocery gator"", a horse that after you stick the saddle on it looks like you could put a couple of bags of groceries on behind your saddle.

,


Big beats little (I feel that's pretty self explanatory)
Pretty Beats Ugly (Once again I feel that's pretty self explanatory)
A whole beats a part (This one's harder - it means look at a horse as a whole; don't kill a horse because he has one splint, kill him if he has many serious faults).
And last but not least, A dink is a dink is a dink. It means don't give the most awful ugly dying horse sympathy points.

, However, here are some of the more common ones:

,, Note: most Arabians I've encountered were cow hocked.

,,, If a horse is rude and runs, you know that you will need to wear good runners!

, You should be looking for a good straight back, straight legs and correctly aligned hooves. Look to see how much fat the horse has on its crest (the fatter the crest, the more you will know the horse or pony is strong).

,, If you can, do so. Walk for a short while, and judge the way it moves. Is it even? Is it easy and forward moving? Then ask for a trot. The trot should be easy to ride to, either sitting or rising. What you want, you should get out of the horse. Does the horse seem evenly paced and balanced? If you feel confident, ask for a canter; this pace should be floaty and easy to receive. How long does it take to get the pace? How long does it take to stop?

,, If you are looking for a Show jumping horse, ask if it has jumped and if it has, ask if you can jump it. If you're looking for a Western Competition Horse, ask to try it over some poles and open a gate. If you only want a pleasure riding horse, make sure it stops when you ask and goes when you ask.

, Drop one rein and see if the horse stops or simply takes advantage of you. You ultimately want a horse that slows but continues as long as you haven't asked for a halt. Most of the time, if the horse is what you want, you can try swinging your legs and see if the horse reacts or is quiet, ride with more reinforced commands, a bit harder squeeze, a lighter or harder pull of the reins, sit floppy in the saddle. The owner may ask why? But you know that if the horse objects to this he is probably not suited for less experienced riders

, This way you can ride it every day for the week and really try it, even take it to a competition if appropriate.

, The horse should look nicely proportioned. It will take some time to pick up different things, but patience is rewarding.

, For pure breed these are usually decided by the breed society.

Prepare for the Horse Management.,
Remember to be very careful filling out your Record Book and your Stall Card.,
Understand that you should be riding at least 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) above your fence height.,
Make a checklist of the things to remember when you are driving to the rating.,
Talk to the examiners.",How to Get Ready for Your D3 Pony Club Rating," This the hardest part of it all. Luckily, at this level, it is not too bad. Try printing out just the HM test sheet, filling in the correct answers, and having someone ask you them.

When you can get all of the answers 10 times correctly, you are ready. If you have any questions, e-mail or text a friend a level or two up, or talk to your DC. They are there to help you. Do not be worried, and remember that it is easier to remember if you are relaxed.;
, These are what will lose you the most points, so be very particular and specific. When you have more information available, you will look much more prepared!

Go through a last minute check before you go, to make sure you did not leave out any important information.

, The best way to wow the examiner is to simply talk to them. If your horse drifted, tell them. If you dropped your stirrup, tell them. They want to know that you know what is going well and what is not, and that is the best way to pass., For example, the amount of food your horse gets, or to look up over the fence. This will really help you to do well, but you should know everything before you leave the house., They want to know your opinion, too!"

Feed your horse its regular diet while on the road or at shows.,
Maintain your horse’s normal feeding schedule.,
Offer your horse salt daily.,
Hand-graze or hand-walk your horse at the show.",How to Feed Your Horse During Show Season1," When you are traveling to an event or while at a show, it is important that your horse’s diet remains the same. Abruptly switching forage can cause colic and other gastrointestinal issues in horses. Maintaining dietary consistency is key to your horse’s health and performance during show season., It’s extremely important that your horse maintains its feeding routines while on the road and at shows. You should bring enough hay, supplements, feed, and chaff to feed your horse during the entire time you are away from home. Feed your horse on its regular schedule., While at home, traveling, or at the show, you should offer your horse salt as a free choice. Horses require about 1-2 ounces of salt each day. This intake helps them meet dietary requirements for sodium and chloride. Be sure you bring enough salt with you to ensure your horse will meet minimum dietary requirements while you are away from home., If it is possible, get your horse out on a walk or to graze while you are at the show. Both promote digestive health, and will help your horse maintain its regular schedule. Walking and grazing can also help horses shed the bad attitude that sometimes comes with being confined at a show for an extended period of time."

Contact your vet.,
Leave the ear plaque alone.,
Prevent flies from biting your horse.,
Discuss any scrubbing or scraping of the ears with your vet.",How to Get Rid of Ear Plaque in Horses1," If you believe that your horse has aural plaque, contact your veterinarian. An examination will confirm that the whitish, flaky sections are in fact ear plaque and not another more serious condition. Your vet will also suggest a course of treatment.Your vet may suggest that you do nothing to treat the plaque. They may also suggest a cream or ask you to bring the horse in so the plaque can be gently shaved off under sedation.
Make sure to never remove a plaque or apply a cream to the horse’s ears without consulting the vet first.;
, Many veterinarians suggest no treatment for aural plaque in horses. Ear plaques do not bother all horses, so for many horses it is just a cosmetic issue that bothers the owner. Touching or handling the ears may cause more problems for the horse than leaving it alone.Too much handling of the horse’s ears when they have ear plaque may cause them to be head shy or sensitive to people being around their ears or face.

, To help your horse from getting infected or reinfected, find ways to get rid of flies around the horse. You may use a fly repellent spray to keep the flies away. You can try a fly mask with ears.You may also consider placing the horse in a stable during the times when flies are active, which is dawn and dusk.This can also reduce your horse’s discomfort because when flies bite the sensitive, infected ears, it can irritate the existing ear plaque that may not hurt or bother the horse otherwise., If the ear plaque isn’t bothering your horse, you shouldn’t worry about trying to remove the patches of plaque. This can cause more pain for the horse, and increase their ear and head sensitivity. If your horse is in pain, you can discuss with your vet about removing the plaque.If you want to remove the plaque, try softening the scaly patches with baby oil first. Baby wipes are also good for cleaning the ears and removing the flaky debris of aural plaques. Remove the plaque as gently as possible.
You can treat the red, pink areas left by the ear plaque with healing ointments. Talk to your vet about a proper ointment to help heal the affected areas.

Make any changes to diet or feeding schedule gradually.,
Reduce excitability with a diet low in sugar and starch.,
Increase stamina by adding fat to your horse’s diet.,
Consider a B12 supplement.",How to Feed Your Horse During Show Season2," If you decide to change the type, amount, or frequency of feed for your horse, you must do so over an extended period of time. Abrupt changes to a horse’s feeding schedule or food type can lead to colic or founder.To change the amount of food, decrease or increase a little at a time over several weeks.
To change the type of food, try replacing ¼ of the old food with the new food every 2 days over the course of 8 days.

, The sugar and starch content of your horse’s diet can be linked to higher levels of excitability. This can become a problem during show season for some horses. To prevent excitability, try feeding your horse a feed that contains a sugar and starch level lower than 20% and a fat level of 10% or higher., A diet higher in fat can allow horses to process glycogen more efficiently, and increase their overall stamina. Try feeding your horse a feed with a fat level of 10% or more. You can also increase the amount of fat in your horse’s diet by adding a fat supplement., This supplement can increase energy levels in horses, and helps fight fatigue. If you are looking to heighten your horse’s energy level, consider giving them a B12 supplement. You can give your horse a B12 supplement by injection. You can also administer B12 gel to your horse through the mouth via a syringe."

Offer your horse water on a regular basis.,
Bring water from home.,
Consider flavoring the water.,
Add electrolytes to the water.",How to Feed Your Horse During Show Season3," It is important that your horse is hydrated while on the road and while stabled at show locations. Give your horse fresh, clean water every two hours while you are traveling to a show. While stabled at the show, fresh water should be available around the clock. Offer your horse water between events or classes.Horses should drink 8-30 gallons of water per day, depending on activity level and climate.

, Sometimes horses are reluctant to drink water away from home. The water can smell or taste different due to locale and chlorination. If you are traveling to a trail ride, show, or event, consider bringing along water from home. This will help ensure your horse remains hydrated during the time it is away from home. You can transport the water in a large water tank that will fit in the back of a truck., If your horse is reluctant to drink water away from home, consider adding a flavoring agent to it. A few days before travel, begin flavoring your horse’s water at home. This will help ease your horse into drinking flavored water while on the road. Just make sure the flavoring doesn’t contain caffeine or other additives that might trigger a drug test.Wintergreen and vanilla are good flavoring choices.
You can also use apple juice or molasses, but both will add sugar to your horse’s diet.
Always offer your horse a bucket of plain water alongside the flavored water.

, Dehydration and extreme heat can occur during show season, disrupting your horse’s electrolyte balance. Add dissolvable electrolytes to your horse’s water at least a week before the show. Make sure you offer a bucket of plain water alongside the supplemented water.You can also deliver electrolytes to your horse through the mouth with a syringe.
Powdered electrolytes can be fed to the horse as a dressing on grain.

Consider using a wart cream.,
Prepare the ear before using the cream.,
Apply the cream three times each week or as directed.,
Be aware of the side effects of the cream.",How to Get Rid of Ear Plaque in Horses2," Many vets have started using imiquimod (Aldara), a human wart cream, to treat aural plaque.The cream treats the plaques in many horses when using a 5% solution, by stimulating an immune response in the affected area.This treatment is primarily used if the ear plaque is causing problems or pain for the horse.


Some horses and cases of ear plaque won’t respond to imiquimod.

, Before using the cream, you have to remove the white crusty areas and any other build up on the ears.To remove the ear plaque, use baby oil or another agent to soften the crusty, flaky areas first. Then, carefully and as gently as possible, remove the crusts.Never scrape the flakes off the horse's ear without softening it first. You don't want to cause the horse any additional pain. Scraping the plaque off the ears without taking care to reduce pain can cause head shyness and resistance.

, Talk to your vet about the recommended treatment schedule for your horse. Generally, the cream is applied every other day for a few months.Some horses may only need to be treated every other week, however. Be sure to follow your vet’s directions in applying the cream. If your horse is in a lot of pain, your vet may recommend applying the cream twice weekly instead.

, The wart cream can lead to reactions in some horses. The most common reaction is severe inflammation. The affected areas may become red, start swelling, or ooze.Some horses may have to be sedated. If the side effects are too much for your horse, your vet may prescribe Phenylbutazone. This is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) that helps with pain and inflammation. Don’t stop treatment because of side effects – consult with your vet, instead. By stopping early, you may end up losing valuable progress in healing.

Check for a white substance in the ear.,
Look at the skin underneath the white substance.,
Notice any ear or head shyness.,
Figure out if your horse’s ears have been bitten by flies.",How to Get Rid of Ear Plaque in Horses3," The main symptom of ear plaque in horses is white or pale grey growths in the ear. They may appear crusty or flaky. It may be in small bumps or in large patches.The whitish patches are often slightly raised.Aural plaques are often described as looking like small cauliflower.

, If your horse has ear plaque, the skin underneath the white, crusty patch will be shiny and pink or red. This will look different than what the inside of your horse’s ear usually looks like., Horses who have ear plaque may act shy, skittish, or irritated if their ears are touched. Aural plaques can cause ear sensitivity that leads to horses not liking having anything done to their ears or heads. This may cause the horse not to want to be bridled or have a halter put on.Some horses may display head shaking due to ear plaque.Some horses won’t be bothered by the ear plaques and their ears will not be sensitive.

, Ear plaque is common in horses. Some horses are more prone to it than others, and some horses may not get it at all. Ear plaque is commonly spread by bites from flies.Aural plaque is believed to be caused by a wart virus similar to one that causes warts in young horses.

Before beginning the usual bath process, take a moment to gently calm down your horse.,
Instead of tying them to a tree and blasting them with water, get a friend/relative to hold the horse.,
Once you have someone holding the horse firmly (but calmly) slowly turn on the water hose.,
Now, slowly and gently raise the hose for the horse to see (don't spray its face, just let it see the water).,
Once the horse has accepted the water coming from the hose, carefully let the water run down the horse's shoulder.,
When the horse finally gets where you can run water down their shoulder, continue to move up their body, towards their back.,
Talk to your horse gently, allowing it to know that it's okay.

",How to Get a Horse Used to Baths," Talk to them softly, while you pet them. This should calm down your horse, making them much more relaxed and less flighty.;
, This will be a much better choice then tying them to a post or tree. Therefore if the horse panics, or something worse happens, they can break loose without breaking their neck.

, Turn it on so that there is very little water coming out.

, You never want to spring something unexpected on a flighty horse!

, If he jumps or tries to get free, take the water away and reassure him that everything is safe. Now start the process all over again.

, Continue to do this until your horse has allowed you to wet down their entire body.

Clean up.",How to Clean the Sheath of a Horse," In general, arguments in favor of washing a horse’s sheath focus on hygiene and reducing the chances of infection. Bacteria tend to colonize around the smegma. The exact nature of the secretion and the likelihood of infection vary from horse to horse. No matter what, an excessive build-up can lead to irritation and inflammation in any horse. In turn, the sheath can swell up, which can restrict the horse’s ability to procreate or even urinate. Some owners report that excessive smegma actually attracts flies, which carry disease., Many experts argue that a horse’s sheath “self-cleans”, so washing it by hand might actually be harmful. It could disrupt your horse’s normal physiological system or you might end up damaging its sheath in the process. Others argue that it is not necessary to wash a gelding because they have been castrated, thus reducing the horse's natural production of smegma., In the end, regardless of which side of the debate you support, you should discuss this issue with your vet. When it comes down to deciding whether or not to clean your horse's sheath, you’ll need to consider your situation — your specific horse. Some horses are more susceptible to smegma or bean build-up. This can be the result of glandular or hormonal issues. Some beans will naturally shake loose and others won’t. If left alone, these can be considerably dangerous and may even require surgery to remove., Cut them as short as possible and/or file down any sharp edges. Since a horse’s sheath is incredibly sensitive, you’ll want to eliminate the possibility of scratching the horse. Keep in mind that the horse’s instinctual response to discomfort in its nether regions will be to kick and buck, which can lead to serious injury — for you and/or the horse.

, Do not use thick rubber washing gloves. This might offend your sense of propriety, but it is more important that you retain your tactile senses. You’ll need to be able to feel for any built-up smegma secretions or beans., They can hold the reins, which will keep the horse facing a specific direction. They can also brush the horse to calm them while you do the dirty business. If you are alone tie the horse safely and securely.

, This helps you feel for your horse’s movements so you can move out of the way quickly in case he moves to kick. Many horse owners and vets also claim that a trusting horse will be comforted by your hand too., It is safest to stand with your hip and shoulder near the horse's front legs. Since horses kick with their back legs, you want to stay as far away from them as possible., Since you need a hose and want to avoid being trampled, you'll want to clean your horse's sheath in an open area - perhaps in your barn. Don't stuff yourself and your horse in a small stable stall. You won't have anywhere to turn., Start from the belly and work towards its penis so that the horse isn't surprised. Use room temperature water, if possible. Hot water and cold water can be uncomfortable for your horse. Your goal here is to sluice off dirt and other contaminants from the outside of the sheath. Discard the used sponge after completion, Lubricate your hand and the sheath with either KY Jelly or a commercial sheath cleaner. In order to remove the smegma or “beans”, you’ll need to lubricate the region. This will also make the process less stressful/painful for the horse., Take a soft sponge or a pad of cotton wool and wipe gently along the outer edge of the horse's sheath. Remove all smegma, dirt, and any other foreign materials that may have built up. Use room temperature water to rinse, while wiping. Do not wipe too aggressively. Work the sponge or pad of cotton wool in small circles as you move along the sheath. , Push it as far as your can before inserting your hand. At most, your horse's sheath will slide 1 or 2 inches back. This will reduce the pocket that forms around the penis and will making cleaning easier. Not all horses will allow you do to it. If you do this frequently enough, your horse will become used to the sensation and won't resist., It will probably be a rusty color. This is normal. The smegma (dried excretions) will usually flake and peel away in your hand. Bring out as much as possible and use a lot of lukewarm water to rinse., Insert your little finger into the urethra and feel for a hard lump. If it is there, slowly roll it out of the tip of the horse’s penis. Some call this harvesting beans. You will feel it before you get to your first knuckle. Beans rarely form deeper than this and if they do, they require surgery to remove., Check for thick skin, grayish skin color in normally pink areas, and lesions. If you see any of these, you should consult your veterinarian. These can be the result of improper genital care, but may also be symptomatic of other dietary, bacterial, and viral issues., If you used soap, make sure it is all washed off. Left-over soap residue can cause problems of its own like skin irritation., You’ve just completed a gross job. Use a strong anti-bacterial soap and wash your hands and forearms several times."

Belly Clip.,
Low/High Trace Clip.,
Irish Clip.,
Blanket Clip.,
Hunter Clip.,
Full Clip.",How to Clip Your Horse1," For this clip, you remove the hair from just the underside of the neck and belly. This is common on ponies living out and only ridden on the weekends. Hardy ponies may not need to be rugged with this clip, unless the weather is very bad.;
, Hair is clipped from the underside of the neck and belly up to where the traces would be on a driving pony. As the name suggests, high trace clips remove the coat up to a higher line than the low trace clip. The lower half of the head is also sometimes clipped. The legs are left unclipped. This clip is appropriate for horses who are turned out during the day, and perform moderate work on a regular basis.

, A line is draw from the poll (top of the head) to the belly to make a triangle shape, everything under this is clipped. Often half the head is also clipped. The legs are left unclipped. This is done on horses who perform light work and are turned out during the day.

, This is similar to a trace clip, but the neck is fully clipped and the head is half or full clipped. The legs are left unclipped. This is good for horses that work heavily, as it removes hair where they sweat but leaves enough to keep them warm simultaneously.

, All the hair is removed, except from the legs to give some protection. Some hair is sometimes left on the back in the shape of the saddle, and less often girth, to give protection from saddle rubs. Because most of the hair is removed with this clip, careful watch must be taken to make sure that the horse does not become too cold.

, For this clip, the entire coat is clipped off. This is done on show horses who are heavily involved in competition, to give them a sleek coat that sweat can evaporate off of easily. A full clip should only be done if the horse is not turned out during the winter or at night."
"
Groom your horse.,
Mark off the areas you plan on clipping.,
Make sure your horse is not frightened of the sound of the clippers.,
Get your horse used to the feel of the vibrations.",How to Clip Your Horse2," Dirt and debris in the horse’s coat will dull your clippers as you use them, so it is best to groom your horse well prior to clipping. When possible, give your horse a bath the night before you plan to clip to remove as much of the dirt as possible.

, Use chalk or masking tape to section off the areas of your horse’s coat that you intend on clipping. Make sure to use straight lines and mark off all areas before starting to remove hair.

, The buzzing noise put out by clippers is frightening to most horses, especially those who have never been clipped before. Let the horse see the clippers, and then turn them on a few feet away from its face. Allow them to see that the source of the noise is from the clippers

, Alongside the sound, the way the vibration of the clippers feels on the horses skin might spook them. Test out their reaction by turning on the clippers, and placing the handle-end on their side. This will allow them to feel the vibrations without removing any hair.


If your horse spooks particularly easy, place your hand on their side and the handle of the clippers on the back of your hand. The vibrations will travel through your hand and they’ll be able to feel it on their skin indirectly.

"
"
Select two different clippers.,
Sharpen the blades.,
Clean and oil the blades.,
Pay attention to the temperature of your clippers.",How to Clip Your Horse3," In general, it is good advice to keep at least two pairs of clippers on hand at all times. You will need one shearing clipper to use for wide areas of clipping, and a smaller clipper for sensitive areas such as around the face.

, When cutting anything, the sharper the blade the easier the process. If you are using brand new clippers, you probably won’t have to sharpen the blades. If you are Using older clippers or blades, send to have the blades sharpened or do it yourself at home.

, Make sure there is nothing on the blades that might slow or impede their process; dirt and mud buildup will make clipping take much longer. When the blades are clean, coat them with oil and allow the clippers to run for 10-20 seconds. This will make them run smoother as you’re clipping.

, You want your clippers to be running at room temperature; if they get hot, the motor is overheating and they won’t work as well. If your clippers are ever hot, turn them off and let them cool down for several minutes before attempting to use them again."
"
Start in a non-sensitive area.,
Begin clipping.,
Continue clipping out strips.,
Be careful around the mane and tail.,
Clip the face last.,
Trim any remaining hairs.,
Clean up the hair.,
Blanket your horse.",How to Clip Your Horse4," Move your clippers to a part of the horse’s body that won’t be so ticklish. This is likely the neck or their sides.

, Turn the clippers on away from your horse’s body, and allow them to run for a few seconds. Then begin to clip by moving the clippers in the direction opposite of hair growth. Try to keep lines straight and to remove entire patches before moving onto other sections. Watch the corners of the clippers to make sure that you don’t poke your horse with them.

, Work in long, narrow sections to get the most even results. Overlap each new strip of hair your clip off, so that you don’t have any uneven patches. When you reach a whorl in the coat, clip out the hair from different angles to remove it all.

, When you clip near the mane and tail, wrap it and move it to the side so that you don’t accidentally cut any long hairs. If you need, have a friend help by holding both to the side to make it easier for you and your horse.

, If the clip style you choose requires you to clip your horse’s face, save it for last. This will help to keep their anxiety level low. Be sure to switch to the smaller clipper when clipping the face and other sensitive areas.

, If you’re not doing a full clip, there will be areas of the horse which still have hair, and some of that will be a bit long. Use a pair of cutting shears to trim down extra long hair, typically around the legs.

, The hair left on the ground will need to be swept up and removed. Horsehair does not decompose quickly though, so it should not be put in a manure or compost pile. Instead, simply toss it out with your regular garbage.

, Your horse won’t be used to the stark temperature change as a result of having much less hair, so they will need to be blanketed whenever they are put out. In general, if you need a thin coat, put a thin blanket on them. If you’re very cold, they’re also going to need a thick winter blanket."

Tie your horse up to a secure fixture with a hose nearby.,
Remove loose hair.,
Get out your sponge and dampen it.,
If your horse is a she, then you need to take another clean sponge that has never been used on any horse's face and clean her dock.,
Take the same clean sponge and clean the underside of your horse's tail regardless if your horse is a boy or a girl.

,
Get another clean sponge.,
Get a bucket of warm, but not burning water, put horse shampoo in it, and insert the horse's tail into the bucket.

,
Scrub the tail gently with the soap.,
Use a hose to spray the soap and dirt out of the tail.

After spraying the body, use horse soap and the sponge that you used on the tail and on the dock to scrub up some bubbles on your horse's body.

,
Use the Hose to rinse off the bubbles and the dirt.

,
Use the sweat scraper to get off all of the excess water.

",How to Clean a Horse,";
, Use a horse brush in the summer-time. Use curry comb or shedding blade if it is spring-time. Consider skipping horse baths in the fall or winter.

, Clean out your horse's nose and wipe out the eyes.

, If your horse is a he, then get out a clean sponge that has never been used on any horse's face and clean under his tail where a girl horse's dock is normally.

,, Clean the underside of your girl horse (mare). This means touching the udder and teats (areas that have no hair) and are prone to collecting dust and sweat. When mixed with dead skin, this makes a really gross, disgusting goo that must be removed to prevent irritation to the horse. The first time is the worst - once the area is clean, it will be much easier to clean later. If she's never been cleaned, the goo will dry and you will be pealing it off. The horse will appreciate your soothing voice as you do this unpleasant chore.

,, You may use the sponge used for the rear end when washing the tail. Do not use the sponge for the head when washing the tail.

,,, Be very careful not to dig at the frog as it is soft and tender. The frog is located at the rear of the hoof.

Learn about the profession.,
Consider your ability to do the work.,
Shadow a farrier.,
Evaluate your ability make a career as a farrier.,
Apply to an accredited farrier school.,
Complete the coursework.,
Find an apprenticeship.,
Get certified.,
Register your business.,
Get health, disability, and liability insurance.,
Build your client base.,
Continue to gain knowledge of your trade.",How to Be a Farrier," Before you decide to become a farrier, it is a good idea to learn as much as you can about the profession. Being a farrier is hard work, but it also requires a genuine interest in caring for horses. As a farrier, you would:


Travel to your clients to change horseshoes, clean and trim hooves, and provide therapeutic shoes for lame horses.
Have knowledge of horse anatomy and veterinary care, and advise horse owners if there is a problem that requires veterinary attention.
Communicate well with horse owners as well as have excellent horsemanship skills.
Work mainly with your hands, but you will also need good problem solving skills.;
, Farriers should have a passion for working with horses, but they should also be willing and able to perform hard manual labor on a daily basis. A farrier spends the day standing, stooping, kneeling, bending, and lifting. Farriers also often have to forge custom shoes, which is also physically challenging.


Keep in mind that being a farrier requires excellent physical health and a high level of physical fitness.You will need to keep yourself in good physical condition to do your job, similar to an athlete.
Be aware that you may end up working weekends, odd hours, and in bad weather as well. You will often have to accommodate your clients’ schedules.
You will also need to have a driver’s license and a reliable vehicle to visit your clients and bring your tools along with you.

, Shadowing a farrier can give you a good idea of what the work entails. If you have never spent a day with a farrier before, then you might want to find a farrier in your area and ask to go along with him or her for a day to see what the work is like. Try to find an experienced farrier so that you can ask questions, such as:


What is the most challenging part of your job?
How many clients do you visit each week?
What is a typical day like for you?

, Living in a rural area (or at least an area with a lot of horses) is essential to being able to make it as a farrier. Consider the horse population in your area to determine whether or not you could make a career as a farrier.Even if there are lots of farriers in your area, you may still be able to make a good living if you are willing to get advanced certifications and to provide excellent service.
Keep in mind that you should also really enjoy working with horses in order to be successful as a farrier. If you are only looking at the career from a money-making perspective, then it may be hard for you to be successful.

, It is important to find a school that is accredited so that your coursework will be acknowledged by any professional organizations that you wish to join. Attending a farrier school can also speed up your path to becoming a professional farrier, since some schools offer programs that you can complete in a few months rather than a few years.You might also want to consider programs that pair business courses with the farrier coursework in order to increase your chances of running a successful business when you graduate., Coursework for farriers is often completed alongside practical experiences, such as forge work and horseshoeing. Course work for farriers often includes things like:horse anatomy
making tools
welding
shoeing horses
veterinary care

, An apprenticeship provides hands-on job experience under the supervision of an experienced farrier. Depending on the requirements of your training program, you may complete an apprenticeship alongside your coursework, in place of coursework, or after completing your coursework.


A four year apprenticeship with an Accredited Training Farrier (ATF) is required to work as a farrier in the United Kingdom. During the apprenticeship, you would also be required to complete coursework and take exams., Getting certified as a farrier is required by some countries, but not all. For example, certification is required to work as a farrier in the United Kingdom, but it is not required in the United States.However, you can get certified in a country that does not require certification as a way to set yourself apart and gain more clients.In the United States, the American Farriers Association offers certification levels ranging from entry level to advanced., If you plan to do business under a special name rather than using your own name, then you will need to register your business. For example, if you plan to do business under the name “Friendly Farrier Service,” then you will need to visit your local clerk’s office to register this name.


License your business if necessary. Depending on your state’s laws, you may need to obtain a license for your business as well. For example, a business license is required for farrier business owners in California., Being a farrier can be dangerous because you are working closely with horses as well as doing other dangerous tasks, like forging and welding. Before you start working, you will need to ensure that you are well covered in the event of an accident.


Health insurance is extremely important for farriers. Don’t opt for the bare minimum insurance options if you can help it. It is likely that you will need to use your insurance at some point, so paying a bit more every month is better than having to pay a lot more out of pocket if you get seriously injured.
Disability insurance will provide you with some security in case you are injured and cannot work for a while.
Liability insurance provides some protection for you in case one of your customers is injured or if his or her property (including the horse) is damaged by you or as a result of your work., You can gain clients by taking on clients that experienced farriers do not want or cannot accommodate, by meeting new clients at horse shows, and by telling people about your business and handing out business cards. Building your reputation as a good farrier is especially important for gaining clients, so make sure that you always provide excellent service to your new and existing clients.


You may want to try to work as an assistant to an experienced farrier until you have enough clients of your own to support a business.
Do your best to maintain good relationships with your clients, such as by showing up on time for your appointments and listening to your clients’ needs.

, Continuing education is essential for your success as a farrier. Don’t end your education with a basic certification. Keep learning about your trade and gain as many certifications as you can.Stay up to date on new developments within your trade.
Attend conferences, horse shows, and other equine events.
Take advanced courses and challenge yourself to apply for advanced certifications as well.

Determine whether your horse has thin or thick hair.,
Repeat the above step on the right side with the curry comb in your left hand.

,
Now that you have used the curry comb to bring the dirt to the top, use the stiff brush (soft brush if thin hair) and following the direction of the hairbrush the dirt out.,
Use a mane and tail comb and get the tangles out of the mane and tail.,
Use the soft brush afterwards on the mane and tail to brush the dirt out.

,
If you want the horses coat to shine a little, go over the body with a cotton rag.

",How to Correctly Brush a Horse," For thin hair use a rubber curry comb, or skip this step altogether. Starting on the left side, put the curry comb in your right hand and face towards the back end of the horse. Starting at the upper neck go in circular movements down the horse ""gently"". This will pull the dirt to the top. This is NOT to remove the dirt.;
,, Continue doing this until ALL dirt is removed. Do not use a hard brush on a horse's face or legs.

, Be careful doing this. Do it in pieces not a whole lot at once.

,,"
"
Gather the correct supplies.,
Tie up your horse using a quick-release knot.,
Use the curry comb on the body of the horse.,
Use a dandy brush on the horse’s legs.,
Use a mane comb on the horse’s mane and tail.,
Wash the horse’s face.,
Wet the horse.,
Clean the horse’s anus and genitals.,
Shampoo the horse’s coat.,
Rinse the horse.,
Dry the horse.,
Carefully comb your horse's mane.,
Wash the tail.",How to Bathe a Horse," Properly bathing a horse requires the correct assortment of tools and supplies. Chief among these supplies are a shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for a horse.


You will also need an assortment of grooming tools such as a sweat scraper, body brush, curry comb, mane comb, and chamois leather or towels.You will also need access to a water source, obviously, as well as a step stool if your horse is too tall for you to reach its back.;
, Choose a place to tie your horse where the water will drain away. Most stables have wash racks or a part of the stable reserved for bathing horses.


A quick-release knot (or safety knot) is the best option because a panicked horse can injure itself or damage the barn/fence to which you’ve tied the animal.This type of knot allows you to easily untie the horse with a tug on the knot instead of having to fumble while the horse pulls back on the rope.
For instruction on how to tie this type of knot, check out: How to Tie a Quick Release Knot.

, Work the comb in a circular motion to stir up and loosen dirt and debris within the coat.You can then follow with a dandy brush to remove this detritus.A curry comb is a rubber- or plastic-bristled comb that you can use to gently stimulate circulation in the horse’s muscles and skin. The curry comb is usually the first step in grooming, and it loosens dirt and debris from the horse’s coat as well.A dandy brush is a stiff-bristled brush made from synthetic fibers or coarse animal hair. The brush is good for removing the layers of dirt and hair lifted by the curry comb. The brush is also good for removing mud from the horse’s legs and hoof walls., Depending on your individual brush, a stiff curry comb can be too harsh for use on the legs, in which case just use the dandy brush on the legs. Brush downward along the lie of the hair to loosen off dried mud.

, Use a wide-toothed mane comb to tease out any debris or knots tangled in the mane or tail. For especially tangled knots, use your fingers to work them free, rather than tugging at them with a comb.Never stand directly behind the horse. When combing or washing the tail, stand beside the horse's rump and reach around to the tail. This way if the horse kicks with a back leg you are out of harm's way.

, The horse is likely to be sensitive about having its face washed, so do this first before the rest of the bathing. Soak a sponge or a rag in warm water, then squeeze off the excess moisture. Wipe the face over, following the direction of the hair. Take care when working around the eyes that you don't squeeze water into them. This will upset the horse and cause unnecessary distress.


Never use shampoo on the horse's face, just plain water. If the face is very dirty, refresh your bucket of with clean water as many times as is necessary until the rinse water comes away clean.

, It is best to wet the coat all over before applying any shampoo. To wet the horse, you can use a hose, or you can soak a sponge in water and wipe it over the horse's coat.


Not all horses are happy to be hosed down. Start with their hooves and slowly direct the water up the legs before wetting the body. This gives the horse time to understand what you intend to do.
Don’t squirt the horse with a high-velocity water jet, which is bound to upset the animal.

, Now is a good time to clean the sheath in a male horse and around the anus regardless of the gender of the horse. For this, use clean wads of cotton wool or a clean cloth that you save just to wash these areas. Use a separate cloth for the anus as for the sheath.


Washing the sheath and penis of a male horse requires gentle sponging and rinsing of the area. You should also check the horse’s penis for potential abnormalities. You can find more information about the washing and examination process at: How to Clean the Sheath of a Horse

For the anus, simply dampen the cloth with water and wipe. Use a fresh area of the cloth when the first area becomes soiled. Keep gently wiping until the cloth comes away clean.
Never stand directly behind the horse to wash the anus. Always stand to one side.

, Once the coat is wet, apply a coin-sized amount of shampoo (as directed on the individual product) to a wet sponge and work it into the coat.You will likely need to repeat this several times depending on the horse's size. You may also want to shampoo the horse’s body in sections because the shampoo can lead to a dry, dull coat if is sits long enough to dry.Shampoo is not always necessary. Be cautious about shampooing too frequently since it may strip the horse's coat of valuable oils that help to waterproof the coat in bad weather.
If the horse is a show animal and needs shampooing more than once a month, then you might need to think about stabling the animal as their natural ability to cope in bad weather is undermined.

, Shampoo left in contact with the skin can irritate or dry it, leading to a dull coat. Always rinse the shampoo off well. To do this, either use a clean bucket of water and repeatedly rinse the coat with a damp sponge until no more foamy residue remains, or you can also gently hose the horse off., Once satisfied the water running off the horse is clear and there is no shampoo residue left, you are ready to stop rinsing and dry the horse.


One option is to use a sweat scraper and to move it in the same direction as the hair. This squeezes the excess water from the coat. If you don't have a sweat scraper, you can use the edge of your hand to ""squeegee"" the water away.
Alternatively, use several clean dry towels to wipe the entire horse over and dry it off.
When you are satisfied the horse is as dry as possible, walk it for ten minutes or so in the sun. If it's clouded over, put an anti-sweat sheet or cooler blanket on the horse.

, Don't try to comb out knots. Undo them with your fingers, and then gently comb the mane.

, You should clean your horse's tail as well, especially if it is a pale color. Because washing the tail doesn't chill your horse, you can wash it any time. Hold the bucket of warm water and shampoo up with one hand. With the other hand, lift the horse's tail into the bucket and then hold the bucket about level with the horse's dock. Clean as much of the tail as possible.


Swish the tail in the bucket, squeezing the dirt out. You can clean the top of the tail using a sponge dipped in warm water mixed with shampoo.
Rinse the tail off in several buckets of clean water. Dip the sponge into clean water and clean the top of the tail.
Dry off the tail with a towel. Let the horse graze in a sunny place to let the tail dry off.
Again, never stand directly behind the horse. Stand beside the horse’s rump and reach back with the bucket to avoid any potential kicking.

Before you even think about beginning to campdraft, you need to ensure that both you and your horse are up to the job.,
If you have never seen a campdraft before, it is probably a good idea to go for a look first.,
Go to a small campdraft first.,
Like any sport, you will need to warm your horse up before you run.,
Once you and your suitably warmed up horse are ready, you should head to the camp.,
Pick the right horse.,
OK, so you've picked your beast and the announcer has just called your name.,
Start when you are told to and not before.,
You have finished your yard work, you need to call out for the gate at the front of the camp to be opened.,
Now is the scary part.,
HAVE FUN.,
Now go and waste some money on entry fees.

",How to Campdraft With Your Horse," Riders need to be very competent and confident and should have some experience working cattle. A horse will preferably have had experience working cattle. Horses should have the ability to turn on their back legs, stop and start quickly similarly to a cutting horse. Indeed, many cutting horses, or, more commonly cutting bred horses, often make fine campdrafters, providing they have the speed to keep up with a beast in the arena. The most common breed used for campdrafting is the Australian Stock horse, closely followed by the Quarter horse, however almost any smart horse with a bit of cattle sense can make a campdrafter.;
, Many small towns in Australia run a campdraft at least once a year and there are campdraft exhibitions at all the major royal shows. Campdraft calendars can be accessed at the following sites-<www.abcra.com.au> (Australian bushman's campdraft and rodeo assn.), <www.campdraft.org.au> (Southern Campdrafting assn.), <www.campdraft.com.au> (Australian campdraft assn.), <www.campdraft.com.au> (Australian campdraft assn.), NB- As these sites are different associations they all have different campdrafts.

, So, you're all set, you've got an idea what to do and you're at your first draft. It's probably best if you go to a small local one for your first time. The competitors will tend to be more friendly and it is a lot more fun, even if the cattle are often more difficult.

, If you have time, you should take at least half an hour to do this, and longer if your horse is unused to the atmosphere. Once the initial warming up is done, a great place to work your horse is in the arena, returning cattle that have already been run into holding pens. Everyone is usually welcome to help out but it can get crowded in the mid morning before the weather is too hot. This is great to get your horse on cattle and to get him used to the atmosphere.

, How long you spend here is personal preference. Some people arrive half an hour before their run, others arrive just as they are about to go in. My personal preference is to arrive 10 runs before mine, to give both you and your horse ample time to relax and for you to pick a beast.

, Picking a beast is probably one of the hardest parts of drafting. Often this is a personal preference, with people choosing a certain breed of cattle or maybe heifers or steers. A general rule of thumb is to pick the beast you would want to take home to slaughter. You don't want a little mouldy beast as the smaller ones can run very fast and are often dangerous. A beast that is over fat is likely to knock up outside and prevent you from completing the course. You want a beast that turns away from the horse and rider (but does so calmly- the beast that bolts away will do just that outside), is alert and not in amongst the mob. in an ideal world this is what you would pick. also, never be afraid to ask, most campdrafters are more than happy to help a newbie.

, RELAX. If you get tense, so will your horse, and you WILL stuff up. Ride in with one hand on your waist to relax you. If the judge isn't looking, you can ride amongst the mob to help chose a beast, just be careful not to start working until he says go.

, The judge will tell you to start when the previous competitor's beast is off the course. Usually he will call out to you to start, or it may simply be a nod. Either way, be ready when he says go. There is nothing more infuriating than someone trying to pick a beast when the judge is waiting. Shorten your reins, using two hands and calmly try to cut your beast from the mob. If he is on his own you can simply ride up to him and push him down the camp. You may need to bring more than one beast up the front. This is OK, but should be avoided. It looks bad and it works your horse up. Once your beast is separated you need to turn it about 2-3 times at the front of the camp. Once you become more experienced you can get a bit more 'fancy' but for your first little while its best to keep it simple.

, Yell out ""GATE"" or ""RIGHT"" or whatever else, just make it loud and clear as the gatemen are more than likely chatting or half asleep.

, You are outside in the arena. For the purpose of this we will assume it is a left hand course (the judge will tell you if the course is left or right hand). Your aim is to turn the beast around the first peg, then bring him round in a figure 8 and go round the second peg before going through the ""Gate"" (two pegs""). The whole course is similar to a barrel course. Use common sense to turn the beast. If you want him to turn a gradual left, hang back about the length of one beast back and one out from his head, on his right hand side. If he turns to quick, change sides to correct him. Sometimes it is necessary to ""Shoulder"" the beast, or push him with your horse's shoulder. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNLESS YOU AND YOUR HORSE ARE VERY EXPERIENCED. This is one of the major causes of accidents.

, Remember, you are not doing this to make money. If you win that's a bonus, if you get the whip in the camp then bad luck, try again next time. Don't lose heart. If you stick at it long enough you will get there.

In terms of clothing, avoid wearing fleecy clothing because cut hairs tend to stick to it, and can irritate you while clipping the horse.
In addition, wear a cap to prevent your hair from blocking your face, or worse, getting tangled in the clipper.;
, Select a proper location, preferably one with good lighting.


If the weather permits, clipping should be done outside the stable, to ensure that there is enough light for you to have a clear view of what you are clipping.
If you are indoors, make sure there is sufficient light available.

, During clipping, ensure your and the horse's safety by restraining the horse.


Drape the lead rope over the horse’s neck and hold its end to temporarily restrain the animal while you attach the halter.
Place the nose band part of the halter over the horse’s nose. Place the head piece over the animal’s ears.
Draw the head piece strap underneath the jaw, and attach the snap closure to the ring on the left jaw of the horse. Attach the lead rope on the ring in the chin part of the halter.
Then, lead the horse to the area where you will perform clipping by holding the lead rope or halter and pulling it while walking alongside the horse.
To restrain the horse, have your assistant tie the lead rope to a post, and have him hold the halter so that when the horse moves, a slight pull of the halter will restrain the horse.
If you are working alone, you can restrain the horse by using cross ties that can be attached on each side of the halter, and fixing it to two opposite posts.

, The horse must be clean and free from caked dirt and dust prior to clipping.


A clean coat will ensure that the clipper will not get tangled while clipping, and become dull and painful for the horse.
However, a full bath is probably not necessary.

, Make sure that you have all the necessary accoutrements ready at hand.


Gather heavy duty extension cords with circuit breakers.
You will need at least one set of shearing clippers for clipping wide areas of hair, and a small clipper for clipping around the face and ears.

, Before clipping, ensure that the clippers's tension is proper and sufficient.


This can be done by reading the manual of your selected clippers for proper tension settings.
Additionally, get a wet sponge with warm water that will be used after clipping, as well as good blankets and drapes to cover the horses, especially if the weather is cold.
This will help prevent chilling, because newly clipped horses need additional insulation to ensure much needed warmth.

, For this type of clip, a line using a chalk is drawn around and above the elbow and knee of the horse. All of the parts of the horse above the line are then clipped, including the belly, face, head and chest. The withers, forelock and tail are not clipped.

, There are two types of trace clip, the Low Trace Clip, and the High Trace Clip.


Low trace clip. For this clip, a line is drawn starting from the throat latch of the horse, passing through the high point of the shoulder, and ending at the flank. Everything that falls below the line is then clipped, including the underside of the neck, the belly and the chest, but not including from the elbow and knee downwards, and the face.
High trace clip. This clip is similar to the low trace clip, but the line drawn starts from the high point of the back of the base of ear, passing above the highest point of the shoulder, and ending at the flank. Everything that falls below the line is clipped, including the underside of the neck, the belly and chest, but not including the elbow and knee downwards, and the face.

, There are other clip types that are more specialized, depending on the specific circumstances of the horse's use.


Use a belly clip for ponies that are ridden out on weekends. Clip hairs from the underside of the neck and the belly.Use a full clip for show horses that are mainly engaged in competition. Use this clip to clip the entire coat, leaving a sleek coat where sweat can evaporate easily. This clip is only used for horses that are not turned out during the winter or at night.Use an Irish clip for light work horses and horses turned out during the day. For this clip, draw a line from the poll to the belly to make a triangle, and clip all of the coat that falls under the line. The legs are not clipped, but sometimes the lower half of the head can be clipped.Use a blanket clip for heavy work horses. Using this clip, the neck is fully clipped and the head is half or fully clipped. Only the legs are left unclipped, letting hair be removed in areas where they sweat a lot, but leaving enough hair to give them warmth."
"
Maintain a system and pattern when clipping.,
Check the temperature of the blades and oil the blades every 5 to 10 minutes.,
Avoid clipping the mane, tail and forelock of the horse.,
Use big clippers for large surfaces and small clippers for tight areas.,
Get someone's help to clip the elbows, hind legs, belly, and trunk.,
Wipe the horse to clean him off.,
Clean store your clippers and blades.",How to Clip a Horse with H & H Tips2," Always begin clipping from the less sensitive areas like the shoulders, going upwards to the neck.


Clip in long and overlapping strokes, and always go against the hair growth.
Do this one side at a time.

, Make sure your blades do not overheat, and keep them lubricated with a generous amount of mineral oil (5 to 10 drops).


If the blade gets hot, replace it with a fresh set or let it cool down first before using it again.

, You can prevent cutting these areas by wrapping the tail with bandage, and by pushing the mane with your other hand when you are clipping an area near it.


These areas can irritate the horse when clipped.

, Clip a majority of the hairs using big clippers, and then use smaller clippers on the nooks and ear edges.


Move the horse's skin or stretch it using your fingers to reach into nooks and crannies.
When you are clipping the face, be careful around the bony edges around the face and eyes.
You can cover the eyes with one hand to prevent cut hairs from falling in and irritating the eyes.
Additionally, when clipping in this area, make sure that the blades are not hot, because a hot blade can startle the horse.
For whiskers, use fine or small clippers.

, Clipping from the elbows down is a two man job, and you will need an assistant to lift the foreleg of the horse, so that you can stretch and clip the skin behind the elbows.


Clipping the hind legs, belly, and trunk, also requires an assistant to make sure that the horse is properly restrained.
These areas are ticklish and can startle horses, making them kick.
The simple halter restraint discussed earlier may be sufficient.

, After clipping, wipe the horse with a warm wet sponge, to remove cut hairs that can cause irritation.


Any hairs that are left on the horse can prick their skin and cause them to buck and struggle.

, Dust and brush off all the hairs from the clippers.


Remove the blades by unscrewing the tension screws.
Clean the blades with oil and cloth, using 5 to 10 drops of mineral oil and wiping it away with a flannel cloth.
Clean the hand set of the clipper.
Store it in a cool, dry place.

Put on your helmet.,
Mount outside the arena or in the middle of the arena.,
Adjust your stirrups and/or girth either from the ground or in the middle of the arena.,
Go with the current direction.,
Give right of way to people on horses when you are on foot.,
Close the gate behind you.",How to Follow Arena Etiquette While Horseback Riding1," If you’re in the arena, you should be wearing a helmet. Even if you are not mounted or even planning on riding, your presence in the arena requires a helmet.;
, You should not mount where you will be in another rider’s way. Mount outside the ring and then walk into the ring on your horse. You can also walk your horse into the middle of the ring (where there is usually less traffic) and mount. Some rings also have designated mounting blocks in a specific place.Have someone hold your horse to keep both you and the horse safe while mounting. This will also protect already-mounted riders and horses nearby.

, If you need to adjust your girth or your stirrups, always do so in a place that is not blocking other riders. Try to be fairly quick about adjusting your girth and stirrups., If you walk into the arena and most horses are travelling to the left, travel to the left with them. It is easiest for all parties involved if you mostly go with the flow of traffic. , If you are walking your horse in or out of the arena, be cognizant of people riding around you. Wait for a break in traffic before you cross the track to leave the arena.

, Whether you are entering or exiting the arena, make sure that you close the gate behind you. You may need to dismount to do this. You should always close gates, even if you come upon it already open."

Groom on a daily basis year-round.,
Feed your horse a coat-enhancing grain.,
Take care of your horse’s mane and tail.,
Keep up your horse’s medical treatment.",How to Prepare for a Horse Show1," If you want a truly show-ready horse, keep their coat in perfect order all the time. Grooming your horse every day does two things: increases emotional bonding, and increases the health and shine of their coat. A win-win situation, huh?


Spend the most time with a curry comb to work out dirt and loose hair that cause your horse to appear dull and dusty.
Be sure to pick your horse’s hooves on a daily basis as well. Keeping them clean will make it more comfortable for your horse, and better-looking in the long run.
Spend time brushing the dock of your horse’s tail to stimulate hair growth. Your horse’s tail will end up becoming fuller and more healthy as a result of spreading the natural oils and stimulating the hair follicles.;
, There are many different feed products on the market that are full of the nutrients necessary to enhance the thickness and shine of your horse’s coat and mane/tail. If your horse is able (based on dietary circumstances), incorporate one of these grains into their regular eating throughout the year, at least several months prior to a show.

You can also feed your horse small servings of dried bread crumbs. This really will make their coat shine, just be careful to not make your horse sick!







, If the mane and tail of your horse are constantly ratted and full of debris, it will be very difficult to get them looking good in time for showing. Brush your horse’s mane and tail thoroughly every time you groom them, and rub in some cocoa butter once every few days. This will act as a conditioner, making their hair thicker and softer over time. When necessary, use a detangler to help reduce the number of knots.



Braid their mane and tail occasionally (when flies are low) to keep the hair from getting in more knots.

, A horse that is underweight, overweight, has worms, or any other illness/ailment won’t show as well. Make sure that you are keeping your horse’s health in mind throughout the year, instead of doing last-minute worming and medication the week of a show. A healthy horse will work better and be much more presentable than an unhealthy horse. You should also ensure that your horse is up to date on its vaccines and meets any other important health standards. "

Purchase a container to hold all of your grooming supplies.",How to Assemble a Horse Grooming Kit," A rubber curry comb has several rows of rubber teeth. This variation of the curry comb removes dirt, loose hair, and dander from your horse’s coat. It should be used on your horse’s large, muscular body parts. This includes the neck, hindquarters, and shoulders., A plastic curry comb has multiple rows of tough, plastic teeth. This brush can remove caked on dirt and manure from your horse’s coat. Its durable teeth are ideal for your horse’s thick, winter coat., Massaging curry combs are dual-purpose grooming tools. In addition to ridding your horse’s coat of loose hair, dirt, and dander, these brushes also gently massage your horse’s muscles. These combs are available with hard or soft rubber teeth., A metal curry combs have several rows of sharp, metal teeth; a shedding blade has one row of sharp metal teeth. Due to the sharpness of the teeth, you should use the metal curry comb and the shedding blade sparingly on the horse’s body. You can use either tool to remove caked on mud or to thin out your horse’s thick, winter coat.Do not run these tools over your horse’s non-fleshy areas.
Be gentle when using a shedding blade.
Alternatively, you can use these tools to clean your other brushes., The rubber grooming mitt, or currying glove is a gentler alternative to curry combs. You may use this mitt on every part of your horse, even its legs and face.


Many people use this mitt at bath time., Due to the bristles’ stiffness, it should not be used on sensitive areas or run over bones., The medium bristle brush is a must for your kit. This versatile brush is suitable for most of your basic grooming needs. It will effectively remove dust and dirt from your horse’s coat., The soft bristle brush is used to groom the delicate areas of your horses. These areas include the legs and face.

Instead of using a soft bristle brush on your horse’s face, you may also purchase a face brush. The face brush is smaller and easy to handle., The body brush has very fine bristles. These bristles effectively remove small particles of dust and dirt from your horse’s coat. As it removes the grime, it also leaves the coat shiny.


If you wish to enhance your horse’s natural sheen, consider purchasing a sheepskin mitt., In addition to caring for your horse’s coat, you also need to maintain the animal’s tail and mane. Your kit should include a wide tooth comb and a plastic bristle hair brush. These tools will gently remove tangles from your horse’s hair without causing breakage., When your horse’s mane needs a trim, don’t reach for the scissors—cutting the hair will result in an uneven mane. Instead, use a mane pulling comb. This metal tool removes a few long hairs at a time.If you’ve never done this before, have someone show you how to use this comb before trying it on your horse. Otherwise, you may hurt your horse or pull out too much of the mane.

, Hoof picks are used to remove dirt, manure, and stones from your horse’s hooves. These tools come in a variety of shapes, styles, and sizes. You can purchase one with a brush or one that folds up., This tool can be used to remove sweat after a heavy workout. Additionally, you can use it to remove excess water after a bath., You should store a variety of clean rags and sponges in your kit. You can use the rags and sponges when you bathe the horse. Do not put dirty sponges and rags back in your kit.You can also keep baby wipes in your kit for cleaning tack as well as sensitive areas of your horse, such as near its eyes, ears, and lips.

, As you assemble the supplies for your kit, you need to have a container to hold them. You can purchase a plastic caddy or make your own wooden crate. Some people prefer to use a bag."

Let faster horses travel on the outside of the track.,
Always pass “left to left.” The “left to left” rule applies when you are travelling around the ring in a different direction than someone else.,
Pass other horses on the inside.,
Give only quiet commands to your horse.,
Be prepared for an emergency.,
Maintain a safe distance from other horses.,
Let other riders know where you are going.",How to Follow Arena Etiquette While Horseback Riding2," If you are walking or trotting, let cantering and galloping horses travel on the outside track, closest to the fence. However, if they are jumping in the center of the arena, you should probably remain on the outside track if you are walking., If you are facing another rider head-on, you should pass such that your left shoulder is closest to their left shoulder. In other words, if you see an oncoming rider, go to your right side of that person.Someone may override this rule in the ring by calling, “Rail!” Be aware of this possibility and always keep an eye on your surroundings.

, If you need to pass a horse that’s travelling more slowly than you are, pass the horse on the inside. In other words, do not go between the fence and the other horse. Go to the left of the slower horse, closer to the middle of the ring. Be sure to communicate with the rider you’re passing by saying “On your left” or something similar, so that she knows where you are.

, Many horses could get spooked or upset if you yell at your horse, smack your horse loudly with the whip, or give wild hand gestures in an effort to get your horse to move. Be quiet and respectful when giving commands to your horse. Do not yell or make loud noises., Always be aware of your surroundings. If another rider falls off their horse, dismount immediately and hold your horse, trying to keep him calm. Know where the first aid kit is., You should be at least one horse length (but preferably two) away from any other horse at all times when you’re in the arena. Other horses can become upset if you pass too close to them. Horses can also kick pretty far out to the side and behind them. Keep a safe distance away from other horses while you’re in the arena., This applies especially in situations where you might be jumping or turning unexpectedly. If you are going to jump over a cross-rail in the arena, yell, “Red crossrail!” Be specific, loud, and clear. You can also say, “On your inside!” to a rider you’re passing."
"
Know the rules.,
Do not enter the warmup ring unless you are competing.,
Do not allow your trainer to come into the ring with you.,
Make sure you and your horse are wearing numbers.",How to Follow Arena Etiquette While Horseback Riding3," Each discipline and each barn has different rules about the show arena. Look up the specific rules of the horse show you’re attending. Be aware of what other riders are doing and how it differs from your home barn. If you have a question, ask. It’s safer to ask than to assume.


For example, many barns have a rule where you need to let riders know that you're coming into the arena by saying ""Door"" or ""Coming in!""
Many barns also have rules where you can't be on your cell phone while you're riding.
Dogs are also prohibited at many barns because they can spook the horses.

, The only people in the warmup ring at a show should be the people who are competing. Do not bring your horse into the warmup ring if he is not competing, even if you are and are riding a different horse., Your trainer should be on the outside of the ring, giving you directions. However, do not stop on the rail to talk to your trainer. Other people may be riding in the ring, and you should try not to be disruptive., You should always have your number displayed at a show. Some shows require numbers for both horse and rider, but some only require one. Make sure that you know the rules and obey them.

Bathe your horse.,
Clip your horse.,
Whiten any white socks or sections on your horse.,
Take care of your horse’s mane and tail.",How to Prepare for a Horse Show2," It's best to bathe the horse the night before so your horse is clean and ready to go.If you clean your horse before the night of the show, your horse could get dirty and you would have to clean them again.


Beware of using shine-enhancing formula around the saddle area though, or you might run into the issue of a slipping saddle or saddle pad.
Another benefit of bathing the horse the night before is that there is less time for them to roll about etc. to make themselves dirty again.

, Clip the fetlocks on your horse's legs closely, as well as the longer hairs that grow on your horse's muzzle, face, ears, and throat. Clip the hair that falls onto your horses hooves straight. Clipping is important! Always clip your horse a nice, clean bridle path - for stock horses, the length of the ear but for light breeds about an ear and a half. Clipping adds definition to your horse's body shape and improves the overall presentation before the judge.


Do not trim your horses if they are heavy horses, such as Friesians or Clydesdales.
If you're planning on a full-body clip, do so 1-2 weeks prior to the show. Clipping the entire body gives the coat a dull appearance until the oils are spread out again and the coat grows back a bit., A white horse or horse with socks that appears brown, grass-stained, or dingy won’t score as well with judges. Use a whitening shampoo to thoroughly scrub all white areas on your horse, allowing it to set and soak in for about 5 minutes before rinsing it off. Then, coat white socks or stars with cornstarch or French chalk to keep the white looking white.


Wrap white socks with standing wraps to keep your horse from dirtying and staining them before a show.

, Wash the mane and tail with a specialized shampoo, and use a whitening product if your horse’s hair is white. Add in a detangler to make sure that there are no knots to get your comb caught on. Then, use a metal pull brush to thin out too-thick manes, or use a specialized mane razor to accomplish the task. Finish off by braiding or banding the mane and tail for the show.


By braiding the mane and tail a few days in advance, even if you intend to have their mane and tail loose, it will keep it from getting tangled and add a lovely wave to the hair.
If you’re banding the mane, cut off excess hair after banding. This will help it to look more precise and avoid the need to cut it twice.
Wrap the tail with a tail bag or long sock to keep it from coming undone or getting caught on anything.

Prepare your horse's food and water.,
Gather all your tack.,
Get a trailer companion prepared, if necessary.,
Prepare the necessary stall equipment.,
Get a first aid kit prepared, for both horses and humans.,
Bring a change of clothes.",How to Prepare for a Horse Show3," Because shows are often stressful areas for horses (with all the other horses and people present), it is important to try to keep as normal of a feed schedule as possible. Get all their regular food and at least two buckets for water. When you get to the show, try to feed them at the same times as you normally would at home.

, The worse thing is showing up to a show missing some of the necessary tack and equipment that you will need. Make a checklist of everything you will need for the show, including any riding or exercise gear and blankets. Put all of these together and check them off your list prior to leaving, just to make sure you’ve gotten everything you could possibly need.


Clean and polish all tack before heading to the show for the best presentation.
Check with your show circuit's regulations; some bits, aids and pieces of tack are prohibited. For example, 4-H has severe restrictions on the types of bits used, and some riding clubs or associations don't allow figure-eights, draw reins, etc.

, Driving long distances in a trailer can be especially stressful for some horses. Rather than arriving at your show with a frightened, anxious horse, help to minimize their anxiety by bringing another horse along for the ride. They’ll be much more calm upon arrival than if you hadn’t.

, Call the event venue that you are showing at, and see if you need to bring your own bedding for the stall. Many shows require that you bring your own shavings to fill the stall with, as well as any hooks or chains, and a wheelbarrow/bucket and pick for cleaning. See what will be available for communal use at the show and what you need to bring from home - and make sure what you’re bringing meets any guidelines the venue may have.

, No matter where you travel, it is always important to have a first aid kit prepared for your horse. Bring all basic supplies to treat for basic cuts and abrasions as well as bruises or swelling. Be sure to do the same with a human first aid kit, should you encounter an accident of some sort.

, You’ll be away from home, so it’s best to prepare for everything and anything. Pack a spare set of show clothes in case something happens to your own, making them unusable for the show. Additionally, you could choose to pack a pair of more comfortable clothes/shoes for the ride to and from the venue.

Dress for Western classes.,
Dress for English classes.,
Do your hair properly.",How to Prepare for a Horse Show4," For western competitions such as Western pleasure or Western horsemanship, always wear an outfit that makes your horse stand out and color coordinates with your saddle pad. This will add great style to your overall presentation. For a local show, a button up western shirt, nice show pants, boots, and a belt may be very acceptable. But for more competitive shows, everyone will be wearing more elaborate garments such as form fitting silkies and vests, expensive chaps, etc.


If your budget will not allow you to make these purchases, as long as your outfit compliments yourself as well as your horse, then you have nothing to worry about.
Dark colors on light horses, and lighter colors on dark horses tend to draw more attention to them.
It's not recommended to wear an all-black outfit in the show ring. Most of your competition will also be wearing it and you will want to stand out among everyone else. A deep purple or midnight blue is a great alternative.
If you are confident in your skills and the skills of your horse, try drawing a bit of extra attention with a brightly colored shirt is a good option. You will stand out in the crowd and be more memorable in a sea of similar colors.

, You should wear a dark and/or traditional coat (navy, black, hunter green, tan, gray, brown, or copper) and breeches that complement, generally a light neutral or white color. Your shirt should have a stock collar and pin or a ratcatcher collar. Your boots should be highly shined and your gloves should match your boots; black is the recommended color. Do not wear boots that have a high heels.


The glove should successfully keep any bare flesh from being seen between your hands and the sleeve of your jacket.
For saddle seat you need a full suit: day coat and matching pants with shined jodhpur boots and either a derby hat for the female riders, or a fedora for the male riders, that accents your outfit.
Helmets for English classes are typically expected to be velvet-covered. Check the guidelines for your event to see what the specifics are., always have your hair up, make sure to get all fly-aways before showing, unless you are showing hunter/jumper or dressage. For more competitive shows, all hair should absolutely be under your helmet, or tight into a neat, tight bun in a hairnet at the back of your head, just barely below your hat or helmet.

"
"
Feed your horse.,
Do a final grooming.,
Polish your horse’s hooves.,
Take time to relax.",How to Prepare for a Horse Show5," Overfeeding or underfeeding at an event is a surefire way to make your horse uncomfortable, and therefore less show-ready. Follow their regular diet plan, adjusting feeding around events if necessary. Your horse will be happier and easier to work with after having eaten.

, Don’t bathe your horse, but brush them down really well to make their coat gleam. Spend the most time using the curry comb, and make sure to address all parts of their body. Spend extra time on white areas and apply more baby powder, corn starch, or French chalk if necessary.

, English and western riders often sand the horses hooves to make them smooth, then apply hoof polish. Black hoof polish can be applied on naturally black hooves, while clear polish should be applied to hooves any color other than black. This should all be done on a clean hard surface.


Put down rubber or heavy foam mats on the ground in your grooming area, to allow the hoof black to dry. Once the hoof black is completely dry, dirt may be wiped off with a dry towel.
If you don’t want to polish your horses hooves, rub in some lanolin oil to add extra shine.
Appaloosas are not permitted to use hoof polish of ANY color, other than clear, and even that is frowned upon. Check with your breed registry for specifications and regulations.

, Shows and events are intended to be enjoyable; if you’re nervous you will not only enjoy the event less, but your horse will mirror your emotions and you likely won’t show as well. Make sure you've gotten enough sleep the night before, and enough to eat and drink before the competition. Do some deep breathing exercises and visualization to relax; listen to music or repeat a mantra if that helps you. Be sure to help your horse relax as well, going for a walk or lunge with them if necessary.Don't worry about the other competitors. Act as if you were riding alone in your home arena. It will calm your nerves, and encourage you to pay attention to your own riding. Of course, be alert, and avoid running into the other riders in the ring.

Understand the reasons why horses can be difficult when handling their feet.,
Don't try to do too much at first.,
Work with the horse in a safe enclosed area, this can be a small area of field sectioned off with electric fencing (turned off!,
Do not work with the horse tied up at first, this can cause a horse to panic if he feels that he cannot get away from something that he thinks may put him in danger.,
Start with the front legs.,
Use the same technique when working on the back legs, but with the false arm.,
Replace the fake hand with your own.,
Begin picking up his feet.,
Using the padded walking stick, move to the back legs.,
Begin holding the foot as a farrier would.,
Using sounds similar to what he would hear from being worked on by a farrier, get him used to having his feet tapped and the sound of hot metal in water.",How to Train Your Horse for the Farrier," A horses first line of defense is to run away, this is difficult if we have hold of a leg! He feels vulnerable. Maybe he has been mishandled in the past when having his feet lifted. There could be a physical problem making it painful for him to, either lift the foot you are working on, or put his weight on the other three feet.;
, When training a horse to have his feet worked on, break the training down into small ‘bite size’ chunks. So although ultimately we want the horse to stand quietly while having his feet held up and worked on, this is unlikely to happen during the first training session. We need to look for small improvements and end a training session on a good note, rather than ask for more than the horse can understand and risk confusing him.

,), or perhaps a round pen. This is to ensure that if the horse somehow gets away from you while you are working, it cannot get into a dangerous situation and you don’t have to walk as far to catch it again!

, In addition to a safe area it would be a good idea to have a bamboo cane about 1 meter (3.3 ft) long with some padding on one end, you can even make it into a false arm using an old glove to look like a hand, and a walking stick with the curved handle padded.

, To begin with stroke the horse on the neck and slowly make your way down to the shoulder, if he is happy and hasn’t moved away, stop and take your hand away. Gradually work your way down the front leg, taking your hand away each time you go a little further. Working like this you will soon be able to touch all the way down the leg to the hoof, with the horse remaining relaxed. If you find that you can only get to the knee during the initial sessions, that’s fine, finish on a good note and attempt to get further down the leg during the next session.

, If the horse kicks out or steps away, try to keep the arm on, or at least near the leg. As soon as the horse stops, take the arm away to reward the horse for doing the right thing (in this case stopping kicking or moving away). While doing this work keep yourself calm and relaxed, as this will also help the horse. As with the front legs it will not be long before you are able to touch all the way down the back legs and around the fetlock area with the false arm.

, Once you are happy with how the horse is reacting to this you can try to touch down the leg with your own hand. Alternate between legs during a training session to keep things a little more interesting for the horse (and you). This will also help to get the horse happy having all his feet lifted. There are a lot of horses that are really good having their nearside front leg lifted, and gradually get worse as you work your way round. There is no rule that states what order the horses feet need to be lifted in!

, Now your horse now lets you touch all his legs whilst standing calmly. For the front legs, run your hand down to just behind the knee and, while standing a little to the side, gently pull forward. As soon as the horse lifts his leg put it down and give him a stroke. Continue like this, holding it up a little longer each time. Once again do not ask for too much too soon, it’s best to do too little than risk upsetting the horse and undoing all the previous good work. When you are able to lift and hold the leg up by pulling it forward, gently try getting it into the more usual position by bringing the hoof back and under. Again reward the horse by putting the foot down, and go to the other side to do the same with that foot. Now try gently picking the front feet up in the normal way. If the horse finds it difficult, go back a step, lift the legs forward again and repeat the above, he will soon get the idea.

, Stroke down the leg and hook the curved handle around the fetlock, you may also use a rope. Gently pull forward, when the horse lifts his foot immediately put it down and remove the walking stick. Repeat this several times, gradually increasing the time you have the foot lifted. Again when you are happy with how the horse is coping with this, lift his foot with your hand, lift it by pulling forward as you did with the walking stick.

, Once the horse is happy having his feet lifted and held up you can start to get him used to having them held as the farrier would hold them. So take note of the positions that the farrier uses.

, Maybe have him around when another horse on the yard is being hot shod, to let him see and smell the smoke and experience the noise.

Do your research.,
Join an equestrian community.,
Spend time around horses.,
Pay careful attention to the physical and mental needs of horses.,
Respect the animals that you work with.,
Serve as an apprentice.",How to Be an Equestrian1," Learn everything that you can about horses. Go online and look up information about different horse breeds and their characteristics. Watch videos showing horse behaviors. Subscribe to two or three well-known horse magazines. These publications will provide useful information while also letting you know about horse events in your area.


Being an equestrian requires that you are a life-long learner of all things horse related. Never stop researching or asking questions. For example, if your horse reacts oddly to a certain harness, look up possible reasons online.;
, Making friends with fellow equestrians at your local barn is always a good idea. They can be excellent mentors for you. Being an equestrian is not a solo activity and you will require the assistance of many people in order to be a success. You can also get involved in equestrian communities online, especially by participating in one of the many horse blog networks.If you own a horse and choose to board it, your fellow riders at the boarding stable will become your community. To find a good boarding stable, search online for boarding and training facilities by state. You will want to choose a stable close to your home to make visiting easier. Visit your stable options to assess their cleanliness and general atmosphere.You can also build a community by going to a stable for riding lessons. In this case, you will want to very carefully choose your riding instructor. Make sure that they are a member of the Certified Horsemanship Association (CHA). Request references and ask questions about their experience level as well.
To keep the conversation going, before you head to the barn each day, think about a few questions to ask other riders. For example, you might say, “How long should I cool down my horse after a one hour work-out?”

, Take lessons at a local barn or volunteer to help out at a non-profit stable. If a neighbor owns horses, offer to help them out. You want to spend as many contact hours around horses as possible. Doing so will make you attuned to their behaviors and will help you hone your caretaking and horsemanship skills.


For true equestrians, riding is only part of the experience. You will also need to get your hands dirty mucking stalls, grooming, and feeding/watering. Don’t shirk these responsibilities or other riders will not take you seriously.
It is great to own a horse, but make sure that you have contact with other horses as well. Expose yourself to different horse personalities and alternative skill sets. For example, if you are interested in barrel racing, both you and your horse would benefit from spending time with an experienced racing team.

, As an equestrian, you are responsible for the well-being of the horses around you. Make a daily, weekly, and monthly calendar in which you note major health appointments. Use this calendar to also keep track of how much, and what items, you feed your horse every day. And, keep an eye out for your horse’s mental status. If your horse begins to act out violently or is really lethargic, it may need some extra attention or even a change of stall.


Treating all health concerns seriously is important for the horse, but also for your safety. Animals in pain are more likely to lash out, injuring their caretakers in the process.
Get to know all of the equine professionals who care for horses, including veterinarians and farriers. Vets take care of a horse’s vaccinations and dental work while farriers watch over a horse’s all-important hoof care.Horses will often take a wide variety of supplements and vitamins. It is important to note what a horse takes in so that you can trace its outward effects.

, No matter whether you are riding your personal horse or a shared barn horse, you need to treat all animals with the respect that they deserve. Keep calm when working with them and never act out of violence. Count to five if you get frustrated and try the same action once again.


Take note of the physical strength and size of a horse as well. They can hurt you without even meaning to if you aren’t careful. For example, when you walk beside a horse, watch the placement of your feet. If a horse steps on your foot it can lead to bruises and even fractures., Some local horse programs offer formal apprenticeship programs. However, you can usually arrange your own. Find a trainer or horse professional who you admire and feel comfortable working with. Tell them about your interests and ask them to teach you everything that they know. In return, offer to help them care for the horses.When you are a more experienced equestrian, make sure that you return this favor by accepting apprentices yourself. Or, even less formally, act like a mentor to younger riders.

Stay in shape.,
Get access to a horse.,
Choose a type of riding.,
Wear the right equipment.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Learn from other equestrians.",How to Be an Equestrian2," Although you hold the reins in your hands, you control your horse by moving your core body. Start incorporating core-strengthening exercises, such as the wood-chopper and plank, into your regular routine. You will be able to ride longer with fewer sore muscles as a result.Remember that riding a horse is excellent exercise, but does not include weight resistance. So, it may help you to develop muscles, but will not build bone density.If you want an exercise boost, muck out a stall. It provides both cardio and weight resistance.

, Spending time caring for a horse and working on your riding skills is a necessary part of becoming an equestrian. If you have the resources, you can always purchase your own horse and pay to stable it nearby. If you do not own a horse, go online and search your location along with “barns” “stables” “horseback riding” and “equestrian clubs.” Find a location that fits your price range and schedule and go on a visit.To get real results you will need to spend time with horses on a regular basis, more than just once a week. Schedule “horse time” into your calendar and be consistent in attending.
Some riding locations will allow you to spend time with different horses each week while others will encourage you to stick with the same horse. Ask about the policies before you commit.
Select equestrian programs at the college level will provide access to a stable of pre-selected horses. If you are interested in joining a collegiate equestrian team, look into this option.

, Eighteen styles of riding are currently regulated by the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF).You can focus on western style reining (executing precision loops with your reins while horseback) or even vaulting (holding on to a modified saddle while performing gymnastic moves) or countless other options. Ask your mentors and peers for information, watch equestrian events, and read all that you can about the various sports.The standard Olympic equestrian events are: dressage, show jumping, and eventing. Dressage is essentially dancing in sync with your horse. Show jumping involves a horse and rider jumping over various obstacles on a course. And eventing is a combination sport requiring endurance and jumping on untamed terrain.Western style riding requires that the horse and rider navigate a variety of obstacles and demonstrate proficiency in corralling.Western dressage riding places an emphasis on a smooth gait and clear communication between horse and rider.Western reining is judged on control during the demonstration of reining patterns.Other styles of riding include hunter, which mimics the process of a hunter pursuing prey on horseback, and English pleasure style, which places an emphasis on smooth transitions. You can even focus on carriage pleasure driving, which takes into account a driver’s skill in managing a team or single horse., Many of your equipment choices will coincide with your sport. Take equipment recommendations from your mentor or other equestrians. If you plan to participate in competitions, make sure to read the guidelines carefully or you could face disqualification or point penalties.


Remember to invest in a quality helmet. It needs certifications from both the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI).If you choose to ride competitively and/or often, it is also a good idea to buy a body protector. You wear this vest over your torso and it helps to absorb the energy from a fall or kick. Many different models are available online.You will also want to wear some sort of leather shoe, preferably with a small heel. Riding boots are standard for many equestrian sports, although western riders often go with cowboy boots.You can purchase riding gloves online or at a local tack shop. Gloves are especially useful in the winter and are also required for some equestrian sports.Here is an example of sport-specific dress: General Western style riders prefer leather chaps, cowboy hats, and brightly colored western-themed shirts. Western dressage riders often wear themed-riding jackets as well. In addition to the above, Western reining riders must wear a collared shirt and necktie.For safety reasons, try to remove most of your jewelry. If your hair is long, tie it back and secure it under your helmet., As often as you can, get out with a horse and practice your intended sport. Do repetitions of the same action so that it becomes second nature for you both. Look for weaknesses and target those areas in particular. For example, some barrel horses don’t like turning left, so it is all the more important to practice that direction.


It is best to practice at least once a week with a trainer who has experience in your specific sport. If you belong to an equestrian team, it is possible that you will have group lessons as well as individual ones.In addition to working out with a trainer, you should practice at least 2-3 times a week on your own. This is yet another reason to choose a stable near your home.

, Go to equestrian competitions and cheer for your peers. Go the barns afterwards and talk with the riders and their helpers. If you are unable to travel to competitions, watch them on TV or stream them live online."

Do what you enjoy the most.,
Acknowledge the time requirements.,
Consider your personal finances.,
Pursue advanced training.,
Enjoy the equestrian lifestyle.",How to Be an Equestrian3," Sit down and do some serious thinking about what you like about horses. Do you enjoy a particular sport? Or, do you find the most happiness out of training horses? Perhaps you really like treating horses for illness? Not all equestrians are the same and you don’t have to compete to be an equestrian. Equestrians love horses and live a horse-centered lifestyle.


If you are considering a competition sport, you will want to think about whether or not you should stay amateur long-term or transition to a professional at some point. Seek the advice of other trusted equestrians as you make this decision.

, Horses require a great deal of care. They will interrupt your daily schedule and will demand attention even on holidays. Look over your daily calendar and consider realistically how much time you have to devote to an equestrian lifestyle.This is an especially important to consider if you are thinking about becoming a horse owner. Horses are social creatures and don’t do well cooped up in a stall without visits for long periods of time. This can seriously damage your relationship with your horse and may even put you in danger while riding.

, Evaluate what monies you have available to devote to your equestrian pursuits. Being an equestrian can be quite expensive, depending on your specific interests, so you want to be realistic early on. For example, certain sports such as dressage require advanced training that can be rather costly.


If you are on a limited budget, all is not lost. Look for an riding center that provides long-term or group discounts. You can also offer to work part-time at a facility in order to get additional horse contact hours.

, If you decide to become a professional equestrian, whether you take a competition track or decide to be a trainer, you will most likely need to pursue a degree in equestrian studies. Many schools over both associates and bachelor degrees in equestrian fields. You can gain even more experience by participating in a school’s riding club., Every time that you are around a horse do a quick internal reminder that you are here because it makes you happy. You may face difficult moments, but stay grounded in your love for horses and horse culture. This will help you to continue to make the best decisions for you and the horses that you work with.

Ride the horse.,
Try on the right.",How to Train a Horse to Turn,", You want something that isn't too big, but not a stall, so you have some room to work., You want to mimic that you're riding the horse as much as you can before actually getting on., Grab the rein about a foot away from the buckle and pull your hand back to the horse's left shoulder. It should be taut and your horse should have it's head turned at a right angle to its body (or close)., Push on the shoulder until the horse is facing the same direction as his head, letting the rein go as you push the shoulder. Encourage and do not restrict your horse from moving. If you teach your horse from the beginning to move forward out of a corner or turn it will benefit your later riding., Each time, try pushing less on the shoulder. You can reward a horse for turning only with the cue of the rein by giving it a small treat like a carrot or peppermint. If your horse seems to be getting frustrated or you are starting to get board or frustrated yourself, try taking a break for a couple hours or even a day. Usually, this is not a one day process, so expect to take a break., If your horse seems to be doing well on the ground, mount the horse (it's easier bareback if your horse needs help, but if your not comfortable doing that, use a saddle). Pull the rein like the cue you taught the horse and if your horse needs a little help, use your boot to push on the left shoulder., Some horses will pick it up well the other directions, but it's possible that you will need to reteach the turn completely."

, Send good and happy messages to your horse.


Try sitting on the ground a good distance from your horse and wait for him or her to come over to you.

, In particular, talk in your ""happy voice"". Horses can sense human emotions and recognize how humans feel by viewing the body language. This is why it's so important to always angle yourself so as to avoid giving the impression of predatory behavior.

,, This doesn't mean using a whip or yelling when your horse does something wrong. It means using a firm voice to say ""no"" and asking the horse to try again.

, The horse needs to understand such commands as: Come here, stop, turn away, and focus. Most importantly, the horse needs to understand how to move his or her feet on command.

, Instead, interact in other fruitful ways. At all times, make sure your horse is comfortable before you try new things, as it can be very scary for the horse.

, This is fun for the horse and can be a nice mix of from the usual routine. Some fun tricks include: kiss, paw, bow, smile, etc.


Always start with small tricks. Don't attempt harder tricks until you are positive that the horse can handle it and has absolute trust in you.

,


Don't force the horse to walk but don't let the horse not do it.
Bring treats as a reward, but don't make it so the horse is working for treats. This means using them sparingly, if at all.

, It may take time to get to this point so just keep working and the horse will learn. Just work at a walk, so you are not throwing too many things at the horse at once.

, Just do light riding and learn how to feel and move with your horse. Riding bareback is a physical connection for the rider and horse.

, You could even try trotting and cantering with him. After you have been doing liberty with you horse for a year or more, it's likely that you'll both be comfortable playing tag and chasing each other around!

, There is no certain point in which your horse is at liberty with you. Similar to many religions, this is a spiritual level. Your horse needs to be at one with you.

, You can never be fully finished working with your horse. There are always new possibilities.

, The whole goal here is to achieve a strong bond with your horse; the goal is not to worry what other people think about it. This is about growing a spiritual, physical, and mental connection with your horse.


You need to understand that you won't ever be doing this the wrong way; it is your decision and there is no strict way to do it.

Repetition is the key.,
Congratulations!",How to Train a Horse to Saddle," Start with a lead rope that is about 14' long. If you can't find one of these, go ahead and make one. It's very simple to. All you need to do is go to your local Tractor Supply Co. and get the necessary materials, such as a rope cut to the right length, a large clasp, which should be able to fit around your rope when it's folded in two (brass or aluminum will do, but brass is the stronger of the two), and a snap. Just slip the snap on at the end, put the two pieces of rope together, put the clasp on and pound it down with a hammer. Voila! Your very own lead rope.;
, Take the lead rope and begin swinging it very gently towards your horses feet. Let it wrap around them so as to desensitize them to the feeling. Gradually work your way up to their back, letting it wrap around the side. It is best to train your horse in a round pen, but a smaller enclosed area like a paddock will also do. Continue this exercise for a couple of days, alternating with lunging. This will create a cycle for the horse: Sensitizing, and then desensitizing.

, After a few days, switch to a whip with a long tassel at the end. This will create noise that most horses do not like. Repeat the same things that you did in step two.

, Your lunging and desensitizing work may have paid off, depending on how long you have spent training your horse to do so. It has been at least two weeks, and now you are ready for the next part in this. Tie your horse in a quick release knot to the side of the roundpen. Your horse should be comfortable with the whip and the lead rope. Thrust your saddle blanket to the very side of your horse, not even on it's back. Rub the blanket around the side, on the buttocks, down the legs (carefully), and near the neck. Continue this for a few more days.

, Now gradually begin edging the blanket higher and higher towards his back, but then take it off. Continue the swinging and throwing motion, and take it off. You should get to the apex of his spine, but again, take it off. This should be done for a couple of days, as well.

, Finally, you should be able to leave the blanket up there for short periods of time. If the horse gives you any lip, smack him lightly. Never use lunging as a punishment the horse will associate a work out with a punishment and that will cause problems later.

, Mr. Ed should be comfortable after all of this to have the blanket put on him anywhere -- from cross-ties to the middle of the pasture -- for a longer length of time. Taking him to an enclosed area (not the cross-ties, though), slip the rope over the side of the roundpen, but DO NOT TIE IT, in any way, shape, or form. If he has not been comfortable with the saddle in the past, he won't be right now, either. He'll just be more used to having things on his back. Take the saddle and do the same things you did with the saddle blanket. Slowly rub it along his side, then work upwards, once more. Gently rest it on his spine, in the normal position behind his withers. If he does anything questionable, get out of the way immediately. Stay out of his way. Continue this same exercise, until you get it set up on him.

, Keep at it, but don't do the cinch just yet. That's a whole different story. Separately, aside from training him to tolerate the saddle on his back, you will need him to accept the cinch. To do this, you must have your 14' lead rope, once again. Swing it on his back, around his hooves, and especially underneath the girth. Mr. Ed should already be acquainted with the lead rope, so this should be no sweat.

, Rest the long rope over his back, around where the cinch and girth should be. Carefully grab it from underneath, and wrap it up to meet so you have, in essence, tied a loop around your horse. Gradually tighten it, but not too tight, at first. Each time you do this, increase the tightness.

, Now back to the saddle. Once your horse is comfortable with the saddle atop his back, and the rope around his girth, bring the SADDLE'S girth around, just like you were with the rope. Take your cinch, and tighten it to the lowest setting. Do this quickly, but gently, then lunge. Mr. Ed may buck, kick, or flail around, so be careful while lunging. Once he is comfortable at a trot with it, make him face you, and praise him.

, Everyday from now until YOU are comfortable, repeat this last exercise. Praise him every time. Tighten the cinch every time, as well, until the saddle would securely stay up on his back and still hold a person up there. As soon as you feel the most comfortable, make sure that you go straight to the next step of mounting, so as he doesn't forget anything he's learned.

, You have successfully trained your horse to hold a saddle.

Train your horse to do a half-halt.A half-halt is a horseriding maneuver that briefly slows your horse’s pace and prepares it to make a new movement or change in speed.Teaching your horse to half-halt requires using the saddle, your legs, and hands.Squeeze the reins gently a few times.,
Train your horse to recognize cautionary cues.Walk your horse around its pen and slow it down while saying, “Hold,” “Easy,” or another verbal cue.,
Start your horse out young.The best way to train a horse to cross water is to get it used to the feel of wading into water when it’s young.,
Help your horse conquer its fear.",How to Train a Horse to Walk Through Water1," This will alert your horse to pay attention to you.
Once your horse begins to slow, add another cue. Keep your upper body rigid, tall, and motionless. Let your weight settle into your legs.
Use your legs to give your horse a light squeeze around its sides. Hold your legs in this slight squeeze for two or three paces before giving your horse its next command.
If your horse isn’t responding to your cues, try the half-halt again a few steps later. A successful half-halt results in an alteration of your horse’s gait.;
, Repeat your verbal cue of choice every time you slow your horse. This way, your horse will come to associate the word you selected with the action of slowing down and moving more cautiously.

, By the time the horse is an adult, walking through water will be second nature to the horse.


A foal cannot, obviously, cross water at the same depth that a larger adult horse can. Train young horses in a wide puddle of only a few inches deep.
This early training will build up the horse’s confidence and make it comfortable with being in the water.
Gradually increase the amount of water the horse trains in.

, If your horse is truly uncomfortable with water, walk it and train it near a garden hose. After your horse can adequately perform all your commands near the garden hose, turn the hose on, allowing just a trickle to come out. Continue training near the garden hose, slowly increasing the flow of water from the hose over time.Once the water is coming out of the hose at its maximum rate, expose your horse to more direct sources of water such as a sprinkler system. Start training your horse at a distance from the sprinkler that the horse is comfortable with, and gradually move your horse toward the sprinkler during training sessions.
Teach the horse that water is fun. Lead your horse into deeper water, especially on hot summer days. Many horses enjoy splashing and playing in pools and rivers.
When your horse has a positive association with water, getting it to walk through water will be easy.

Pay attention to the horse.,
Deal with problems.,
Help him relax.",How to Train a Horse to Lead," If you are teaching a young horse or foal to lead for the first time, you must first teach it to wear a halter. The halter (sometimes known as the headcollar) is the harness that you will place over the horse’s head, around the muzzle and up over the poll and ears. You can buy these at any horse supply or tack store, or you can always find one online.Make sure you buy a soft halter, since hard poor quality nylon will rub and can cause sores on your horse’s sensitive skin.
Remember, thin hard rope can be more severe than thick soft rope.;
, If your horse or foal is not halter broken, you should spend some time getting him used to the halter before you put it on. If you have a young foal, you should get it used to people as soon as possible. Do this gradually. Start rubbing around the face and head to get it used to being touched and handled where the halter will go.


Once the foal is happily accepting you touching its head, start rubbing the halter over its face and body and let it sniff it so it becomes comfortable with the new object.
It is common to place a halter on a foal when it is just a few days old.
Make sure that the halter is a good fit, and is not loose enough to snag or catch on anything., Once you have built a relationship with your horse and he is comfortable with you touching his head, and has gotten used to the sight, feel and smell of the halter, you can try to put it on. When you’re both ready, gently slide the halter over his nose and onto his head. Fasten it on the side of the head, behind his ears. This can be tricky, so be patient and gentle at all times.


Don’t get angry if he is awkward. Don’t shout or hit him as you will only cause him to associate haltering with negativity.
Always try to end each training session with some success. If you can’t get him to wear it completely, make sure you get it over his nose, or one ear, before you finish., Once your horse is comfortable in the halter, you can begin training him to lead. First of all you need to attach a lead line to the halter. Standing on the left hand side of your horse, take the line in your right hand and hold it a foot or two away from his chin. Take hold of the remaining line in your left hand.


You can fold the line in your left hand, but never wrap or tie it around your hand or wrist.If he balks, or just has a sudden head movement, and you have no give in the line it could injure either or both of you.

, Make sure you are standing at the horse’s shoulder and facing in the same direction as him. Start by holding the lead rope under your horse’s chin, and then gently apply forward pressure. Keep the pressure consistent until he make a forward movement. As soon as he steps forward, release the pressure completely. Repeat this again and again until he moves as soon as you apply forward pressure.


If you are applying pressure on the line and he moves his head up, or even steps back, maintain a consistent pressure until he moves forward.Just taking one step forward is good for the first lesson.
If you are working with a young foal, 15 minutes is long enough for these first lessons., As you have established that standing next to your horse and looking in the same direction indicates that you want to move forward, you can use your body position as a cue to halt. Turn to face your horse, and give an audio cue. Say something like “halt,” “stop,” “whoa,” or “stand.” Don’t pull back on the lead line when you stop, but do apply a little resistance pressure., Standing alongside your horse, bring the lead line down so it is directly beneath his chin. Then apply some gentle but consistent pressure on the line until he responds by making a backwards movement. The moment he shifts his weight back, release the pressure on the line. Wait a few seconds, and then repeat this again and again.


If he moves in a different direction or becomes excitable, keep calm, don’t react, and maintain steady gentle pressure on the line., You can train him to recognise cues to turn left and right in a similar way to the cues for forwards and back. Stand on the left of him and apply gentle consistent pressure to the line until he moves in the desired direction. Immediately release the pressure when he does, then wait and repeat. You can do this on the right hand side in much the same way. Just stand on the right and apply pressure to the lead line.Repeat these training exercises again and again, until he responds quickly and correctly every time.
Remember to be patient and gentle at all times, and reward him for good work., When you are ready to lead your horse, you can do it from the lead position, or from the partner position. The lead position requires you to stand to the side and ahead of your horse. You walk ahead of him, and this helps to define your personal space, which you decide when he can and cannot enter.Hold the line in your hand and allow some slack so you can move along together comfortably.
You can try to time your steps in line with your horse’s stride so he sees that you are matching strides and that is part of the game., To lead from the partner position, you have to walk near the horse’s shoulder. The horse will learn to stay close to you, whether walking, trotting, or standing still. In this position, you will be leading and driving the horse at the same time. Generally you would only do this once you have mastered leading from lead position and have good understanding and relationship with your horse.


You can lead from the partner position on either side of your horse, left or right.
In the partner position your horse is in your space and you should be able to pull him back from you at all times., When you are leading a horse, it’s vital that you pay close attention to him and the environment. You want to be able to spot any potential problems before they occur. If you see something that might frighten the horse or prompt him to run, be ready to react. If he starts to run, turn him in a narrowing circle until he stops.


Do this by drawing him in one direction with the lead line, and then leading him round in a circle. You can start with a larger circle and then tighten it.Don’t punish him for reacting or being scared.
Allow him time to explore new environments, and spend time desensitizing him if he has particular problems., Sometimes when you are leading a horse, he might get startled and start moving around side to side, or even balking and rearing up. This can be a scary experience so it’s important that you stay calm and know how to react. Don’t pull back on the line, as this will only make him feel more trapped. Give him all the line to rear up he needs.


The safest place to be is close enough to the horse that it can’t get any room to swing his legs and kick you.
If you are within range move close to his shoulder, and you can even grab his mane if necessary.
Don’t punish a horse for rearing, instead just interrupt them with clear instructions and carry on., If you notice that you horse is anxious when you are leading him, there are things you can do to help calm and relax him. If he holds his head up, and his ears are pointing up, this indicates that he is not relaxed and may be distracted. You can help him relax by teaching him to lower his head on cue. Lowering his head will release and loosen his spine and reduce any anxiety.


You can teach him to lower his head on cue, by standing alongside him and holding his lead line about two inches from where it is attached to the halter.
Apply gentle consistent pressure down. Make sure you apply pressure straight down so he does not think you are asking him to move forwards or back.
Hold consistent gentle pressure until he makes a downwards movement with his head. Even a very small movement should prompt a release.
Repeat this over and over and reward him for good work.
Once you have trained him to do this you can get him to lower his head when you lead him to help him relax."

Training is a long process, and should not be taken on by the faint of heart. If you are determined to train your horse but may not have many years of experience or have never done training before, look into hiring a professional trainer part-time or getting frequent advice from a friend with more experience.;
,, For successful training to occur you have to show your horse that you are trustworthy and that you have their best interests in mind. Do what is best for YOUR HORSE- each horse is different and may need a different approach. Leading is different than bossing, though. When you step into training, make sure you give clear, strong signals without being aggressive or abusive. Your goals as a leader should be:


Be assertive but not aggressive.
Work with a slow yet steady pace to build trust.
Keep the horse’s safety (physically and mentally) in mind at all times.
Keep confident and calm.

, Even the best trainers still have a mental lesson plan in mind. Keep yourself organized with a step-by-step training schedule. Break down tasks into small goals, and gradually work through them. Each thing in your schedule should be building on things you’ve already trained, so that your horse is constantly having your training reinforced.


Stick to your training schedule. It is okay to take longer than you originally thought was necessary to teach something, but not to leave large gaps of time between training sessions.
Get detailed with your schedule. Rather than starting ‘train groundwork,’ break it down into segments like ‘practice backing away from handler’ or ‘train to turn on the forehand.’, You won’t be able to properly train a horse if you aren’t consistent with your teaching system. As with all creatures, positive reinforcement is more ideal than negative reinforcement. However, sometimes a horse will require you to be very assertive before doing what you ask.


Immediately reward the horse once he accomplishes what you asked him to do. This includes an immediate release of the pressure used to cue the horse and sometimes verbal praise.

Don’t reward your horse with treats, as this can cause them to become expectant and bite-prone over time. Treats can be given occasionally, but should be reserved for one-on-one time outside of training.


Discipline the horse if he intentionally disobeys with a weak excuse. Understand that horses always have a reason for their actions, and quite often are only trying to communicate that there's a problem, they're in pain, or they're trying to tell you something.

Discipline should occur in the form a horse understands - the way a leading horse in its herd would ‘punish’ it for misbehaving. Assert your dominance by making the horse move either away or toward you, or by making the horse back or turn. Mix it up so the horse won't start expecting your decisions.
Never punish a horse by beating or whipping it. As a trainer, you need to show your power without jeopardizing the mental and physical health of your horse.



, Much of caring for a horse involves physical touch, and it isn't a good idea to start training a horse you can't take care of if he gets hurt.

, When you begin working with a horse, you want to be able to touch their head. Start by petting the neck or shoulder and work your way toward the head. If the horse gets nervous, just keep talking to them and keep touching that spot until they relax. Then praise them by returning to a less scary area.


Move slowly. Horses can scare from quick, unpredictable movements as a result of being prey animals and may become anxious if you move to suddenly.
If your horse becomes tense or anxious when you get to a certain part of their face, stop your hand and hold it there for a second. Reward them by moving your hand to a more comfortable place. Continue this a few more times, holding your hand in the nervous area for a little longer each time.
Don't remove your hand from his face if they spook or become anxious. By removing your hand you are reinforcing their his that your hand is dangerous/frightening and is something they should be scared of.
Continue this process a little each day until your horse doesn’t react in a bad way to you touching his face, even without leading up to it by touching their neck or body., When you are leading your horse, the ideal position is for you to be parallel to their face. Too far ahead of them and you are pulling and don’t have their attention, and if they’re ahead of you then you’re clearly the one not in control. Use a crop or whip to act as an extension of your arm, and therefore power/energy. Begin walking with them, pushing them away if they start crowding or drawing them nearer to you if they are keeping too much distance.


Hold the crop in front of the horse's chest to prevent him from walking too far ahead of you, and wave it towards their hindquarters to speed them up if they are too far behind.
When they begin walking next to you, drop the crop. If they begin to speed up or slow down, pick the crop up again and repeat the above process of slowing them from the front or speeding them up from behind.
Do this until they consistently walk next to you, even without use of the crop., A horse that doesn’t stop on cue is a horse that doesn’t think you’re the leader. Walk next to your horse (using the techniques described above) and stop after a few feet. If your horse does not stop with you, repeat the process but next time turn to face them, which blocks their forward movement, as you stop. If your horse still doesn’t stop, repeat the aforementioned but stick a crop out in front of their chest as you turn towards them.


Do not take any additional steps once you’ve made the decision to stop. If your horse continues and you take any steps forward, it will think it can control you and won’t listen to your ‘stop’ cues.
Condition your horse to stop to the word ‘woah’ by saying it at the same time you stop., Backing up is one of the basic movements required of a well-trained horse. Take your horse into an open area, equipped with a lead rope and halter. You will need to use a crop for this process. Start by holding the lead rope directly in front of them, about four feet from the tie on the halter. Focus first on getting their attention; they should be looking ahead at you with one ear turned towards you.


Tap the lead rope with the crop and say ‘back’ firmly (not aggressively). Wait for the horse to back up.
If your horse does not back up, repeat the process but tap the lead rope a bit stronger. Continue adding pressure with your taps; if your horse still does not respond tap them strongly on the nose or chest with the crop while saying ‘back’ firmly.
When your horse backs, release pressure by stepping back a few feet and dropping your eye contact. Then, step forward and pet them while praising them.
Train this into habit by repeating all of the above steps., Longeing does several things - it gets the horse focused on you and your cues, it releases excess energy and adrenaline, and it strengthens conditioned cues. Start longeing by putting your horse on a 20’ longe line, and having them walk in a circle around you. After a few minutes, speed them up into a trot by simultaneously making a clucking noise and swinging the end of the longe line towards their hindquarters.


If they don’t respond, cluck and add pressure by running towards their hind quarters.
If your horse still is not responding, you can wave a crop at them towards their tail. The crop will act as an extension of your arm and cue them into going faster.
To get your horse into a canter, repeat the process but make a kissing noise instead of a clucking noise. This will allow you to cue the two different gaits from horseback later on.

, Put your newly-trained ‘woah’ to use and train your horse to stop while longeing. While they’re moving, take a few steps towards where they’re going, blocking off their path (without actually putting yourself in their path). As you do this, slowly say ‘woah’.


If the horse doesn’t stop, shorten the longe line and repeat the process. You can jiggle the rope as you do it as well, getting more aggressive with it until the horse responds.
When the horse stops, lower eye contact and step towards them to pet them. Give them words of praise as you do this so that they know they did what they were supposed to.

, Get your horse to switch directions while longeing without stopping. As they are moving in one direction, take a few steps towards their shoulder to cut them off (as you do when telling them to stop). At the same time, swing the end of the longe line in a spiral motion in front of their path. This sends energy to block them but tells them to keep moving, so they should turn around.


If they don’t turn immediately, take a few half-jog steps towards them in front of their path, while spiraling the longe line. Back away to release pressure once they turn.
Cluck as you do this to keep them in motion., Get the horse used to having reins around its neck and you pulling back on its face by using the lead rope on the halter. Take your horse into a round-pen, and have it stand still. Hold the lead rope a few feet from the halter, and then fling the end onto the horse’s back. Wiggle it around and move it all up and down their neck.


If the horse gets anxious or spooks, don’t let it run off and don’t remove the rope. Instead, continue moving the rope around their back until they calm down and stop moving. Then remove the rope.
Do this on both sides of the horse, dragging the rope over their face as well. The idea is to get them completely desensitized to a rope or reins being on them and moved around frequently.

, Desensitize your horse to having ‘scary’ things moved around it through a process called ‘sacking down’ Use a long crop or stick, and attach a plastic sack to the end. Wave it in the air around the horse; they will likely spook or become anxious. When they get scared, continue with the motion of the sack until they realize it’s not dangerous and calm down. Then remove the bag and crop, and pet them while praising them.


Continue this process until you’re rubbing the plastic bag all over the horse. Remember never to remove the bag while they’re scared, only ever take it away while they’re calm.
Substitute the sack for other items that might make a lot of noise or seem frightening. A black windbreaker jacket, for example, is a scary item to have behind many green horses.

, After several days of sacking down, prepare your horse for riding by getting them used to you around/on their body. Get close to the horse and jump around, flail your arms, and do any activity that might seem strange or cause your horse to spook. As with the other methods of desensitization, don’t stop doing these things when your horse spooks; only stop when they recognize that you are no threat and calm down.


Rub the horse’s body quickly and move around them fast so that they don’t become bothered as much by quick movements.
As your horse becomes comfortable with all your movements, lean over their back on your stomach. You are preparing them for riding by adding weight, but doing so in a non-frightening way.

, Starting a horse under saddle must be done in steps, starting with the most basic piece of tack: a saddle blanket. Keep your horse in an open area, a round pen or an arena work well, and bring the saddle pad in. Allow them to see it and smell it, and then lift it onto their back. Pat it and slide it around a bit to make sure they’re comfortable with it around them.


Walk them around with the saddle pad on. Because there is nothing holding the blanket down, it is important not to let the horse go faster than a walk so that it doesn’t fall off and spook them.

, The next step is to put on a surcingle; a type of bare-back riding gear that consists of a girth that wraps all the way around with a handle-like horn. This gives the feeling of the saddle without all the weight and bulk. When the surcingle is on the horse, walk them around a bit on a longe line. After a few minutes, cue them into a trot and canter.


Longe them with a surcingle several times over a week or two before moving onto a saddle to make sure the horse is really comfortable with having something tied to its back.

, Choose a lightweight english saddle to start your horse under. This will be less frightening and heavy on their unconditioned back. Allow the horse to see it and smell it, and then slowly lift it onto its back. Set it down softly, and gauge your horse’s reaction. You can then tighten the girth, and walk the horse around.


Take the saddle off after a bit, and then repeat the process. Put the saddle on from both sides of the horse so they get used to you walking around them with it.
Longe them with the saddle on after a few days of simply putting it on and walking around with it., Never jump into starting a horse with a bit; instead, use a bitless bridle to get them used to having something a bit different than a halter on their face. You can put it on over their halter to start, or leave it as the only thing on. Walk them around with the bitless bridle on, and if you have the halter on as well you can longe them with the bridle on.

, When you’re sure your horse is comfortable with a bitless bridle, try introducing them to the bit. Use a gentle bit, typically a broken snaffle, and ease it into their mouth by tickling their gums. Allow them to just hold it for a while, and then take the bridle off. Do this on a daily basis before every applying pressure to the bit; just allow the horse to get used to having something in its mouth.


Bitting a horse can take some time, so don’t ever rush it. If you have to stand there for 30 minutes trying to get your horse to take the bit, then do it. Patience is vital to getting the horse used to the bit, as this is the most potentially dangerous aspect of starting a horse under saddle.
When the horse has worn the bit for several days, you can begin using the reins to give it directions via the bit. However, do not longe the horse with a bit in its mouth as this risks damage and can be unsafe.

, Finally, put all the tack on the horse at once. Do this slowly and simply walk them around with it on at first; don’t rush them. Use a bitless bridle to lunge them with everything on, or lead them around at a walk and trot with a bit.


This should be done once a day for several days before any mounting or riding is attempted.
You can continue using the Jeffery method of desensitizing with the tack on so the horse gets used to the idea of you possibly mounting them.

Prepare the tarp for the horse.,
Lead the horse onto the tarp.Stand on one side of the horse.,
Trade the tarp with actual water.Once your horse can comfortably walk across the tarp with two cones on each side, remove the tarp and bring the horse to a large shallow body of water about three feet (one meter) deep.,
Start small.Before riding through water of any significant depth or distance, you should walk your horse through lots of shallow water.",How to Train a Horse to Walk Through Water2," Using a tarp to train horses to cross the water is simple and painless.The tarp will imitate the surface that the horse will encounter when walking through water. Lay a 6’ x 6’ (2 meters x 2 meters) tarp on the ground. Place an orange traffic cone on each corner.


Walk across it several times so your horse can see that it is a safe and secure surface.
The traffic cones are designed to keep your horse moving in a straight path over the tarp. Some trainers use a wooden rail instead.If you use a wooden rail to guide your horse, ensure it can be later moved and assembled easily at a site of actual water.
This method can be used with a horse of any age, but is most appropriate for older horses who have not had much exposure to water.

, Holding your horse’s reins in one hand, slowly lead your horse across the tarp. This will help the horse learn to trust you and build up its own confidence.


Don’t stand in front of the horse, or it will think that the goal of the exercise is to come toward you.
Let your horse sniff and explore the tarp before it walks across.
Train your horse barefoot on the tarp. If your horse is shod, its horseshoe might catch on the tarp, and cause the horse to panic.

, Place two cones in front of the water. Guide your horse into the water while standing at one side.


Over time, you can gradually expose your horse to deeper waters, up to a level that reaches the middle of its chest.
If your horse is hesitant to jump in water even one meter high, start out with a wide puddle just a few inches deep. Work your way up from there.

, Water that is even just a few inches deep can help acclimate a horse to the process of walking through water. Walk your horse through shallow water, then trot it back through again. Repeat frequently to build your horse’s confidence.

"
"
Let your horse relax around the water.When your horse first enters the water, it might snort and show general reluctance to jump in.,
Ease your horse forward.,
Be patient with your horse.Doing so will only lead to accidents and injury for your and your horse.,
Guide your horse cautiously.If you can see through the water, keep your horse away from larger, jagged rocks that might trip him up.",How to Train a Horse to Walk Through Water3," It might get in and out of the water a few times before it’s ready to make the crossing.


Let your horse take a few minutes to drink if it chooses to. This will show the horse that water is a friend, not something to be feared.
Your horse might also left and right along the length of the river or lake before it jumps in.
Sometimes it helps to have an experienced horse go across a stream first and let your horse follow it.

, Once your horse has acclimated to the presence and feel of the water, begin crossing the stream.Give your horse a slight nudging in the side with your legs to get it moving forward. With each step your horse takes toward the water, release the pressure of your legs on the horse’s sides.This will keep it moving in the right direction.


If necessary, dismount and lead your horse through the water, standing at its side just as you would have during the tarp training.However, you must never lead your horse from the front. This is a recipe for disaster. The horse can easily crush you, if it gets anxious or alters its speed.

, Use verbal cues and half-halts to keep you and your horse safe. If your horse feels pressured or scared, he might bolt or make a big, dangerous jump straight into the water.


If your horse is being excessively hesitant, take it for a quick walk around the area. Walk it up and down the shore, or just walk it in a tight loop several times. This will help the horse burn off its nervous energy.
Your horse will indicate its readiness to walk through the water when it lowers its head, blows out through its nostrils, and gently mouths the bit., Support your horse’s head with both reins to keep him from veering off in one direction or another.


If you encounter large slabs of rock, have your horse cross them closer to their middle, not their edges. If your horse steps on a large rock slab’s edge, the rock might wobble.
Your horse will probably have a few slippages on rocky stream beds. When this happens, comfort and reassure your horse by patting its mane and saying things like, “You’re okay,” or “Easy.”

"
"
Use a route with a flat, broad bank.If the bank into or out of the water is steep, crumbling, or strewn with loose rocks and roots, it offers many more risks than a bank that is part of a flat, clear, well-trod route.,
Check the water.,
Cross at the narrowest points of the river or stream.The route will be easier when you choose to cross a body of flowing water that is relatively narrow.",How to Train a Horse to Walk Through Water4," The bank should be easily visible from the shore, free of dense foliage, and composed of sand or dirt.

, The current should not be too strong and the water should not be too deep.Avoid walking your horse through water right after a heavy rain, or during the spring. Know the depth of the water before crossing.


Water that reaches just above your knees is the ideal height for walking a horse through.
Many well-trod horse trails that cross water have a post sticking up out of the water at their deepest point indicating the water’s depth.

, Well-trod paths have usually been selected for repeated use for the very reason that they are the narrowest points in a river for some distance. If you’re forging your own path, however, look for rivers and streams where the banks of each side are closest to each other.


For instance, if you’re crossing a river that is 30 feet (10 meters) wide, but upstream you can cross at a point where the river is only 20 feet (6.6 meters) wide, head upstream to make your crossing.
There are limits to this rule. Water crossings should be at least 10 feet (3 meters) wide.Crossing water of a distance less than that could cause the horse to try to make it across in a single jump.

Understand what the ideal piaffe looks like.,
Consider your horse’s temperament and your experience as a rider.,
Make sure your horse is comfortable with basic dressage movements.,
Do tapping exercises with your horse.,
Use your horse’s reins as aids.,
Have him repeat his back and forth movements using the reins.,
Practice these movements until he starts to piaffe.,
Start by asking your horse to halt.,
Get your horse to trot on the spot.,
Practice diagonal walking on the spot.",How to Teach Your Horse to Piaffe," The ideal piaffe will look like your horse is trotting in place, with only one hoof print landing forward in every step. Your horse should be bent at his haunches, with his pelvis tilted, his back arched, and his front legs lifted. When your horse does a piaffe, he should look like he is doing a rapid trot, with short, active and high steps.He should move through four clear stages or steps to achieve the piaffe. First, he should bend his body from head to tail. Second, he should bend his inside hind leg and put his weight in this leg. Third, he should bend his outside hind leg and put weight in this leg. Fourthly, he should be able to bend both of his hind legs so both legs carry weight.
In a piaffe, your horse’s movements should be high, energetic, and smooth. His mouth should be relaxed and his entire body should be engaged but also calm and fluid as he moves. His front leg should lift until his forearm reaches a horizontal level, and his posture should be constant and even.
As the rider, you should be tall and relaxed as your horse does a piaffe. You should follow the movements of your horse and give him aids very subtly.;
, Teaching your horse to piaffe successfully will require you to use gradual or more accelerated training, based on his temperament. If your horse is energetic and seems comfortable with moving diagonally, you may have an easier time of teaching him how to piaffe. If your horse’s temperament is more calm but he has difficulty moving diagonally, you may need to be more patient and work slowly to teach him how to piaffe.As the rider, you should consider your relationship with your horse. If you are an experienced rider who has taught horses to piaffe before, you may use a method you are comfortable using. But if you are less experienced rider, you may try more than one method when you teach your horse to piaffe.

, Your horse is ready to learn how to piaffe if he is relaxed and calm as you ride him, and if he can halt and trot with ease. He should also be familiar with shoulders-in and half passes and should be able to execute these movements comfortably.Your horse may already know how to do the “school walk” and the “school trot”. If so, he may be able to pick up the piaffe fairly quickly.

, Start by standing on one side of your horse with a good grip on his reins. You will need a horse whip to guide the horse and sugar cubes to reward him when he moves correctly.You want to make your horse more comfortable with lifting his front legs and his hind legs up, one at a time. Do this by using the whip to tap on one of your horse’s legs. This should then signal to him that he needs to lift up the leg you have tapped. When he does this, reward him with a sugar cube.
Continue to practice this, alternating from one hind leg to the other hind leg. Reward him with a sugar cube when he lifts up each leg in succession. Then, alternate from one front leg to the other front leg. Reward him again when he lifts up each leg in succession. This will allow him to get more comfortable with how he should be moving his hind legs and his front legs.
Some horses are uncomfortable with being tapped or touched, especially on their legs. Before you try tapping exercises, make sure your horse is comfortable with being touched with the whip and that you have done some in hand exercises with your horse before where he responded positively.

, In order for your horse to successfully piaffe, you will need to develop certain aids or movements you can perform on him to get him to then move as you would like. Your horse’s reins can act as aids and you can teach him to read the movements of his reins to perform the piaffe. You can also use the whip and the rein to help your horse get more comfortable with the aids.Face the horse’s shoulder with your legs apart and your upper body turned towards the horse’s croup. Hold the left rein with your left hand and hold the right rein in your right hand. You can then hold the whip in your right hand, with the right rein.
Ask your horse for one or two easy halts along the rail. His neck should be flexed and his jaw should be relaxed. Then, ask your horse for one to two backing up steps by vibrating the reins in your left hand towards the back side of the horse.
Once he backs up two steps, reward him with a sugar cube. Then, repeat these movements and reward him after he completes them again correctly.

, Once your horse appears comfortable with moving one to two steps backward, ask him to take one to two steps back and then carry your upper body forward. Loosen your grip on the left rein and the right rein and carefully touch your horse on his inside buttock to move him forward. If he moves forward, reward him.Continue to practice these movements, increasing to two to three steps forward and two to three steps backward. You should be leaning forward as your horse moves forward and leaning backward as your horse moves backward.

, If your horse responds well to rein training, you should try to increase the speed of his movements over time until he makes several strides forward and backward, with his knees lifted high, and does the piaffe.Keep your touches quick and light on his backside, and keep the reins semi taut as you train him to move forward and backward. Your hold on the reins should be confident and smooth so he does not get confused or thrown off as he moves.

, Ease your horse into the movements of the piaffe while you are riding him by beginning with sharp, smooth halts, followed by collect trot departs. You can use the reins as aids to communicate when your horse should halt and when he should trot.After your horse appears comfortable with halting and then collect trotting, you can start to reduce the amount of strides he takes between halts. You can also shorten the duration of the halt.
Note how quickly your horse complies with halting and trotting. If he hesitates or appears confused, you may have moved too fast and need to spend more time halting and trotting with longer strides between halts.
You should also pay attention to how relaxed your horse is and how balanced your horse’s movements are. Your horse should move smoothly and fluidly from a halt to a trot.

, Once your horse seems comfortable with halting and trotting, you can work on getting your horse to trot on the spot. Try to reduce the amount of strides between each halt and trot and also shorten the trot stride. Hold the reins loosely and do not jolt or roughly tug at them, as this can throw off your horse.When your horse starts to move at a slow and relaxed pace, have him slow down for several strides and shorten his trot stride by sitting taller and deeper in the saddle. Try to get your horse to do two to three strides one after the other on the spot and then allow your horse to move forward again. His balance should not shift as he strides and then moves forward.
Reward your horse when he successfully trots on the spot and moves forward with ease and confidence. You should then end the training session and allow your horse to rest.

, Only move on to this final step if your horse can perform an energetic walk that contains a fluid trot and stride. You can then work on moving your horse diagonally on command to create the piaffe. Be light and relaxed in the saddle as you work on this skill with your horse.Ask your horse to move forward and do a fluid short trot and then two to three fluid strides. Allow the horse to move on his own after you ask him and do not pull or tug at the reins.
Reward him when he does this and then let go of the reins and allow the horse to walk on loose reins. This will give him a moment to stretch his neck, as the piaffe requires a balanced body and a straight neck. Continue to practice diagonal walking on the spot until your horse seems comfortable with the movements and is doing the piaffe.
You can also have a helper watch you and your horse move to ensure you are both moving fluidly together. The helper can also help to guide your horse’s hind legs with a long whip by lightly tapping or touching his hind legs as he moves.

Move your horse to an enclosed work area.,
Bring your horse to a halt.,
Apply pressure with your one of your legs.,
Use your reins to control the front of your horse.,
Continue applying leg pressure and using your reins.,
Improve the coordination of your legs and hands.,
Lessen the amount of pressure you apply with your inside leg.,
Improve your balance when sitting on your horse.",How to Teach Your Horse to Turn on the Forehand," After you have mounted your horse, move him to an enclosed area that has an even surface.Turning on the forehand involves a number of leg movements, so your horse will need to be sure of his footing while turning sideways.


After you moved him to the work area, it may be helpful to warm him up for about 20 minutes (e.g., trotting, walking) before starting your training session.;
, Turning on the forehand can be easier to practice when your horse is at a complete stop. To stop his forward movement, apply steady pressure on his reins.His strides will shorten until he stops walking.As you bring your horse to a halt, make sure that you are sitting up straight. This will prevent you from shifting your weight and possibly causing your horse to either keep moving forward or move backward.It can sometimes be helpful to practice turning on the forehand when your horse is parallel to a fence or rail.This would give you a frame of reference to make sure that you are not bending your horse’s neck too much with the reins.If you practice parallel to a fence or rail, your horse’s hind end will turn away from, and his head will turn towards, the fence or rail., This pressure should be placed three to four inches behind your horse’s girth.The leg that applies this pressure is called the ‘inside leg’ and is used to encourage your horse’s sideways movement.Your horse will turn in the direction of your inside leg.The pressure you use should be firm, but not forceful. Turning on the forehand requires your horse to move away from your pressure, but he may instinctually push back against the pressure if it is too forceful.When you apply the pressure, one of your horse’s hind legs will move in front of and across the other hind leg. For example, if you apply pressure with your right leg, your horse’s right hind leg will move in front of and across the left hind leg.Applying pressure with your inside leg will also cause one of your horse’s front legs to move around the other. If you use your right leg as the inside leg, your horse’s left front leg will move around the right front leg, with the right front leg staying still.The leg that is not applying pressure (the ‘outside leg’) should be kept steady so that you can keep your balance on your horse.This leg will also keep your horse from trying to turn too quickly., Having good control of the reins will help you prevent your horse from moving forward. With one hand, you will lift one of the reins up and back to flex your horse’s neck slightly in the direction of the turn.The rein used to flex your horse’s neck is called the ‘inside rein.’For example, if your horse is turning to right, your right rein will flex your horse’s neck to the right.


Flex your horse’s neck with your inside rein until you can see the inside corner of his eye.You will use the rein in your other hand (the ‘outside rein’) for support and to keep your horse from moving forward.Keep the outside rein close to your horse’s neck.Do not use your reins to pull your horse’s head in the direction of the turn.This will cause his turn to be somewhat awkward.
The use of your reins should be coordinated with the use of your legs to facilitate a proper turn on the forehand., To complete the turn on the forehand, you will need to repeatedly apply pressure with your inside leg and flex your horse’s neck in the direction of the turn with your inside rein. Your horse will respond by moving one hind leg across the other and one front leg around the other (depending on the direction of the turn). With each step that he takes, he will move around in a circle a little more.Halt after each step until your horse completes the turn.The turn will be complete when your horse has turned 180 degrees.Give your horse some positive reinforcement (e.g., verbal praise, small treat) when he has completed the turn., If your hands and legs do not work together, your horse will not be able to perform a proper turn on the forehand. For example, if you use your inside rein to flex your horse’s neck too far, your horse will turn in response to that flexion rather than responding to your inside leg’s pressure. He will also not be able to cross one hind leg in front of the other.Using the reins more than your legs may also cause your horse to back up and out of the turn.Using your legs more than your hands may cause your horse to walk in a circle (rather than doing a turn on the forehand), or simply leave the turn., You may think that applying more and more pressure with your inside leg will encourage your horse to turn on the forehand. However, the more pressure you use, the more your horse will want to push back towards the pressure, rather than move away from it.If he is preoccupied with pushing back, then he will not make the proper turn.


Even though a spur may be useful in applying enough pressure, digging in with your spur will likely cause your horse to push back.If you sense that your horse is pushing back, ease up on the pressure that you are applying with your inside leg.
Another option is to work on ground training that will teach him to move away from your pressure., If you are sitting unevenly on your horse’s back, he may move in response to where your body weight is, rather than responding to your leg pressure or use of the reins. In addition, if you are unbalanced, then your horse will have to work harder to maintain his own balance.If he has to make an extra effort to stay balanced, then he will not be able to turn on the forehand properly.


Sitting up straight and staying centered on your horse’s back will evenly distribute your weight, keeping both you and your horse balanced."

Reinforce the pattern.",How to Teach Your Horse to Lunge," The lunge line should be your main method of communication with your horse during lunge training. You'll give your horse subtle direction using the line, just as you would with the reins if you were riding the horse.The lunge line should be approximately 25 to 30 feet (7.6 to 9 meters) long and made of lightweight material. It should also come with a swivel snap, though some come with a chain at the end.Lunge lines are typically made of cotton webbing, nylon, or a blend of both fibers. Some experts recommend cotton for beginners since it is less likely to twist up or slip from your grip.
Some lunge lines come with stops along the strap to help you get a better grip on the line, while others do not. This is largely a matter of personal preference and comfort. If your line doesn’t come with these stops, you can add them yourself after the fact by knotting the line at 1 foot intervals toward the end you hold.
If the lunge line is too short, this will make the circle that the horse is traveling too small and put too much stress on the horse’s ligaments, tendons, and joints, all o which could result in injury.;
, Halters can slip out of place and diminish your control over a horse during lunging.Instead, your horse will need to wear a lunging cavesson while training and exercising on the lunge line. This piece of equipment should have a heavily-padded noseband with a metal ring attached to the top. That ring will be used to attach the lunge line to your horse.Have an equestrian expert size and adjust your horse's lunging cavesson to ensure a proper fit.
A properly fitted cavesson should stay securely fastened and remain in place while still being comfortable to the horse.
Never fit a lunging cavesson over a grackle/figure 8 noseband. This will be tremendously uncomfortable to the horse and it may reduce your control over the animal.

, The role of a lunge whip is to mimic a rider's leg against the horse's body. It is not used to spur the horse's speed, but to gently urge the horse forward or out along the circle.The lunge whip should be approximately six feet (1.8 meters) long and fitted with lashes that measure six to eight feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters) in length.The whip also helps keep distance between you and the horse, maintaining the circumference of the circle. This is for the handler’s safety.

, It’s important to always wear gloves when lunging a horse. This prevents rope burn on your hands if the horse bolts suddenly or runs off spooked. The gloves can be riding gloves or work gloves, just so long as they fit well and don’t interfere with how you hold the lunge line., You may instinctively think that wrapping the lunge line around your hand or wrist will help you maintain a better grip, but such a hold is actually quite dangerous. If the horse panics and takes off, you would be dragged along with it or have your hand or fingers broken by the quickly tightening rope. Instead, it's best to hold the line in such a way that you can maintain control but still let go if necessary.Fold the lunge line back and forth to create a stack of folded line.
Feed the line out from the top of your folded line stack and attach that end to your horse.
Hold the line in the center of the stack and let additional line out as needed. If your horse panics for any reason, let go of the line so you are not dragged.

, Stand in the circle with the lunge line stacked into a folded line and held in one hand. You'll want to stand at the horse's side facing its shoulder. Hold the lead with your hand approximately 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) from the snap., The lunge whip is one of your most important tools. You'll use it to guide your horse as it lunges in and out of the circle. As you train, make sure you tap your horse's shoulder steadily and consistently.Maintain a steady rhythm of one to two taps per second.
If your horse moves its head, keep tapping its shoulder. As soon as your horse learns to move its shoulder instead of its head, immediately stop tapping.
Wait a few seconds, then repeat the whole process until your horse learns to follow your cues.

, As your horse gets comfortable with the process, you can increase the length of the lunge line. This may take several weeks of consistent practice before your horse gets this comfortable and is ready to advance.Hold the line about 10 inches (25 centimeters) from the snap and follow the same procedure.
Keep practicing until your horse becomes fluent at this length.
Don’t ask your horse to go at faster speeds until he is comfortable on a 20 meter circle and can hold this in both directions.

, Your horse has probably been conditioned to always stay with you when it's being led, which can make lunge work confusing for horses at first. Teaching your horse to move around the round pen on its own will help your horse get more comfortable with other steps in the lunging training.The best way to get your horse comfortable and familiar with a round pen is to simply set it loose in the space. This lets your horse to see, smell, and check out all the areas of the round pen, which will make him more relaxed.
Don't hold the reins or strap; simply let it leave your side or return to you as it desires.Try using a verbal command like ""walk."" You can teach a verbal command by giving the cue, encouraging a response to the command, and rewarding the behavior.Once your horse is used to roaming around the pen, get your horse comfortable walking the circumference of the round pen and following your command using a lunge whip.

, Once your horse is comfortable roaming slowly around the round pen on its own, you'll want to work at building your horse's speed. Start out slow and gradually get faster and faster, but make sure you don't sacrifice form for speed.Use a lunge whip to teach your horse to trot outside of the circle around you.
You can also use verbal commands. Say ""trot,"" then tug on the lead while jogging and reward your horse when it responds., The goal is to get your horse to halt in its path without turning to face you. It may take a while for your horse to get comfortable with halting, so be patient and have faith in your animal.Try using your body language to lead the horse back out into the circle. You can also tug on the horse's lunge line to guide it the same way you would tug on the reins.
Whenever your horse turns and faces you, approach the horse and guide it straight back onto the circular path.
If you see your horse start to slow or turn in, you can use your lunge whip lightly at the shoulder to encourage him to stay forward and keep moving.

, Once your horse is comfortable working in a round pen, you're ready to take it to a larger space, like a full-size arena. This can take many weeks of dedicated practice for some horses, so be patient and remain consistent in your practice sessions."

If the horse becomes agitated when tied, have a horse-wise helper hold the horse on a lead rope instead.
Both you and your helper should wear sturdy boots.;
, Don't rush into this. Nuzzle the horse's ears, or give them a treat and talk to them in a low, slow voice. If you stay calm, there is a good chance the horse will too.

, Select a 10 feet (3 meter) rope, preferably one made from thick cotton. Stand in front of the horse and to one side, facing the horse's rear. See how your horse reacts when you lightly and quietly swing the rope to touch one of his front legs. Stand at least a couple feet (0.6m+) back and to one side, since the horse may kick.


The goal of this exercise is to get the horse used to having its legs touched. If your horse has issues with ropes, you may need to desensitize it to the rope first.
Remember, the rope is a gentle extension of your arm. Never use it to hurt the horse or intentionally scare it.

, The horse will typically react by stomping his foot or moving away from the rope. Let it react, then slowly swing the rope again at the same leg. Repeat this motion until the horse starts calming down. It may take several days or even a couple weeks for this to happen.


If your horse over-reacts or panics, your training session is probably too long. Try to end each session on a high note, when the horse has shown improvement and before it gets frustrated.

, When you notice that the horse's reactions decrease, stop touching him for about 30-60 seconds and praise him briefly. This lets him think that he has control over the rope touching him, or that he will get a reward when he stops squirming.

, Repeat the same exercise on the other front leg until you get the same result. Then move on to the hind legs and repeat, one at a time. Be especially careful with the hind legs as they can kick sideways and very quickly. Make sure the horse gets used to being touched around his flanks and high up between his legs.


It may take several days to pass this point, or even longer if the horse has picked up bad habits.

, Once the horse shows no reaction to the rope, gently swing the rope so it curls around the horse's front leg. Again, repeat this exercise until the horse no longer reacts, then repeat for each of the other three legs. Patiently repeat this in daily training sessions until the horse stops showing any reaction.

, When the horse is ready, and not before, let the rope curve around a front leg as usual. This time, retrieve the other end of the rope, taking care not to place your head within kicking distance. Holding both ends of the rope, slowly and gently pull the rope back and forth and drag it up and down the leg. Repeat until the horse no longer responds to the movement.

, Let the rope slide down to just below his fetlock joint and slowly pull forward on the rope, lifting his hoof up off the ground about an inch (2.5cm), then returning it to the ground immediately. Slowly repeat this action until he stops pulling against you. Repeat with the other front foot.


This will teach the horse to balance on three legs, instead of on the back of the person inspecting his hoof! Your vet and farrier will thank you later.
Do not hold the hoof up for more than a moment. The first few times, the horse may lose his balance, pull back his foot, or over-react.

, The process for the two hind legs is mostly the same. However, it requires extra caution, as this area of the horse is more dangerous and more likely to react. Some horses will kick when you bend down out of their vision, or when you try to lift the hoof. Keep a close eye on the nearest hoof and a firm grip on the ropes. Move extra slowly so you and the horse stay comfortable.

, Eventually, you should be able to lift the rear leg without the horse reacting. Start lifting the hoof a little higher each time, but no more than the horse finds comfortable. Do this only for the hind legs.

, Once the horse is desensitized to the rope, it's time to teach it to allow closer handling. Choose a time when the horse is calm and standing still. Spend a few minutes speaking to it in a calm voice, and/or petting its muzzle.

, Stand next to the horse's shoulder, facing the rear of the animal.During this process, bend at the waist and keep your legs only slightly bent. Never sit or kneel on the ground near a horse, or you will be unable to move out of the way if it gets violent.

, Slowly work your hand from the shoulder down the front leg. Pay close attention to the horse's reaction. If the horse makes a noise, moves its legs, or tenses, pause your hand. Once the horse stops moving, resume your slow downward movement. Continue until you reach the lower cannon bone, or further down to the pastern.

, As one of your hands get all the way down to his hoof, use your other hand to press forward onto the back of his knee. This should make the knee buckle forward, so the foot lifts. Praise the horse when it allows its knee to bend.

, Place just the toe on the ground, leaving one hand on the back of his knee. If the horse responds pretty well, try gently lifting the toe off and on the ground to get him used to this motion.

, If the horse doesn't resists when you try to pick up his hoof, hold the leg in this position instead, with just the toe on the ground. Lightly massage the tendons at the back of his leg and fetlock to help him relax. Once you feel the muscles relax, let go and back away. If the horse stays in this position, he's fully relaxed and well on his way to having his feet picked out, worked on, and so on.


If the horse does not relax, slowly unflex the knee and bring the hoof onto the ground. Repeat this raising and lowering motion a few times. Do not drop the hoof abruptly onto the ground. This is fine for some experienced horses, but not beginners.

, Assuming you have been patient and trained the horse well, he should have no reason not to lift his hoof. From now on, you should not give up when the horse resists. Patiently work with the horse until it lifts its hoof. Allowing the horse to ""win"" encourages further disobedience.

, Many horse owners say the word ""hoof"" or a similar command each time they touch the leg. As the horse figures out what you want, it should start cooperating and lift its leg in response.

, The hind legs are more difficult to pick up. Their movements tend to be less fine-tuned and more instinctual, often leading to overreaction. Attempt this only after you've succeeded with the front legs, and use an abundance of caution.

, Stand in a similar position as you did when you lifted the front leg, within easy reach of the hind leg. You should still face the rear of the horse and plan to bend over rather than kneel.

, Show the horse what you are going to do by placing your hand on his back and slowly moving downward. Continue until your hand is on the back of the pastern, just above the hoof.

, You may try to flex the knee forward from behind, as you did with the front leg. This may work if your horse responds well to the rope training, which uses a similar motion. However, if the horse resists, tugging the heavier hind leg can be tough on your back.

, Leaning your shoulder against the horse's haunch can cue him to shift weight onto the far leg. This can make it much easier to lift the leg if the horse responds.

, If the horse still resists, try gently pinching the inside of the hind leg, at the fetlock. There's a nerve here that can reflexively flex the leg. Be very cautious with this method. Pinching too hard can hurt the horse and cause it to kick out instinctively.

, Once the hoof lifts, you can use the same techniques you did for the front hoof. Massaging the leg, holding it so the toe is on the ground, and gently lifting it up and down can all help relax the horse. Over time, the horse should become more comfortable with you or a farrier lifting the hoof to higher positions.

Keep these lessons short and interesting.",How to Train a Horse to Drive," Examples are cars, flags, plastic bags, the cart you plan to use, young children, dogs, and anything else that might one day cross his path. Being traffic-wise is even more important to a driving horse, as places to drive off-road are rare.;
, He will need to get used to having something placed on his back. Be sure to let straps gently touch his legs and get him used to having his tail handled. Treats may be a good reward.

, Even if the horse is broke to ride you should introduce the bridle gently as he will not be used to blinders (solid pieces of leather on a harness bridle that keep the horse from seeing the cart behind him). Most people start with either a snaffle or a solid rubber bit. You may have to spend a while before the horse becomes comfortable with the bit and the blinders.

, If you have done your homework well, your horse should accept the harness with little trouble.

, He should fully understand these commands. If he doesn't, you can grab a lunge whip and as you go from walk to trot drag the whip behind them. If they don't respond to that, you can lightly tap them on the rump with the whip. Do not hit the horse at any time. When you are showing your horse in a show-driving competition, you will have to use a whip as a traditional item. If your horse doesn't stand still, it may be a good time to take the harness off and lunge them in a roundpen while using voice commands as they transition from walk to trot, trot to walk, stopping, etc. Once your horse understands this, then you will be able to move to ground driving.

, During ground driving, you walk behind the horse and teach him to respond to your (gentle) tugs on the reins and voice commands. To do this, have him walk toward a fence, as he prepares to stop, gently pull on both reins and tell him ""whoa"", or gently pull on one rein to encourage him to turn. Most horses get the message fairly quickly.

, He should be especially well-trained to stop at ""whoa"" and to stand perfectly still at ""stand"". Your horse shouldn't turn his head as he is turning, even though this is an indication that he's paying attention to you rather than what's going on outside of his periphery. Blinders can help him focus on looking straight ahead when performing this step.

, Pull it around him so that he can hear the noise it makes and see it moving. Let him smell of it and become completely familiar with it. As your are ground driving, ask someone to pull the cart between you and your horse on both sides and in front of your horse. Put the horse between the shafts (but do not hitch) and lead the horse while one or two helpers walk the cart to keep pace with the horse. You might even let him watch another horse pulling a cart.

, One person will need to hold the horse and comfort him (as well as have control of his head) while you hitch him up. Then lead him while he has the cart hitched to him. Do not get into the cart until you can walk him around without him getting panicky about a cart following so closely behind. Go through your commands with your horse before you feel absolutely certain your horse is ready to be truly driven, with you sitting in the cart has he pulls you and the cart along. You must be absolutely certain that your horse is ready; if you have any doubt, you may compromise the safety of both you and your horse.

, Once you have repeated the previous lesson as many times as necessary, you can step into the cart. Be sure you are wearing a helmet, and always have a friend nearby in case assistance is needed. First time must be slow, at walking pace, and preferably on a flat, level surface such as in a riding arena.

, Now, you can step it up to pleasure drives on back roads. Somewhere safe without much traffic is all you need.

, 15-20 minutes of solid driving is about all a beginning young horse can handle per lesson. Be sure to reward lavishly, and of course, have fun!

You can achieve this by working within the confines of a circular pen. Choose a pen large enough for the horse to lunge in a circle around the trainer but without being so big that the horse can avoid the trainer’s presence.


An alternative to a circular pen is a small arena or school. However, this has the disadvantage of having corners where the horse may retreat and stop moving. Obviously a circle has no corners, so the horse does not have the same incentive to come to rest in a corner.;
, The only equipment the trainer needs is a long lunge line, which the trainer uses to gently tap the horse's back legs. This gives the horse a reason to move forward as he tries to evade the tapping of the line.


The trainer should not use a lunging whip or any other method of incentivizing the horse to go forward. The whip represents a fearful stimulus, which the horse could associate with the trainer. This can ultimately impede the building of trust between the two.

, Another important point to understand is that if the horse does not ""get"" what you are trying to do, then you should stop the session. There is nothing to be gained, and everything to lose by frustrating and confusing the horse. Simply start again another day.


In the meantime, carefully review your gestures, body language, and tone of voice (covered more in Part 2) to improve your technique and correct an inadvertent mixed messages you were sending out.

, Going into it with a nervous or angry attitude is not going to get you anywhere. The Join Up depends on the horse viewing you as the calm at the center of the storm, so you must present a safe and trustworthy person to approach. Take a few deep breaths and make sure the horse knows you're confident and relaxed.


Remember that the horse will almost always mimic you. If you're jumping everywhere and shouting, the horse will respond by running and acting aggressively.
Maintain relaxed body language and don't show fear. If you show fear or hesitation, then the horse will take this as a sign of submission from you, and it will take a lot longer to join up.

, Stand tall but in a non-aggressive, non-confrontational manner. This means making your movements soft and fluid rather than tense and jerky. Keep your hands close to your body.


A horse may take fright at objects perceived as being waved around, so presenting a uniform silhouette poses less of a threat.

, Use a sing-song, happy, calm tone of voice. As soon as you shout or berate the horse, you have broken the Join Up because the horse understands your attitude as well as the tone and timbre of your voice.

, Your aim at this stage is to familiarize the horse with the arena, so the animal can see it holds no surprises. You also want to show the horse you are calm and not a threat.

, The horse might be a little scared or confused. Lead the animal around the safe, enclosed area for a few minutes. Change direction a few times as you lead to set yourself as ""leader.""


You may also want to talk to the horse in a gentle voice as you do this to help calm the animal.

, You want to encourage the horse to move toward the perimeter. To do this, you may need to firmly ""shoo"" the horse away. You do not want to frighten the animal, but merely point out that it needs to be somewhere else, in the same way a mother may send her foal away.


The process of moving the horse away presents you as lead mare.

, You will still have the longline attached to the horse’s halter. As the horse moves away from you, throw the line out behind the animal while keeping hold of the clip. Position the line to the far side of the horse. This will cause the line to trail alongside the animal’s body, behind the tail, and across the hind quarters.Flicking on the long line now has the effect of geeing the horse forward. Encourage the horse to move in a circle around you., Continue to push the horse on gently, working in circles around you. As the horse becomes familiar with what's expected, you will see its body language start to change. The horse may angle its head toward you and twitch the inside ear (the one closest to you) toward you as if awaiting instructions. This is a sign that the horse is ready to negotiate his position and do what you want., You will see the horse angle his head to you, which is a sign he is ready to negotiate his position according to what you want.


After 5 or 6 circuits (if using a 50-foot diameter pen), change direction by blocking the horse using body language, but not actually getting in the way. After another 5 or 6 circuits change direction again, and start to coil the line and maybe drop eye contact down to the neck/shoulder.

, Other signs the horse is paying attention and looking for your guidance include making the circle smaller, turning the inside ear toward you, licking or chewing at the air, and lowering the head perhaps even touching the nose to the ground as if looking for somewhere to graze.The fact that the horse is relaxed but looking to you for instruction means the horse has started to trust you. Now you are both ready to move onto the next phase and test that trust.

, When you see these signs, drop eye contact completely and soften your body language. Try bringing the hand nearest the horse across your stomach with fingers closed. Turn your back and take a few steps away from the horse while remaining alert (watch out he/she may lose attention on you while you are not looking). This will cause the horse to come toward you slowly and 'join up'.


If everything goes according to plan, when you turn your back and walk away, the horse will step toward you and follow. This is the same way a foal follows the mother when she moves off. You want to reward this behavior so that the horse is more likely to repeat it in future.If things don't go to plan and the horse ignores you, start working the animal in a circle again and go back to the beginning. However, if the horse is starting to tire, stop and try again another day.

, You can rub between the eyes or offer a nice stroke on the neck. This is how horses naturally groom each other or assure a lower status horse. They do not approach the lead mare unless she is very relaxed and not exerting her authority.

, Stand next to the horse on the near side, facing forward. Walk off and circle around the horse’s nose to the right. The horse will follow when you have established that you are the leader. Complete a small circle and reward the horse. Do this in both directions.

If you are not confident that you will be able to regain control while mounted, get off quickly. You can still work him and regain control from the ground before mounting up again. If you don’t feel safe, don’t take the risk of staying mounted.If you cannot dismount normally you may need to perform an emergency dismount. There are a couple of ways to do this, but with each one you should try to land facing forwards or sideways, never to the rear.
For the vaulting method, kick both feet free of the stirrups and grab the pommel. Lean forward and kick both legs up over the horse's back. Drop to to the left side of the horse, holding the left rein in your left hand and facing forward.
If you don't think you can jump your legs over the horse's back you can kick free of the stirrups, grab the pommel, and swing your left leg over and slide down.
With either method you should not pull down on the rein when you land or you might prompt him to rear again, or pull him onto you.Stay calm, and if he doesn't respond to you getting off and keeps rearing, step away but keep your eyes on him.;
, As soon as you feel the horse begin to rear, try to loosen the reins and resist the urge to pull back or down. You can loosen the reins by pushing your hands up towards his mouth. Lean slightly forward in the saddle and tip your upper body towards his neck, but stay centred in the saddle., Often, when a horse rears the rider is taken by surprise and she loses her balance. This will prompt her to lean back in the saddle and pull back on both of the reins to try to hang on. This can be dangerous and can cause the horse to be pulled off-balance, potentially falling over backwards and hurting you and the horse.


If you pull on both reins, the horse may also try to fight your hold.
This will only make him more nervous and trapped, and will exacerbate the situation., Once he has placed his front feet back on the ground, try to encourage him to move forward to prevent him rearing again. Leaning slightly forward in the saddle, give him a squeeze with your legs to get him moving forward., If he balks, and seems to be about to rear again, hold one rein out to the side and lead him around in a half circle.Don’t use both reins and don’t pull him back. Try to just hold onto one rein and use that to redirect his feet. Do this to get him thinking about his feet, and not what has prompted him to rear in the first place.


Put him on a loose rein and concentrate on getting his feet moving with lots of changes of direction.
If you find yourself struggling for balance, grab the saddle horn or a handful of mane with your spare hand., If your horse is afraid and that is what’s prompting him to rear, you can tackle this by yielding his hindquarters. This means making him cross over his back legs so he loses his balance point, and has to think about how he is moving his feet rather than whatever is frightening him. When he loses his balance point, he also cannot stand up on his hind legs to rear.


To do this, pull one rein around to your hip, so you bring his head around towards your toe on one side.
Put your leg (the one that you are drawing him towards) back, and apply a little pressure to his flank.
When he responds to the pressure and moves the way you are directing him, release your leg.
When he has softened to the rein by giving to the bit, and noticeably softening his jaw and neck, you should release the rein., Some people advise hitting your horse on the poll (between the ears) to punish him for rearing, or even intentionally pulling him to the ground. This could end badly, with injury or horse. While it may stop him rearing at that moment, it does nothing to help prevent him rearing again in the future., There are generally two reasons why your horse will rear up. Either he is being held back, or he is feeling trapped. Rearing is a fearful reaction generally caused by the rider, however accidentally. Think of your horse as wanting to move forward but being held back, and it becomes easier to see why he rears up. Horses like to run, and running is the basic way a horse will react is he feels anxious. If you prevent him from running, the only direction he can go is rearing up.He may also rear if he is balking at something. If he doesn’t want to do something, his way to get out of it will be to rear or move backwards., If your horse rears, and you are not certain you can correct him, it is definitely not a bad idea to get off him. Some people try to avoid dismounting because they don’t want the horse to think he has won, and reinforce his behaviour. It’s perfectly fine to get off, but it does matter what you do next.


If you have dismounted, longe the horse, and do some ground work to get his feet moving. You will get him thinking again and regain his respect.
Do not rub him, or pat him, and walk him back to the stable. Doing this will only reinforce his bad behaviour and can encourage him to rear again in the future., Rearing is often a result of your horse not properly respecting you. To tackle this you have to go back to basics and work on building up your relationship. Do lots of ground work, and get him used to you touching him and working with him.The more you are able to get him to move his feet in all directions, forwards, backwards, left and right, the more he’ll be thinking and paying attention.
Use exercises that involve a lot of changes of direction, such as figure of eights and rollbacks.Reward good behaviour and have fun together.

, If your horse is particularly sensitive or anxious, certain stimuli may prompt him to rear. You can work on addressing this by progressively desensitizing him to the things which provoke anxiety. The basic technique for desensitization work is to expose him the stimulus in a safe environment, and wait for him to stop reacting.


When there is no reaction to the stimulus, remove it and praise the horse.
Wait a few seconds and then reintroduce the stimulus.
Repeat this over and over.
Remember not to remove the stimulus until there is no reaction from your horse., A rearing horse can be a very intimidating, scary, and dangerous thing to experience. If your horse keeps rearing and you are struggling to prevent it, be sure to contact a professional trainer who will be able to help you, and work with you and your horse.


The problem can be fixed with the right work and help.
A rearing horse can cause injuries and even be fatal, so you should never take risks or just hope for the best."

Lead your horse somewhere quiet so he can focus on you.,
Run forward with your horse, but with your back away from the horse.,
Stop your horse.,
Make an upward motion with your arms toward your horse.,
Stand somewhere high to direct your horse.,
Raise an arm with a treat and command your horse “up” or “rear.” Take your treat in one hand and move it up, sternly saying “up.” He will stretch his neck to try to eat the treat.,
Repeat this process as long as needed.,
Continue this routine until your horse fully rears.,
Ride your horse and rear.,
Use the same ""up"" cue when riding.,
Release pressure when your horse raises slightly.,
Continue this process until he gets confident, and rears on cue.",How to Teach a Horse to Rear," A place with very few distractions is the best place. You want his complete attention to be on you. You also want your horse to be very relaxed and ready to be trained.


Avoid a pasture with other horses or other animals.
Avoid a pasture where other people are training.
Pick a place that is as quiet and calm as possible.;
, Leading and teaching by example is one of the best ways to train your horse. Run backwards in front of your horse, but not too quickly. Make sure to put enough distance between you and your horse so that you won’t be trampled or run over by accident.









Build your horse’s momentum forward by running.
Make sure your horse and you are running fast enough so that momentum is building.
Keep a safe distance.
Walk the pasture before so you don't run into a hole and hurt yourself., Stop your horse safely and prepare to transfer his/her energy upward. Use both verbal and visual cues to stop your horse. Previous training will help immensely.









Motion and/or verbally command your horse to stop.
Keep a positive demeanor and praise your horse when he obeys you.
Keep a safe distance., Once you’ve stopped, you need to direct your horse upward. Direct your horse upward by making a motion with your arms. This needs to be done as quickly as possible once the horse has stopped.









Pair your upward motion with an appropriate verbal command like “up” or “rear.”
This could be dangerous, so don’t get too close to your horse.
Reward your his behavior whenever he acts the way you want him to.
Do not try this with an untrained horse., Now that your horse is used to rearing and to your motioning for him to rear, take it to the next level and reinforce the verbal commands you may have been using before. Find a spot to stand, preferably where you’ll be higher than your horse. You’ll want your horse see you clearly and follow your direction. If you are tall, just stand on the ground in front of your horse., When he moves his head upward a little bit, reward him with the treat.







, Each time you repeat this, slowly raise your hand a little bit higher. Your horse will continue to stretch his neck, and then slowly move up on his hind feet. Work with your horse and don’t tease him with the treat – make sure he always gets it once he’s put forth the effort.







, Eventually, he’ll rear to the appropriate level in order to get his treat. Remember several things when doing this:









You need to have patience with your horse.
Continually praise your horse and reward him with treats.
This process could take several days or longer., After you’ve completed the initial motion and verbal training process, you can now try to rear with your horse. Make sure to do so in an appropriate setting, with someone watching you in case there is an accident. Also, make sure to lean forward when your horse rears. Leaning backwards could result in you falling off, your horse falling over, and both of you being injured., When you’re on your horse, try to use your command. He may not respond, so use leg pressure, tug lightly on the reins, and press hard into the saddle. Continue to say ""up"" the whole time until he responds. Don’t kick or yell at him if he does not respond the way you want him to., When he raises slightly, sit lightly, release the reins, take away your legs, and praise your horse. Reward him with a treat afterword. Also, make sure to use a positive tone when you talk to him.







, Over time you’ll be able to perfect how your horse rears, how high, and when. Again, you need to be patient in this process and work with your horse as a member of your team. Don’t show your frustration, and never take it out on your horse.

Consider lessons for your horse.",How to Get Your Horse to Trust You," If your horse is anxious as you approach him for training, you may be approaching him wrong. Some horses are fearful of humans (or any animals) that approach head-on.Try approaching from the side and avoid direct eye contact.As you get close to your horse, hold your hand out to allow the horse to sniff you. If the horse is still afraid, try bending at the waist while you hold out your hand and avert your gaze.;
, Other than grooming and riding your horse, how much time do you really spend together? You can learn a lot about a horse's personality and behavioral tendencies by observing your horse for any period of time. Try sitting nearby while your horse roams or interacts with other horses, and let him get comfortable with your presence. You may also get a pretty good idea of why your horse behaves the way he does by watching him and spending time with him.Try to spend some time with your horse every day. Even if you only have 10 or 20 minutes, you can spend that time grooming your horse or squeezing in a short warm-up ride., Some people might feel awkward talking to an animal that can't talk back. But some horse owners find that talking to a horse can help gain the horse's trust and get him used to being around humans. Try speaking to your horse using a calm yet assertive tone. Your horse will learn that he can feel comfortable in your presence and that you are a reliable leader., If your horse hasn't earned your trust yet, riding him for prolonged periods may be difficult or even dangerous. But that doesn't mean you can't get out of the stable with your horse. Try taking your horse for a long walk in the woods, leading him by the reigns as you would lead a dog on a leash. This can help your horse learn to grow comfortable traveling with you and being guided by your lead., Part of training your horse and building trust should include learning how to calm your horse. It's important not to rush this part, as forcefully laying your hands on a horse that doesn't trust you could result in further mistrust and even injury. Once your horse gets used to your touch, you can use a variety of relaxation techniques to help facilitate training if your horse is being stubborn or fearful.Stand next to your horse's head, facing the same direction as he is. Hold the lead rope in your hand and slowly bend down at the waist with your head down. Gently guide the horse's head down with you. This should pull your horse out of his alert, guarded pose, and over time he will see that he can safely let his guard down around you.Stroke or scratch your horse, but don't pat him. Patting is not something that horses do to each other in the wild. Stroking or scratching mimics the way a horse might rub against another horse in the wild, and it's the best way to soothe an anxious horse and get him used to your touch.Use an index finger to gently stroke the groove that runs down the top of your horse's muzzle. Stroke gently and run your finger down the entire length of the muzzle. This can be incredibly relaxing in some horses, and will help desensitize your horse to your touch.Hold your horse's muzzle with one hand and gently slide one finger from your other hand into the back corner of your horse's mouth. Horses shouldn't have teeth in that part of the mouth, but it's still important to proceed cautiously. Don't force this exercise if your horse still isn't comfortable being touched by you. Once your finger is in, gently and very briefly stroke your horse's tongue. This teaches the horse to submit to you, and over time will earn his trust., This might sound like common sense, but it's easy to forget that expecting too much too soon from an animal can be stressful and confusing. Training is a great way to build trust with your horse, but it should be done in a scaffolded approach. Start with small, easy to accomplish tasks and work your way up to more challenging training lessons.Start with what your horse already knows. Then add easy challenges that you know he will be able to accomplish without too much effort.If your horse isn't ready to jump over a new obstacle, that's okay. Get him comfortable standing near the obstacle and smelling/looking at it, so that, over time, he'll be comfortable and mentally prepared to jump over the obstacle.Don't rush your horse. If he's still not comfortable jumping over obstacles, forcing him to jump will only make him more distrustful of you, and could cause harm to both you and your horse. Let your horse investigate the obstacle as much as he needs to before he's ready to jump over it, and be sure he's comfortable being around the obstacle before you attempt to jump it., Any time you train your horse to accomplish a new task and he attempts the challenge, give him a reward, even if he doesn't fully accomplish the task. The key is to teach your horse that it's advantageous to try for you. Eventually, with enough reassurance and reward, your horse will want to try for you, not just for a treat.Choose healthy treats as rewards. Vegetables like apples, carrots, and celery make excellent treats for horses if cut into small enough pieces.Do not give your horse vegetables that tend to cause gas like cabbage or Brussels sprouts. Never give your horse any plants from the nightshade family, including onions, potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers.Always give treats in moderation. Giving too many treats or giving treats too often can also create problems like constant expectations of food, which can lead to nipping. For this reason, it's important to set some kind of boundaries when it comes to how you reward your horse's behavior.Generally speaking, one or two pieces of horse-appropriate vegetables should suffice as a treat or reward.Be cautious with hand-feeding your horse treats. If your horse doesn't trust you yet, he might try to snatch treats as quickly as possible, which could result in your hand getting bit. Instead, offer treats in a bucket or feeding trough., If your horse has certain anxieties - like crossing water, for example - you'll need to help your horse confront those fears. But that doesn't mean you should force your horse to run recklessly into whatever he's afraid of. Forcing a horse to confront a fear too quickly could frighten the horse and may cause injury to you, but over time he should confront those fears. The best part about helping your horse confront his fears is that he'll remember your role in the process, and he should come to respect and trust you.Build your horse's confidence by leading him to whatever he's afraid of - say a creek that runs across your property.
Use relaxation techniques to calm your horse, then lead him slowly toward the water. Let him watch the water, sniff the shore, and once he feels comfortable stepping into the water, let him stand in the water for a few moments to understand that it's not a threat.

, If your horse hasn't learned to trust you, you might be part of the problem. Horses can sense when a rider is tense or anxious, and any hesitation on your part could cause your horse to lose his trust and confidence in you. Try confronting your riding fears with your horse, using relaxation techniques and a soothing but confident voice. As you get more comfortable riding your horse through scenarios that previously made you nervous, your horse should get more comfortable confronting those scenarios with you., If you simply can't earn your horse's trust, you might need to hire a professional. Professional trainers can work with you and your horse to learn why your horse may be reluctant to trust you, and can teach you how to overcome those obstacles.Bucking, bolting, and rearing up are all examples of bad horse behavior that need to be corrected. These actions are generally caused by your horse not trusting or respecting you, and can cause serious harm to you or other riders.If your horse engages in any of these behaviors, contact a qualified horse trainer before any further attempts at riding your horse.
Look for a trainer or other qualified expert through a professional organization, like the American Quarter Horse Association. Search online for a trainer near you.

Seek professional help.",How to Stop a Horse Rearing," A horse will rear for numerous reasons, but for the most part this can be linked to fear. A horse will rarely show its underbelly, the main situation they would do this in the wild is when stallions fight for a mate. In general kicking out and bucking is more common, and when young horses are backed, this is the natural reaction. If a horse is rearing there may be a serious reason, maybe it was taught to by previous mishandling or poor riding, for example. Figuring out why your horse is rearing is the first step to stopping it. Pure punishment for its behaviour is unlikely to work. Staying calm and patient will. It is also important to remember that it is very unlikely that you will fall off from a rear and throwing you off is unlikely to be the aim in your horse rearing, they might be telling you something else is wrong.;
, Your horse may rear out of pure fear so always keep yourself calm and never scream or yell because this may scare the horse more. When your horse rears be sure to check his gear, is it painful, for example.

, In preparation for a rear, the horse will put its head in the air, and you can feel it become lighter on the forehand, it might even make a few mini-hops with its front feet. Take stock of these sorts of signs in order to help you prepare yourself, and take preventative measures.

, The biggest danger with rearing is if a horse goes up so high it falls over backwards. This will damage the horse, tack and more importantly, you. A good way to manage rearing is to make circles. When you start to feel the horse prepare itself for a rear, with one leg, press so that it must move to the side, and open the opposite hand. For example, you decide to move it to the left so you press with the right leg, and open your left hand to bring the head around. If a horse is moving sideways, it can't go up. Additionally, by bending the head round, you have gained some control over where it is, you have stopped the head from move upwards, and instead, the head is now to the side. If a horse can't get it's head in the air, it cannot rear either. Make sure you don't simply pull back with one rein, opening your hand is also important and give the horse a space to move into.

, If a horse is moving laterally forwards, it can't go up. May sure you ride with long reins. This might seem counter intuitive as you are scared and want to keep control. This will make things worse, if you shorten the reins, your horse will raise its head, eventually its whole body. Make sure it has enough room to keep moving forwards. Press it on, and give it its head. Your reins do not have to look like washing lines, but they must allow your horse space.

, One good technique to get your horse out of the habit altogether is to use circles again. This time, when you feel your horse starting to go vertical, make a small, tight, fast circle in one direction, and then quickly spin him round the other. Then ask them to 'woah'. This whole process should be calm. Undoubtedly, after spinning in two directions, your horse may be a bit flummoxed, this is okay, you have rattled their cage a little bit without any aggression. Once they stand calmly, praise them. If they don't want to stand but decide to walk, it if it calm, that is also okay. The main thing is to praise calmness.

, This should not be done in an aggressive manner and must be used with caution. If you can, once in a rear, use your fist to bonk the horse between the ears will confuse them somewhat and might bring them down and make them think twice about doing it again. This has worked in the past but should not be done by an amateur.

, From rearing and being ridden with its head in the air, your horse may have built up a lot of muscle on the underside of its neck, and not so much along its back. This actually means that moving in any other way is uncomfortable. There will no doubt be psychological issues to deal with too, but dealing with the physical ones might be easier, and will pave the way for dealing with the psychological ones. Before getting on it, lunge it enough so that it is used to working with its head down, and get it round and building its topline. This way you are not fighting a myriad of problems once on its back and things might be a lot safer. This will not always work, if your horse rears while being lead as well, this might not be an appropriate approach, but there is no harm in trying. On the lunge, when they rear, just push them forwards and once they and moving calmly, praise and stop the session and give them lots of fuss.

, If in doubt, call a trainer out. Get one that uses a calm, steady, kind approach. No doubt the horse rears already out of fear or from aggressive riding. More of the same will not solve the issue. Kindness does not mean they will let the horse get away with it, it just means they will treat it with compassion and understanding, rather than aggression and more fear.

Horses that are unhappy may have tense nostrils that appear thin and rigid., The horse’s lower lip should curl down slightly and appear relaxed. This is an overall indication that the horse is relaxed and in a good mood. If the lip looks tense and tight, the horse may be stressed or unhappy., When your horse is happy, their jaw should be relatively loose and relaxed. This signifies the fact that they are not stressed out. In addition, you may see the horse drooling a little bit., A happy horse should have a relaxed tail that is not tense. Their tail should swing back-and-forth in an even manner. If the tail is not moving or appears tense, the horse may not be happy.If the tail is moving back-and-forth very quickly, it may suggest that your horse is stressed out.
Watch to see if there are a lot of flies or other insects present, if this is the case, your horse’s tail movement may simply be an effort to swat them away.

, Horses are often happy when they graze. If you notice your horse walking around the pasture and slowly grazing, this is a good indication that they are happy. Unhappy horses may stand still or gallop along fence lines., If you see your horse rearing their front legs upward or pawing/scratching at the ground, they may be happy. Ultimately, these are signs that the horse is in a playful mood. Unhappy horses won’t play., Observe how your horses interact together.

, If your horse is walking around the pasture and defecating or urinating, they’re likely relaxed and may be happy. This is important, as stressed horses will often not go to the bathroom., With horses, as with humans, appetite is closely related to happiness and general health. A poor appetite may be a good indication that a horse is sick or unhappy. As a result, monitor your horse’s eating habits. Take note of their feed box, their grazing routine, and any other source of food they consume., Illness is probably the biggest factor that could cause a horse to be unhappy. As a result, be diligent about watching your horse for signs of sickness. Common ailments include:

Skin conditions like ringworm, mud fever (associated with wet and muddy conditions), and cracked heels (similar to mud fever).
Respiratory problems like a cold or a cough. To identify a cold or cough, listen for coughing sounds and watch for nasal discharge.
Colic, which could be a result of many things, but almost always manifests in abdominal pain., If you are concerned about whether your horse is happy, you should talk to your veterinarian.

Review your horse’s general temperament and behaviors.,
Check the horse for pain and discomfort, not just in the back and girth areas, but the legs, head and mouth as well.,
Check the horse’s saddle, bridle and bit for fit, positioning, wear and cleanness.,
Invest or borrow a leather or elastic girth.,
Pay attention when you handle the horse and be honest about that handling.,
Have a mounted lesson with a good instructor.",How to Tighten a Girth on a Difficult Horse1," If the horse is tense when ridden and has a short stride something may be causing the horse pain. A horse who is easy to catch and happy in their work may have a more direct problem with the girth, rather than what they associate with it. Common areas to look for are how easy the horse is to catch and mount, being stabled, groomed or anything thing else the horse may associate with being tacked up and ridden.;
, Although these areas aren’t directly related to the girth, horses are excellent at associations. If a horse is in discomfort when ridden, they associate being tacked up with being ridden and therefore with the discomfort. You will need the help of a vet to assess your horse.

, Bits can develop sharp and rough edges with wear and flocking in saddles can form into hard lumps causing pressure points. Dirty girths and saddle cloths can cause rubbing. You will need the help of a saddle fitter to assess the fit of your tack.

, Some synthetic girths don’t stretch at all and must feel very restricting. Use a girth that is shaped around the elbow, and make sure it is the right size so you are not using the last few holes meaning you can’t tighten the girth gradually.

, Are you rough or impatient? Do you slam the saddle down or tighten the girth too sharply? It is helpful to ask a knowledgeable and honest friend to watch you.

, Tell them your situation and ask for an assessment of your riding position and if it could be causing the horse extra stress on one part of their body.

"
"
Remove any possible reason the horse may have to react to the girth being tightened.,
Give yourself extra time to tack up.,
Use a step to place the saddle on your horses back.,
Do up the girth so it comes in contact with the horse, but without any pressure and then tighten it one hole at a time.

,
Keep in mind why the horse is acting up when he does.,
Make sure you don’t slip back and allow the problem to come back.",How to Tighten a Girth on a Difficult Horse2," The horse will not immediately stop. They must trust that being girl will not cause or lead to any discomfort, and that will take time and gentle consistent handling.

, Take time to groom or fuss over your horse if this is what your horse enjoys.

, This will allow you to put the saddle on more smoothly. Place it gently on to the horse’s back making sure the saddle cloth and flaps aren’t rolled up.

,, Although bad manners and dangerous behaviour can’t be tolerated, remember that the horse is trying to tell you they are unhappy. Be sympathetic, but correct the behaviour:


Swishing Tail/Pulling Faces: This is the horse’s way of communicating and shouldn’t be punished. Don’t ignore it though. The horse is unhappy about something, if you ignore it the horse may try a more extreme method to communicate it.
Moving Away: When you tighten the girth, if the horse reacts, keep or gently increase the pressure on the girth while moving with the horse. Don’t pull it sharply. As soon as the horse stands quietly release the pressure, ask them to move back to where they were and award the horse.
Threatening to Kick/Biting/Stamping: Wear protective clothing; several layers of long sleeves and gloves, boots with steel toe caps etc. When you tighten the girth, if the horse reacts, keep or gently increase the pressure on the girth. Don’t pull it sharply. As soon as the horse stands quietly release the pressure and award the horse.
Kicking: This should essentially be handled the same as if the horse threatens to kick, but the situation is more dangerous. A more severe reaction is needed just before the horse kicks. This reaction should be “horse aggressive” (snorting, stamping) rather then “human aggressive” (hitting, shouting). Professional help would be a very good idea as timing is essential.
Blowing up: This is when the horse blows themselves up to stop the girth being tighten to much, it is usually a method the horse has developed to cope with rough handling or over-tight girths. Tighten the girth to the correct amount, i.e. so you can fit a hand between it and the horse, regardless of how much the horse has blown themselves up. You may have to use a girth on the large side (so you end up using the hole near the top), a girth extender or some string so you can do up the girth at all. Check and tighten the girth after putting the bridle on, putting the boots on etc. Walk the horse inhand and then check and tighten it again until the girth is tight enough.

, Make sure you instruct anyone that handles the horse.

You're just going on your way, your horse is moving forward and suddenly it decides it doesn't want to go this way. It quickly spins back and starts walking back towards the barn.;
, Most likely one side of your weight, direction or handling was not strong enough to hold the horse on the path. Especially for green horses, they need strong reminders from the rider as to where they are going.

, If you feel your horse beginning to turn to the right, immediately close the door to that direction by closing your right leg on its side and holding the right rein, as well as applying some supple support from the left rein. By holding your rein, you are just keeping a steady contact. Do not pull back, for to do so will confuse your horse.

, The scenario is:


You're trotting in a straight line, but your horse needs work on its circles. You turn your horse to the left, but its nose comes to its shoulder, while it moves even more to the right.

, At this point, you need to repeat what you would do in the above scenario. Close your outside leg and really hold with your inside rein. Do not release until the horse gives and move into a nice left turn.

, The scenario is:


Your horse is still trying to turn when you want to go straight again.

, Your horse will be much less likely to try to slow down to turn back if is is engaged in an active forward movement constantly being subtly reinforced with your leg, as well as a very clear blocking of your reins by maintaining steady contact.


The strength of the contact depends on your individual horse's needs and responsiveness to the riding aids.

, Moving forward (the previous method) may only result in your horse jigging to the side at a faster pace. Here you need to maintain your leg and other bodily indicators, but your natural signals won't always work. Once you notice this, it is time to resort to the equipment:


If you have spurs, start to use them.
You can use a dressage whip to tap the horse's shoulder to try to move it into the turn.

, Sometimes, a horse may grow used to a bit the more you use it. Remember that with snaffles, they need to be flipped every now and then so that your horse doesn't get used to the feeling of it. The more you use a bit, the more a horse loses its responsiveness to it.


Different bits are effective on different parts of the horse. Ask your trainer or someone who is knowledgeable about bits to help you pick out a bit that is more likely to work with your horse.

Breathe deeply and speak quietly to your horse.,
Flex his head by shortening the reins.,
Have your horse change direction.,
Move your horse forward by putting pressure on his body.,
Use a pulley rein if all else fails.,
Do ground work to gain the horse’s respect.,
Desensitize him to frightening objects or obstacles.,
Let him get his energy out in a round pen before riding him.",How to Stop a Horse That Tries to Buck," Though you may find it difficult to take a breathe and be calm when your horse tries to buck, panicking will shut down your ability to process and react properly. Try to take a deep breathe and speak quietly to your horse by saying “whoa” or “calm”.You should also focus on keeping your legs long on your horse and your heels down when you are in the saddle. Sit deep in your pockets and keep your lower back soft. This will help you stay on the horse even when he is trying to buck.
Do not grip the horse tightly with your legs or squeeze him with your legs as this will just tell your horse to buck more and throw your center of gravity off balance.;
, When your horse bucks, he stiffens his forelegs and his body. Getting him to flex his head allows you to regain control of him and relax him. You will need to use the reins to flex his head.Keep both hands on the reins at all times when you ride your horse. When he begins to buck, shorten one rein until you can see the side of your horse’s face. This will turn his head and force him to stop bucking.
Do not pull backward on both reins as this can throw off the horse’s balance and your balance. In fact, pulling backward on the reins will only encourage him to keep bucking.

, Once you have regained control on your horse by getting him to flex his head, you should then have your horse change direction. This will help to rebalance your horse and allow you to continue the ride.Do this by asking your horse to step inside of a sharp turn. Lift and open the inside rein, which is the rein closest to the direction your horse’s head is flexing. This will lead him into the turn and help him rebalance. This will also put less weight on his forehand and more weight on his hindquarters, making it more likely he will keep his back feet on the ground.
You may need to make him change direction several times by doing a series of sharp turns. Stopping and changing directions will force him to focus on your commands and distract him from bucking.

, Another option is to try getting your horse to move forward so he stops bucking. This can be useful if your horse is energetic and likes to gain momentum on rides.First, shorten the inside rein and get your horse to flex his head. Then, hold the rein in the “open” position away from his neck. This will get your horse to move his shoulders and rebalance himself.
Apply rhythmic pressure on both sides of his body with your legs to get him to move forward. He should understand this cue and propel forward, moving onward with the ride.

, If your horse is really freaked out and needs to be calmed for the safety of the rider and the horse, you may want to try the pulley rein technique. This is an emergency technique and should only be used when all else fails, as it can be hard on the horse.Start by shortening both reins. Hold one rein taut, but not too tight, and brace your hand against your horse’s neck or his saddle horn. Raise the other rein up and back. Then, sit deep in the saddle. Make small pulses of pressure with the rein to encourage your horse to shift his weight back to his hind legs and raise his head.
Once your horse raises his head, you can try using other techniques like the direction change or pressure on the body. Sometimes horses can react negatively to the pulley rein technique so it may end up cutting your ride short.

, If your horse is not willing to let you regain control or is still defying you, you may need to go back to doing ground work with him. This will allow you to bond with your horse and teach him that he needs to respect you. You will need a rope halter and a lead rope to do ground work.On the ground, pull his lead rope until he flexes his neck. His nose should be pulled toward his stomach. Practice this on both sides, pulling the lead rope so he flexes his neck.
You can also stand in front of your horse and walk toward him, keeping the lead rope up. He should step back, away from you. If he does not do this, shake the lead rope until he steps back.
You can try lunge lessons, where he learns how to move softly and quietly around you, with no pulling. He should also be able to respond properly to verbal cues for trot, walk, canter, and whoa.

, Some horses buck because they are frightened or spooked by certain objects. You should try to desensitize him to these objects during your training so he is not afraid and does not buck when he comes across them. You can do this by integrating different objects into your ground work sessions with him.You may have one person hold tarps, plastic bags, umbrellas, or poles near him while you train him so he gets used to their presence and can become more comfortable around them. He is less likely to buck at strange objects if he has been exposed to them previously.

, Some younger horses tend to buck as soon as they get out of their stalls, as they are full of pent up energy. To avoid getting bucked while riding a young horse, you may want to let him trot around a round pen or enclosed area before you ride him. Giving him some activity on his own can help to calm him down for the ride.Keep in mind this option is best if you are a recreational rider and do not have the skills to try to stop him from bucking during a ride. If you want to be a serious rider or a competitive rider, you should try to learn the skills necessary for controlling your horse during a ride and regaining control of him if he starts to buck.

Establish yourself as the leader.,
Watch for aggressive body language.,
Don’t let your horse groom you.,
Don’t hand-feed your horse.,
Leave hay in the stable.,
Look for signs of discomfort.,
Give the horse a quick smack on the muzzle.,
Reward good behavior.,
Always respond quickly.",How to Teach Your Horse to Stop Biting," Horses are social creatures, and every herd has an alpha stallion that the other horses follow and won’t bite. Your horse biting you may be a sign of disrespect, a way of saying he is in charge instead of you.


A good way to establish yourself is to keep his head front and center when you are working around him, including for grooming. If it starts to drift, either away from you or closer to you than you would like, use your hand to push it back where you need it to be for whatever activity you are doing. Pressure on his cheek or neck should get the point across that his head belongs where you want it to be.There are other general ways to make sure your horse respects you. Watch the rest of his body to make sure he is standing where you want him to, and if he is not, push him to move back. If you are riding him, don’t let him wander off in directions other than the one you want him to go. If he does that, make him stop, and lead him in your direction, not his.If he is a young colt, or has been allowed to misbehaved in the past, you will probably need to do these things several times for him to get the message. Keep your responses consistent, and he will learn.;
, The most common sign for aggression in a horse is for him to pin his ears back. You may also see other signs of nervousness or discomfort with the pinned ears like lowering his head, or stamping his feet. If your horse looks like he is in a bad or aggressive mood, be prepared to reprimand him, or step away so he doesn’t have the opportunity to bite.A number of different things can cause aggression in horses. Usually, it is a sign of unease, which come from being in an unfamiliar location, meeting new people or horses, or even boredom. In general, it is best to remove your horse from a situation where he begins acting aggressively. Otherwise, try to keep his day busy and activities varied to prevent boredom and encourage good social behavior with other horses., When you brush or groom your horse, he will try to groom you with his mouth in return. If he turns his head to you, stop brushing to let him know that he does not need to reciprocate with you. If he gets aggressive turning his head toward you, use your hand to push him back, and stop brushing until he turns forward again., Because of where their eyes are, horses can’t see in front of their mouth. They may use their teeth to get a feel for where they are, and start biting.Hand-feeding like this also lets your horse get too comfortable with his mouth on or near your hands, making a bite too tempting. He is also more likely to become aggressive if someone doesn’t give him the food he is expecting.If lots of people interact with your horse (say at a riding barn), and have been hand-feeding him, have them stop immediately. You don’t want the horse associating hand-feeding with others. This will make him more likely to bite as he gets frustrated with new people that don't feed him. This is especially true if they are being hand-fed by people who don’t know what they are doing.Your horse may go through an aggressive period where he won’t understand why he isn’t being fed, but that will pass as long as you are consistent with this new treatment.

, This is useful for teething horses, so they always have something to chew on. Without it, they will gnaw on the wood in their stables, and be more willing to bite you to deal with the irritating feel., Horses sometimes bite as a way to express their irritation at pain or other discomfort. You don’t want to punish a horse for expressing pain. Check your horse’s equipment, making sure everything fits properly and has been put on correctly, and keep an eye out for injuries.Check your horse’s equipment to make sure it fits properly and is the appropriate tightness. This is especially true for tack equipment such as the saddle and bridle. If it is either too tight or too loose, it will not feel right to the horse.Always make sure your gear, especially pieces made from leather, are clean and sturdy. This will prevent irritation to your horse, and make it less likely for you to have an accident from a broken tack.Check your horse’s shoes as well. Make sure they are clean, don’t have any impediments, and fit properly. If there is an issue, contact your farrier to have the shoes adjusted or reshod.Eye injuries are also a common problem for horses. If your horse is squinting or tearing up, you notice his lids swelling, his corneas becoming opaque, or facial asymmetry (each eye looks different), check with your veterinarian to determine the problem.

, If your horse nips you, quickly strike him with an open palm. This should be a quick smack, almost like a reflexive swat. A big windup or additional screaming and flailing will only confuse your horse.It can be helpful to add a loud “Stop!” or “Knock it off!” to increase the shock for your horse. Adding language can also help train the horse to recognize verbal commands, so that eventually saying “Stop!” will help prevent biting without the physical contact.Alternatively, have a rope or bat nearby. If a colt starts nipping, give him a swish with the rope or a light, but firm, tap with the bat. This mimics the response he would get from an older horse’s tail, reminding the colt who is in charge.If you aren’t comfortable striking the horse, you can also use your thumb and forefinger to twitch him between the nostrils on his nose or his neck. It won’t hurt him, just give an unpleasant shock that he won’t want repeated.

, You want your horse to know that doing the right thing will be rewarded. If he follows your punishment by staying back or holding his head still, give him a soft pat or rub on the shoulder.It can be a good idea to reward your horse immediately after punishing him. This can help reestablish trust, and let him know he is now doing the right thing, that is standing still rather than trying to bite.

, Whatever you do to respond to a bite or attempted bite, make sure it happens immediately. The horse needs to know that the punishment is tied to his biting. If you think you see it coming, that he is moving to bite you, go ahead and act preemptively.This also means responding early in your horse’s life. Young colts nip because they don’t always know better. If your horse gives you a little nibble, respond as you would if it were a full bite. This can help prevent bad habits from getting worse as your horse gets older. It is never too soon to let your horse know what isn’t appropriate, so he can understand the right way to act.

Untie your horse.",How to Train an Unruly Horse to a Hitching Rail," Horses may be unruly for a variety of reasons, including hormonal imbalances, human handling, and learned responses. For example, a hormonal imbalance may cause your horse to be abnormally aggressive, especially if he is a stallion. Horses that have been inbred or have tumors in hormone-producing organs (e.g., ovaries) are very prone to hormonal imbalances.Your horse may have also experienced poor handling by his previous owner. If his previous owner mistreated him (e.g., physical abuse, overworking, little to no interaction), your horse may have developed dangerous behavioral issues.Your horse may have also learned to demonstrate unruly behavior to get out of something he didn’t want to do.For example, he may have misbehaved in order to avoid doing work.;
, Take your horse to your equine veterinarian to rule out hormonal balances.Your veterinarian will perform various medical diagnostic tests to measure your horse’s hormone levels. If the hormone levels are higher than normal, your veterinarian may prescribe medication to lower the hormone levels or, if necessary, remove a tumor that is causing the hormonal imbalance.


If a hormonal imbalance is not the cause, a thorough review of your horse’s history could help you determine how he was treated by his previous owners, and if he developed a pattern of bad behavior.

, Fortunately, unruly behavior in a horse can usually be improved with proper training and plenty of patience.Consult with your equine veterinarian or an equine behaviorist if you are unsure of where to start with addressing your horse’s unruly behavior. Making your horse less unruly will help you train him to a hitching rail.


Be aware that some unruly behaviors may take months or years to correct., Leading your horse will allow you to assess how your horse responds to pressure from his halter on his poll (behind or right behind his ears) and head, which he would feel when he is tied. A proper response from your horse involves him willingly flexing his neck muscles, bending his head downward, and walking forward. If your horse pulls back (e.g., lifting head, resisting walking forward), he is responding improperly and indicating that he is not ready to be tied.Pulling back is also known as the ‘opposition reflex.’Practice leading your horse from various positions until he demonstrates the proper response.

, Stand in front of your horse and give him a verbal ‘back’ command. If he does not immediately understand this command, apply some indirect pressure with the lead rope. When he backs up, release this indirect pressure.As he backs up, he should feel some pressure from his halter on his poll and head, just like when you led him.


Whether he starts to come forward (proper response) or pulls back (improper response) will help you determine if he is ready to be tied.Continue working with your horse until he demonstrates the proper response to being backed up.

, Tying your horse softly means that you are tying the lead rope around the hitching rail (1 to 3 times) without making an actual knot. It may take some time for your horse to get used to the feeling of being tied to the hitching rail, and he may initially pull back. By not making an actual knot, your horse would be able to pull back without feeling the resistance of being tied.Keep in mind that your horse should not pull back at all when he is tied to the hitching rail. However, he may do so because being tied is not natural for him.
Practice tying softly in short training sessions (10 to 15 minutes). If you notice that he is pulling back, go back to leading and backing him until he stops pulling back, then try tying him softly again.Consider tying your horse when he tired, when he may be less likely to resist. Also, feeding him treats could distract him from being tied.If you notice that your horse is anxious about being tied, tie him with one of his companions close by.You may need to practice tying your horse softly up to 30 times before he is ready for you tie the lead rope into an actual knot., It is important to make a knot that is secure enough to keep your horse tied to the hitching rail, but not so secure that it cannot be undone easily if you need to unhitch your horse quickly. A common knot to make is a quick-release knot.When you drape the lead rope over the hitching rail, make sure that there is some slack in the lead rope so that you do not hitch your horse too tightly.The lead rope should not have so much slack that your horse could step on or over the rope.You should always use a lead rope to tie your horse— never tie him by his reins or bridle. The lead rope should be at approximately your horse’s eye level or the height of his withers. This will decrease the chance of injury if he happens to pull back., With one hand, grab a portion of the loose end of the rope and make a loop that is at least several inches across. Then, rotate your wrist to make a small twist in that loop. With your other hand, cross the rest of the loose end under the section of the lead rope that is attached to your horse's halter.With sections of the lead rope in both hands, the rope should be roughly in the shape of the number '4.', Fold the loose end over and back across the section of lead rope attached to the halter. As you feed this portion of the rope back through the loop, make sure to leave some of it outside of the loop. You will pull on this to loosen the knot. For example, if you are holding the loop in your left hand, you will use your right hand to feed the loose end of the lead rope through the loop.

, You will do this by pushing the knot towards the hitching rail.Make sure that your horse’s head is at a comfortable level (straight ahead and relaxed) before tightening the knot.If you can, keep a close watch on your horse to make sure that he does not undo the knot himself by putting the portion of the rope that is outside of the knot in his mouth., When it is time to untie your horse from the hitching horse, you will simply pull on the remaining loose end of the lead rope.If you made your quick-release knot correctly, the knot should come undone with your pull on the loose end of the rope. Make sure that you untie your horse before you remove his halter."

Determine if your horse is bored.,
Give your horse some space.,
Get your horse plenty of exercise.,
Mentally challenge your horse.",How to Stop Your Horse from Chewing Things1," Your horse is likely to chew or crib (grab objects and suck air through them) if he is kept in a stall. This is especially true if you have an energetic horse that is stalled for several days at a time without much to watch or little social interaction. You may also notice a bored horse:Weave or pace
Kick the sides of the stalls
Show separation anxiety
Toss his head
Become aggressive;
, Make sure your horse can spend time in open space, such as a pasture or paddock. This also means you should give him space to wander freely on his own, exploring new pasture. Your horse should have enough room to canter or gallop, roll around, and generally burn off energy, as the mood takes him.Be aware that even being turned out in a small paddock is still boring for some horses. A cramped paddock, or one shared with other horses which limits mobility, can frustrate your horse leading to fence chewing.

, Ideally, you should turn your horse out onto a large area of land all the time. If you can't do this, make sure to ride your horse daily. This will give physical and mental stimulation that can distract him from chewing habits. Try to switch up the types of exercise your horse gets. For example, take him on a trail ride, do lunging exercises, ride with other horses, or work in a round pen.Make your horse work for his food. To do this, use a hay feeder which will slow him down by slowing the release of hay through a narrow slot. This will stimulate your horse mentally, occupy him, and make him spend more time eating., Fortunately, there are lots of ways to entertain and enrich your horse's life. You can try training your horse to do new things, like touching targets on cue, jumping, or dressage. Or, offer toys to amuse your horse. Your horse might like playing with rubber tires, ropes, or balls, especially if he has to stay in his stall for a while.Even just spending time with horse can stimulate his mind. Give him a gentle massage and talk to him.

,
Take one carrot out of your pocket.,
Stand in front of your horse, facing him.,
Lean forward while saying ""kiss"".,
After your horse gets used to touching your cheek start to move the treat away (hold it closer to your hip).,
After practicing every day for two weeks your horse should kiss you as soon as you lean forward.,
Feel proud that you and your horse can now perform a trick.

",How to Train a Horse to Kiss,";
,,, Place it in your right hand.

, Bring your dominant hand up beside your cheek (you should have a carrot in this hand).

, Let your horse see and smell the treat, the horse should reach forward to take the treat. Before the horse gets the treat make a kiss sound to show the horse that the trick is over. Your horse may be a spectacle, so if they look like they want to come forward but are afraid, you should lean forward more and offer the treat again. The horse will take it eventually.

, If your horse doesn't go for the treat move it up again. Keep going, don't give up!

, Perfect! The cue for the 'kiss' is you leaning forward and the verbal command of ""kiss"".

"
Consider your horse's eating habits.,
Evaluate your horse's diet.,
Have your horse's diet assessed.,
Determine if your horse is in pain.,
Know when to take your horse to the dentist.",How to Stop Your Horse from Chewing Things2," If you've noticed your horse chewing and a change in his diet, a medical condition may be affecting your horse. If you're unsure if there have been any changes, ask yourself the following questions:Does the horse eat more or less?
Has the horse become a messy eater?
Is the horse losing weight?
Is the horse drinking more or less?
Have the horse's droppings changed?

, Your horse should be chewing grass and foraging for up to 20 hours a day. If your horse is getting a high-concentrate diet (like pellets), he won't have the chance to chew for a prolonged period of time. While this means he won't need to physically chew, he'll still have a psychological need to chew.Your horse may also develop strange chewing habits if his diet is missing necessary vitamins or minerals.

, If you think your horse's diet is causing the chewing, have a veterinary nutritionist evaluate the diet. The nutritionist can see what needs to be adjusted so that the diet is balanced and not deficient in vitamins and minerals. You may also be referred to the vet for blood work to determine where deficiencies lie.You may also want to switch from a concentrated diet to a forage and hay diet, so the horse spends more time chewing.

, Your horse may start chewing things as a way to distract himself from pain. He may have a nagging or low-grade pain, like a stomach ulcer. Your horse may show one of the following signs if he's in pain:A gaping mouth when you ride
A clamped down tail when you ride
Tense muscles
Any behavior that's uncharacteristic for your horse (for example, a lower energy level, strange facial expressions, or reluctance to interact with other horses)
Elevated heart rate

, If a dental problem is causing your horse's chewing, you'll need to make sure that the cause is identified and treated. Only by treating the medical condition will the chewing stop. Get medical attention for your horse if you notice:Changes in eating habits
Signs of pain
Rough wear on the teeth
Excessive salivation
Bad breath
Face or jaw swelling

Wear a spur.,
Carry a crop.,
Use your voice.",How to Ride a Lazy Horse1," Wearing and using spurs on a lazy horse can encourage stimulation and speed. Do not, however, spur your horse every step. Use your spur sparingly and effectively. Put it on, get a result, and then take it off.


When your horse starts slowing down or if your horse needs more motivation, turn your heel in so that the metal spur touches his side.
Opt for a ball spur, which is safer, gentler option that will still make your horse pay attention.
Do not spur your horse for a long period of time. Horses are better with quick, intense aids rather than dull, repetitive ones.Different horses need different amounts of spurring, but, if your horse becomes angry when you use your spur, you should try using a crop or your voice instead.;
, Do not smack your horse with the crop as soon as you get on. Instead, use the crop sparingly in places where your horse typically slows down. Many horses will slow down in the corners of the ring, easier parts of the trail, or when you move from the posting trot to the sitting trot. Use the crop quickly and assertively. Tap your horse behind your leg. Do not hit your horse’s shoulder or rump.Don’t excessively beat your horse. A single, firm smack sends the message to move forward or go faster.
A lot of horses will pick up the pace if you just show them the crop. Much of the time, you may simply need to threaten your horse instead of actually using the crop.

, If necessary, use voice commands that your horse understands. Horses are so responsive to your tone of voice that changing your tone and asking them to “Get up” or a similar command should get the job done. All horses have been trained a little bit differently, but most horses will understand a cluck as a sign to trot and a kiss as a sign to canter.


Don’t scare or spook your horse with your voice. It should be clear and commanding, not frightening.

"
"
Be persistent from the beginning.,
Start and stop on your terms.,
Provide clear cues to your horse.",How to Ride a Lazy Horse2," If your horse does not have the speed or impulsion you want from the beginning of the lesson, do not settle for a slower pace. Make a constant effort to make your horse move forward. Make it clear that you will not take “no” for an answer. Don’t be overly aggressive, but make sure that your horse knows exactly what you want. Do not kick aggressively, yell, or slap your horse with your crop too hard. Squeeze with your legs and keep light contact.

, If you ask your horse to trot and he continues walking, do not stop asking for the trot until you get the trot. If you ask your horse to trot and he gets away with not trotting, he will know that he can get away with it further into your ride, too. Be persistent.

, Make sure that you are asking for what you want correctly. Ask your trainer or a more experienced rider friend to watch you ride your lazy horse and evaluate your use of the aids. Are you using your leg correctly? Are you pulling his mouth too much?The use of aids differs for every discipline, so your use of the aids will be different depending on whether you ride hunt seat, dressage, or western.
Ask your trainer for tips on encouraging your horse to move forward.

"
Set up cavallettis.,
Practice transitions.,
Go for impulsion, not just speed.",How to Ride a Lazy Horse3," Ask your trainer to set up cavallettis, or small, slightly raised rails. Trot over the cavallettis. Your horse will have to stretch the length of his stride to make it over. This challenge can help improve a horse’s rhythm. You can also go over the cavallettis at the canter.These do not have to relate to how much you jump or show; it's also good practice to make your horse pay attention to his feet and move with a bigger stride. If you don't want to use cavallettis, you can also put poles on the ground.

, Transition from walk to trot, trot to walk, trot to canter, canter to trot, walk to canter, and canter to walk. Make these transitions crisp and clear. Your horse will have to think constantly about what you want and will be more responsive to your aids. The horse won’t become dull and desensitized to your ride. He will instead be waiting for the next thing you ask for., Speed is not the only indication that your horse is moving well and not lazily. Impulsion, or the horse’s movement from the hind legs, rather than from the front legs, depends on the horse moving from behind. Impulsion is, essentially, how well your horse moves and how much energy his stride has.


To get impulsion, you need to establish light contact with the horse’s mouth, keeping your hands above the withers.
Urge your horse’s hindquarters to come under his body by squeezing with your legs and maintaining contact. Let his head drop forward, more into your contact."

Prevent boredom.,
Try a cribbing collar.,
Use an anti-cribbing feed supplement.,
Try making it impossible for your horse to crib by tying stiff brushes (brush side up) on your horse's usual cribbing areas.,
As feeding forage ad lib is not always possible, try putting their hay into a hay net with really small holes to keep them chewing for longer.,
Another option is putting a muzzle on the horse while in the stall (except at meal times), which will make it virtually impossible for the horse to grab objects to crib on.

,
If your horse is at the end stall in the aisle, trying moving him/her to a busier spot in the stable to prevent boredom.",How to Keep a Horse from Cribbing," Cribbing is often associated with boredom, so consider turning your horse out more with some other playful horses. Or, make his stall more interesting with some stall toys or constant access to quality forage. However, if your horse has been cribbing for a while, he may prefer to crib than play or eat.;
, These can be purchased at your local tack store, and are attached tightly around your horse's upper neck. They prevent your horse from breathing in very deeply, so he can no longer get the effect he seeks when he cribs. When he finds that there is no way to get high, he will stop chewing. However, he will never be cured, so he has to wear this collar whenever he is in his stall or turned out (if he cribs during turn-out). Be sure to remove the collar he is exercising, though, or he could potentially suffocate.

, These are quite simple: just scoop the right amount onto his feed once or twice a day. You might still want to use these in conjunction with another method, though, to guarantee success.

, They can't crib on something that isn't solid, and the bristles will give them a little reminder poke when they try to crib anyway. You could also try painting anti-chew treatment on the cribbed surfaces, or lining the surfaces with metal, as some horses find the metal uncomfortable to bite.

, Due to the way they have evolved, horses have a psychological need to chew almost constantly, but they should not be chewing on something that isn't edible.

,, But don't try this with everything, as where their stall is might not be the problem.

Make sure you have a good position.,
Walk the horse first.,
Cluck to the horse and see if they respond to that before you kick.,
Make sure you post to the beat of the horse.,
Gather your reins so that they aren't too loose.,
Control the horse.,
Once you are ready to stop, lean back a little bit and say ""Whoa"" or ""Ho"" in a deep voice.,
Keep practicing.,
Have fun while it lasts.",How to Ride a Difficult Horse or Pony," If you are an experienced rider, you should be able to maintain proper position. The same can't be said for people who are just beginning to ride. The key for this is sit up straight, pull your shoulders back, and keep your heels down! Pulling your heels up to become more stable is actually a bad mistake. When you do that, it encourages the horse to go faster. Don't rely on your heels, use your thighs and knees to stay on. It won't encourage the horse to go faster.


Keep your toes forward.
Heels down.
Shoulders back.
Sit straight up.
Grip with thighs and not your heels.
Keep your center of balance (shoulders, hips, and heels align).
Try to go stirrup-less with the horse you have been riding before, just in case you lose a stirrup.;
, Does s/he have a fast walk that you can't keep up with, or is s/he dragging behind you? This could potentially tell you if they will be a little jumpy or not.

, If there is no response to clucking, rub your heel on them while clucking. Still no response? Give them a tap (not a kick) with your heel. If they don't respond, kick them and tap their shoulder with the crop.


The crop should not move the hair or injure or break the skin under the coat. If that happens, stop using a crop.

, If your coach or friend tells you to check your diagonal, look at the outside shoulder of the horse. If you are standing when that shoulder is in and sitting when it goes out, sit two beats so that you stand when the shoulder goes out and you sit when it comes in.


This can be difficult for you if the horse becomes quick or starts gaining speed. If that happens, pull and release. Don't pull back and just hold it there, or they might stop going all together.

, Rub your heel by the wall just a little behind the girth and keep your inside leg on the girth. They should go as soon as you do that.

, When they go, some horses like to gain as much speed as possible during the straight areas (not around bends) so when you feel it get too bouncy or too fast, pull and release on the reins only using your wrist to move. Pull left, release, pull right release; it's pretty much seesawing the reins but to a lesser extent.

, If the horse didn't stop, you should do that again but pull the reins back.

, Even though they may not have been to bad or perky this time, they may have been tired or hot. Ride them a few more times till you move with them and can keep up with the pace. Maybe try jumping with them next time too, if you didn't do that already.


If you are jumping with the horse, grab a chunk of their mane and get into two point. Do not get into it early, or they could decide they don't want to jump and you could take care of it alone. Either get into it late or get into it perfectly on time.

, You probably won't ride the horse forever, so stick with it as long as you can! Do stirrup-less, wash the horse, fall off a few times, make it worth your wild to ride a perky horse!

Stand in front of your horse and ask him to lift his leg.,
Hold his pastern.,
Set your horse’s leg back down.,
Repeat the first two parts of the trick.,
Cue the “Shake” without using the whip.,
Repeat the lesson again until your horse is confident with the trick.",How to Train a Horse to Shake a Hoof," To get your horse to master raising his leg, you will need to use a driving whip. You may already have a whip that you use to train your horse. Your horse should be comfortable learning new tricks with the aid of a whip and act calmly around the whip.Another option is to use the rubber end of your riding crop. Using a riding crop is a good option if your horse is not comfortable around whips.
Shaking a hoof can be challenging for most horses, so you may want to start with easier tricks first to ease your horse into the training. You may teach your horse to hug or to kiss so he is comfortable taking direction from you by the time you teach him to shake a hoof.;
, Your horse should be wearing a halter and lead. Let the lead drape over one side of your horse so he knows it is training time. Then, stand beside the leg you want him to shake.Hold the whip in one hand. Keep treats, such as carrots, in your pocket or in a bucket nearby so they are easy to access as rewards.

, Lightly tap below your horse’s knee and say “Shake”. Make sure you tap him lightly, as the whip should be used as an extension of your arm. Only give the verbal cue while you are tapping his leg., Once you have tapped his leg and said “Shake”, run the whip up and down his leg and gently lift up his foot. Do this by gripping above his knee. Do not touch his hoof, as some horses are sensitive to touch in this area.


Place his foot back down gently. Stand back up straight.

, Once you have placed his foot back down, reward your horse with a treat. This will let him know he has done something good and is getting rewarded. You may also verbally reward him with a “Good job”., Repeat these steps again, lightly tapping below his knee and saying “Shake”. As you progress, move in front of your horse and get him in the habit of responding to the cue when you are standing directly in front of the leg he is lifting.It may take several tries or several lessons to get your horse used to lifting up his foot with the cue of the whip and “Shake”. Be patient and consistent with your cues, following the same motions every time you do the lesson. Praise him generously, as this is likely going to be the most difficult part of learning this trick for him.

, Before you move on to the next part of the trick, remind your horse of the first part of the trick. Use the whip to get your horse to lift his foot with a light tap and a “Shake” command. Horses learn best through repetition after all, so make sure your horse is confident doing the lift before you move on to the next part of the trick., Do this by lightly tapping below his knee and saying “Shake”., Once he raises his leg, gently hold on to his pastern, which is the sloping part of his foot located between his fetlock and his hoof. Stretch it slightly up and forward.Be very careful when doing this as you do not want to over-stretch his limb. You should hold his pastern very lightly to avoid spooking your horse or agitating his hoof.
If your horse is not comfortable with you holding his pastern, you can “shake” his leg by lightly gripping his thigh or gaskin.

, Give him a treat right away and praise him verbally with a “Good job”. You should then repeat this lesson several times until he seems comfortable with picking up his foot and bringing it forward on his own with a tap of the whip and the “Shake” cue.Make sure you praise him and give him treats each time he achieves this movement. You will want him to be confident with this part before moving on to the final version of the trick.

, Before you get your horse to shake with a verbal cue only, you should remind him of the previous lessons. Lightly tap below his knee with the whip and say “Shake”. Then, once he lifts his leg, hold his pastern lightly with your hand.Reward him once he completes these two motions with confidence and ease.

, To do this, stand in front of your horse. Say “Shake” but do not use the whip to tap his leg. Wait two to three seconds for him to respond.If he does not respond, lightly tap him with the whip and say “Shake” again. He should raise his foot to shake. Then, lightly hold his pastern and then place it down on the ground. Reward him with a treat and verbal praise.

, Try this lesson again until he lifts his foot up and brings it forward with the verbal cue only. You may need to practice this trick with him over several sessions or several weeks. Be patient, as your horse needs to be taught this trick with repetition and consistent reminders from you.Over time, your horse should be able to lift his leg up and forward for a shake with just the verbal cue “Shake”. Always reward him with praise and treats so he knows he is doing the trick correctly.

, 3 times in one direction, then 3 in the other direction. Watch your horse, he`ll tell you when he wants to come in by: keeping an ear on you, tipping his head to the inside of the circle, dropping his head, licking his lips. When you see a sign that he is ready, ask him to stop. Go up to him at his shoulder only, as this is your safety area. Rub him all over his body, start moving up to the ear area. Retreat, repeat.

, Do this as much as necessary. Eventually, the horse will want to rest with you, when you can rub him all over with your hands, (rubbing ears, poll, forelock, etc) with him in comfort.

, Rub, never pat (horses like to be rubbed) the horse on the head, gently stroking the withers or neck.

, If there are any spots on the horse (especially the head) that it objects to you touching, use an approach and retreat method. Use a rhythmic rubbing motion. When you have reached the spot where the horse pulls away or objects, retreat to a place where he does accept and then approach the spot again. Repeat until the horse accepts your touch and then stop to give the horse a release (this is the reward). Make sure all of the touchy spots are eliminated using approach and retreat.

, Approach and retreat while respecting his objections and then working past them. Remember to release the second the horse makes a change and accepts the halter's touch. This is very important.

, If the horse raises his head to the point you cannot reach the poll area, any place you can reach on his neck will be the place to start. As soon as you get the smallest give release, rub and praise. (This can take awhile but well worth the effort.) Now that the horse is dropping his head, start asking him to bend his neck toward you. Do this by placing your left hand over the top of his nose, to the other side of his face/check area, bring in toward your body. Remember to release on the slightest try on the horses part. This position is the safest place to halter, start rubbing the halter over face, retreat. Do this until the horse is comfortable.

,,, Now you can halter your horse.

, Hook it while stroking the forehead slowly. Allow little slack in the lead-rope as you attempt to lead the horse.(About 18-24 inches, don`t choke up on them, this makes them claustrophobic, and puts you in danger.) If they try to trot or bolt, step to the side and pull sideways. This will upset their balance, and make it hard for them to run off.

Become proficient in handling a mare, foal, or gelding first.,
Ask the stallion's regular handler how the horse is normally handled.,
Bond with him and earn his trust and respect.,
Keep the stallion in sight when leading him.,
Take advantage of his gut instinct.,
Teach him to wait.,
Managing a stallion during breeding season is especially important.,
Find out the rules for handling stallions in your country or state.",How to Handle and Control a Stallion," A ""mareish"" mare is a useful to bridge the gap between a docile gelding and a stallion. A good idea is to practice leading and controlling a horse. You must have confidence and know the commands and rules for handling horses.;
, Ask about the equipment and techniques usually used on the stallion.



Halter and lead rope: A common halter with strong buckles and a strong, heavy-duty lead are quite adequate to lead a stallion. Many stallions are quiet and will only need a basic halter and lead.
Bridle: A bit can also be attached to a halter for the same effect. The horse must be lead from both bit rings, either by passing the lead through one ring and clipping in to the other, by passing the lead though both rings and clipping it to itself, by using a coupling to join both rings or leading from the reins. A horse can be lead from any bit, but a straight bar snaffle is preferable.
Halter and stud chain: Commonly used when showing in Halter events, the stud chain is passed though a side ring on the halter, passed over or under the nose, or though the mouth and clipped to the other side ring or passed though and clipped to itself the form a triangle. The stud chain can be snapped, (quick yank or a tug, providing a snapping action on the horses chin or nose). This stops a horse being rude and unruly. When the horse stands and behaves, the chain is released providing the reward.

Make sure you're using the stud chain in the desired way. Some studs are trained that having a stud chain a certain way (for example, over the nose), or even using a stud chain at all, means breeding time.


Chifney bit: Also called an anti-rearing bit, this bit allows the handler to lead the stallion as normal. If and when the horse rears up (this can happen if they smell a mare in season), the bit puts pressure on the tongue, making it uncomfortable for the horse, thus resulting in a 'safe grounding', when the stallion or rearing horse settles back on the ground. The reward is the release of the pressure. This tool is commonly used during breeding; the handler will hold the stallion while the mare's handler holds the mare. This way, exact dates and times can be recorded on breeding certificate.

Free Lunging, also called free schooling, is when a handler lunges the horse without using a lunge rein. The handler uses voice, body language, and sometimes a long whip to control the pace and directional changes. Stallions taught with this method can often be settled faster as they are quicker to respond.

, Ride him, talk to him, or whatever. Just remember to have authority and confidence, and you can earn his respect.

, He may not intentionally want to hurt you, but like horses in general, he can easily injure you.

, Food is often a tool of bribery, which is good, but when handling a stallion, they can become nippy and begin to play. Colts and foals will play as if you were another foal, but as they grow older this can become dangerous. Stop this before it becomes dangerous by flicking his nose when he nips, or using a citronella or chili treatment.

, Many trainers and handlers will repeat words such as 'manners' and 'wait' while feeding; the handler uses a lunge whip to keep the horse at a safe distance (without hitting the horse). When the handler is done, the handler will say 'okay' or a word to express to the stallion that he may eat.

, You need to be aware of the stallion’s power. He will be full of hormones and he may become rude or disobedient. This can be often seen in cases where you are handling a stallion with a mare.


Always have two people present, in case of an emergency.
Try to make it as safe as possible – use smaller paddocks to direct the horses together, or use a large paddock with the mare and stallion at either end.
Many stallions and mares don’t like to be watched, so let them have their privacy.
When it comes time to bring the stallion back from the mare, use a bribe. Many mares will be ready to give the stallion back. They will push him away and may kick at him, so make sure to avoid the firing line.
If and when it is time to bring the stallion back, it may be easier to bring the mare back first. This depends on the situation and each individual horse.

, Many Show Councils have an age ruling on showing a stallion or colt. A message in the code of conduct may read, No stallion or colt is to be handled or ridden by a person under 18 years of age. If unsure, contact your breed association or show council.


Though this is a show rule, it does not prohibit a minor from handling a stallion while at home. Many junior handlers are quite competent in handling a stallion, but as a general rule, any handler or rider of a horse or pony should have a second person watching or who knows they are riding or with a horse. Then, if something should happen, such as the horse kicks or bucks, the adult or other experienced person can intervene and ensure a safe and happy ending.

Is your horse safe to train to kiss?,
Get lots of small yummy treats, maybe 20 per session.,
Warm the horse up with a free treat so they will know what they're working for.

,
Put two or three treats in your hand, and hide the rest in your pocket.,
Position yourself in front of your horse, but facing to the side, so without turning your face, your cheek is toward him.

,
Lean over to position your cheek beside your horse's nose.

,
With the hand holding the treats, tickle your horse's nose with your index finger.,
The moment he wiggles even a tiny bit on your cheek, reward him with a treat, as fast as you can so he/she knows what they did right!

,
Repeat the procedure, saying ""kiss"" while you're encouraging the move, until he/she starts to get bored (or you run out of treats), not more than 10 or 12 times.

,
Repeat the same procedures once a day until he/she figures it out.,
When he/she has really got it, you should be able to lean in and ask for a kiss, and be rewarded with a big smooch!

",How to Teach a Horse to Kiss," Some horses won't respond well to learning this. They may bite and this trick may become a habit when your horse is unhappy. Decide whether your horse has had bad behavior and whether this is a safe trick to teach him/her.;
, Apples, carrots, and watermelon cut into small pieces are some specific examples.

,, Make sure your horse knows about the ones in your hand.

,,, A light tickle usually works best. The combination of you tickling his nose, and him wanting to work a treat out of your hand will hopefully make him wiggle his muzzle back and forth. Try to have your cheek against it when he does!

,,, When you think he/she gets it, stop tickling his/her nose, but keep your hand there. Pretty soon you can take your hand away, but remember to keep a treat ready!

Evaluate your horse's personality.,
Choose a good location to train your horse.,
Gather supplies.,
Adopt a patient and positive attitude.,
Limit training sessions to 5-15 minutes each.,
Lead your horse into the training area.",How to Teach a Horse to Bow1," You should already be familiar with the temperament and personality of the horse you are trying to train, and the horse should already be able to stand still on command. Horses differ drastically in their level of energy, attention and patience, just like people. Take some time to practice simple obedience exercises with your horse, such as walking on a lead rope, or gentle riding in a safe environment.;
, The ground should be relatively soft and comfortable. Otherwise, your horse may not wish to put their knees down on the ground. Soft grass or relatively rock-free dirt is a good choice. Also make sure the area is calm and quiet, and clear of distracting or noisy objects like running machinery. This will ensure that your horse is comfortable, and can pay full attention to your instruction., You will need a lead rope and halter that fits your horse, as well as carrots, apples or another horse treat to use as a reward during the process. You should also wear leather gloves and boots for safety. Make sure to show your horse your equipment, allowing them to touch, taste, and feel them before you begin training so that they do not become frightened by them., Horses are very sensitive to noise and emotion, and if you become impatient or try to work too quickly they may become resistant or even frightened. Throughout the process, speak soothingly to your horse, offering reassurance and praise. If you are not comfortable around large animals, take some time to practice simply interacting with your horse until you are at ease., While all horses are different, any horse will become frustrated and lose interest if you try to teach them too much in a single session. Limiting the length of each session will ensure that you don't stress your horse out, causing them to resist the training and potentially hurting your progress., You may wish to walk them around, guiding them with their lead rope, until they have had a chance to familiarize themselves with the environment. Once they are calm and attentive, listening to you and responding to your voice and gestures, you may begin training.

"
"
Stand in front of the horse.,
Offer a treat below the horse's nose.,
Begin incorporating commands.,
Gradually encourage the horse to reach further down.",How to Teach a Horse to Bow2," Hold the horse's lead rope loosely but securely in one hand. Leave the other hand free to stroke the horse, and to grab treats. You should keep the treats in a pocket well out of reach of the horse, so that it won't be tempted to reach and grab them.Remember to always retain control of the horse's treats, only allowing the horse to eat one when it does what you want. If the horse figures out it can get the treats from you without doing what you want, it may be very difficult to train.

, The idea is to encourage your horse to lower its head as far as it is willing to. Move the treat down, towards its feet, until it is reluctant to lower it further, then praise the horse and allow it to eat the treat. This will teach the horse to associate lowering its nose at your command with receiving treats.If the horse does not seem to understand, you can encourage it to lower its head with a light, constant tug downwards on its lead rope. Don't try to force the horse's head (it's stronger than you), and don't tug suddenly or violently on the rope.

, Now that the horse is able to reach down, you will want to start training it to do so on command. Continue practicing the excercise with a treat presented below the horse's legs, but start incorporating spoken commands along with the treats. Choose something short and simple like ""bow down"". State the command before you offer the treat between the horse's legs.Repeat the command throughout the exercise. Then reward and praise the horse.

, Accomplish this by holding the treat further and further towards the ground, rewarding the horse only when it lowers its head further than it did on the previous attempt. Repeat until the horse is bending its neck nearly to the ground, or even bending one of its front legs slightly."
"
Move to stand beside the horse's head and neck.,
Offer treats on the ground between the horse's front legs.,
Reward kneeling.,
Use commands consistently.,
Gradually remove treats from the practice.,
Reinforce your horse's training.",How to Teach a Horse to Bow3," Continue holding the lead rope. The horse may shift towards you, or swing its head to face you. Be patient, and use the lead rope to encourage the horse to stand sidelong to you. Once it is still, run the lead rope between the horse's front legs so that you can pull down on it while kneeling., If you must reach behind the legs to do so, make sure the horse can feel and see your arm. The horse may try to back up to avoid having to bend its knees to reach the treat. Do not reward this behavior, but insist that the horse remains still. If it can reach the treat without bending its knees, praise it and allow it to eat the treat, then repeat the process with the treat further back.Continue to use the lead rope to gently encourage the horse to lower its head.
If your horse is confused by this change, go back to reinforcing the earlier lesson from the front for a bit.

, Eventually, your horse should begin to bend one of its knees in an effort to reach the treat. This should be rewarded immediately. Be patient with your horse as it learns to kneel, since it is not a comfortable position for horses. Your horse may even stumble or fall while trying to kneel the first few times. Be encouraging, offering frequent rewards for obedience, and don't stress the horse out by forcing it to continue attempting the task for too long.The horse will naturally put one leg out in front of it as it kneels, and will lower its head beneath its body to reach the treat. Once the horse kneels to the ground you are ready to move on.
If your horse is reluctant to kneel you can use a second rope, tied around its foot, to gently encourage the horse to extend its leg and kneel. Simply apply gentle pulling pressure on the rope as you offer the treat below its nose.

, Do not change what command you are using, or alter it by adding words. Also, avoid repeating the command when you are not trying to get the horse to bow. This will help the horse associate the command with the task of bowing., As your horse begins to understand your command, you can begin alternating between using a treat during the exercise, and offering an empty hand, using the command and pressure from the lead rope to encourage the horse to bow.If your horse does not understand, or will not bow without a treat, continue training with treats and try again later.
Eventually, your horse should perform the bow simply upon receiving the command and receiving a little encouraging pressure from the lead rope. Continue praising and rewarding the horse each time it completes a bow.

, Just like people, horse's may forget tricks and skills you have taught them if they do not have a chance to practice them often. Even once you have moved on to teaching your horse other tricks, you should occasionally spend some time practicing kneeling and bowing, so that your horse's memory is fresh when it comes time to show the trick off.

"
"
React immediately.,
Utilize the pressure and release method.,
Stand your ground.,
Use your voice.,
Have the horse move backward.",How to Discipline a Horse Without Using Aggression1," When your horse participates in unwanted behavior, it is important to react within 2-3 seconds. Horses are only aware of immediate, in-the-moment reactions, so disciplining your horse at a later time will not help the horse understand that its behavior was unwelcome., Using the pressure and release method describes the methodical application of pressure to promote obedient behavior and is a nonaggressive way to correct your horse. Pressure must be applied with purpose and with a specific outcome in mind, and the key is knowing when to release the pressure. You should release immediately when the horse tries to correct its behavior. The horse will see this as a reward for listening to your command.


While in the saddle, you can apply pressure with your legs. If your horse does not want to stop, move your legs slightly behind where they usually rest and apply soft pressure with both knees to stop your horse.If a horse does not want to go left down a path, apply pressure with your right leg. Horses will move away from the side where the pressure is felt. In this case, the horse will begin to veer toward the left path.A horse should respond calmly when the release method is used correctly. With time, the horse will become more responsive and willing to listen to your commands., Use your body language and stance to let the horse know its behavior is unacceptable. Stand squarely in front of the horse and look it in the eye.This will assert that you are alpha, the horse’s leader. Remain calm so that the horse will respond to your behavior in a positive manner.

, When your horse needs to be disciplined, remain calm, and say a simple, but firm, “No.” Do not shout at the horse.Use this command consistently, and the horse will begin to understand that this means it needs to behave.

, Place your hand on the horse’s chest and calmly ask it to move back. Horses do not like walking backward, and using motion to gain control of your horse is a nonthreatening form of discipline."
"
Look for possible reasons that the horse may be taking advantage.,
Assess the extent to which the horse is taking advantage of you.,
Gauge your response according to the action.,
Give the horse an incentive to do what you need them to do.,
Remain calm in all situations.,
In some cases, the horse will be taking advantage of you because it thinks that it is the boss.",How to Deal With A Horse That Takes Advantage Of You," If there is a particular section of path that your horse bolts through, or a tree that your horse shies away from, try conquering their possible fear of that object or place by making it more common. If it is an object, show them the object every day in a calm manner to allow them to get used to it.;
, If the horse is bolting or rearing with you, then that can be considered more serious than a horse waiting for you to ask twice or three times before making a transition into trot.

, Something more serious will require you to enlist the help of an experienced trainer or instructor whereas something more trivial could be solved by yourself.

, If the problem was that the horse wasn't listening to a leg aid then use a whip after first asking to make it clear that you want them to go forward. If the horse passes a previously scary object give them a treat as a reward.

, If you become irate the horse will take your anger or fear as signal to be afraid and due to their impulse to flee danger the horse may become flighty and pose a bigger risk to both itself and you.

, You need to tell him in some way that you are the big man, and that they should be listening to you. If the horse walks in front of you repeatedly, lightly yank his halter at first. If this keeps happening, yank his halter harder and back him up. This shows the horse that you are in control. This varies depending on your situation, but the horse should always know that you are the boss."
"
Create a positive atmosphere.,
Shape the horse’s behavior.,
Practice consistency.,
Reward the horse for good behavior.",How to Discipline a Horse Without Using Aggression2," Demonstrate to the horse that it is in a positive atmosphere and that you are trustworthy. Pulling on the reins, kicking the horse’s side, raising your voice, or using your spur will only teach the horse that it is not pleasant to be around you.The horse will be less likely to respond to your commands and training efforts in a favorable manner if you are hostile, reactive, and harsh.


Be calm and consistent. If you speak to the horse in a calm manner, don't ride your horse when you are stressed, and practice consistency in the commands you give, the horse will relax, and eventually the relaxation will grow into trust., Shaping is a technique that is helpful for horses that do not know what response you are looking for.If you overstress what is incorrect, the horse’s excitement level will rise, which will interfere with its ability to think through and complete the command or exercise. When you use this technique, you gradually influence the horse to complete the desired behavior, rewarding it with praise each time it gets closer to completing the task. Slightly emphasize one of your cues to remind the horse of what you are asking it to do. This technique will minimize the horse’s confusion and distress.The shaping technique is useful when teaching your horse a new task. If you are training it to walk into a trailer, for instance, reward the horse for taking a few steps toward it. On the next go, you would reward the horse for walking up the ramp. Finally, reward the horse when the horse enters the trailer.This incremental system of rewards will help the horse understand your expectations.

, Consistency is key in training a horse and establishing good behavior. Be sure not to send your horse mixed signals by frequently changing your technique, cues, or expectations. If you are reprimanding your horse for a particular behavior, be sure to consistently correct it on each occasion. If you let it slide once, your horse may lose sight of the big picture and the lessons will be lost., If your horse completes a task correctly and does what you ask, give it a reward. Eventually, the horse will learn that it is beneficial and worthwhile to listen to your commands.The horse must believe that you care about it and its needs before it will perform the tasks you ask it to do.Reward a horse by stroking or scratching its neck or sides, praising it, or giving it a small piece of fruit or vegetable as a treat."
"
Remain calm.,
Speak to your horse in a calm voice.,
Refrain from interacting with a horse if you are stressed.",How to Discipline a Horse Without Using Aggression3," It can be frustrating when a horse is consistently misbehaving, but it is important to remain calm and steady. Horses will be able to sense when you are tense, stressed, or anxious. Be sure that your shoulders are relaxed and that your posture isn’t stiff with tension.


If your horse is biting or rears up, it is important to control your breathing to help you release any anxiety and fear. Steady your breathing by counting to 10 as you breathe in and out. Breathing deeply will help you control your emotions, help you remain calm, and will put your horse in a peaceful state as well.If you are feeling tense during your ride, do some stretches while in the saddle. Release your shoulders and slowly lift and lower your thighs from the saddle. When the horse has stopped moving, stretch your back forward toward the saddle horn and backward, and be sure to flex your ankles., Speaking in a pleasant, gentle voice has a calming influence on horses. A stern, low tone has been shown to increase a horse’s heart rate and cause distress.Be sure to speak to your horse in a calm, friendly manner to keep the horse's heart rate down and create a safe, pleasant environment.

, If you are angry or stressed, that is probably not the best time to work with your horse. Your horse will pick up on your mood and will react negatively.Understanding and controlling your own reactions, emotions, and moods will benefit both you and the horse.


Before working with a horse, imagine placing all your stress and the bad aspects of your day in a corner where they will stay during the remainder of your ride. This visualization technique can help you relax mentally so you can focus your attention to your horse.With time and consistency, this technique will help improve your ride and will provide an escape from the stress of everyday life.

Relax if your horse is acting up while you are riding.,
Check your riding position.,
Try riding him in a tight circle or a figure eight if your horse is still jumpy.,
Think about why your horse is misbehaving.,
Inspect the horse's tack.,
Consider that the girth may be rubbing.,
Check your horse's feet for any foreign bodies or for any swelling or bruising/ulcers.,
Try changing the way you are controlling the horse.,
Take off a crop, double bridle, or spurs if you're using them.,
Consult your veterinarian if the tack fits and you're riding well but the bad behavior continues.,
Spin the horse in a tight circle if you ever feel like you are out of control on a horse.",How to Get a Horse Under Control," Horses can sense nervousness and tension, and it will affect their performance. Even if you are nervous, scared, or tense, try not to let the horse know it.;
, Are you clenching the horse with your heels? This may cause him to go faster. Are you yanking on his mouth or holding your reins high and tight? Both of these things may confuse and/or agitate your horse. If you are doing something like this, fix it.

, Show him that you are the boss, but don't haul on his head. If you are riding in a group, get your instructor's permission to let you use the whole arena for a minute so you can get your horse under control.

, Is it storming or about to storm? Is something nearby making a loud noise? Is another horse crowding him? If none of these things are happening, keep reading.

, If you find any of the following defects in the tack, replace it immediately. Check for:


Worn-out leather that might rub
Pieces of tack that are too tight or too loose
Sharp objects embedded in or rough edges on the saddle

, Try a different type of girth and see if his behavior improves. If he is wearing a breast collar, see if it is too tight (it may be pinching him) or too loose (it may be bouncing around and annoying or rubbing on him). Ideally, you should be able to fit about four fingers under the breast collar. The bit may also be pinching his mouth or too strong for him. If you have a gently curb or snaffle bit, stick with it, but if you have a stronger curb, kimberwick, or gag, consider switching to a gentler bit.

, These can cause the horse to not want to move for you., Remember, every horse is different. If you usually ride a horse that needs strong cues and you have gotten in the habit of practically kicking to make him speed up, consider that this horse may not need such an aggressive kick. Try using softer aids and don't pull so hard on his mouth.

, They may scare the horse, annoy him, or he just may dislike them. The horse may not need artificial aids.

, Maybe the horse has a sore back or other physical problem, especially if this behavior is out of character for him.

, Don't panic! Just make sure your actions are clear to him and that what he is doing will not get him anywhere.

Maintain your personal space.",How to Train a Horse to Respect You," Before you can train a horse to respect you, you need to know what respect (and disrespect) looks like. Obviously, if your horse is biting, kicking, or rearing, then you have a respect issue, but there are also more subtle signs, like bumping you with his shoulder, tossing his head, or nudging you with his nose.You can tell your horse respects you if:You can lead your horse on a loose rope beside you, walking side by side with 3 to 4 feet between you and your horse. You should not be pulling your horse.Your horse follows you when you back up or walk forward. You may need to prompt your horse, especially for backing up. Lift the lead rope high and rhythmically bump your horse’s neck to get his attention.
Your horse moves his head away when you walk into his face area. You may need to give your horse some direction by pointing your finger or holding up the lead rope. If your horse moves his head into you, you have a respect problem.
Your horse moves his hindquarters away when you walk to his rear. If your horse moves to block you with his shoulder, then you have a respect problem.;
, Horses in a herd naturally establish a hierarchy. The head horse is the one who can get the other horses to move on command. So if you step out of the way when your horse swings its head into your space, or if you let your horse push up against you, then you are communicating to your horse that you are a follower and he is the leader., It’s good to love your horse, but love alone will not produce respect. If you pet, brush, and give treats to your horse without ever asking him to move or doing anything to establish a mutually respectful relationship, you’re going to end up with a horse that shows all the signs of disrespect: tossing its head, pushing you, and maybe even biting., To earn your horse’s respect, you will need to be his leader. That means training your horse to move on cue. The more easily you can get your horse to move his feet, the more your horse respects you. And no matter how well-trained your horse is, if he doesn’t respect you, you will have problems controlling him., With dangerous horses, in situations where you need to protect the horse, yourself, or others, a physical reprimand may be necessary. If you do reprimand your horse physically, be sure to continue until he steps out or your space, or you will have failed to assert dominance. Generally, though, you should use gentler training techniques that help to foster trust and companionship between you and your horse., Especially when first training your horse, keeping him busy responding to your cues will help cut off any unwanted behavior. Whenever your horse’s attention drifts or he shows signs of disrespect, practice yielding to pressure, backing, and waiting to enter your space. Let him know that not being respectful means hard work!, As well known horse-trainer Clinton Anderson notes, “Horses don’t stay the same. Every day they either get a little bit better or a little bit worse.”Don’t think that you can train your horse once and expect perfect behavior from that day on. Horses need repetition to reinforce appropriate behavior. Even after your horse has mastered the drills below, keep incorporating them into your interactions.


Ask your horse to yield to pressure several times when tacking him.
If your horse drags behind or gets too far in front of you when walking on a lead, stop and back him up.

, Teaching your horse that you are both safe and a joy to be around will make training for respect much easier. Every chance you get, rub your horse all over his body, scratch his itchy spots, and generally show you love him. If your horse objects when you rub an area, back off and return to it slowly. When your horse accepts being rubbed with your hands, try other objects like ropes, saddle pads, and bridles., When a horse A pushes horse B, and horse B gives ground, then horse A has just communicated dominance. You need to practice doing the same with your horse, so that when you press on any part of his body, he gives way. This not only helps establish respect, it is also very useful in handling your horse on a daily basis.Start with your horse’s poll (the head just behind the ears), pressing down until your horse lower his head, even if it takes several minutes. Keep practicing until your horse lowers his head quickly every time you apply light pressure.
The goal is for your horse to yield to light pressure. Don’t push to hard. And even if it takes more pressure at first, lighten the pressure as your horse learns, so that eventually he is moving away at a touch.Move on to the shoulder, hip, barrel, muzzle, legs, and other parts of the body. Make sure your horse is responding correctly every time you apply pressure before moving on.
Keep up practice with all parts of your horse’s body, combining your practice with rubbing your horse as in the previous step. Spend 5 minutes a day rubbing your horse, asking him to yield to pressure, rubbing so more, and then asking again, etc.

, A quick, responsive back up is the foundation of training a horse to respect you and your space.Teaching to back on cue will take time and several sessions, but is worth it.Stand 3 feet in front of your horse, holding a slack lead rope. Be sure it does not become taut at any point during the exercise.
Hold up the lead rope while you point with your finger. Wiggle the lead rope gently back and forth.
If your horse does not walk backward, wiggle harder. Continue wiggling harder until you are jerking the horse’s halter enough for it to be uncomfortable. The goal is not to cause pain, but mild discomfort.
As soon as your horse steps backward, stop wiggling. Pet and praise your horse.
Keep practicing until your horse backs at only a slight wiggle of the lead rope, or even at a wiggle of your finger.
Steadily increase the distance you ask your horse to back before rewarding him – 2 feet, then 4, 6, 8… up to 10 or 20 feet., This is a very important lesson to teach and then constantly reinforce. Whenever, your horse misbehaves, you can use this exercise to calm him and reestablish your dominance.


Once your horse has mastered backing up, hold the lead rope and wiggle it until he has backed 10 feet from you.
Wait. If your horse stars towards you without a cue from you, immediately ask him to back up to 10 feet again. Continue this until your horse can wait patiently.
Cue your horse to come to you. Wiggle the lead rope to ask him to stop 3 feet away. Once he is stopped, pet him and give praise.
Once your horse has mastered this, make it more difficult by turning your back or moving after your horse has backed away to 10 feet.
Keep practicing. Whenever your horse becomes disrespectful, you can ask him to back away and wait for your cue. If he walks ahead of you when leaving the stall, or nudges you for a treat, back him up., Even after you’ve trained your horse to wait and back up on command, you’ll still need to maintain command on a daily basis in all situations. In particular, you need to be careful not to let your horse push you around. If you have taught him to yield to pressure and back up, this will be easier.


If your horse swings his head towards you, touch his jawbone to ask him to yield. If he does not, push with force. Don’t let him push you around.If your horse tries to step on you, move in front of your horse and ask him to back and wait.If your horse attempts to bite you, immediately ask him to back away. If you are in a stall, slap his neck to show displeasure, then move in front of him and make him back away in the stall. Even a step will do.

Tip: Never give your horse treats when he nuzzles you. This can lead to nipping."

Plan what you are going to say.,
Watch for an inviting body position.,
Approach the horse from the front side.,
Become the leader.,
Approach the horse calmly.,
Use short words.,
Be consistent.,
Communicate with your body language.,
Watch your tone.,
Keep your talking to a minimum.,
Give your horse a chance to respond.,
Read your horse’s body language.,
Watch your horse’s facial expressions.,
Listen to your horse’s sounds.",How to Talk to Your Horse," When you communicate with your horse, it is important to remain calm. If you don’t come in knowing what you want to do, you will likely fall back on feelings and instincts. This will make you more likely to panic or overreact to a horse’s actions, rather than remaining calm and in control., When you come near a horse, you want to make sure he is willing to talk to you. If the horse wants to talk to you, he will turn his head or front toward your, lick his lips, and soften his eyes. Once you get this signal, you can approach the horse slowly and start communicating further.


Your horse may do the opposite, turning his head away from you, walking away, or even ignoring you. If the horse isn’t interested in letting you in, he won’t be responsive to what you say.

, Horses have monocular vision, meaning they can’t see directly in front of their noses. Make sure you walk toward a horse from the side so he can see you clearly. Never approach a horse from behind. Horses can’t see in that direction, and you are at risk of getting kicked if they get spooked., Make sure your horse recognizes that you are the leader of his herd. If he doesn’t recognize you that way, he won’t listen to what you are saying. If your horse doesn’t seem to be showing proper respect, make him move his feet. Pushing on his shoulder or hip should do well on most occasions. If you need a little more power, you can poke him with the handle end of a crop. Just make sure you stand in the same place when you do this, and don’t shuffle your feet.A horse that doesn’t respect you will rub his head on you, nip to get your attention, or walk in front of you when you are trying to lead him. These are not behaviors he would show to a dominant leader of his herd.

, Horses are prey animals, meaning that in the wild they are hunted by others, and your horse considers you a predator. This means he will consider any outsider to be a threat, including you. Learn to approach the horses calmly so they regard you as someone walking through the herd rather than a potential predator., When you give commands, use clear words with fewer than three syllables. Horses don’t speak English, so when you use longer, more complicated words, that will only confuse them. Short simple words like “Trot” or “Whoa” are easier to remember, and more recognizable to a horse’s ears. Shorter commands will also help you to be consistent when speaking., When you speak and give commands, make sure you repeat yourself regularly. Otherwise the horse will get confused over what you are saying and what you want him to do.Even a small change like adding the horse’s name to the command changes what the horse hears. “Whoa” and “Whoa, Silver” are different things to the horse’s ears, so resist the temptation to address your horse by his name when giving a command.

, Horses are visual animals, and communicate much more through body language than verbalizing. By sending the right signals while speaking, you can get your horse to better listen to you when you speakActive body language is more assertive, and good to do when you are giving commands. Square your shoulders to the horse, and look him directly in the eye. If you want to further emphasize the need to do something, lean forward toward the horse, and have a stern look on your face. This is a more assertive stance, which lets the horse know he needs to move his feet.
When you want the horse to relax, keep your body language more passive. Don’t square your shoulders or look him in the eye. Instead, relax your shoulders and maybe even cock one of your legs. This is a more relaxed stance for you, and lets your horse know he can relax when you tell him to calm down.

, Keep your voice calm and firm, and use it to reinforce your body language. This kind of language is more for you, to help remind yourself to remain calm and in control when talking to your horse.Make sure you speak normally around your horses, and avoid only whispering. The only thing that will happen is that your regular voice, or any other voice, will startle the horse and he will react with fear., You want your horse to associate your voice with giving commands. If you talk constantly to and around your horse, he won’t learn to associate your voice with anything in particular, and will start to tune you out. Make sure to limit your communication to necessary points, and make sure your horse follows those commands., When you give your horse a command, he may not follow through right away. Rather than punishing him for not immediately responding, wait a few seconds to see if he will follow. If he doesn’t give the command again with more force, such as a kick or push., Horses communicate mostly using body language, and understanding your horse’s activity and position will let you know a great deal about how he is feeling and how receptive he will be to your talking. Keep an eye on the way your horse is using his tail and legs, which should be easy to spot, even from a distance.The horse’s tail will be held high if he is alert or excited, or low if he is feeling tired, afraid, or in pain. Be careful if his tail is swishing around, as that is a sign that the horse is irritated, and probably won’t be receptive to you.
If your horse is lifting or pawing his legs, that is a sign of frustration or fear. Stamping can indicate a mild threat, or the horse could be getting rid of flies biting his legs.
The horse’s whole body is something else to keep an eye on. Nervous horses will either be very tense and rigid, or shaking. If you see a horse doing this, step away for a few minutes to give him a chance to calm down., Horses use their heads and faces to communicate as well. Watch the way your horse moves his head, eyes, and ears to determine his mood.Good facial expressions from a horse include having his ears forward or relaxed, eyes open and bright, and their head held high.
Some negative facial expressions include your horse’s ears being pinned backwards, as well as showing the whites of his eyes.
Watch for your horse having his jaws open with teeth exposed, as this is also a sign of aggression.

, Making noises is one of several ways your horse communicates. You won’t want to try and mimic these sounds, but they can be useful is determining your horse’s mood.Sighing, drawing a deep breath and letting it out slowly, can be a sign of relief or boredom. If it comes while being groomed or massaged, it is a sign that he is feeling good. If it comes while doing exercises, it is a sign of boredom, and you might consider doing something different to keep your horse interested.
Groaning can be a sign of pain, either from a rider or activity, or even from some internal stress. Unless your horse is only groaning while going over jumps, like an athlete grunting during a game, check for injuries or other health problems.
Nickering, a soft sound made with the mouth closed, is usually a signal of happiness or anticipation. It is a common noise horses make with one another. If accompanied, though, by fearful body language like pacing, flicking ears, and eye rolling, then it means your horse is feeling threatened.
Blowing or snorting is a sound of excitement. In general, this is a good sound, though once you start exercising with the horse he should calm down. If he is still snorting, be prepared for him to try sudden movements. Try and calm the horse down with some sudden halts, and other signals that you are in charge.
Neighing is a varied sound, so when you horse neighs you’ll need to also carefully watch his body to see what he is thinking. A confident horse will make a bugling sound, and be combined with forward-pricked ears, looking forward, and a slightly lifted tail. A nervous horse’s neigh will be higher pitched, and usually be accompanied by pacing, sweating, flickering ears, and a lifted tail.

Be aware that horses are mirrors.,
Note that some horses are difficult whether you have a good attitude or not.,
Choose an older horse if you're inexperienced.,
Research the best method of controlling your emotions, and becoming confident.,
Bear in mind that your horse is not a human, and does not think the same way you do.,
Be more of a leader than a friend.,
Learn gradually and methodically.,
Be careful of what people term ""abuse."",
Value trust over pandering to the horse's fears.",How to Behave Around a Horse," If you are angry, they will be difficult or scared. It takes a very strong human to overpower a very strong horse, and even if the human wins, it's not always for the better. The relationship with your horse should always be as fair as possible.


For example: Say that you are emotionally wired and you try to approach your horse. He's difficult to catch, and when you do catch him, he's jumpy and/or angry. This is because he's feeding off a negative energy source. He feels insecure and wants nothing more to get away from you. This means you should take a moment, step away from your horse, and relax. Taking deep breaths and leveling your emotions will likely result in a much better behaved horse.;
, Sometimes this is genetics, how their mother raised them, or how a human has handled them in the past. It takes dedication, faith, and a lot of working on manners before your horse will listen to you. It is just like working with a human on their communication skills, only you absolutely need to listen to your horse.


You must be advanced in managing your emotions and tenseness, because if you're not, you could wind up losing your horse, or either of you fatally injured.

, An old horse that has been through it all is a good start for beginners. Look for a horse that isn't fussed if you're unsure how to feed him or put a bridle on the correct way but remains sturdy and relaxed as you fuss about him. A horse like that can be hard to find, but they are the best teachers. They are the horses who care enough about humans to help them learn, despite the mistakes and miscommunications humans make with them.


There is no breed that has more of this type of horse than the other. There are old, experienced horses everywhere. You must listen to the vibe you get from your horse to see if it's your match or not.
Some breeds are bred purposefully to be high-strung and snorty. This doesn't mean you should listen to the stereotypical things like ""Saddlebreds are so flighty,"" or ""Arabs are crazy."" Because not all of the horses in those breeds are flighty or crazy. Just like not all quarter horses are dull. Know what you like, and look for it in the horse itself, not in the breed it relates to.

, Mediation is one of the best methods for getting in touch with yourself and learning to be more confident within. With horses, acting more confident won't work, because horses are adept at reading body language. However, this does not mean that if a horse is threatening to kick or charge you, you can't discipline them and move on. Although he won't see your confidence, he will see that you're strong, and likely won't mess with you much more.


Never hold a grudge against a horse. Horses have built-in responses, meaning that your horse might pin his ears at the sight of a saddle, simply because he knows it means work. However, he doesn't spend his stall time thinking about how much he hates saddles and what he's going to do the next time he sees one. Out of sight, out of mind.

, There are countless times you may see people treating their horses as humans, and talking to them as if the horse really understands what they're talking about. Although it's good to talk to your horse, it's not good to keep screaming ""I don't know why you're acting this way, after all I've done for you!"" as if your horse understands. Horse language is body language, and that is extremely important to remember if you decide to own a horse--especially a difficult one. Knowing their body language (which takes time and patience) is better than the horse knowing your vocabulary. However, horses can be trained to respond to commands such as ""trot,"" although they are not equipped with the same thought process to listen to every word that's said and understand.

, Be both, but horses respond better to leaders, because they know their place in the ranking system. Horses work as a hierarchy, and at the top is, you guessed it, a leader. Next is an enforcer (side-kick of the leader) and so on and so forth. Most horses will bow willingly to a calm, assertive, fair leader, but others are determined to outrank everything. With problem horses like that, it takes a lot of patience and extreme levels of strength and managing your emotions.


To be a leader doesn't mean you have to beat your horse regularly or be emotionless. In fact, when a horse does something good, shower them with praise and good feelings, because it reinforces the action. Discipline your horse when he behaves badly; do so in a fair, assertive way, and then move on. Catch the horse before he does something wrong and correct him by distracting him, or giving him a warning cluck or whatever command you choose for ""pay attention.""

, It takes trial and error to determine what method of discipline, and how much to use, works for your horse. It takes a good trainer/owner to know that each horse is an individual and should be treated as such. Some horses need a light tap with a whip to move, while others may need a discussion about paying attention to what your commands are. If you are listening to your horse, he should be listening just as much to you. If he can get away with anything, he will.


Find out what method and how much of that method gets your horse to respond, and stick with it. The greater the disobedience, the bigger the punishment, and then it's over. Once your horse is doing what he should be again, the pressure of your discipline should evaporate immediately.
Remember this: as long as you are trying to listen to your horse, and your horse is listening to you, it's a start. Always remember to let your horse be who he is, not who you want him to be. If he hates a saddle on his back, get him to the point where he can have a saddle on his back (and possibly show, if you really want him to), and then try harness, or halter.
Sometimes the horse you're dealt isn't cut out for what you want, and that's okay. As long as you are listening, and fair, you can make a horse do anything, including what he doesn't want to do. That's what training a horse is; taking a horse and making him do exactly what he doesn't want to. The trick is doing it in such a way that the horse realizes it's not so bad--especially if they have a good trainer/owner! Trust is everything. If you trust that you can take a wild, abused mustang from pasture and turn him into a well-mannered, happy, trusting show-horse in the next one or two years, then it will most likely happen.

, Some people may think that ""training the horse to do what he doesn't want to"" is abuse. The reality is that it is more dangerous to leave them unhandled and distrustful. Not only is it unfair, it's dangerous for you and the horse's safety.


For example, a barn catches fire, and the owner must get her horse out. However, the horse has an affliction to being caught, and puts up a fight about her entering the stall in a rush to get him. The owner can't just rush her horse out of the barn without being caught because there's a highway just outside, and he may get hit if he's loose. But the horse is bucking, kicking, and refusing her attempts to save him. This is a situation where it would have been a good idea to train the horse to trust being caught in a calm, submissive manner before something dangerous happened.

, There are many situations like the one described in the previous step, where the owner is desperate to handle the horse in a way he doesn't approve of, and can get him/herself or the horse hurt. It's important to teach the horse to face his fears and walk near a bag that blows in the wind without shying into your body space, and to trust you, because one day you will seriously need his trust. Follow whatever path you choose and whatever method you think is best, but always be certain you have your horses trust, and that you trust your horse.

Pay attention to his ears.,
Examine his head carriage.,
Watch his muzzle.,
Notice when he stomps or paws at the ground.,
Watch his tail.",How to Tell if a Horse Is Frightened1," The position of a horse's ears says a lot about his mood.If his ears are flicking back and forth, your horse is probably frightened or overly stimulated. He is flicking his ears around to pinpoint the source of his anxiety.
If his ears are perked forward, he is alert and interested in his surroundings.
If his ears are pinned back tightly, he is angry or feeling aggressive and may be preparing to lash out with a kick or bite.
If his ears are turned outward to the sides, he is relaxed and not paying attention to his surroundings. Be careful not to startle him by approaching or reaching out toward him suddenly.;
, When a horse suddenly raises his head when being ridden, he is examining something far away and is no longer paying attention to you. He may be preparing to bolt or shy away from something.If your horse raises his head high while rounding his back, swishing his tail, or pinning his ears back, he may be in pain. Stop and check his legs and around his tack to be sure nothing is hurting him.

, When your horse curls his upper lip while breathing in and out, he is examining a scent in the air. This may be a sign that something in the immediate environment is causing him stress., Your horse may be simply trying to get rid of a pesky fly, but it might be something more serious.Pawing at the ground with a raised leg usually indicates boredom or restlessness.
Excessive stomping may mean your horse is annoyed with you for some reason. If you don't resolve the situation, your horse may move on to more extreme behavior next.

, Horses communicate using body language, and the tail is a good indicator of mood. If your horse is slowly flipping his tail from side to side, he is probably just trying to swat a fly. But quick tail flips, or a clamped-down tail, indicate stress.A horse clamps its tail down by tucking it lower into its hindquarters. If your horse is pressing his tail down against his body, this is a sign that he is nervous or frightened.
If your horse is jerking his tail rapidly up and down or side to side, he is probably irritated or angry and may be about to buck or kick.

Groom your horse.,
Massage your horse.,
Rub your horse with different objects.",How to Show Your Horse That You Love Him1," Grooming is a great way to show your horse you love him. Grooming your horse every day is ideal, as well as before and after you ride him. Keep in mind that grooming is not a ‘one size fits all’ activity, so you will need to learn what grooming tools your own horse prefers, as well as how he likes for them to be used on his body.Grooming your horse is also a good way to detect any abnormalities on your horse’s body that may need further medical attention.There are many available grooming tools, such as hoof picks, combs (curry combs, mane and tail combs), brushes (dandy brush, body brush), and cloths (towel or polishing).A curry comb is used to remove dirt and debris in your horse's coat and/or skin. Move it in small and gentle swirls on your horse's body. The mane and tail comb should be used very gently on your horse's mane and tail to prevent pulling too much hair out.A dandy brush is used in a flicking motion to flick dirt off of your horse's coat.The body brush can be used all over your horse's body,but you should pay attention to his sensitive spots.
Learning what grooming tools to use on your horse, and how, may take a period of trial and error.
When you groom your horse, start on one side of him. With slow and gentle strokes, begin grooming at the top of his neck and work your down to his tail. Switch sides and repeat.Be attentive to your horse’s body language (e.g., muscle tensing, stepping back)—he will let you know if there are areas of his body where he does not want to be groomed.
Talking to your horse in a calm voice can help him feel comfortable with you grooming him.
Consider talking with an equine groomer or your equine veterinarian if you feel unsure about grooming your horse properly.;
, Massaging your horse strengthens your bond with him and has many benefits, including soothing his sore muscles,, improving his circulation and muscle tone,, and calming his nervous system.There are a variety of equine massage methods. Whichever method you choose, your horse will likely appreciate your effort to massage him.


An easy way to massage your horse is to use broad strokes with the palm of your hand and massage him in the direction of his muscles.Use your own body weight to apply pressure as you massage him, but make sure not to push him. Pay attention to your horse to know how much pressure he is comfortable with.A basic understanding of equine anatomy will help you give your horse a better massage. Talk to your equine veterinarian to learn more about equine anatomy.
Do not massage your horse if he has certain medical conditions, such as a fungal skin infection or nerve irritation.Talk with your veterinarian to find out if your horse's medical condition makes a massage impractical.

, Even if your horse loves when you touch with him your hands, he should also become comfortable with other objects touching him. Practice gently rubbing him with a saddle, ropes, and bridles.In essence, rub him with any object that you would regularly use on him.


The more time you spend getting him comfortable he is with different objects on his body, the more he will trust you.As with other ways of touching him, read your horse’s body language as you rub him with different objects.

Listen for a snort.,
Pay attention when your horse blows.,
Disregard a nicker.,
Analyze the situation when your horse squeals.,
Disregard a neigh or whinny.",How to Tell if a Horse Is Frightened2," When your horse snorts, he holds his head high with his mouth shut, and exhales forcefully through his nose. This causes a loud fluttering sound in the nostrils which lasts for about a second.Snorting indicates your horse has identified a potential danger, and is investigating it.
If your horse shies away from something after snorting, this indicates fear.

, Blowing is similar to snorting, but without the loud flapping sound in the nostrils. It makes a softer sound.Horses do this when they are curious about something, or when meeting another horse.
If the horses get along, they will calmly continue to snort in greeting. If they feel threatened, one or both animals will squeal or nip at the other.
If your horse blows and then becomes tense or shies away from an object, he is showing signs of fear.

, When your horse nickers, his vocal chords emit a vibrating sound through his closed mouth. This does not indicate fear – it is a greeting directed at a person or another horse., When your horse squeals, he creates a noise that can either be short and soft, or long and loud. A loud squeal can be heard from quite far away.


A squeal indicates resistance to something – your horse may not be afraid, exactly, but he is not happy about what he's being asked to do.

, A neigh is a very long sound that is the combination of a squeal and a nicker. A horse neighs when he is separated from other horses.


A whinny or neigh does not indicate fear. Your horse is trying to determine where his companions are.
When another horse hears a neigh, he will usually whinny in return. This lets the first horse know he isn't alone.

Remain calm.,
Use a one-rein stop.,
Face the danger, but allow him to back away from it.,
Control the reins.,
Avoid gripping with your legs.,
Avoid the scary object.,
Praise your horse if he is under control.,
Avoid praise while your horse is panicking.,
Dismount.",How to Tell if a Horse Is Frightened3," Horses can detect fear in humans. Your horse will become even more afraid if he senses that you are worried about a situation., Pull your horse's head back toward your foot, using only one rein. This will often stop a horse more effectively than by using two reins., Don't try to turn your horse away from the object that spooked him – he is more likely to panic because he can no longer see the threat.Point your horse's head toward the worrisome object, so he can get a clear look at it. #*Meanwhile, allow your horse to back away or step to the side.

, Avoid tugging or pulling at the reins, which will only make your horse more anxious. Keep your horse under control with gentle pressure., Retain your balance as best you can without gripping too tightly with your legs. This will reassure your horse that you are in control of the situation.Push gently on your horse's neck or withers, which will help loosen your legs while anchoring you in the saddle.

, Don't force your horse to go over and confront the water jug or fallen lead line, or whatever is scaring him. Your horse will probably panic, and it will damage the trust he has in you., If your horse seems to be afraid, but is still allowing you to control him, be sure to praise his behavior. Speak in a calm, reassuring tone of voice., Don't praise your horse while he is shying away from something, or you will reinforce a behavior you don't want., If your horse is truly in a panic and you are unable to bring him under control, jump to the ground and get to safety. A frightened horse can cause very dangerous situations."
"
Desensitize your horse to harmless things that frighten him.,
Try gradually riding closer.,
Praise your horse if he is under control.,
Work with a trainer.",How to Tell if a Horse Is Frightened4," If your horse often spooks at a particular type of object, like tarps or bicycles, try “following.” This may help your horse become accustomed to these objects.Drag (or roll) the object around in front of your horse, leading away from him. Allow your horse to follow you.
Don't approach your horse with the object, or drag it towards him – this will probably frighten him.
Pull the object around calmly, until your horse becomes curious and comes to explore it. This may help get rid of his fear of this type of object.

, One way to help your horse become accustomed to a particular scary object in the ring is to gradually direct him closer to it., If your horse seems to be afraid, but is still allowing you to control him, be sure to praise his behavior. Speak in a calm, reassuring tone of voice.Place the scary object at the far end of your ring or paddock, and ride your horse in small circles in the center of the ring.
Gradually ride in wider circles until you are closer to the object. Don't get so close that your horse spooks.
Praise your horse for remaining in control, and repeat the exercise another time. Ride closer to the object each time.

, If you don't have much experience with horses, find a local trainer who will work with you and your horse together, to establish trust between you. A good trainer will assign exercises you can do with your horse, to strengthen the bond between horse and rider."
"
Lead your horse.,
Teach your horse to yield to direct pressure.,
Teach your horse to yield to indirect pressure.,
Practice leading and applying pressure each day.",How to Show Your Horse That You Love Him2," In the herd, horses are natural followers.Within the herd, one horse needs to be a leader. In your relationship with your horse, your horse should see you as his leader. One way to establish the leadership role with your horse is to lead him.


It may not seem like asserting your leadership is showing your horse you love him. However, horses need boundaries and leadership. When he sees you as a good leader who will be attentive to his needs, he will trust you and feel safe with you.Lead your horse from various positions—the lead position (ahead of your horse), partner position (beside your horse), and drive position (behind his withers).Leading your horse teaches your horse to respect your personal space.
As you lead your horse, be assertive, yet gentle, with him when maintaining and establishing the boundaries of your personal space., Yielding to pressure is another way for your horse to see you as his leader.Horses use pressure with each other to assert dominance.Therefore, when you apply pressure to him, you are asserting your dominance over him—once again establishing your leadership role.


Use your hands to apply pressure on your horse’s body. The pressure should be gentle yet firm—not enough to push him, but enough to make him a little uncomfortable.
Do not release the pressure until your horse has moved away from it.Practice applying direct pressure to different parts of his body (e.g., shoulder, muzzle, legs)., Indirect pressure involves the use of driving aids, such as a lead rope, to get your horse to yield.Practice this by standing about three feet in front of your horse, with his lead rope attached to his halter. Point your index finger at him and begin to wiggle the lead rope. Your horse should begin to move backwards.Your horse may not understand what you are trying to get him do to the first time around. He may stand there, or move to the side. Wiggle the lead rope with more force until he steps back, or at least leans backwards.Stop wiggling the lead rope as soon as makes the backward motion.

, It may take some time for your horse to learn that you are his leader and that he should respect your personal space. Practice for a few minutes each day until your horse readily and consistently accepts your leadership role with him."
"
Feed your horse a good diet.,
Give your horse treats.,
Schedule regular horse care.,
Provide him with comfortable housing.,
Exercise your horse.,
Talk to your horse.",How to Show Your Horse That You Love Him3," A great way to show your horse you love him is to feed him high-quality food and provide him with access to plenty of fresh water. Your horse’s dietary needs will vary according to his age, size, activity level, and medical condition.Meeting his dietary needs will help your horse live a happy and healthy life.


Grass and hay are essential to a horse’s diet—they provide roughage that helps move food through his digestive system. Bermuda grass and fescue are good types of grasses to feed your horse.Alfalfa hay is a great hay to feed your horse. Make sure the hay is green, clean (no dirt or weeds), and free of mold.Your horse should eat about 1.5% of body weight in roughage each day.Horses can eat grain, but too much of it can cause digestive problems and weight gain.Limit your horse’s grain intake to four to eight pounds per day, spread out over several meals.Oats are good type of grain to feed your horse on a limited basis.Salt licks add extra minerals to your horse’s diet. As long as he has access to plenty of fresh water, you do not need to be concerned with him eating too much salt.Pelleted horse food contains a good mix of grains, molasses, vitamins, and minerals. However, pellets can be expensive.Allow your horse to graze as much as possible. Constant access to grazing is preferable., Your horse will love when you give him treats! However, treats should be given only in moderation.Also, the treats should be nutritious.Apples are a great, healthy treat for horses. Apples have fiber (which provides roughage) and vitamin C (thought to be important for older horses). Applesauce may be suitable for horses with finicky appetites.Maple syrup is a sweet treat that is an energy source and contains potassium and calcium.Honey is another healthy sweet treat. It contains vitamin B and is rich in minerals and antioxidants.Be mindful that hand-feeding treats may lead to your horse nipping at you.Feeding treats should be strategic (e.g., a reward during training).If you give him treats during training sessions, you should work on phasing out the treats. A scratch on the chin can replace the treat and will still be rewarding to your horse., Showing your horse you love him also involves staying on top of his health. For example, your horse should receive a dental exam every six months. Poor oral health can lead to several problems in your horse, such as difficulty eating, colic, and poor athletic performance.


Your horse’s hooves also need to be taken care of. You should clean them every day, as well as before and after every ride. Your horse’s hooves also need to be trimmed every four to six weeks.A farrier can trim your horse’s hooves if you are unable to do so.
To keep your horse healthy, he will also need to receive regular vaccinations (e.g., tetanus) and dewormings by your equine veterinarian.Vaccinations are typically administered on a yearly basis.Your horse’s deworming schedule may depend on the worm burden in your pasture, so talk with your equine veterinarian to see how often your horse should be dewormed.

, Depending on how you use your horse, he may end up spending a lot of time in his stall. His stall should be dry, safe, and provide protection from the elements (e.g., sun, wind, rain). In the summer months, his stall should also be able to provide him relief from biting insects.Given that your horse is on his feet for most of the day, the floor of his stall should be comfortable for him. Ideally, the floor should be comprised of multiple layers: a subfloor made of natural materials (e.g., crushed rock, wood, not dirt) and paved with concrete or asphalt, and a ‘top’ floor made up of rubber or plastic flooring.You will need to clean his stall every day.Supplying the stall with fresh hay, fresh shavings, and a bucket of water will make your horse’s stall more comfortable.If you have multiple horses, it is helpful to have the stalls arranged such that the horses can see each other., Horses are naturally athletic animals and need plenty of exercise. Exercise will help keep your horse healthy, calm, and happy.Individual exercise needs vary from horse to horse, but, at a minimum, you should exercise your horse for 30 minutes to an hour, three to four times a week.Giving your horse regular access to a paddock or pasture will allow him to casually stroll and get some low-intensity exercise.Riding your horse is also good exercise. A 10 to 15 minute trotting ride on a trail or in a riding ring is a good way to warm up your horse before more intense riding or training.You can ride your horse as often as four to six times a week, but he must be given at least one day a week of rest.It is important to cool down your horse after an intense exercise session. Cool him down by walking him until he relaxes and his heart rate slows down. Let him cool down before putting him back in his stall.Talk with your equine veterinarian to determine the right type and amount of exercise for your horse.

, Your horse will not know what you are saying, but the tone of your voice can influence your bond with him. For example, talking to him in a calm and soothing voice, especially if he is anxious or fearful, can help calm him down.Do not use a loud or high-pitched voice with your horse,especially when you are trying to correct bad behavior.
Your horse will appreciate if you talk to him in a low and soft-pitched voice.Your voice may need to be more firm when you are training him, but it should still be calm.

"
"
Create a balanced relationship with your horse.,
Do not feed him if he is acting aggressively.,
Treat your horse like a horse, not a dog.",How to Show Your Horse That You Love Him4," The relationship with your horse should have an equal amount of love, leadership, and language.Of these three, too much love and too little leadership from you can create a very spoiled horse.If your horse does not see you as his leader, he likely will not respect you. He is also unlikely to be responsible, since you did not set boundaries for him as his leader.Practice exercises that establish your leadership.
Ensure that his needs are taken care of, but do not overindulge him by feeding him a lot of treats or not disciplining him. His diet and training must have boundaries.

, If you notice that your horse’s ears are back, or if he is being pushy and forceful with you at feeding time, come back to feed him at a later time.If you feed him when he is acting aggressively, you will communicate to him that he is the boss. This will shift the balance of leadership from you to him.


Eventually, he will learn that he cannot act any way that he wants at feeding time.

, This may sound intuitive, but horses and dogs have a fundamentally different view of the world. Horses are prey animals and are motivated by safety and comfort. Dogs are predators and are motivated by attention and food.When you interact with a horse as if he were a dog—showering him with hugs and attention, for example—you are showing him way too much love and throwing off that part of your relationship with him.With all of this love and attention, your horse will think that you’ve given him free rein to push you around and assert his dominance.You will have much more trouble establishing your leadership if you interact with your horse as if he were a dog.

"
"
Investigate to find the cause because each horse is different.,
Once you have found the cause (or thought you have), try gradually giving the horse more pasture and/or herd time.,
If the horse continues his/her abnormal behaviour, it may have turned into a habit.,
Watch the horse carefully.,
Continue to gradually increase the outdoor activity and herd-time for another six weeks, if the abnormal behavior is still present.,
Speak with the barn/stable staff and/or all of the horse's handlers (and riders, if any) about their reactions to the horse's vices.,
Get the horse's feet and legs checked regularly for abnormal wear and tear caused by the stereotype behaviour.

,
Be patient.",How to Deal With a Horse That Has 'Movement Vices'," Generally vices related to movement (weaving, box walking, kicking) are caused by a lack of space. Watch the horse. Where does he/she perform the behaviour? In the field, in the stable (stall)? When does he/she perform it and what happens at, before, or after that time? Is it when other horses are taken away or brought in?;
, A healthy herd consists of males and females of varying ages, and has at least 7 members. However, simply having two or three herd mates to interact with is infinitely better than none.








Turn the horse out as much as possible with other horses. You can use pasture, a school (arena), a large barn or even a fenced yard if it’s safe.






Give ad-lib forage in small-mesh hay nets and put it in more than one place to imitate foraging. The small mesh requires the horse work harder to get the hay out, which increases the amount of time they spend eating without increasing the amount of food, which is good for the gut and for horses that finish hay quickly and then get bored. (It also cuts down on hay waste and stall cleaning time because the horse doesn't have the opportunity to spread it around and step on it while eating). Give different types of forage for variation and hide or hang fruits and vegetables in the stable.






If the horse must be stabled, make sure the horse has sight of other horses and preferably have a grill so the horse can touch noses with their neighbours. If you know the horses get on well you can stable them together in a suitable, safe barn.

, If you think this has happened, try creating a more pleasant environment for the horse. Pay attention to the things he/she likes, and what he/she does not like. Add interesting things to their space if they must be kept separate for any length of time, such as brushes to rub against on the wall, interactive toys to play with, and/or classical music playing in the background.








Try an edible distraction. Putting water, hay, a salt block or anything else the horse would like to eat at the place he normally performs the vice may or may not help.






Avoid use of anti-weave grills. These can be fitted to stables to force the horse to stop weaving; however this creates an even smaller, more claustrophobic space for the horse, which will only add to their stress, so this is highly discouraged!

, If the horse is not able to move freely or be with its herd, and the horse isn't permitted perform the vice, he/she will become even more stressed.


Try a very gradual approach to increasing outdoor activity and herd-time for about 6 weeks to give the horse time to adjust to the new situation.

, At some point, you may realize that the horse has other reasons to be stressed, which is why the behaviour has not gone away completely.


If a horse has been performing the abnormal behaviour for a long time, it may be because of trauma suffered at a young age (such as being weaned too early, or in an insensitive way). A horse that learned a behaviour early in life due to traumatic events may carry that behaviour until he/she learns that the behaviour is no longer necessary.
This is especially true with wall-kicking during feeding time, in which case you may need to try many different ways of feeding your horse to figure out the least stressful method. This could involve a floor pan instead of a bucket hung on the wall, or a different corner, or a nose bag instead of a bucket, or feeding within a wider window of time instead of exactly at the same time every day. Be creative and don't be afraid to try something if no one can give you a really good reason why you shouldn't.

, Do they pay more attention to the horse when he/she kicks, weaves or stall walks? Do they give the horse more hay if he/she kicks the wall? Do they yell, strike, throw water or objects or otherwise try to actively/physically discourage or stop the horse from the behaviour? Anything other than completely ignoring the behaviour when it happens may be reinforcing the behaviour.


If it turns out the people around the horse do try any of these tactics, ask them to change their responses. They should completely ignore the horse until the behaviour stops, and then as soon as it stops, they should put the horse out or let him/her have some quality herd-time. This may take many months of pretending to not hear the horse kicking or seeing them weave or stall-walk, but if everyone is consistent and the horse is receiving increasing outdoor and herd-time, the behaviours should subside. Be patient and diligent - horses are not machines, and sometimes it takes time for them to adjust to a healthier way of behaving.
In the meantime, protect walls and doors with wooden or rubber kick boards.

,, Remember that as your horse becomes more happy and stress free, the abnormal behaviour will fade into an occasional annoyance, and may possibly disappear altogether.

Read your horse’s ears.,
Read your horse’s head carriage.,
Read your horse’s eyes.,
Read your horse’s nose and lips.,
Read your horse’s mouth and teeth.",How to Understand Your Horse's Body Language1," Horses use their ears in a variety of ways to communicate. Your horse’s ears can either be forward, pinned, turned out to the side, turned back, or rapidly swiveling. Here is a guide to figure out what each movement means:


If your horse’s ears are positioned forward, this usually means your horse is relaxed. However, if they are sharply pricked forward this means your horse is alert and tuning into something that is either interesting or frightening.
If your horse’s ears are pinned flat against the back of its neck, this means your horse is angry and aggressive.If your horse’s ears are turned out to the side, this generally means your horse is relaxed or sleeping, and many not be attuned to what is going on around it. Be careful not to startle your horse when they are in this position. Instead, call their name or make a noise to rouse their attention.If your horse’s ears are pointed backward, but not pinned, this means your horse is trying to listen to something behind it. When combined with swishing tail or other signs of tension in the body, ears that are turned back might be a precursor to pinned ears.If your horse's ears are rapidly swiveling, i.e., flipping back and forth, this means your horse is in a heightened state of anxiety or alertness. Your horse may be trying to identify a frightening sound or smell.When a horse is relaxed, their ears will point in the direction of what they are paying attention to. This means that a horse with its ears pointing backward may just be paying attention to what's going on behind it without being angry or aggressive.;
, You can tell a lot about your horse’s mood by observing their head carriage. Your horse’s head carriage may be lowered, elevated, or snaking. Here is a guide to figure out what each position means:


If your horse’s head carriage is lowered, this is a sign of relaxation or a sense of feeling good. Its ears will often hang to the side when its head is in this position. Also, if your horse is in the stall, a lowered head position might indicate that your horse is sleeping. Be careful not to startle your horse.If your horse’s head carriage is elevated, the horse is in alert mode, and trying to decipher if it should flee, investigate, or ignore. To prevent your horse from bolting, try to regain its focus on you by saying its name.
If your horse’s head carriage is snaking, i.e., lowering its head slightly and swinging it back and forth, this is an aggressive act. This is a red alert. Try to diffuse the situation by refocusing its attention, leaving the area, or getting away from the horse., Your horse’s eyes indicate to you what your horse is thinking, as well as where its attention is focused. Your horse’s eyes may be relaxed, tense, darting rapidly, or your horse may be showing the whites of its eyes. Here’s a guide to understanding your horse’s eye movements:


If your horse is relaxed, its eyelids will be relaxed where you will be unable to see the whites of its eyes.
If see the muscles tighten around the eye, i.e., tightness around the corner of the eye or a wrinkled upper eyelid, this is an early sign of distress, fear, or discomfort.
If you see your horse’s eyes darting rapidly, i.e., flicking from side to side, this means he/she is scared and looking for a way to escape. And, if your horse feels trapped, it might react by biting or kicking.If your horse is showing the whites of its eyes, i.e., opening its eyes widely, it is only mildly alarmed or startled. However, in some breeds, like the Appaloosas and Pintos, the whites of the eyes are always visible. Therefore, it is only natural for the whites to show and it is not a sign of alarm., A horse’s nose and lips can communicate a lot about what it's feeling. Your horse’s nose and lips may be slack, curled, flaring, or tightly pinched or pursed. Here’s a guide to determine what each signal means:


If your horse is standing quietly with its lower lip drooping, i.e., slack, it is relaxed and/or might be sleeping. Approach your horse with caution so as not to startle it. However, if your horse is awake and its lower lip is still slack, this may be a sign of a neurological problem. If this happens, you should take your horse to the veterinarian.If your horse is curling its upper lip, also known as flehmen, it means that your horse is sniffing an unfamiliar smell. When a horse sniffs an unfamiliar smell, it raises its head, curls the upper lip, and breathes air through its mouth and back out through its nostrils.If your horse is flaring its nostrils, it means one of two things. It is either out of breath and trying to draw in more air, or, if it is accompanied with a quivering, then your horse is either nervous or startled. Your horse's nostrils should only be flaring if it's been working. If your horse has not been working, then flaring nostrils could be a sign that something is wrong. You should call out a vet to check on your horse.
If your horse’s nose and lips are tightly pinched or pursed (one of the more subtle gestures), then your horse is either worried, stressed, or scared. Try to diffuse the situation by moving your horse away from the area.

, You can also understand what your horse is feeling by observing its mouth and teeth. Your horse’s mouth and teeth may be grinding, clacking, or gaping. Here’s a guide to determine what each signal means:


Teeth grinding can be a sign of multiple things. Your horse could be stressed or experiencing pain or discomfort.
Clacking teeth is usually a communication tool used by younger horses, or foals. If a younger horse is clacking its teeth, it usually means it is signaling to other horses that it is just a baby and does not want to be hurt.A gaping mouth with visible teeth can mean several things. If your horse is showing its teeth combined with pinned ears and wide eyes, then it is displaying anger and might be seconds away from biting. If a horse is gaping while you are riding it, then the bridle and bit might be causing it pain. Finally, if your horse suddenly stops and opens its mouth with its neck stretched out while eating, it may be choking. Either try to remove the uneaten food or call a veterinarian immediately.
Horses are nasal breathers, so they should only be breathing through their nostrils. If your horse is attempting to breathe through its mouth, then something is wrong. Call a vet immediately.

Pin the tarp to the ground in advance.,
Put a rope halter on your horse.,
Walk your horse near the tarp.,
Walk onto the tarp yourself.,
Lead the horse on a circular path if necessary.,
Command the horse firmly as a last resort.,
Let the rope go slack.,
Walk the horse to the middle (optional).,
Repeat with daily sessions.,
Move on to more advanced training.",How to Teach Horses to Step on a Tarp in Hand," Secure it as tightly as you can in an area protected from wind, but within sight of the horse's exercise area. The less the tarp blows around, the better. Ideally, give the animal a few days to get used to this ""scary monster"" before you continue.


Before you continue, wait for a calm day when there is almost no wind to blow the tarp.;
, When walking the horse, a rope halter communicates your prompts better than a standard halter. You may use a standard halter instead, but make sure it fits the horse well so he can feel your prompts.


Make sure the horse is calm and comfortable. If the horse is restless, spend a few minutes grooming him, or speaking to him in a quiet voice.
Confirm that the lead rope is sturdy and well-attached.

, Lead the horse near the tarp but go easy on him for now. If he wants to stop and sniff or look at it, let him. Touch the tarp to show that it's not dangerous.


If the horse refuses to come near, walk around the tarp a couple times so he can examine it from all sides.

, Step onto the tarp to show that you're not scared of it. Face the horse and gently pull on the lead rope to see if he is willing to follow. Tell him to ""come ahead"" with a firm, pleasant voice. Praise the horse every time he takes a step closer, but don't force him to do so.

, If the horse balks at your invitation, walk him around the tarp instead. Start with large circles around the perimeter of the tarp, then bring the horse in closer with each pass. Eventually, the circle will cross the edge of the tarp and the horse should step on at an angle.

, If the horse continues to resist, pull firmly and repeat the ""come ahead"" command with a louder voice, but still a calm and encouraging tone. Stay alert as he may buck or rear depending upon his level of fear. Some horses may take quite a while to follow you.

, Take the pressure of the rope once the horse stands on the tarp, putting the horse ""at ease."" If it took a lot of effort to get to this point, or if the horse seems agitated, praise the horse, give him a treat, and call it a day.

, If your horse isn't too skittish, you may be able to walk him to the middle of the tarp. Stand there with your horse for a moment so he can see that he is safe. Walk him back across the tarp and off again, or walk back and forth a couple times if your horse is calm.

, This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several sessions, depending on the horse's temperament. Be patient and confident, since your horse picks up on your mood.

, When the horse is completely calm around the tarp, try a more advanced desensitizing exercise. Introduce these slowly and one at a time, or your horse could react violently:


Repeat this exercise on a day when the tarp is blowing slightly in the wind.
Hold a plastic bag at the end of a long stick, letting the horse examine it from a distance then from closer up.
Hold the tarp and approach very slowly. Once the horse is calm, rub the tarp against the horse's body.

"
"
Get a halter and long lead on your horse.,
Stand in front of your horse wile doing this next step.

,
Gently rub the stick on your horse's body, all around.,
If your horse gets scared and tries to run away, hold tight to your lead.

,
Hold your whip in the place that it was when your horse started to run.,
Repeat exposing your horse to the whip until the horse is completely relaxed with the whip being around his body.,
Instead of rubbing the stick and bag on your horse, try waving it in the air above your horse's head, behind his butt, to both his sides, and in-front of him.,
Repeat the waving process until you can wave the bag everywhere around the horse with little reaction from him.

,
Work on these exercise only until you get a good reaction (not running at first, hesitating more) about 2 or 3 times.,
Praise your horse when he does something right.

,
Try these next couple games, follow the rules above.",How to Spook Train a Horse," Tie a plastic bag on the end of a carrot stick. To be clear, a carrot stick is a training tool, not an actual carrot.;
,, Do this one both sides.

,, They probably ran because they didn't like that whip in that place. Keep your whip there until the horse settles down. If it seems like the horse REALLY isn't going to settle down, as soon as he hesitates to keep running, drop the whip and bow your head. This is a sign to the horse that to stop running is good.


You need to give your horse a rest. If you do this step a couple times and he hesitates to run or doesn't run right away, stop working with him. This will tell the horse what to do, and what not to do.
Only really work on this exercise for 10 min a day, if your horse is really spooky toward the whip. You can go longer for a not-so-spooky horse.

, Once you get your horse calmed around the whip, you can move on to Step 7.

, If your horse runs, repeat Steps 4 and 5.

,, If you have been working with your horse for a wile but he still does run a lot, try being more open about rewarding him for the right stuff he does.

,, You don't have to follow the games in order, but they are assembled in a logical order.


So first you did the bag and stick now try tying soda cans to baler twine and tie that on to a carrot stick. Also, you can try tying other objects, that fly in the wind or make sound, to the stick.
Lay a tarp down. On the corners of the tarp, place heavy objects down so that the tarp doesn't fly away. Have your horse walk over it. You can also place a tarp over jumps and you jump over the jump (have your horse on a lead) and have your horse follow you over the tarp covered jump.
Lay the tarp over your horse. and have him walk around.

Your horse might get very nervous around the tarp. Be careful
You can also have your horse in an enclosed area and you stand a ways away and wave the tarp(you can do this with other objects to). If your horse runs, keep waving the tarp. But as soon as he even hesitates, stop immediately and praise him.


Use a beach ball. Throw the beach ball in front of the horse, under the horse, and behind the horse. When the horse really gets used to the beach ball, try throwing it over the horse. Even stand in front of the horse and roll it toward him.
Use an umbrella too. Stand in front of the horse and open the umbrella. The horse might jump at first, and when he does, just hold the umbrella. Don't move it, just keep it still. Open it a few more times. Then you can try waving it near the horses head, and body. Then try opining the umbrella when you are standing to the side of the horse.
Get lots balloons and toss them up in the air, in front of the horse. You might just want to start with just one balloon and work your way up to more.
You can also roll things toward the horse, wile you are standing in front of him.
Just use your imagination! Use anything that rolls, floats, flies in the wind, or makes noise.

Try to find what kind of spooker your horse is.,
Become comfortable with your horse in a safe environment.,
Start slowly to bring in 'spook factors' into your rides.,
Continue to expose your horse to more 'spook factors'.,
Advance the desensitization.,
Take your horse to low-key events.,
Continue the process.,
Finish on a positive note each time.",How to Spook Proof a Young Horse," Does he or she bolt? Does he or she just snort? Does your horse plant his or her feet and refuse to move forwards. Once you have identified how your horse spooks, you can better prepare how to handle it. Try to understand what sets off your horse and why.;
, Before you start trying to spook proof your horse, get a feel for him or her in a safe environment. Starting in a small round yard or on a lead is a good place to begin. Make sure you are capable at a walk and trot before you start with spook training.


Don't let your fear of your horse stop you from exposing him/her. The only way to get a horse to stop spooking is to get him/her used to various situations via exposure. Sheltering them will not help. If you feel uncomfortable to expose the horse, then get a trainer or more experienced rider to jump on.

, For example: After your horse is warmed up and settled, ask someone to bring in a tarp and weigh it down. Let your horse walk around it and slowly ask him to step over it. Be patient and confident.


When a horse is spooking, try to take his or her mind off it. Ask the horse to use its brain for other things. Ask for small circles or to move off your legs. Distract the horse from the spook at hand until it has settled.
Be persistent and realistic. Horses are naturally a flight animal and it can take time to spook proof a horse. Don't expect your horse to be perfect after a week, it takes a lot of little wins and ongoing exposure to get a bombproof horse.

, Think of things that he/she may experience at shows and try to replicate them. Things like bunting, people, other horses, and so forth. Always introduce one thing at a time and work to desensitize that factor before you introduce another one.

, Once your horse is less responsive to spook factors in the small safe space, think about taking him/her out for a hack. This is best to do at the end of a ride once the horse is a bit tired. Hacking out is a great way to expose your horse to a variety of things.

, Local pony club days or schooling at a new venue are great ways to expose a horse without the stress of a full blown competition.

, Even if your horse seems less spooky, periodically arrange practice days with a few 'spook factors' to re-expose your horse and to practice with how to deal with spookiness.

, Try to end your ride on a good note rather then a negative. if your horse is having particular trouble with an exercise accept a smaller or partial win or go back to an exercise that your horse is confident with before you finish your ride.

Read your horse’s fore legs.,
Read your horse’s hind legs.,
Read your horse’s tail.",How to Understand Your Horse's Body Language2," Your horses fore legs can be either splayed, pawing, stomping, or striking. Here is a guide to understanding your horse’s fore legs:


If your horse’s fore legs are splayed, i.e., its fore legs are spread out to the sides and the horse is leaning back, then your horse is scared and may be seconds away from bolting. Splayed legs can also be a sign of malnutrition or a neurological impairment, especially if the horse is unwilling to or cannot move. Call a veterinarian.
If your horse is tied up, pawing, i.e., an arcing fore leg that is digging a trench in soft ground, may be a sign of boredom and a signal that your horse is either tired of standing or ready to go. Stressed horses may paw if they are in a trailer or before feeding time. Horses may also paw of they are angry, but it is not common. However, if it is combined with pinned ears, then it is a signal that you need to heed. It is a sign of anger or aggression, and charging or some kind of attack, like biting, usually follows it.Some horses develop pawing as a bad behavior to get attention. Knowing your horse's normal behavior can help you figure out if this is why your horse is pawing.
If your horse is stomping, i.e., raising and lowering a foot forcefully in place, this is a common sign of irritation. It could be something minor, like a fly, or something bigger, like your horse is frustrated with something you are doing.
If your horse is striking its fore legs, i.e., a forceful and aggressive forward kick, this is a sure sign of anger or aggression. It is usually preceded by stomping or pawing, wide eyes, and an elevated head with pinned ears. Take caution if this happens.

, A horse’s hind legs can be either cocked or raised. Learn how to determine the different signals by following this guide:


Cocked legs may either signal resting, pain, or irritation. Your horse is relaxing if it rests the leading edge of the hoof on the ground and drops its hip; this is usually combined with a lowered head and ears hanging to the sides. Your horse is in pain if it shifts its weight from one side to another rapidly. On the other hand, if your horse is frustrated and/or defensive, it will cock its hind leg, elevate its head, and cock or pin its ears back.
If your horse raises its hind leg, cocks and pins its ear back, and/or sways its head, this is a sign that it is frustrated and bothered and ready to kick., The tail is one of the more mobile signs of communication. Your horse can raise or flag its tail, clamp it down, or swish it rapidly. Here’s a guide to know what each signal means:


A raised or flagged tail means your horse is excited. This is a tail that is held above the level of the back. A horse with a flagged tail isn’t usually paying much attention to you, and is prone to being startled. Regain your horse's attention by calling its name and putting it to work.
A clamped tail, i.e., the tail is pressed down or in between its hindquarters, is a sign of a nervous or stressed horse. Additionally, if your horse clamps its tail while you are riding it, this is a sign of discomfort or pain. Make sure your horse’s tack fits well. If the movement persists, contact a veterinarian.
If your horse is gently swishing its tail, this is just a sign of fly control. However, if your horse is quickly jerking its tail from side to side or up and down, this is a sign of anger and frustration, and a precursor to bucking or kicking. On the other hand, if your horse is frequently swishing its tail while you are riding, this can be a sign of discomfort; make sure the tack is properly fitted and no sharp or protruding edges are hurting it.

Read your horse’s body tension.,
Heed the warning signs.,
Recognize horse vocalizations.,
Put it all together.,
Ask for help.",How to Understand Your Horse's Body Language3," By reading your horse’s body tension, you will be able to tell if your horse is relaxed, stressed, nervous, or scared. Here’s a guide to understanding these behaviors:


If your horse’s muscles are rigid and its movements are stiff, it is either nervous, hurting or stressed. Assess the situation to figure out what is causing your horse to be tensed, and remove your horse from the situation.
If your horse is trembling, i.e., its whole body is shaking, this is a sign of fear.

, By heeding warning signs, like pushy behavior or swinging hindquarters, you will be able to create a space that is safe and comfortable for you and your horse. Here is a guide to understanding these warning signs:If your horse is reaching out to touch you with its muzzle, it might be about to bite you. Or, it could also just be interested in you. Your horse could also be nervous, and might be reaching out to you for reassurance. However, if your horse pushes you with its muzzle, this is a sign that it does not respect you because you have not established that you are a leader. Horses are herd animals that are used to hierarchy and structure. You need to establish dominance so your horse does not push you around. If your horse is swinging its hindquarters from side to side, it can be a warning sign that it is about to kick. However, if swinging hindquarters is associated with a raising of the tail while moving it back and forth, and urinating, and the horse is female, then it is most likely a sign of being in heat.

, There are four primary signs of horse vocalization. They are: neighs and whinnies, nickers, squeals, and snorts. Here is a guide to determine what each of them means:


When a horse neighs or winnies, the horse is announcing that it is present. It also neighs to acknowledge other horses in the vicinity.Nickers, or softy throaty sounds, are often used by a mare to encourage her baby, i.e. a foal, to eat.Squeals are often used as a threat display and might happen if you introduce two horses to each other.Horses use snorts to signal danger or to alarm other horses that a strange animal has come too close for comfort., To figure out what your horse is trying to tell you through its body language, you need to put all of the pieces together. Consider all of your observations and what they might mean when taken together.

For example, if your horse is showing stress through both its ears and legs, then you can conclude that it is stressed.
Knowing your horse's personality and normal behavior will help you figure out if the behavior is typical for your horse or if your horse is trying to give you a message.

, Don't be afraid to ask for help or advice, especially if you are new to horses. Ask someone who has grown up around horses or an equine expert, who can teach you what you need to know about horses."

Groom your horse often.,
Give treats.,
Spend lots of time just hanging out.,
Be gentle while putting on tack.,Stretch the horses legs out in front to get rid of any skin wrinkles under the girth, if you don't it may be uncomfortable.,
Always ride your horse with his safety and comfort in mind.,
Bond through lunging.,
Take lessons.",How to Gain a Horse's Trust," For horses, grooming is a sign of trust, and a way to strengthen bonds. Take some time every day to gently groom your horse. If you don't know how to groom a horse, ask an experienced rider to help you.;
, Healthy fruit make good treats, and your horse will associate you with the good taste. However, if you do this too much, the association between you and treats can lead to nipping. Avoid feeding your horse sugar lumps or candy, as they're unhealthy.

, It can be easy to want to jump out and just ride your horse, but you must always remember that sometimes what they need is a walk around, grass walking, leading and/or lunging can strengthen a bond between horses and handlers magnificently.

, Be gentle and cautiously slow, but don't be scared. If you are just waiting for your horse to put up a stink about the saddle, blanket etc., your horse will be able to tell and will tense up as you do. If you aren't sure how to properly put on tack, again ask an experienced rider to help you. Points to remember include:


Always groom your horse before tacking up.
When putting on the saddle and saddle pad, put it a little in front of where you want it to go. Then, slide it back; you'll avoid rubbing the hair, which can be uncomfortable.
Be careful and gentle while putting the bit on.
Check that the straps and girth aren't too tight.

,, Never bully your horse, or force him to do more work than he can do. Be firm while riding, as this reassures him that he doesn't have to worry about anything, but don't be cruel.

, Lunging is a great way to bond with your horse. For more details, How to lunge a horse.

, If you hire an experienced rider, you'll be able to learn a lot, and she can give you tips for building a bond and insuring your horse's comfort.

When you get the halter on without any trouble, reward him with a treat.,
It will probably take two weeks to a month or so for this to work, depending on how head shy your horse is.",How to Put a Halter on a Horse With Head Fright," The horse can sense your frustration and/or fear and will respond to it.;
, While your horse's head is in the food, slowly pull the halter on to the horse's face. If it doesn't work the first time, try again patiently.

, This helps him to sense that there is nothing to be afraid of.

,, He will associate the treat with behaving when putting on the halter.

, If he has been abused, it will probably take a little longer, so be prepared to persevere and show your horse that you can be trusted.

Become an experienced rider.,
Get to know the horse from the ground.,
Fit the horse with mild tack.,
Warm up the horse.,
Mount the horse gently.,
Remain calm and confident.,
Pay attention to the horse's behavior.",How to Ride a Sensitive Horse," An inexperienced rider and a sensitive horse are not likely to get along. Sensitive horses respond to subtle cues and can become agitated if they receive confusing commands or rough handling. If necessary, take lessons with a relaxed animal to improve your riding ability.;
, Lead the horse from the ground to build trust and identify her personality quirks. Pay attention to nervous behavior such as flinching, jerking away, rapidly pulling her head back, and quick changes of direction. Try to identify the stimuli that trigger these behaviors so you can avoid them in future. The horse's eyes or ears often point to the source of anxiety, usually a nearby object, person or animal, or your own sudden movements.


Flared nostrils can be a sign of nerves. Look for nearby triggers, especially sources of strong smells. Note that it is normal for nostrils to flare during hard exercise.
Rolling eyes or visible whites are often a sign of severe anger or fear. Immediately move out of kicking or biting range, speak in soothing tones, and lead the horse to a quiet location., Choose mild, well-fitting tack and place it carefully onto the horse. Follow these steps to ensure the horse's comfort:


Make sure the pad of the saddle and the horse's back are clean.
Slide the saddle pad into place, smoothing down the hair beneath it.
Lift the saddle and place it gently onto the horse. Don't let it flop hard onto the horse.
If the horse reacts when you tighten the girth, do it one notch at a time, grooming or petting the horse in between.
Make sure the girth is not too tight. You should be able to lift and pull each foreleg forward without pinching the horse's skin.
Use a gentle bit, such as an eggbutt snaffle, or any snaffle made from plastic or rubber.
Do not use a crop or spurs on a sensitive horse.

, If the horse tends to resist mounting or buck when you first get on, he may need time to adjust after tacking up. Cinch the saddle loosely and lunge the horse for a few minutes before riding. This should help the horse relax and get the saddle to settle into a more comfortable position.

You may skip this step if the horse already seems relaxed and cooperative.

, Move in slow, deliberate movements to avoid spooking the horse. Seat yourself with the correct posture, using very light leg pressure and staying in contact with the saddle at all times. Carry some of your weight on the stirrups to avoid bearing down too hard on the horse's back.

, Your seat, hands, and voice communicate your instructions and your attitude. Instruct the horse with light, steady movements, using slight leg and rein pressure. Keep your voice and movements calm and in control, never revealing hesitation, nervous movements, or uncertainty. Give commands confidently but without shouting or angry tones. When the horse obeys, praise her in a happy, affectionate tone of voice.


If the horse stops every time you use the reins, you're pulling too hard.
If you feel anxious, hum or sing quietly to mask your fears.

, A relaxed horse keeps his head down, back rounded up beneath you, ears up or slightly back, and tail still. A nervous horse will raise his head, tense his neck, hollow out his back, or lash his tail. React to these signs of anxiety with soothing praise, and by identifying the object or situation causing them. Let the horse take his time to adjust to new situations or investigate an unfamiliar object.

If the horse acts very nervous and may be in danger of spooking, try to get away from the source of anxiety. Plan on desensitizing the horse to that trigger back at the stables, at a later date.

The Friendly Game.,
The Porcupine Game.,
The Driving Game.,
The Yo-Yo Game.,
The Circling Game.,
The Sideways Game.,
The Squeeze Game.,
After you've made your way through these games, that doesn't mean that you're done with them.",How to Do the Seven Games of Parelli," This game is all about getting your horse to be confident in himself, in his environment, in you, and in what you're teaching him. In practical terms, this means getting your horse to the point where he's totally comfortable with you being near him, touching him, and to refer to a Parelli-ism, ""taking the time it takes.""


Begin by making sure your horse is comfortable with you being in his space. The concept of thresholds is very important here. If he is resistant to the idea of being touched, don't rush it. Use a rope (or a Carrot Stick & Savvy String, if you've got one) and lightly toss it over his neck, his back, his hindquarters, around his legs, etc. Use a light and steady rhythm. This exercise is a way of testing what areas your horse is okay with you touching and which ones he's resistant to.
A Carrot Stick is an important tool in the Parelli method, particularly within the Seven Games. The Carrot Stick is not a whip; it acts as an extension of your arm.
For the Friendly Game, use the following guidelines: Rhythm, Relaxation & Retreat. If your horse is uncomfortable with something, back off (retreat). Once your horse is comfortable with you touching him all over (with the rope/Savvy String, Carrot Stick, and eventually your hand), you're ready to move on to the next game.;
, This game is named as such because it teaches the horse to move away from a point of pressure, or a ""feel."" It's essential to be progressive with this game, which means getting your horse to give you more while requiring less stimulation from you.


A good place to start is by placing your hand on Zone 1 (the nose) and attempt to back your horse up based on this touch. Slowly increase pressure until he responds and backs up.
The idea of ""phases"" is essential to this game. In the above example, Phase 1 is the least amount of pressure possible. Essentially, it's the act of placing your hand on the horse. If the horse doesn't respond, move to Phase 2 - a little more pressure. If that doesn't work, move to Phase 3 - a little more forceful. If he doesn't respond to Phase 3, move onto Phase 4 - whatever amount of pressure it takes to get a response. This does not mean hitting, beating, etc. Getting to Phase 4 means you have steadily increased pressure. As soon as the horse responds, release the pressure all together.
With time, practice & repetition, your horse will take fewer and fewer phases to achieve the desired response. The moment you release pressure is a variety of the Friendly Game - ""You did what I wanted you to do, so I'm going to remove the pressure.""
This game does not just apply to the nose. Use similar methods, referring to the four Phases, along his side, to lift his leg, turn his head, etc.

, While the Porcupine Game is about steady pressure, the Driving Game is about rhythmic pressure, or eventually the ""suggestion"" of pressure. The Driving Game is a logical progression of the Porcupine Game.


Apply the same four Phases, except this time, rather than using your hand and steadily increasing the pressure or weight behind it, use a Carrot Stick and ""tap"" the horse. Phase 1 is light, rhythmic tapping, Phase 2 slightly stronger, and so on. It's imperative that you maintain a steady rhythm throughout the phases. The speed and rhythm of the pressure shouldn't change, only the amount of force behind the pressure.
This process can be applied to backing up, hindquarter yields, etc. As noted above, for more detailed descriptions and actual demonstrations of the Seven Games from Pat Parelli himself, go to ParelliConnect.com.

, It's pretty easy to see why this game was named as it was. Using the four Phases, back your horse up a desired amount and then use a retreating motion to bring him back. As Pat says, ""The better your horse backs up, the better he'll do everything else.""


To send your horse out, use the four Phases. Phase 1 is very little movement (in fact, wiggling a finger counts as Phase 1), Phase 2 is more pronounced, and so on. At the same time as you change phases, adopt a more forceful, stern look on your face and a dominant body posture. When you want to bring him back in to you, reel in the rope using a steady hand-over-hand motion with a soft, inviting look on your face. Body language is very important in the Seven Games, but it is of particular importance in this portion of the Yo-Yo Game.

, It's important to note the difference between The Circling Game and lunging. In the Circling Game, it's the horse's responsibility to maintain gait, speed, direction and focus. It's not a mindless circle; he must stay attuned to what you're asking. At the same time, you must develop the three parts of the Circle Game: the send, the allow, and the bring-back.


The send is exactly what it sounds like: sending the horse out on a circle of designated circumference. To send, stand in one spot and send the horse out to the end of the rope. Then, lead the horse forward until he begins circling with the rope remaining relatively taught. Once the horse is moving on a circle, you stay in ""neutral"" (face the same direction, don't follow the horse with your eyes or micromanage). As long as he stays on that path, you don't interfere. This is the allow.
When you want to bring the horse back, adopt the same body language as you did when you brought him back in the Yo-Yo Game.
Practice the Circling Game in both directions, at varying lengths and speeds (walk & trot).

, To begin, it's most effective to bring the horse so his head is facing a wall or barrier of some sort. Using rhythmic pressure with a Carrot Stick (not actually touching him, but wiggling the stick and string near the horse's hindquarters), walk toward the horse, who has remained perpendicular to the barrier. This will likely not result in a perfect Sideways motion right away, but alternating repetition and retreat will help you avoid frustration while achieving the desired result.


If you're concerned that your horse may not respond well to this, get a few pieces of fencing or paneling and walk on the other side of it while using your Carrot Stick as an extension of your arm to apply the suggestion of pressure to the hindquarters.

, This game involves getting your horse comfortable with ""squeezing"" between objects. To begin, these objects should be relatively far apart, so your horse is willing to attempt it. For example, play the Circling Game a bit closer to a wall or barrier than normal, with a bit shorter line than normal. If you allow for a 10- to 15-foot space between you and the barrier and you encourage your horse to go through that space, you're playing the Squeeze Game.


Similar to using Phases, your horse will be more comfortable with increasingly smaller spaces the longer (and more effectively) you play this game. It's all about thresholds. If your horse will go through a 15-foot gap but not a 10-foot gap, don't keep pushing him to make it through the 10-foot gap. Retreat, move back to a 15-foot (or even 20-foot) gap, and slowly work back toward that threshold.

, You should be playing, or at least referencing, these games every time you're with your horse, no matter what level horsemanship you achieve. Your relationship with your horse will grow stronger, and your horsemanship will improve as a result. Once again, further information on the Parelli Seven Games can be found on ParelliConnect.com

Rub all over your horse's body.,
Groom your horse.,
Use other techniques to touch your horse, such as massage.,
Touch your horse all over, everyday so that he will be more comfortable with you and the he will trust you more.

",How to Get Your Horse to Trust and Respect You1," Doing this will let the horse know that he can be comfortable and relaxed around you. Be mindful of areas where the horse does not like to be touched; be more cautious in these areas and work on them more slowly. Areas that may be uncomfortable for the horse include the stomach, eyes, and mouth. If you sense discomfort, move away from those areas and come back to them at a later time.
Start by using your hands. Once your horse becomes comfortable with your hands, use other materials (bag, cloth) to rub him. Make sure that the other materials will not be abrasive or uncomfortable to the horse.;
, Like rubbing, grooming shows that you are friendly to your horse and will help him trust you.Focus on areas where your horse particularly enjoys to be groomed, such as the withers, tail, and mane.

, Before massaging your horse, make sure that he is comfortable being stroked.,"

, Grooming sessions. are an important way to bond. Aim to spend at least 15 minutes every night grooming your horse all over its body, with a variety of tools.

, Horsey yoga, or ""carrot stretches"", are a great way to build a bond with your horse, as well as keep you both in shape. Simply teach your horse to reach for treats - around its shoulder, under its chest and even up to the sky.

, It's fun and helps build trust and a better bond.

, Maybe your horse is wary of a tarpaulin? And you don't like spiders? Try to beat your phobias together - take your horse over a tarpaulin to help him, and let him help you when there's next an awful arachnid in his stall!

, Hacks are a brilliant way to improve fitness as well as the bond between horse and rider, as they can throw up all sorts of unexpected challenges which must be overcome together.

, New venues test the bond of horse and rider like nothing else. While riding out on hacks, you'll each find that the different places can be unpredictable and challenging but teamwork will help you to both prevail.

, Maybe you're a show-jumper, so why not have a punt at endurance? Or, maybe you're a happy hacker, in which case why not try hunting or team chasing? Adding different disciplines to your and your horse's usual sphere can improve the bond between horse and rider, as they require greater teamwork and concentration.

Place a bridle on your horse.,
Securely attach the lead rope to your horse's halter.,
Lead from the lead position.,
Lead from the partner position.,
Lead from the drive position.,
Walk around without the lead rope.,
Continue practicing these leading exercises until your horse learns how to be led from different positions.

",How to Get Your Horse to Trust and Respect You2," The horse's bridle will need to comfortably placed on the horse before practicing the various types of leading exercises., The lead rope will be used to help you lead your horse.

, This means that you will be walking ahead of your horse. By being led from this position, your horse will learn that you are dominant and that your personal space should be respected.Be assertive, yet friendly, when establishing the distance to be kept between you and your horse.Decide the speed at which you and your horse will walk, as well as the path of your walk.
If your horse steps into your space or crowds you while leading, gently push him away. By doing this, you're telling him that you are in charge and you need his respect. He will want to be around you because you appear to be stronger, bolder, and will protect him as an Alpha horse protects a weaker one in a herd.

, In this position, you will walk shoulder-to-shoulder with your horse. This will teach the horse to walk next to you. Do not try leading from this position until you can easily lead from the lead position.Practice walking backwards, turning left and right, and trotting with your horse from this position.
Lead from both the left and right side of the horse.
Your horse should still know to respect your personal when you are beside him.

, In this position, you will be standing behind the horse's drive line (behind the withers).You will be walking diagonally behind the horse.
This position will allow the horse to stop and turn without much resistance from the lead rope.

, This is an alternative approach to leading with the rope. Try this after the horse has learned how to be led.


If he follows you, he has accepted you as the alpha. If not, gently coax him to you.
Once you have established that you are the alpha, your horse should trust you and respect your space. Because horses are natural followers, they will follow you when you lead them.

Apply gentle, direct pressure to your horse's poll (behind or right between the ears).,
Apply pressure to other parts of his body.,
Work on applying this pressure everyday until your horse responds to the pressure each time that you apply it.",How to Get Your Horse to Trust and Respect You3," Do not let up on the pressure until your horse gives in by lowering his head, even if only slightly.The first time you try this, you may be waiting for several minutes before your horse responds to the pressure. Just be patient and continue to apply pressure.

, The goal is to make your horse comfortable with giving in to pressure on any part of his body.Other parts of your horse's body to which you can apply pressure include his legs, hips and muzzle.
Horses apply pressure to each other as a way of asserting dominance. Therefore, if your horse gives in to your pressure, this is an indication that you are dominant to him.

, Although this can be time-consuming and take a lot of patience, using pressure is an important step towards building trust and respect with your horse.

Do not touch your horse.,
Attach a halter to your horse and secure a lead rope to the halter.,
Stand about 3 feet in front of the horse and hold the lead rope in your right hand.,
Raise up your right hand and point your index finger towards the horse.,
Begin to gently wiggle the lead rope back and forth.,
Practice this indirect pressure everyday.",How to Get Your Horse to Trust and Respect You4," Use driving aids, such as a lead rope, and your own energy to indicate what you want the horse to do., The lead rope will be your driving aid.

, Make sure that the lead rope is not taut., This will signal to the horse that you are giving him a command.

, The wiggling motion is meant to indicate the horse that it should walk backwards.The horse may either not respond or walk in a direction other than backwards. If this happens, wiggle the rope with more force until the horse at least begins to walks backwards.

, Eventually, your horse should learn to walk backwards with only a slight wiggle of the rope or pointing of your index finger.

Observe how your horse uses his body and voice to communicate.,
Watch how your horse uses his eyes, ears, and facial expressions to communicate.,
Look at the way your horse uses his head, neck, and tail.,
Listen closely to the voices that your horse makes.,
Watch your horse’s posture and legs.",How to Bond With Your Horse Using Natural Horsemanship1," Your horse is able to use many parts of his body (eg, legs, face, tail) and make many different types of voices to communicate with you and other horses. Understanding his body language is a key component of natural horsemanship; if you know why they move and use their body in certain ways, you will improve your communication and bond with your horse.


It can be helpful to initially watch your horse without interacting with him to get a better idea of what he’s trying to say.;
, Your horse’s eyes, ears, and face often work together to convey how your horse is feeling. For example, if your horse is feeling frightened, his ears will be pricked forwards and his eyes will widen.The way that your horse has his eyes open or closed often indicates his alertness and wakefulness; he is alert and attentive when both of his eyes are open, but is drowsy if his eyes are only half open.If he is keeping one eye shut or seems unable to open one eye, there may be something medically wrong with that eye; consult your veterinarian in this case. Horses are able to move their ears together and individually in response to their environment. For example, if one ear is positioned backward, your horse is probably trying to listen to something behind him.If his ears are flattened back or pricked forward, your horse is likely frightened or upset;flared nostrils and widened eyes often accompany these ear positions. Move back to a safe distance from your horse if his ears indicate that he is frightened or upset.
A horse’s facial expressions can convey different emotions or responses. The flehmen response (your horse may look like he’s laughing when he does this) is a way for your horse to pick up and process different scents in his environment; he will lift his head and curl his upper lip under itself. If your horse is young, he may softly clack his teeth (softly chomp his teeth together) so that other older horses won’t hurt him. To indicate that he is relaxed, your horse may droop his chin or mouth., Your horse can convey a variety of emotions by the way he positions his head, neck, and tail. Paying close attention to these positions will give you important clues as to how he’s feeling.


If your horse is holding his head high, he is feeling alert and curious. A lowered head could mean that he is submitting to a command, but it could also mean that he is depressed.Stiff neck muscles indicate that your horse is feeling tense or stressed. If your horse’s neck is stretched out and his neck muscles are feeling loose, he’s probably feeling relaxed.
When your horse swishes his tail, he could be swatting pests away (slow and steady swish) or could be feeling agitated (quick and aggressive swish). If his tail indicates that he’s agitated, give your horse some space to calm down. The height at which your horse holds his tail indicates that he’s feeling alert (high tail) or has some discomfort (tail tucked between the legs)., Just like his other body parts, your horse will use his voice differently in different situations. Take time to learn what each of these voices means.


Horses will neigh when they’re feeling anxious (high-pitched), confident (sounds like a bugle), or simply acknowledging their presence.Horses will also snort and nicker. Snorting indicates that your horse is either excited or alarmed about something.Nickering is a calmer noise that your horse will make when he’s anticipating meal time or, in the case of a female horse, communicating with her foal.Groans commonly mean that your horse is experiencing some type of discomfort, such as being ridden too hard or landing too hard. Groans can also indicate a serious medical condition, such as constipation or stomach pain; your veterinarian will be needed to diagnose and treat the medical condition.
Horses can also sigh and squeal. Just like in people, your horse will sigh when he’s feeling relaxed or relieved. In contrast, your horse will squeal when he is feeling playful or meeting another horse for the first time., Taking an overall look at how your horse is standing or moving can give you important clues as to what he’s trying to communicate. Use caution when observing how your horse uses his legs; horses are very powerful animals and can cause serious physical injury when they kick.


If you notice that your horse is walking very stiffly and has tense-looking muscles, he is likely in some type of pain.Your veterinarian can perform medical tests, such as a lameness exam, to diagnose the pain.
If your horse is trembling, he’s saying that he’s afraid of something. If his trembling is severe, a veterinary behaviorist can work with your horse to calm his fears.To express playfulness, a horse will buck (lifting his back legs) or rear (raising the front legs).Keep in mind that both of these leg movements can also indicate aggression or fearfulness.
If your horse’s legs are splayed, he may getting ready to bolt or may have medical issues that prevent him from standing properly. Your veterinarian can perform medical and behavioral tests to determine the cause of the splayed legs.Your horse will paw or stamp the ground with his front legs to indicate that he is feeling impatient or frustrated.Watch out if your horse lifts one of his front or back legs or starts swinging his hindquarters. This means that he’s getting ready to kick. Move as far back from your horse as possible to prevent injury."

Understand the purpose of applying pressure to your horse.,
Apply direct pressure to your horse.,
Release the pressure.,
Apply indirect pressure to your horse.",How to Bond With Your Horse Using Natural Horsemanship2," The use of pressure is a way to train your horse. Using pressure, which can be direct (touching your horse with your hands) or indirect (using a lead rope), can help your horse understand what you want him to do with his body. When done with care and consistency, your horse will learn how to quickly and calmly respond to your pressure, which will strengthen your bond with him.

, By using direct pressure, you are teaching your horse to move his body according to how you touch him.Training with direct pressure can be very time-intensive, so just be patient with your horse as you train him in this way.


Start by applying gentle pressure to his poll (between the ears) to get him to lower his head. It may take your horse a few minutes to understand what you want him to do, so just keep applying steady pressure until he moves, or at least starts to move, his head down.Once he gets more comfortable with the direct pressure to his poll, you can apply pressure to different parts of his body, such as his nose (your horse will move backwards) and behind the ears (your horse will move forwards).Practice applying direct pressure each day until your horse quickly, consistently, and appropriately responds to your touch.

, It is important to remember that it’s the release of the pressure that teaches the horse that he’s doing the right thing, rather than the application of pressure itself. Knowing exactly when to release the pressure will help your horse learn your commands more quickly.


Release as soon as your horse starts to respond in the way that you want him to; waiting a few seconds after he responds is too late.
The release can be full (no more pressure at all) or partial (less than the initial pressure).
Releasing the pressure before he has tried to respond will increase the amount of time it takes him to learn to respond to pressure.

, Using indirect pressure means that you are not directly touching your horse; rather, you are using a driving aid, such as a lead rope, to give him commands.Practice this type of pressure after your horse has mastered responding to direct pressure.


Attach the lead rope to your horse’s halter. While standing about three feet in front of him, start to slowly wiggle the lead rope to get him to step backwards. If he doesn’t move backwards, or moves in another direction, wiggle the rope with increasing force until he takes a step or two back.
Try wiggling from even further back (about 10 feet).
Practice applying indirect pressure for a few minutes each day.As with direct pressure, release the indirect pressure as soon as your horse to starts to respond appropriately. In this case, you would stop wiggling the rope to release pressure.

"
"
Groom your horse each day.,
Practice various leading exercises with your horse.,
Practice ground training with your horse every day.",How to Bond With Your Horse Using Natural Horsemanship3," Grooming is a component of ground training, a type of training where you are standing on the ground while taking your horse through various exercises.Ground training is an important of natural horsemanship, since it allows you to bond with your horse by establishing boundaries and communicating with him using his natural body language.If you haven’t groomed him before, start by touching him all over with just your hands. Doing this everyday will get him used to your touch. Be mindful of the areas where he doesn’t feel comfortable being touched, such as his stomach and eyes.When you start grooming him, focus on the areas where he likes to be touched. Many horses enjoy being touched around their withers and mane.By grooming and touching your horse all over for just a few minutes each day, he will trust that you will touch him with gentleness and respect. When he trusts you in this way, you will know that you have established a strong bond with him.

, With the use of a lead rope attached to your horse’s halter, lead him from various positions, including in front of him, beside him, and behind him. Leading exercises will teach your horse to respect your personal space; earning this respect from your horse is another important aspect of bonding with him through natural horsemanship.Lead your horse by walking in front of him. Determine how far in front of him you want to walk, and keep that distance for the duration of your walk. If your horse tries to close the distance that you established, gently push him back. He will learn to respect that distance.Lead from the partner position (beside him). Stand next to his shoulder for this position. Just like when you walk in front of him, establish and maintain your area of personal space when walking beside him. Practice this position next to both shoulders.Lead from the drive position. Stand behind your horse’s drive line (behind the withers) and walk diagonally behind him.As an alternative, try leading your horse without the lead rope. Practice this when your horse has mastered being led with the lead rope.
No matter which lead position you practice, the goal is for your horse to see you as alpha and respect your personal space. Practice each day until your horse is comfortable being led by you.

, The key to ground training is to practice it consistently until your horse responds quickly and appropriately to your commands. When he does this, you will have established a bond with him based on mutual trust and respect. Do not do ground training for more than 30 minutes otherwise he will get bored and will not respond."

Look at your horse’s eyes.,
Observe how your horse’s ears are positioned.,
Watch your horse’s facial expressions.",How to Understand Horse Communication1," Paying attention to your horse’s eyes will help you understand how your horse is feeling (eg, alert, sleepy) at any given moment. Keep in mind that a horse’s vision is different from that of a person. For example, horses have a panoramic view of their environment (like a panoramic camera); because they are prey animals in the wild, it is important for them to have a wide view of their surrounding environment.Horses can also have poor depth perception, meaning that they cannot always perceive how deep or shallow something is; what we see as a shallow puddle may look like a bottomless pit to your horse.If your horse’s eyes are bright and wide open, this means that your horse is alert and aware of his surroundings.Eyes that are open only halfway indicate a sleepy horse.If both of your horse’s eyes are shut, your horse is sleeping.
If only one eye is open, it is possible that something is wrong with the other eye. You may need to call your veterinarian to determine why the other eye is closed.Sometimes your horse will move his head in different directions to get a better of view of his surroundings.;
, Horses will hold their ears in different ways to pick up different signals from their environment and indicate how they feel about what’s going on around them. Horses can move both their ears at one time, or move them individually.


Ears that are slightly forward indicate that a horse is relaxed. If your horse’s ears are pricked forward, he may be feeling interested in, or maybe even threatened by, his environment.If his ears indicate that he is feeling threatened, his nostrils will flare and his eyes will widen.Ears that are flattened back are a clear sign that your horse is upset.If you are near your horse when you see this, move a safe distance away to protect yourself from injury.
If one ear is back, then your horse is likely listening to something behind him.If your horse’s ears are to the side, that means that he is concentrating yet relaxed. , Horses can make a variety of facial expressions in response to their environment. Often, changes in a horse’s facial expression accompany other changes in body language.


Your horse’s chin and/or mouth will droop when he’s feeling relaxed or sleepy.A curl of the upper lip indicates the flehmen response. Although this looks funny to people, the flehmen response is a useful way for horses to interpret unfamiliar scents in their environment.In order to display the flehmen response, your horse will extend his neck, raise his head, inhale, and roll his upper lip back and under itself; your horse's upper teeth and gums will be exposed when he does this.Foals, weanlings (recently weaned from their mother), and submissive yearlings will clack their teeth to make sure that older horses don’t hurt them. They’ll do this by first raising their neck and pushing out their head. They will then curl their upper and lower lips to expose all of their teeth, and repeatedly click their teeth together. You will hear a small clicking noise if your horse does this."
"
Observe what your horse is doing with his legs.,
Look at your horse’s overall posture.,
Listen to what noises your horse makes.",How to Understand Horse Communication2," Horses will use their back and front legs in different ways to indicate how they are feeling. Horses can inflict serious injury with their legs, so understanding how your horse uses his legs to communicate will be very important for your personal safety.


Your horse will paw or stamp the ground with his front legs when he is feeling impatient, frustrated, or uncomfortable.Splayed (spread out) front legs indicates that your horse is getting ready to run or bolt. It could also mean that your horse has medical issues that prevents him from standing properly; your veterinarian will be needed to diagnose the underlying cause.Lifting either one front leg or back leg signals a threat. If you see your horse doing this, step back to a safe distance; a horse kick can cause serious injury.Your horse may cock his back leg by resting the front edge of his hoof on the ground and lowering his hip. This indicates that he is relaxed.Your horse will sometimes engage in Bucking behavior, which is when he raises his back legs in the air. This is often playful behavior (sometimes accompanied by grunting and squealing), but can also indicate uncertainty and fear, especially if he's being ridden for the first time.Rearing up is another dual-sided behavior. It can signal playfulness in foals in the field but, if it is an angry stallion in fight mode, it can be a sign of fear when the horse cannot escape the situation., You can understand how your horse is feeling by looking at him as a whole to see how he moves and stands. For example, if your horse’s back is raised, he could be sore from having the saddle on him for a long time.Rigid muscles and stiff movements can mean that your horse is nervous, stressed, or in pain.If you are not sure why your horse looks rigid or stiff, your veterinarian can conduct various behavioral and medical tests (dental exam, lameness exam) to determine the cause.Trembling is a sign of fear. Your horse may tremble to the point of wanting to run or fight. If he does this, give him plenty of space and time to calm down. He may also need to be desensitized to his fear; an experienced veterinary behaviorist can help your horse overcome his fear.Your horse may swing his hindquarters to indicate that he’s getting ready to kick; move away quickly if he starts doing this. If your horse is female, she may swing her hindquarters to indicate that she is in heat and trying to get the attention of a male horse., Horses have a range of noises that they will make to communicate different things. Understanding what these different noises mean will help you better understand what your horse is trying to communicate with you and other horses.


Your horse will neigh for several reasons. He may neigh to indicate anxiety or distress; this will be a very high-pitched sound and could be accompanied by a lowered tail and flickering ears. He may also neigh to acknowledge his presence.A confident neigh will sound like a bugle and will be accompanied by a slightly lifted tail, forward-pricked ears.
A nicker is a soft, throaty sound. To make this sound, your horse will keep his mouth closed while producing the sound from his vocal chords. A mare will sometime use this sound with her foal. Your horse may also make this sound when he knows that it’s almost feeding time.This is usually a friendly sound.
Squeals can be a display of threat. Two horses who are meeting each other for the first time may squeal at each other.Squeals can also be a sign of playfulness, such as when your horse is bucking.
Your horse will snort by inhaling quickly and then exhaling through his nose. With this sound, he could be signaling that he is alarmed when another animal has come too close to him.He could also be indicating that he's excited about something. Be aware that the act of snorting can get horses worked up; you may need to calm him down if this happens.
Just like people, your horse will sigh to express relief and relaxation. The sighs are different for each each emotion: relief–deep inhale, then a slow exhale through the nose or mouth; relaxation–lowered head with an exhalation that makes a fluttering noise.
Groans can indicate different things. For example, your horse may groan if he's in pain during riding (eg, landing hard after a jumping a fence, his rider thuds heavily in the saddle). He might also groan when he's happily exercising without pain. Groaning could also indicate more serious medical issues, such as constipation or gastric pain due to ulcers. If you have trouble determine why your horse is groaning, consult a horse expert.

Watch how your horse has his head positioned.,
Observe how your horse moves his tail.,
Observe how your horse's neck looks and feels.",How to Understand Horse Communication3," As with other parts of the horse’s body, your horse will move his head in different ways depending on how he’s feeling. The position of his head signals a variety of moods.


If your horse is holding his head high, he is showing that he is alert and curious.A lowered head could mean several different things. It could mean that your horse has accepted a particular situation or command.It could also mean that your horse is depressed, which could require additional workup from your veterinarian.If your horse is snaking his head (lowering his head slightly and moving his neck from side to side), he is showing signs of aggression. If possible, remove your horse from whatever is aggravating him. If you cannot do this safely, move as far back from your horse as you can until he calms down.Your horse may turn his head to look back at its flank, which could signal abdominal discomfort., Your horse will swish his tail for reasons than swatting away flies or insects. Although natural tail position can vary by breed, there are some tail positions that are common across breeds.In addition to swatting away bothersome pests, tail swishing can also indicate agitation and can be a warning for other horses to keep their distance. If your horse is agitated, he will swish his tail more quickly and aggressively than if he was swatting away pests.Your horse will often raise his tail when he is feeling happy and alert.In foals, a tail held high over the back can indicate either playfulness or alarm.If your horse’s tail is clamped down, your horse may be experiencing some discomfort, such as a fly on his underside., Your horse will hold his neck in different ways to convey whether he's feeling tense, relaxed, etc. Knowing these different neck positions will help you better understand your horse's body language.


If your horse's neck is stretched out and the muscles under his neck feel loose, this can indicate that he is relaxed and happy.If the muscles under your horse's neck feel tense, your horse probably feel stressed and unhappy."

Spend time getting to know the horse.,
Don't rush it.,
Find out what treats your horse likes.,
If he has any fears, wait to bombproof him until you have his complete trust.",How to Get Your Abused Horse to Trust You," All horses have different attitudes. This is a very important thing to know when training your horse. Some may be the kind that would fight or act aggressive towards you, others choose flight and avoidance. Others act aggressive or shy if they are afraid and/or unsure about you. Whatever the attitude, you need to work with him according to what he is trying to tell you and what you need to do to gain his trust and respect. It also may help if you learn horse signs because different positions of the ear means MANY different things.;
, Try the joining up process done by horse trainers like Pat Parelli or Monty Roberts if you're experienced, patient, have a round pen, the right tools, and lots of time. If you don't have the experience, you may be best to consult with a trainer or experienced horseman or woman to know what the best methods are available for you to gain the trust and respect of the horse. However, more patience, persistence, consistency, and time can do wonders as well. Your horse will come to you when he's ready.

, If he loves oats, then you can use this as a positive reinforcement for him. If he likes another treat, such as a carrot, you can use that too.


When you're giving your horse treats, always give them it to him in a rubber bowl or bucket (or something similar) so that they won't start pushing you around and getting in your pockets, or start nipping you. If you keep hand feeding horses, they may start nipping you, or pushing you around trying to see if you have any treats in your pockets. Make sure that every time you get done handling food, you wash your hands because the horse will smell it and nip, even when it's on your clothes!

Sometimes making friends with a horse simply by giving him treats doesn't solve anything. You need to make him trust you even when you don't have treats in your pockets all the time. Treats can be a good reinforcement that he is not going to be hurt, but even touches/strokes on the neck or head (never the nose or muzzle) can be reinforcement that you mean no harm.

If you give him treats all the time, he learns that the presence of you means food, not as a part of his herd or his social hierarchy, and that can be detrimental in the long run.



, Sometimes though, the whole part of the gaining trust process and rehabilitation of this abused horse is to help him get over his fears. Of course it is always best to let a more experienced trainer work with him than you doing it yourself.


One really good thing other than treats you can do is groom your horse. The horses will love it because you are near them and touching them so much and caring for them that you get 3 in one done. You get your: grooming, desensitizing, and care done all in one and it benefits both you and your horse.

This means putting the needs of the horse before your own desires. You have to be able to respect the emotions and desires of the horse. This is an attitude and it inflects each interaction you have with the horse.


Learn respect for horses by spending time with them.
Horse whisperers astounded the horse training world in the mid 1900s. People had a hard time accepting it could be so easy to work with a horse. Because people did not understand horses very well, previous methods of training horses were brutal and abusive. Horse whispering is a gentle response to this out-dated and ignorant way to break and train a horse. ;
, Study up on horses' perspective and horses' idea of what is the most important in life. Study how the horses' senses work. Know the places in their field of vision they can't see you, and that these blind spots can make a horse nervous. Cognition and vision in horses has been often underestimated.Their blind spots are directly in front of and behind them.


Horses are herd animals, and they seek leaders and validation from their leaders.
Horses are prey animals and they are easily frightened, their primary natural defense being to run.
Horses have very complex communication.

, Many universities have programs that are designed to help people work with horses. Check with your local two year and four year colleges to see what types of programs they have available.


Look into programs that emphasize horse training. Some schools also offer certificates in horse training, colt starting, and horsemanship that you can earn in just a year or two.
Consider getting a degree in business if you are already an experienced horse trainer. A business degree can help you to understand how to manage and grow your business.

, Apprenticeships allow you to shadow someone who works as a horse whisperer and learn from his or her experience. Check with horse whisperers in your area to see if any apprenticeships are available.


Keep in mind that an apprenticeship may or may not be paid. You may receive a small stipend for your assistance or you may be working in exchange for the knowledge and experience you receive.

, Farm or horse clubs, such as 4H, can give you the opportunity to work with horses. Contact local farming clubs and organizations near you, to find out if you can join. Many times you can ask about volunteering opportunities as well. These groups are a great way to get hands on experience. Riding clubs are also a great way to get involved with horses., There are many horse related sports. Polo, racing, rodeos, and trick competitions are all competitive ways to get involved with horses. Sometimes schools, such as colleges, will have these clubs or groups. In other cases, it may take some research online to find a local group that plays sports with horses.

, You have to start somewhere. This is a simple first attempt to work with a horse. Horses like apples, carrots, and oats among other foods. Make sure you give the horse the right feed! Feed the horse sugar cubes only as a treat. This interaction will help you to bond with ad understand horses., Get a horse grooming kit and take good care of it. Gently slide your hand down your horse's body to let him know that he can trust you. This action is a crucial part of understanding and developing strong bonds with horses. It should be a habit.After the horse has been mildly tamed enough to let you pet and groom him, don't expect to just hop right on and ride. You will need to get the horse to trust you first.
Make sure to clean up after the horse as well. This is so you have a full understanding of the animal.

, Horse ownership can be an important part of taking your dedication to horses to the next level. He will require that you work with your horse all the time. He will need care every day. Through this constant dedication, you will come to understand the communication styles of your animal. You will want to see the animal's home life, interact with him, and take him to the vet before you buy it., Remember that a hyperactive horse or a wild horse can be dangerous. Do not get too close to the horse before it is comfortable with your presence - doing so could ruin the trust you have already earned and may put your safety in jeopardy. Do not attempt to calm a frightened horse if you have not been properly trained to do so.


Be careful when approaching horses, as they can be skittish when approached from the behind. Remember that though their hind legs can be dangerous, their front legs are more so.
Observe horses while they are in their paddock.
Stand with the horse and talk to him, gently.
See how the horse interacts with other humans and horses.

, Pay attention to the noises a horse makes, and what they signify. Pay close attention to its body language as well. If you are careful enough, it may tell you things that only ""Horse Whisperers"" can understand. Soon, you may understand the horse and it will understand you.The goal of this is establishing a kind of communication.


Watch for the horse to drop its head in submission.
Good chewing and licking are a sign that the horse is ready to be submissive as well.

, Horses read body language and use physical language as well to express themselves. Horses will also read your body language to determine whether or not you are in charge. Little things like crowding your space or chewing on your shirt can indicate that a horse does not see you as a leader. It is important to teach your horse that you are in charge.


You can use gentle pressure to correct a horse if he is in your personal space. For example, if your horse encroaches on your space when you are brushing him, then lean into his side until he moves back to where he was standing before., Joining up with a horse is a specific training method developed by Monty Roberts that uses a round pen to confine a horse. While the horse is confined, the trainer stands in the center and makes loud noises to frighten the horse into running in circles around the pen. After a little while, the trainer reduces the noise and then goes silent and waits for the horse to approach. This introduction is called the “join up.”This method of training seems to be very effective, but some veterinary science researchers have warned that this method may be traumatic for the horse.

, Horse whisperers get clients by word of mouth primarily, but you may also want to consider running some ads when you first get started. You can advertise in horse magazines, in the local newspaper, or through any classes or stables near your home.If you plan to run advertisements, then you will need to develop a budget for how much you are willing to spend on ads as well.

, By selling your services as a horse whisperer, you will need to save a sizable portion of your income for taxes. This can often be 30% of your income or more. Don't get yourself in hot water by not setting aside enough money to pay your taxes. Some other things you may want to consider include:


Get a tax accountant. Preparing taxes for your business can be difficult and time consuming. You may be better off paying someone else to do so.
Use purchases to deduct from your tax payment. You may be able to deduct some of your business expenses to reduce your tax payment. Keep in mind that you will have to save your receipts to do this and in case you get audited.
Charge extra to cover the cost of taxes. To make sure that your earnings will not be cut short, you will need to charge your clients enough to cover your taxes.

, One great way to advertise your business is to share your contact information with the horse veterinarians in your area. Horse owners will often ask veterinarians for recommendations on horse trainers, so sharing your information with veterinarians may lead to some phone calls from prospective clients.

, Trade shows are great places to meet other professionals and learn about new products, techniques, and research in your field. Ask other horse whisperers in your area about the trade shows that they attend and begin going to a few trade shows per year.

, A website can help you to market your business because the internet is often the first place that people look to find out about a product or service. Include in your website information about your services, your credentials, and contact information. Some nice photos of you working with horses might also be a nice touch.

Maintain a relaxed state of mind and body.,
Pet the horse before and while riding.,
Use a tempo application.,
Do not show fear or stress.,
Get the horse's attention.,
Use lateral flexion.,
Continue ride without acknowledgement of spooking.,
Point the horse toward the stressor.,
Get off the horse.,
Consider the environment.,
Minimize confinement.,
Consider the experience of the rider and the horse.,
Ensure good vision.,
Check for discomfort.",How to Calm Your Horse Down Quickly," Strive to stay relaxed before and during the ride. This can be achieved by breathing slowly and deeply to maintain a steady heartbeat. You might also try to keep a positive attitude in general, which could include soothing the horse by talking or singing softly to it before riding., Petting a horse before riding as well as during the ride can help keep both horse and rider calm. Petting during the ride has the added bonus of helping keep the rider's hands steady, allowing for greater control of the horse. This control can help calm the animal more quickly in the event of spooking.A good place to pet the horse is on its withers, which is at the tip of the shoulders where the neck and back meet.Simply stroke the fur softly to pet. You can also apply soft pressure with your fingertips or scratch lightly with fingernails.

, One way to help keep both the horse and rider calm during the ride—thereby minimizing spooking—is to use an application that sets a riding tempo. Acting like a metronome for the ride, the application will set a tempo for each gait, which the rider can speed up or slow down. The rider simply activates the application on a smartphone or mobile device and places it in their pocket during the ride with the volume up loud enough for the horse to hear it.Another way to use this application is to have a friend operate the tempo adjustments with the application hooked into a riding arena's public address system. This is a good way to ensure the horse can hear the beat., You may be startled by your horse's behavior if it gets spooked, but the horse will only experience greater stress if you show stress yourself. This is because your stress indicates to the horse that there is a legitimate threat, even though it is his or her stress to which you may be reacting. In this case, the horse can be more difficult to calm, so you really should remain calm if your horse gets spooked so as to minimize the horse's stress., Horses are generally only able to concentrate on one thing at a time, and the object on which they will likely focus when spooked is whatever has them spooked. If you can get the horse's attention away from this object, you will be better able to calm him or her quickly. You may even need to ride a horse in circles to get its attention off of whatever has it spooked.Horses can spook at pretty much anything, be it something in the environment, an unfamiliar object, or really anything.

, Lateral flexion is a neutral rein position in which you gently pull on one rein to turn the horse's head. This technique helps the horse slow down before stopping, which will help keep the horse from running when it gets spooked—in effect, lateral flexion can help distract the horse from it's own spooked reaction to a stressor. Lateral flexion is sometimes called a relaxation cue, hence its effectiveness in helping to quickly calm a horse. Lift the reins to feel the horse's mouth through them using one hand, then move your other hand down the rein. Reach until the arm is straight and touching the horse's mane.
Place the opposite hand on the horse's neck firmly to keep yourself stable, and begin to close your fingers slowly from the pointer to the pinky, locking the pinky when you finish.
The horse should now start to bend to the pressure of the rein, at which point you can begin to move your arm down to your thigh near your knee. The horse should bend at this point until there is slack in the rein and stop.
If the horse doesn't stop at this point, push firmly with your stabilizing hand and wait. Release pressure when the feet have stopped.

, If the horse gets spooked, you can also try simply continuing your ride as though the horse had not been spooked at all. If you have tasks in mind, try to get the horse to focus on those as a distraction.Tasks include training for jumping courses, dressage tests, and more.

, If you point the horse's nose at whatever is scaring it, but allow it to drift sideways or move backward, you will keep him or her from being able to run away in a panic because it would mean the horse would have to run toward the stressor. If the horse moves backward or sideways, you will direct its attention in a way that keeps the rider more safe. In order to keep from spooking the horse using this technique, be sure not to push him or her toward the stressor., For your safety, first and foremost, you may need to get off the horse, and doing so can help put you in a better position to calm the animal. If you do get off the horse, one way to help calm him or her is to simply act as if nothing happened. It is not recommended to always get off your horse when it is spooked because it can be dangerous to abandon the animal. It can also train the horse that you will get off if it acts in a particular way, which is not what you want, so only get off under these circumstances if absolutely necessary.You might also try to pet the horse on the withers as above to help calm it.

, Your horse could get spooked if there is a change in their environment. Walking the same trail at a different time of day, for instance, could change the environment for your horse enough that he or she may be more prone to spooking. These kinds of changes in the environment must be considered in order to minimize the possibility that the horse may become spooked to begin with., Horses that are confined for long periods such as over the winter may have pent up energy that causes them to react more dramatically to unfamiliar sights or sounds. Even horses that are stalled much of the time may get spooked by their surroundings, which is why turning a horse out to pasture daily is a good idea. After a long winter's confinement, running in a pasture can help get the horse ready for riding with a minimum of spook behavior., An experienced rider can help lead a horse in a way that minimizes spooking, but an inexperienced rider may react in such a way as to increase the likelihood of spooking. Horses respond to the nervousness of their rider with their own nervousness, and the posture of a scared rider can be interpreted by the horse as encouragement to speed up. For these reasons, the experience of both the horse and rider is important to minimizing spooking., One reason a horse may spook is impaired vision. This is often considered to be the most common reason a horse is more prone to spooking. An examination by a veterinarian is a good way to help ensure your horse will not spook due to vision problems., A horse that is uncomfortable is more prone to spooking. If the horse is in pain due to something as serious as a medical condition or something as simple as improper saddle fit, the problem must be corrected to help minimize spooking. Some other problems that might cause pain and spooking include the fitting or type of bit used, sharp teeth edges, or objects stuck in the bottom of one or more of the horse's hooves."

You shouldn't just walk up to a horse and start petting and rubbing him or begin riding straight away. The horse needs time to understand that you are not a threat before he begins to trust you and see you as a friend and leader. You can begin this process by:


Simply spending time with the horse in his stall, in the arena, or in the pasture. Pull up a chair and just sit with him, or walk around slowly - not getting too close - letting him get used to having you around. Soon you will see him beginning to follow your movements with his eyes and head, watching you curiously.
Do this everyday, without putting any pressure on the horse to interact with you. In time, he will walk up to you of his own accord and start to investigate more closely. Allow him to smell you, nuzzle you and lick you, without attempting any contact in return.
Once trust has been established, the horse may walk over to you as you approach, whinny in greeting or start following you as you move around. That's when you know you've made friends!;
, One essential way of bonding with a horse is to let him get used to the sound of your voice. Talk to him about the weather, about share prices, about a new lasagna recipe you've been dying to try - anything at all! As long as you use a soothing, yet confident tone of voice, the horse will be happy to listen.Some people even like to read to their horses. This is particularly great for cold winter evenings, when it's too dark or too icy to ride. Pull up a chair in the horse's stall and whip out a book. Experiment with different genres and styles to see whether your horse is more of a Dr.Seuss or Tolstoy kinda guy.
Others sing to their horses. This can be a nice way to bond with the horse as you groom him or bring him for a walk. Again, stick to a soothing tone of voice. No death metal please.

, Horses are naturally protective about their personal space, so try to read the horse's body language before getting too close. If the horse flinches or leans away when you reach out to touch it, you know you are moving too quickly. Approach the horse from the side, rather than head on, and touch his back or shoulder rather than his face.


Try gradually moving towards the horse, step by step, before reaching out a hand to touch him. Place a hand on the horse's shoulders or back. Only do this for a few seconds, then remove your hand and back away. This is very non-threatening behavior and will help the horse to feel safe.Most horses have a ""sweet spot"" on their withers, which is located at the base of the mane, between the shoulder blades. A quick scratch on this spot can instantly cause the horse to relax.
People unfamiliar with horses will usually reach straight for a horse's face or nose, but this is a mistake. A horse's nose is a very sensitive and private spot, and should only be touched when the horse allows it.

, If you ever watch how horses interact when they're alone, you'll notice that they greet each other by sniffing and blowing around each other's nostrils. This allows them to recognize each other's scent.


You can do the same by gently blowing in your horse's nostrils to say hello.
If you suck a peppermint beforehand, he'll probably like you even more!

, As you are probably already aware, horses love treats. Therefore, being the provider of treats is a great way to endear yourself to any friends of the equine variety.


Things like raisins, sugar cubes, apple slices, carrots, sunflower seeds, hay cubes and peppermints are usually popular, though you should experiment with different foods to find out what your particular horse is partial to.
Only give treats in moderation, as the horse's health is a priority. They should be given as a reward for good behavior after training or grooming. Make sure the horse has no medical conditions that could cause him to react badly to a particular type of food.
Avoid keeping treats in your pocket or feeding the treats by hand. Over time, a horse can come to associate these places with certain tasty morsels and may begin to nip at fingers or nuzzle at pockets. Do not encourage this behavior; place treats in a feeder or bucket instead., The amount of time it takes to befriend a horse will vary from animal to animal. It will depend on the age of the horse, the treatment he received at the hands of previous owners, as well as the horse's individual personality.


Young, well-cared for horses may quickly imprint on a new owner, trusting them completely within a matter of weeks.
Older horses, who may have been mistreated in the past, will be slower to adjust to a new person and their trust will need to be earned slowly over several months, or even years.
It is important to have patience with the horse and avoid pushing him to do things he's not comfortable with. Like human friendships, a relationship with a horse takes time to build. But once trust is established, you will have a friend for life.

, You should do some groundwork with your horse before you attempt to ride him. This establishes you as the leader and teaches the horse to follow your command, while also reinforcing his trust in you.


Begin by taking your horse for a walk, as you would a dog. Use a halter and lead and go on a small expedition, walking beneath trees, through water or over bridges, side by side. This will plant you firmly within your horse's comfort zone.
Always walk beside the horse, never in front of it, and avoid dragging or tugging on the lead. Walk beside his head or place your hand on his shoulders, stroking him and talking to him as you walk. Think of it like holding hands!

, Horses are herd animals and like to follow a leader. Once you've gained your horse's trust and established yourself as a leader he will follow you anywhere.


Train him to turn left and right, stop and and back up in response to slight movements of the lead or bridle.
Training the horse to respond to such requests on the ground will benefit you hugely in the saddle.

, Try to be firm and consistent in your handling of the horse. Just because you want the horse to like you, doesn't mean you should let him get away with bad behaviors. If he nips or bites, give him one firm smack on the shoulder to show him that it's not okay. If he performs an action incorrectly, make him do it again.


However, it is important to understand the difference between a horse who's behaving badly and a horse that's confused or frightened. Don't expect him to perform actions he hasn't been trained to do, or to respond to conflicting requests.
Make sure to be fair and consistent in your training -- use the exact same cues every time you make a request, without variation. Horses are creatures of habit and will only respond to familiar requests., Like any good relationship, befriending a horse is all about communication. With the notable exception of Mr.Ed, members of the equine species are not particularly verbose, so having an open discussion with your horse is not a viable option. Therefore, you will have to rely on body language instead.


Learn to read your horses facial expressions and body movements, however subtle. These will help you to interpret how a horse is feeling, and may even allow you to head off an accident when the horse is frightened or upset.
For instance, if a horse's ears are forward he is paying attention and interested in what's going on, if they're splayed to the side he's relaxed or asleep and if they're pinned back he is angry or frightened. Other body parts to pay attention to include the tail, the muzzle, the eyes and the legs.

, Once you have progressed to riding, the object is to become one with the horse, almost to the point where he intuitively senses which direction you want to go in. You shouldn't need to rely on tugging the reins or furiously prodding him with your heels, he should respond to the slightest nudge or shift in your seat. Aim to become like the mythical centaur; half human, half horse.


This process will take time, as the horse learns to read your cues and you his. It will require patience, perseverance and, of course, frequent riding. You can't expect to become one with a horse you only ride once a week.
Put time and effort into achieving oneness with your horse and the results will pay dividends.

, Grooming your horse is an important bonding experience, as it shows the horse that your relationship is not all about riding and work, it's also about spending time together and finding things that make him happy.


Thoroughly grooming your horse with a curry comb is a good place to start, just make sure to get all those spots that he can't reach himself, like his chest and belly.

, When it comes to bath time, make the experience as pleasant as possible for your horse by washing him with warm water -- not too hot, not too cold.


Work a specialized horse shampoo into his coat with a soft sponge, but be sure to thoroughly rinse it out afterwards, to avoid irritation.
Remove any excess water with a sweat scraper.

, A horses legs are very sensitive, so by allowing you to pick up his feet, a horse is displaying great trust. Let him grow accustomed to your touch by gently running your hands along his foreleg, starting above his knee and slowly working your way down towards the fetlock. If he grows skittish, stop and start again from the top.


Once he allows you to touch his fetlock, lightly squeeze a few inches above it with your thumb and forefinger. This is his cue to lift his foot.
Once he allows you to lift his foot, check that the shoe is intact and that there is nothing lodged in his hoof. Gently place his foot back on the ground and reward him with a pat.

, Giving your horse a massage is a great way to relax him and encourage trust. By working on any knots or sore spots, you will also be relieving pain and tension, which may also enhance his performance.Learn to recognize the feel of your horse's muscles, and be able identify which areas need the most work. In time, he will learn to lean into the massage, showing you where he needs work.
Sometimes a quick mouth massage is all that's needed, other times you will really need to dig in deep, working hard to loosen his hips or shoulder muscles., Essential oils (designed especially for horses) can work wonders for relaxing and calming your horse while you work on grooming.


Rub a couple of drops of your chosen oil under his nostrils and around his muzzle and he will happily oblige your every request.
As an added bonus, essential oils also work as an insect deterrent, which can be helpful during summertime treks."

Don't do anything violent towards the horse.,
Provide treats.,
Pique its curiosity.,
Speak quietly and rhythmically around your horse.,
Keep working on building trust at all times.,
Earn trust from your horse by being confident when riding.",How to Get a Shy Horse to Trust," This also includes within earshot of the horse or where it can see you. Violent behaviour sparks the instinct in the horse to flee.
, For especially shy horses, treat them when they let you pet them. Buy horse treats or fruits such as apples. At first, pet the horse where it can see you - neck, shoulders. When you are confident, try rubbing and stroking the horse gently on the cheeks, legs, and hindquarters., Horses are curious creatures. It may be worth sitting on a fence, or in the corner of the stable reading out loud or just talking to them; let the horse come to you. If you go to them, this ruins the whole point of the exercise. An animal that feels in control and responding to its own interest is less likely to feel flighty.

Let the horse nudge and sniff you before reaching out to pet it.

, When out riding, try the simple step of murmuring or talking in a low voice to the horse. Tell your horse about your day! This close communication can help a bond to form and the horse will grow attached to your voice and learn to trust it., Trust is an element of time. Never assume that the horse will trust you after a few days. Congratulate your horse both verbally with talking, and physically with petting. Realize that trust needs to worked on continuously., Horses feel your emotions in the way you ride. You must seem relaxed but alert... practice that stance and work on your confidence."
"
Keep yourself calm.,
Pet the horse's mane.,
Ride on a loose rein.,
Don't pull on the reins.,
Use indirect rein in cases of mild spook, instead.,
Use lateral flexion in serious cases of spook.,
Act sooner rather than later.,
End riding sessions on a good note.",How to Calm Down a Spooked Horse1," Riders can get nervous before shows, and this in turn can make the horse nervous. Take a moment to breathe and relax. Remember also, again, that the horse can read your mood and emotions. It is your job as a rider to be the leader. You have to be confident and guide your horse.;
, If you are already on the horse, pet its neck or massage and scratch the area around its hairline on its neck. You can also rub the horse below its ears. Try different techniques until you find the one that works best for you. A good technique is T-Touch – that is, moving your middle and pointer fingers in small circles around the horses body. This will help to ease the horse's tense muscles and calm it., A causal or loose rein is held in one hand, with elbow mostly straight and close to the mane. This requires experience on a horse. You might not feel safe without both hands on the rein or holding it close to your body. However, using two hands on the reins engages the horse's hindquarters and adds power to whatever they are doing. You have to remember that you are sitting on top of a prey animal! The most important thing is keeping the horse calm and assured. Use one rein for control to disengage the hindquarters., If your horse starts to spook, your first reaction will be to hold on tighter. Resist this feeling. Do not immediately pull back on the reins, as it can worsen the situation. The horse may react as if it is being attacked and fall into a total panic., Indirect rein is a technique that will stop the horse's forward motion and turn it, allowing the horse to circle and have some time to calm itself. You can do this by taking the rein in one hand and pulling back, inward, in the direction of the horse's outside hip. The rein will not cross over the neck but lay against it and apply small pressure to the animal's mouth., If the horse starts to buck, rear, or run, you may need to use something called lateral flexion and achieve a “one-rein stop.” Unlike indirect rein, this is a direct rein technique that stops the horse's feet when the animal is ready to stop – it does not force it to stop. With the “one-rein stop” you will need to shorten one rein smoothly and force the horse into a tight circle. Remaining centered and balanced, pull the left rein until the horse's head and neck bend in that direction. Keep your forward movement. The idea is not to stop the horse immediately but to slow it. Once the horse is in the turn, it will start to calm and relax, allowing you to slow to a walk and stop. , You should act promptly if you feel the horse become tense. Stay calm. A spooked horse is a dangerous horse and how you react may save you from an injury or worse. Try to diffuse the situation and bring the horse under control, dismounting if necessary., Your horse shouldn't fear the arena or get nervous whenever the saddle comes out. Don't punish the horse for an episode of spooking. This will merely frighten it and cause it to see you as a potential threat or predator."
"
Avoid the horse if you are a beginning rider.,
Stay calm.,
Reward calm behavior.,
Ride with a buddy.,
Earn the horse's trust.,
Check for physical discomfort.",How to Be Comfortable Around a Bad‐Tempered Horse1," If you are an inexperienced horse handler, this environment is not one you will learn or benefit from. A bad-tempered horse can be very dangerous, and training it requires skilled handling.


If you own the horse and do not wish to sell it, send it to a reputable trainer.;
, Horses can sense your fear, which can make the horse nervous or poorly behaved. Speak in a calm, quiet voice, and avoid flinching, shouting, and other anxious behavior.


If you are sweating nervously or your heart is pounding, stay back. Watch the horse from a distance and take slow, deep breaths to relax yourself. Think happy, calm thoughts. As you calm down, approach a couple, slow steps at a time.

, When the horse calms down or responds to your commands, reward it by patting its neck or shoulder, speaking in an encouraging tone, and giving it a treat. This will teach the horse to stay calm in order to get the reward.


This applies whether you are riding the horse or standing near it.

, If you don't feel comfortable around a horse, have your friend or trainer ride in front of you. Since horses are herd animals, your horse will naturally want to follow the horse in front. This is especially important when you're practicing a new skill.


Too much of this can make a horse ""herd bound,"" which may be a concern if you plan to take the horse to shows.

, Spend plenty of time talking to your horse and interacting with it so it gets to know and trust you. Set aside time for relaxing activities, such as grooming or a lazy grazing day.


As a more experienced owner, you can gain the animal’s respect with calm, consistent ground work, including exercises on a longe line and with free rein. This is a long process that requires an experienced and certified trainer, even if you have intermediate experience.

, The horse may be misbehaving because of an injury or another source of pain. If the behavior appeared recently, or if you cannot determine the cause, have a licensed professional perform a full physical examination.

Take several deep breaths before you get into the saddle.,
Talk to the horse and stroke him gently.,
Visualize your ride on the horse before you mount him.,
Use a tempo to help your horse stay calm during the ride.",How to Keep a Horse Calm While Riding1," Approaching the horse calmly, as a rider, can also help to keep the horse calm. Before you mount the horse, take several deep, long breaths. This will slow down your heart rate, which will also help your horse’s heart rate to remain steady and calm., Connect with the horse on the ground by talking softly and encouragingly to the horse. You can also put your hand by his head and allow him to get used to your presence. If he appears calm and responsive to you, you can gently stroke him behind his ears and around his neck.If you tend to ride the same horse, you may want to create a grooming routine that you do with the horse before every ride. This will allow you to connect to the horse on the ground and get him used to your presence.

, Take a moment to picture your ride on the horse. Focus on having a calm, relaxing ride on the horse and set an intention. This will help to keep you calm and avoid bringing any emotional or mental struggles you may be having into your ride with the horse., Horses respond well to rhythm and tempo, as they will act as guides for how to move their feet and stay calm. You can count out a tempo as you ride in a soft, calm voice or you can try to find a steady tempo as you ride so your horse can get comfortable.You can also download an Equi-Tempo app, which plays different rhythms for walk, trot, and canter. The app allows you to speed up or slow down the tempo according to your needs as a rider. Put your phone in your pocket and play the app on your phone as you ride so you and the horse can listen to the beat. You can then practice different tempos while riding and note which tempos seem to relax the horse the most.

Approach with care.,
Reassure the horse.,
Do not chastise or force the horse.,
Calm the horse with an herbal remedy.,
Lunge the horse.",How to Calm Down a Spooked Horse2," Show the horse that nothing is going to harm it. Move slowly while speaking comforting words – even though the horse might not understand you, it will be soothed by the calm sound of your voice. Keep your hands at your sides with palms facing up, as well. Be sure not to make any sudden movements., If the horse shies back or to the side, continue to speak to it in soothing tones. Try to find out what has alarmed it. This should be fairly obvious as the horse will either prick his ears and either look directly at the object or shy in the opposite direction. If you can safely approach, try rubbing the gentle spot in the middle of its forehead. Horses respond positively to massages like the so-called ""T-Touch."" This will relax the horse., Horses do not share our ability to reason. For them, an unknown shape or object signals a possible danger and is to be avoided. They won't understand that a rabbit or garden hose, for example, is not a danger. Punishing the horse or forcing it to confront what has spooked it will therefore not work, and in fact may worsen the situation, increasing the horse's fear. If you punish the horse, it may also begin to fear you., Formulas made from plants like lavender, chamomile, valerian, or bach flower are favorites for calming down horses. These can also calm riders. Herbal remedies come in several forms like herbal compresses, poultices, infusions, or tinctures of alcohol, water, and plant essence; depending on type, they can be given to the horse by inhalation or ingestion in its feed. Make sure that you follow the proper instructions for how to administer the remedy. , Lunging is a technique in which a horse is worked around a circle on a trainer's line. It can help inexperienced horses learn to respond to voice commands and a trainer's body language and will get them used to wearing a saddle and reins and to feeling the bit. Lunging can also settle a horse before you ride it, so it is always a good idea to do so. To lunge your horse you will need good boots, a ring arena, your voice, and a long line about 30-35 feet long. The idea is to have the horse circuit the arena with the guidance of your voice and a lunging whip, changing its pace and direction. Eventually it should come to recognize your voice for walking, trotting, cantering, and other commands.Be sparing with the lunging whip. Cracking the whip can upset the horse, while touching it with the whip is a signal for the animal to move forward strongly. .

Be calm.,
Approach the horse only if it is comfortable.,
Feed the horse.,
Visit the horse frequently.,
Try to read the horse's body language.,
Be patient.",How to Calm Down a Spooked Horse3," Horses can read your emotions. They can sense if you are agitated or angry and may become flustered. Remember that some horses will not immediately trust you and will need time, which can be weeks or even months. A misstep might cause them to panic. Always approach with calmly and with confidence, not timidly or shyly., If its ears are pinned or its nostrils are flared, this might indicate that it is agitated by your presence. Don't approach the horse in either of those cases, because your movement might spook the animal.If it is safe, approach from the left and front, if possible, speaking gently so that it is aware of your presence. Never approach the animal from behind., Horses learn by positive reinforcement.If the horse is calm and you are able to safely approach it, feed it tidbits like carrots, apples, sugar cubes, or horse treats to help gain its trust. This sort of positive reinforcement will calm the horse and assure it that you are friendly. Repeat this step a few times and, if the horse is willing to eat, stroke its mane. Keep in mind that certain foods are not good, however. Avoid giving horses onions, potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage, or any other vegetable that causes intestinal gas or belongs to the nightshade family., Once you have visited often enough, the horse should slowly become used to your presence and begin to trust you as a ""friend.” Continue your visits to establish a steady relationship with the horse and an ever stronger bond. After a time, the horse will trust you enough to let you on its back.

, Like humans, horses give physical signals about how they are feeling. A lowered head is a sign that the horse is relaxed, for example, while shaking the head is a sign of aggression. A rapidly darting gaze often indicates fear.Try also to read how the horse reacts to its environment. Spooking may be a psychological behavior for the horse, the result of a traumatic or abusive past. If your horse get nervous around a saddle, for example, this may mean that it has a bad association with saddles or there is something about the saddle that hurts it., And also be careful. Gaining the horse's trust might take some time. Keep working on the relationship. If your horse does spook and you are trying to restrain it, keep in mind that the animal does not necessarily know your intentions. It might panic or try to run, which could put you in danger of being kicked, bitten, or even run over. Putting more tension on the lead rein might make the situation worse. Be careful of your reaction.

"
This is a lengthy method that requires a lot of patience.,
Place the horse in a stall/holding area well away from other horses and people.,
After a few days, sit outside of the fenced area and read a book, while ignoring the horse.,
Approach the horse slowly and offer a treat in a bucket.,
Slowly attempt to stroke his head or neck area.,
When he accepts you (without the treat) to touch him, enter the enclosure at the opposite end of where the horse is located.

,
Allow it to approach you.,
Eventually, saddle and ride the horse again using the slow, gentle method.

",How to Be Comfortable Around a Bad‐Tempered Horse2," It is a long procedure but very gratifying when the horse responds. In order to make this process work, you need to do the following at all times:


Continuously speak to the horse in a rather soft/monotone voice.
Avoid spooking the horse by doing everything in a calm and slow manner.
Whenever the horse misbehaves (tries to bite or kick) during training, start all over again.

, Make sure he is properly fed and watered and his area is cleaned, but other than that, he should be ignored.

, After a few days of that, the horse will probably approach the fence where you are sitting and try to get your attention. Allow this to occur a couple of days in a row before you respond.

, If the treat is taken without any aggressiveness, do this for another couple of days.

, Again, depending on his response, continue doing this for the rest of the week.

,, If there is no trouble, start in with gentle grooming.

,"
"
Begin working the horse daily in a 40’ round pen.

,
Walk, trot and canter both directions until the horse begins to relax and give up.,
Initially, for the first 3-5 days or more, the horse will not appear to relax and it means being patient and continuing to work him.,
Repeat this process every day until you begin to see the signs that the horse is becoming respectful of you as the herd leader (as indicated by head position, licking lips, turning to face you when he stops, etc.).",How to Be Comfortable Around a Bad‐Tempered Horse3,", Try working off-line (meaning the horse is wearing only a halter) and do not have a longe-line on him; you may find it gives them the freedom to make good choices quicker as they feel less restricted/confined. Voluntary actions/reactions seem to stay with them longer.

, Ask him to walk, trot and canter until he’s tired and wants to stop. If you let him stop and he doesn’t crop his head, lick his lips or cock his inside ear toward you or voluntarily turn to face you even a couple steps (which he won’t) you ask him to go back to work. Repeat that process until the horse begins to drop his head as he travels, cock his inside ear towards you and and lick his lips. When he stops he should turn slightly towards you (but typically don’t turn and fully face you as they eventually will).

, That is the point of this entire process: to teach a horse who may otherwise have a domineering or bully attitude, to accept the handler as the herd leader and afford them the appropriate respect. Once the horse has accepted its handler as leader, it becomes easier to discipline ears pinned back and testy behavior.

"
"
Stay in charge.,
Alter your tone of voice.,
Respond to biting.,
Prevent the horse from walking ahead of you.,
React to rearing.,
Deal with pulling feet away when they’re picked up or refusing to let their head be touched with daily reinforcement in a quiet, relaxed manner.,
Keep an eye out for traumatic triggers.",How to Be Comfortable Around a Bad‐Tempered Horse4," The horse's aggressive behavior may be an effort to challenge you. It's important not to back down or let the horse take control, to show the horse that the behavior is not effective. Even a little hesitation before responding to bad behavior can encourage the horse to keep trying.

, When the horse behaves poorly, speak in a low, serious voice. When praising the horse, speak in a high pitched, cheery voice. This way, the horse will easily understand what behavior is acceptable and what is not.


Avoid shouting, which can startle the horse.

, If the horse tries to bite you, knock his teeth with your knuckles. Stare at him and scold him in a low, serious voice. Do not yell.


A smack on the neck or rear is also an appropriate response to this kind of behavior.

, If the horse tries to walk ahead of you while you are leading him, stop moving. Once the horse stops, walk ahead. This establishes you as the leader.


If the horse keeps walking too quickly, slow your pace to keep the horse calm.
Keep a firm hand on the lead rope, but do not yank it.

, If the horse rears or tries to break free of your lead rope, do not let him go unless you need to for safety reasons. If you are on the ground, lightly and repeatedly pull the lead rope until he stops. If you are riding, grip the horse with your thighs to stay in the saddle. Scold the horse for a couple seconds in a low tone.


If you cannot safely stay on the horse, learn how to avoid injury when falling.

, Brushing the face and head last before you turn them loose so they relate the two together can help.

, Many horses react poorly to specific activities, such as getting in the sower, being tacked up, or entering the pen. If the horse is generally well-behaved, the horse may have a specific trauma related to the activity. Getting the horse to accept this activity will take a lot of reassurance and trust. Approach the activity in small steps, rewarding the horse for calm behavior.

Think of the reins as a way to communicate with the horse.,
Practice the casual rein position.,
Avoid pulling or jerking on the reins while riding the horse.",How to Keep a Horse Calm While Riding2," The reins on your horse should act a form of communication, rather than control. The reins should move with the horse’s front feet, thereby connecting your body to the movements of the horse. Your horse’s front legs can act as your arms and hands, responding to how you move the reins.As you ride the horse and hold the reins, you should notice any signs of tension or stress in the horse. This could be his head moving up and down quickly, his jaw tensing up, or a quickening step. When he appears stressed, hold the reins with one hand and use the other hand to pet him and stroke him. This can help him to calm down.

, The casual rein position is when you hold the reins in one hand, close to the horse’s mane, with your elbows slightly bent. The reins should be loose in your hands. This position then allows you to bend down and put your hand on your horse with one hand, calming him as you ride.It can be difficult to do the casual rein position if you are not yet comfortable with riding on a horse. However, you should try to practice the casual rein position as much as possible while on the horse, as this displays trust and confidence in your horse.

, Though you may think that pulling or jerking on the reins will help you gain control of the horse, in fact, it will only spook him further. Pulling with two hands on the rein also causes you to pullback on the reins, preventing the horse from moving on his feet to calm down.If you do need to pull on the reins, try to do it with only one hand on the reins. When you pull on with one hand, you will turn the horse in a small circle but also allow him to keep his feet moving. This will then let him calm down on his own by moving his feet and getting his bearings.

Be aware of the function of the drop head cue.,
Practice the drop head cue on the ground first.,
Move to doing the drop head cue in the saddle.,
Encourage your horse to do the drop head cue on his own.",How to Keep a Horse Calm While Riding3," Your horse’s head can act as an indicator of his emotional state. When his head rises, he is tensing up and preparing for flight. A lowered head is a sign that he is relaxed and calm. You can teach your horse the drop-head response so he can learn to calm down on his own. This will ensure you have a smooth ride together and can rely on the cue in the event there is a tense or stressful situation during the ride., Practicing this technique on the ground first will allow your horse to get comfortable with the cue. Start by putting your horse in a rope halter with a training lead.Put your thumb and index finger on the knot just below your horse’s chin and apply steady, gentle pressure in a downward motion. Do not pull his head down. Instead apply pressure so he is aware of the cue.
Observe your horse. When he drops his head, release the pressure and praise him. Then, repeat the cue again. Be patient and move slowly, as getting him to drop his head a few inches during the initial practice can be challenging.
Over time, he will start to drop his head whenever you apply downward pressure. Encourage him to keep his head down towards the ground for a few minutes before rewarding him.

, Once your horse seems comfortable with doing the cue on the ground, you can move to practicing the cue in the saddle.


Tack him up and mount him. Then, have the horse stand still. Shorten one rein in your hand and lift the rein slightly to apply light pressure to your horse’s mouth. Wait a few seconds and do not increase the pressure so it is uncomfortable for him. You just want enough pressure for him to notice the cue.Observe him, as he may move his head a little to figure out the cue. Once he drops his head, release the reins and praise him.

, Practice the drop head cue on a frequent basis, perhaps during every ride, to get him used to the cue. You should also encourage your horse to do the drop head cue in any stressful situation during a ride. This will allow him to self medicate during the ride and react to a fearful moment in a calm manner."

Expect your horse to be calm.,
Keep your horse before your leg.,
Be prepared to spend many hours training a hot horse.,
Don't push your horse.",How to Calm Your Hot Horse1," Horses are herd animals, and a hot horse is sensitive to your moods and actions. If you expect your horse to be tense and excited, he won't disappoint. Tension in the handler results in tension for the horse.Every time you ride, take several deep breaths before getting on the horse. Relax your shoulders, relax your face. If you're still carrying tension from your day, your horse will pick up on it.
Before you mount, visualize how you'd like your ride to be. Picture your horse remaining attentive, responsive, calm and confident.
Only speak to your horse in a relaxed voice. If you use a tense, upset voice, your horse will respond with tension.;
, Your horse should respond immediately to light leg aids, or commands. When your horse is behind the leg, he is not following your directive. Instead, he is deciding for himself what he wants to do, when, and how much. Teaching your horse to go forward with light command is essential to keeping your hot horse calm. With a hot horse, the first thing to do is to discern the reason why he's behind the leg.Is your horse not responding to your aids because he's resisting them? If this is the case, change directions. Don't insist that your horse do what you want. Instead, request something different. Do a simple ground exercise, such as walking backward. Come back to the original directive when your horse is calmer.
If your horse is overly responsive to your aids, you may find yourself avoiding them. Or, you may become fearful and tense when giving them. Notice your own participation. If your horse is overly responsive, practice slowing down.

, While every horse is different, a hot horse will need extra work time. Never rush or hurry a hot horse. Your impatience can ruin hours of careful training.Giving your horse the time he needs with you or another trainer is probably the most important element of calming a hot horse. Rushing your horse through exercises can result in your horse developing anxious, irritable or even dangerous behavior.
If you don't have the time to do all the necessary training yourself, consider hiring someone to work your horse for you.

, When teaching something new, work slowly, making sure that each direction is clear and understood by your horse. If your horse doesn't understand what you're asking, try asking for less. Break your directive down into its most basic steps for teaching. If you feel frustrated or anxious, it's best to remove yourself from the horse until you calm down.
By pressuring or pushing your horse to do something he doesn't want to do, you're reinforcing the cycle of resistance already found in a hot horse. If you press them too soon, or if the horse really doesn't understand what you want, he can become rebellious, acting impulsively or headstrong.

Teach your horse that your touch can be trusted.,
Bring your horse to a round enclosed field or small paddock.,
Approach your horse from the side.,
Put your hand to your horse's neck or shoulder gently but firmly.,
Stroke your horse gently.,
Give her a treat to reward her trust.",How to Get a Head Shy Horse To Trust You1," A head shy horse has learned to avoid a human touch, whether because of maltreatment or accident. Your horse must be taught that human touch is a good thing. Behavioral training teaches this by associating the desired behavior with a reinforcement, or reward.The steps of behavioral training require time and patience. Teaching your horse to keep her head quiet when approached is the observable behavior that you can work on. Trust is something that can only develop over time.
Don't engage in behavioral training unless you're feeling calm and confident. If you lose your temper during this process, all the efforts you've put into training will be useless. It's essential that the behavior training is done in a consistent manner.;
, Lead your haltered horse with a soft rope or lunge line. Once inside the field, take the lead off and place it outside the fence.35-foot diameter paddock is the minimum safe area for working with your horse, though it can be as large as 60 feet.
Keep the paddock free of other distractions, loud noises, other animals, etc. The horse should feel safe and comfortable.

, Walk at a steady rate of speed, neither fast nor slow. Keep your body relaxed. If you're tense, the horse will likely pick up on that.Do not make eye contact with a nervous horse. Instead, place your gaze near her knee or lower body.
Wait until the horse shows that she's open to being touched. She might turn towards you, lick her lips or soften her eyes.
If your horse gives signs of not wanting to be touched, such as turning her head away or walking away, respect this. Never force touch on an animal.

, This isn't a rub or a pet, but simply a light touch. If your horse tenses or shies away, drop your hand and walk away.This is done for purposes of assessment. If, at the end of this assessment, your horse easily allows you to touch her, move your touch closer to her head.
If she doesn't allow you to touch her closer to her head, go back to the area where she was comfortable with your touch. The trick is to go at her rate of speed in order to develop trust.
Only allowing brief touches will encourage your horse to trust you. She may be overwhelmed by longer touches. She will learn that you respond quickly to her pulling away from an unwanted touch.

, With your fingers, follow the direction of her hair in a rubbing motion. This is a brief petting, about 3 seconds. Then walk away, as before.Again, you're teaching your horse that you are a safe person. Your touch is safe, but firm.
Through repetition, you can move your hand closer and closer to the areas of her head she may not have allowed you to touch before.
Over time, you can keep your hand on your horse for a longer time. 3 seconds can increase to 4 seconds, then to 5. If she shies away, you'll know you've gone too fast. Go back to the amount of time she's comfortable with and try again.

, As soon as you feel her relax beneath your touch, remove your hand and offer her a treat.With one hand on her head, say, ""Good girl!"" or whistle to her softly.


You'll want to reinforce the trusting behavior while it's happening, so that the behavior and the reinforcer are strongly connected.
The sound of your affirming whistle or voice serves as a way to draw the horse's attention to what's happening at that moment. If she's relaxed, even for a very small time, you can draw her attention to that relaxation.
Hold a treat in the hand that's not touching the horse. If the horse tenses, even briefly, do not pursue her. Pause, or walk away.

Put a long, comfortable lead on the horse, if possible.,
Choose a good location.,
Bring along a calm horse if possible.,
Keep your voice and body language calm and controlled.,
Stand to one side of the horse.,
Display the object that scares the horse.,
Read the horse's body language.,
Give the horse a couple minutes to calm down.,
Slightly increase the pressure.,
End the training session on a positive note.,
Continue this training once or twice a day.",How to Desensitize a Horse1," Before you begin desensitization training, put a well-fitting halter onto the horse. Attach a long lead that won't tear up your hands if you need to pull it.


If you are trying to desensitize the horse to a halter or bridle, see more specific information on haltering an unruly horse and bridling a horse. The steps below may still provide useful information as well.;
, If the horse is very skittish and afraid of many sounds and outdoor phenomena, start the training indoors so you can focus on just one object or experience. Otherwise, outdoor training may help accustom the horse to objects in the natural conditions it will encounter them.


Once a skittish horse has shown improvement during these desensitization sessions, bring it outside for the next one to help it become accustomed to ""real world"" situations.

, Horses are social animals that take cues from the reactions and body language of other horses. If you have another horse that is already desensitized and calm, bring it along as an example to help calm the sensitive horse down.

, Horses can pick up on your stress or anger, and this can spook them further. Relax and lower your shoulders, and keep your movements relaxed and controlled. Speak calmly but authoritatively. Do not shout or use an angry tone of voice.


If you are trying to desensitize the horse to loud voices, have an assistant stand nearby and talk loudly. As the trainer, you need to remain calm and reassuring, to show the horse that nothing harmful is happening.

, Horses are most easily spooked from the front or the back. Stand a short distance away from the horse's side, near the front so the horse can see you. Begin at least five feet (1.5 meters) away when starting training.


For small horses and ponies, you may stoop down to their level to calm the horse further. Do not do this if there is any risk of the horse kicking you.

, The goal of desensitization training is to gradually ramp up the level of ""pressure"" on the horse, waiting until it is comfortable with each stage before moving upward. Start by simply showing the horse the object that spooks it, without using it to make noise or moving it around. Keep the pressure low at first by holding the object below the level of the horse's head.


If the horse is afraid of an experience, such as being given a bath, choose an object that is related, such as a hose or spray bottle.
If the horse is afraid of a large object, such as a horse trailer, lead it near the object, but allow it to stop a short distance away.

, At this point, the horse's head should raise into an alert position, and it may try to shy away. If at any point, the horse shows signs of more violent behavior, such as aggressive rearing or kicking, taking the horse to a professional horse trainer is highly recommended.

, Continue to display the object, speaking calmly and reassuringly, until the horse lowers its head, takes a deep breath, or begins working its jaws. These are signs that the horse has calmed down, and may recognize that the object is not a threat. Praise the horse to reward this behavior.

, Move on to a slightly more stressful situation, such as waving the object around gently or using it to make a quiet noise. Watch the horse return to its alert position, and again praise it for its behavior.


Many trainers put a scary object, such as a plastic bag, on the end of a pole or stick. This allows them to wave the object around near the horse without risking a kick.
If the horse doesn't freak out too much when you approach it with the object, you may be able to hold it near the horse for it to investigate and sniff.

, This may be enough for the first training session, especially if the horse took more than a few minutes to calm down. Desensitizing a horse can take a great deal of patience, so don't try to rush through it in one training session. Instead, end the session right after the horse has shown positive behavior, typically calming down. Remove the scary object, and reward the horse with praise and an edible treat.


When praising a horse, speak quietly with a positive tone of voice. Pet or rub the horse, rather than slapping its sides., A maximum of two short training sessions is recommended. Begin with simply displaying the object each time, until the horse calms down. Continue to gradually increase the pressure on the horse, making louder noises with the object or waving it around more aggressively. Praise the horse each time it calms down, and give it a special treat at the end of the training session.


Once the horse remains calm around the object, try the same process again while the horse is walking. Some horses are more easily spooked while moving.
The final stage of desensitization is often the placement of the object on the horse's body. Start at the back and side, then gradually increase the pressure over several training sessions by moving to the legs, hindquarters, feet, neck, and face.

Walk your horse back and forth.,
Walk your horse using the longe line.,
Mount your horse, but remain still.",How to Calm Your Hot Horse2," Do this simple calming exercise before attempting to mount a hot horse. With your horse on a longe line in a quiet paddock, position yourself about 6 feet from your horse's head. Standing calmly, keep your feet still, and ask your horse to back up. Use only your rope and body position. Angle your body and head toward your horse, and gently twirl your longe line in the air with your free hand. Your horse should respond by walking backwards. After a few steps, stop, and request your horse to walk forwards. Let the spinning rope go limp, and lean back with your body. You may gently rock back on one leg.This exercise serves to keep your horse engaged with you, confident of your directive, and rids him of excess energy.
Repeat this exercise multiple times, for perhaps 10 minutes total.
Return to this exercise any time during your riding session when you feel your horse becoming hot and anxious.

, Standing in one position, direct your horse to walk around you slowly, while holding his longe line. His eye gaze should be on you at all times, his ears directed towards you, and his nose angled slightly in your direction. Any work you do on the longe line will reinforce the horse's attention on you, without the excitement of having a rider.When your feet stop moving, the horse should too. Let him stand still for a second, relaxed. He should continue to be attentive to you - including eye gaze and ears held in your direction. If he attempts to look away, click your tongue to draw his attention. Then instruct him to walk in the opposite direction. This teaches him that he can stop, take a little break.
Repeat this exercise multiple times, for perhaps 10 minutes total. You may want to occasionally intersperse this exercise with the walking back and forth exercise shown above.
You can ask her to speed up to a trot, then slow down again to a walk. This teaches her to speed up her body's movements without adding excitement, and consequent anxiety.
The purpose of these exercises is not to tire your horse out, but to engage them with your direction.

, Start by positioning your horse beside a mounting block. Stand on the block. If your horse isn't completely calm, simply stand beside him until he relaxes. When your horse is completely calm and relaxed, mount your horse. The first exercise is simply to remain standing, with you mounted. Simply sitting on your horse is an exercise teaching him to remain calm. Do not allow your horse to move unless he's completely calm.Once your horse is completely calm, direct him to walk a few steps, then stop, stand and relax again. Give your horse praise for remaining calm.
Repeat this exercise multiple times, until your horse is completely relaxed while moving as you ride.

Use a mild bit.,
Make sure your horse gets plenty of pasture time.,
Find a professional trainer.",How to Calm Your Hot Horse3," If your horse isn't comfortable in his bit, he won't be calm. A good bit will fit more on the bars of the horse's mouth than the tongue. Experiment with different bits until you find the bit that is right for your horse.Hot horses often dislike the pressure of the bit, and, not understanding why the bit is there, become even more resistant and worried. This results in an inexperienced rider using more pressure on the but, which reinforces the cycle.
If you must teach your horse to accept a bit of any sort, try using an elastic insert. This insert releases pressure in response to the horse's relaxation. This reinforces his relaxing, and teaches him to accept the bit.

, If your horse is kept cooped up in a pen too many hours per day, he's more likely to be hot with pent-up energy and excitement when he finally gets into the pen. A healthy horse will want to release this energy by running and playing.Your horse should get plenty of grass and hay, with only a little grain. Too much grain means too much energy for a horse.
Pasture turn-out is a great stress-reliever for your horse.

, Sometimes, even an experienced rider won't be able to figure out how to calm their hot horse. It can be helpful to have the aid of an professional who isn't emotionally involved with the horse. The trainer may be able to spot behavioral routines you may have developed with your horse.Check with your local riding stable, equine veterinarian or farrier about professional trainers in your area.
A good way to evaluate a potential trainer is to observe them at work with another horse. Ask if you can schedule a time to observe them at work. If their training style makes you uncomfortable, you should try another trainer. A good trainer should inspire confidence.
Be prepared to make detailed observations while you watch the potential trainer at work. Are the stables clean and well-tended? Does it look like a safe place for horses and people? How does he interact with the other horses?
Once you've found a trainer you like, arrange one session between the trainer and your horse. Horses respond differently to every person, and you want to make sure that there's a good fit between your horse and the trainer.

Learn about passive and active abuse.,
Ask questions about your horse’s past.,
Identify what special needs your abused horse will need.,
Become familiar with your abused horse’s other needs.,
Learn your horse’s body language.,
Learn the proper way to approach your horse.,
Touch your horse.,
Talk to your horse.,
Teach your horse to yield to pressure.,
Lead your horse.,
Be consistent.",How to Gain the Trust of a Recently Abused Horse," Before working to gain your abused horse’s trust, it will be important for you to understand what type(s) of abuse he suffered in the past. There are two types of abuse: passive and active. Passive abuse does not involve physical harm. Rather, it is characterized by neglect—lack of food, water, shelter, or veterinary care.Active abuse involves physical harm, such as excessive use of a whip, unreasonably heavy loads, and beatings.The type of abuse may play a role in how long it will take for your horse to trust you. Passive abuse may be easier for your horse to overcome than physical abuse.;
, Learning what type of abuse your horse endured will help you understand what kind of uphill battle you will face to gain his trust. Obtaining more information about his life as a whole will give you an even better idea of how to work with him. For example, you can ask more probing questions about his abuse: When did the abuse start? How long did it last? How severe was it?


Consider asking what your horse is afraid of.Ask about his prior veterinary care (e.g., deworming, vaccinations, dental exams).
Try to learn more about his temperament: Is he aggressive? Does he startle easily?
Finding out whether your horse has worked with an equine behaviorist would be helpful information.
There are many questions you could ask the previous owner or rescue group to learn more about your horse. Ask as many questions as you can think of.

, Depending on the nature or severity of your horse’s recent abuse, he may have many special needs. For example, if he suffered from a lack of food and water, he will probably have specific dietary needs to help him put weight back on and correct nutritional deficiencies.If he did not receive consistent veterinary care, he will probably need a number of veterinary services—deworming, vaccinations, dental exam, shoe trimming, etc.Active abuse may have left him with physical injuries requiring veterinary care.
Keep in mind that the effects of abuse may not be visible. He may have developed serious behavioral issues, which could necessitate the expertise of an equine behaviorist.Consult with your veterinarian to determine what special needs will need to be addressed to get your horse back into good shape., Your recently abused horse will likely be emotionally fragile. Before he can even begin to trust you, he will need to feel emotionally safe and comfortable with you. In addition to this emotional comfort, he will need to regain a sense of companionship and routine.


These needs are just as important as his more basic needs (e.g., food, water, shelter).
Training exercises and quality time with your horse will help you address these needs.

, Being able to read your horse’s body language will allow to you communicate with him more effectively, which will in turn help you gain his trust. Your abused horse may demonstrate certain body language as a result of the abuse (e.g., trembling, tense muscles). The more you understand how he is feeling at any given moment, the better you will be able to address his abuse.


Trembling is very common in abused horses. Your horse may begin to tremble and shake as you approach him, out of fear that you will hurt him.A trembling horse may be signaling that he is ready to bolt. Be prepared to quickly move to safety if your horse begins to tremble.An abused horse may also tense his muscles in response to being touched or approached.Physical abuse may have caused your horse to exhibit aggressive body language, such as striking with a front leg, swinging his hindquarters, and pinning back his ears.For your own safety, do not attempt to approach or work with your horse if he is being aggressive.
Talk with your veterinarian or equine behaviorist if you are unsure how to read your horse’s body language.

, How you approach your abused horse is an important factor in whether you will gain his trust. Slow and easy movements are a must.In addition, you should approach him from his side, not directly in front of him.Approaching him from his front may look threatening to him, which may make him wary or afraid of you.
Your body language (relaxed breathing, slow walk) should communicate that you are calm, confident and aware of your surroundings.Do not make direct eye contact with your horse as you approach him.Wait a short distance away from your horse before approaching him. This will allow you to observe his body language and determine if he is ready for you to be in his personal space.If he looks relatively calm (e.g., ears turned to the side, lowered head, cocked hind leg),proceed with walking towards his side.
Body language that signals fear or anxiety (e.g., ears cocked back, pawing at the ground, tightened facial muscles),indicates that your horse may not want to be approached.
Consider the ‘advance and retreat’ method. Approach his side for a few seconds, then back away. Approach again, scratch his shoulder or withers, then back away again. Your horse will not only feel safe around you when you do this (predators don’t advance and retreat), but he will also be curious about you., Your abused horse may be averse to being touched—he may equate this to physical pain and punishment. For this reason, you should be extremely careful with how and where you touch him. Begin by gently scratching his chest, shoulder, or withers.Watch your horse’s body language as you touch him. An abused horse may be especially skittish and prone to making sudden movements. Staying aware of his body language will help you move out of the way quickly if you sense his fear and anxiety.
As he becomes more comfortable with you, try touching him in different areas of his body, such as his neck and legs.Avoid touching his face or head.Horses don’t particularly care for their noses being touched.Do not be overly affectionate with your horse.Not only may he not be ready for it, but horses in general are not overly affectionate with each other.

, How you talk to your abused horse also plays a role in whether he will trust you. His previous owners may have constantly yelled at him, or avoided talking to him at all. Talking to your horse in a soothing and reassuring voice will go a long way towards gaining his trust.


Do not ever raise your voice with him.Spend time talking with him for at least a few minutes each day.Of course, what you talk about is not important—the more you talk to your horse, the more he will recognize your voice and feel safe around you.

, In the wild, a pack of horses will have a leader that all other horses will follow. In order for your abused horse to trust you, he will need to see you as his leader who will protect and care for him.Teaching your horse to yield to direct and indirect pressure is a great way to establish that your leadership.


With direct pressure, you will gently press your hand against your horse’s body until he moves away. Release the pressure immediately after he moves away.For indirect pressure, you will attach a lead rope to your horse’s halter. Standing a few feet in front of him, point your index finger and wiggle the rope. Continue pointing and wiggling the rope until he begins to move back, then release the pressure.Do not be surprised if your horse does not learn to yield to pressure right away. Be patient with him and talk to him in a reassuring voice. Eventually, he will learn how to respond correctly to pressure.
Start with as little pressure as possible, then gradually increase the pressure with each practice session.
Keep in mind that abused horses may be either hypersensitive to pressure or desensitized to it.

, Leading your horse is another good way to establish that you are your horse’s leader. This type of training will teach your horse to respect your personal space and will help him trust and bond with you.Leading your horse from the partner position is the safest and most preferable way to lead your horse. You can stand next to either of your horse’s shoulders, but it is customary to lead from a horse’s left shoulder.It may be helpful to hold your elbow out—this will lessen the chance of your horse knocking you over if he starts to get too close to you.Be sure to coil the excess lead rope in your hand.Do not wrap it around your hand or wrist. You may get dragged and seriously injured if he bolts and you are unable to free yourself from the lead rope.
Leading your horse from his front (lead position) or back (drive position) is not recommended., Establishing leadership with your horse will take consistent, daily practice. Because of the abuse he suffered, your horse may take a long time to accept your leadership and trust you. Do not become discouraged, though. The more consistent you are with your training, the more your horse will trust you and feel safe with you.


Routines are very important to horses.
Consistency also applies to other ways of interacting with your horse, including grooming him and feeding him.

Teach your horse to associate your presence with treats.,
Pause before giving her the treat.,
Lift your other hand, palm open, towards her head.,
Touch your horse as she eats.,
Touch your horse before offering the treat.,
Move your touch to other parts of your horse's muzzle and head.,
Vary your training sessions.,
Be a leader for your horse.",How to Get a Head Shy Horse To Trust You2," At this point, do not attempt to touch her. Simply stand in front of her, slightly to her left, and offer her a treat with your open hand.Desensitization starts with simply being present in the vicinity of your horse's face. She will learn to associate your presence with something positive.
Work slowly, and allow the horse to direct the speed of progress. This will build trust.
After doing this several times, bring the treat within six inches of her muzzle. Then, drop your hand. She'll likely follow your hand with her head. Say ""Yes,"" or ""Good Girl,"" and offer her the treat. Do this several times, so that she learns to connect your hand and your words (or, to her, sound) with the treat.

, When she has made the connection between your hand and the treat, she will expect it. You are teaching her to desire your hand, because it contains the treat.


Hold this hand, palm down, fingers wrapped around the treat. When your horse lowers her head toward your other hand, let her have the treat.
Raising the head can be a sign of anxiety, and reinforcing a lowered head teaches her to be calm.

, Do not touch your horse, but simply hold your hand in place.This will teach your horse that having your hand in this area, close to her head, isn't dangerous. Although currently, this is something fearful for your horse, she can learn that having someone's hand here isn't always bad.
Repeat this many times over several days, until you're sure that your horse is aware of your hand and yet not bothered by it. Continue to wait until she lowers her head to reward her with a treat.

, When your horse has gained comfort with your hand near her head, you can start to touch her on her muzzle. Put your raised hand on the bridge of your horse's nose, below her eyes, as she eats her treat. Speak to her in a gentle, reassuring voice.As your horse finishes eating, she may try to pull away. Try to keep your hand on her muzzle until she relaxes. At the moment she relaxes, say, ""Yes"" and pull your hand away.
Repeat this step until your horse seems relaxed with your hand on her muzzle.

, Follow the same procedure as before, gently but firmly setting your hand to your horse's muzzle.Continue to keep the hand containing the treat low, so that she must lower her head to accept it.
When she relaxes, say, ""Yes,"" and give her the treat, and release your touch.

, Continue to wait for her to relax before offering the treat with your other hand. When she relaxes, say, ""Yes,"" and offer her the treat.Move slowly, gradually expanding the range of your touch, as you teach her to trust you on all areas of her head.
Start to stroke or massage your horse's head for a few seconds below her muzzle, before she gets her treat., Horses, like other animals, don't necessarily generalize well. For best teaching, train your horse in these steps on different times of the day, and in different places.Lowering her head should continue to be met with a treat in your palm. Don't offer her a treat unless her head is lowered.
When your horse is comfortable with your hand, start to teach her to trust the feel of cloth, or grooming instruments. Use the same training procedures as before.

, This will further your horse's sense of trust in you. Horses are a pack animals, and require a leader to feel safe and protected. Establishing leadership isn't about being dominant, but about establishing yourself as leader of the herd.


Correct your horse when she tests boundaries. Your goal is to make sure your horse knows who is in charge. When your horse is confident that you're in charge, she'll likely stop testing boundaries.
When your horse is fearful, encourage her to lower her head. A lowered head automatically relaxes a horse. Your horse may then learn to associate the feeling of relaxation and safety with you.

"
"
Be positive.,
Use a kind voice with your horse.,
Build credibility through consistency.,
Ask for professional help.",How to Get a Head Shy Horse To Trust You3," Your horse is sensitive to your emotional state. She'll be quick to pick up on your irritability or frustration. If you've decided that your horse is difficult, then she will be. Instead, approach your horse with a feeling of optimism and trust. This will increase the chances that she'll respond in the same way!


Talk to your horse frequently, whenever you're in the pen. Give her a nickname that describes the best way she can be, rather than focusing on her more difficult qualities.Remember that a relationship, whether with a horse or with a person, always has two partners. Knowing your own weaknesses as a trainer will help you from blaming your horse for behaviors which are yours.
Spending more time with your horse will help develop a positive relationship. Hang out with your horse, even if you're just reading a book in her stall, or cleaning the barn nearby. She should get used to your presence, and associate it with good things. Talk to your horse frequently and reassuringly.

, When talking with your horse, your voice should always be kind and positive. Never shout at your horse in an angry voice.Communication happens verbally and nonverbally. All communication with your horse should be kind. An violent yank on a halter, or a jerk on the reins, communicates angrily to your horse. This erodes trust, and should be avoided.
Make sure your communication with your horse is clear, concise and consistent.
Good grooming for your horse provides a daily opportunity to bond. Brushing your horse, caring for her hooves, combing her mane are all opportunities to practice positive communication.

, Developing consistent patterns of behavior will help increase your horse's ability to trust you. If you're predictable to your horse, your horse will be more likely to trust you.Pay attention to the praise you offer your horse. Is your praise being consistently directed? Or are you more often praising your horse based on your own good mood? If you are directing corrections to your horse, does it make sense to your horse?
Make sure you're using consistent directions when asking your horse to do something. Remember, even though your horse may be learning to respond to your commands, your horse does not - and never will! - be fluent in spoken language! Use consistent commands, both verbal and nonverbal, to get consistent results.

, Even the best trainers can sometimes get stuck. Sometimes the most effective way to work through a situation with a head shy horse can be to ask a friend, another trainer, or a professional instructor for help. Another person may be able to see a pattern that we couldn't.There are support groups for horse owners. Many horse owners will have come across the same challenges you face, and they're eager to share their experience. Search online for local area groups, or participate in online groups. Ask at your local stables or horse clubs.
Volunteer to help others. It's easier to have a clear perspective on situations you're not emotionally involved in. Helping another horse owner with their situation may result in fresh insights regarding your own pattern of behavior with your horse.

Wait until the horse is comfortable with being ridden.,
Bring along another, desensitized horse if possible.,
Ride past spooky objects near the end of a ride.,
Move past the objects at a normal pace.,
Praise the horse whenever it calms down.,
Only dismount as a last resort.,
Perform other training sessions outdoors.",How to Desensitize a Horse2," When first riding a horse and teaching it to respond to cues, pick a less stressful area away from sensitive objects. Desensitizing will be much easier with a horse that responds to cues such as your voice, leg movements, and reins.

, If possible, ride along with a more experienced, calmer horse that can pass the ""scary"" objects without difficulty. The more skittish horse will often take cues from nearby horses, and reevaluate whether the objects are actually a threat.

, Plan your route so you'll ride past stressful areas such as loud roads or cow fields on your way back home. If you spook the horse near the beginning of the ride, the experience will be more difficult and unpleasant for both you and the horse.

, Do not allow the horse to increase its speed to pass by the objects. Desensitization comes from repeat exposure in ordinary conditions, so the horse eventually realizes there is no real threat.

, It may take many rides and a great deal of patience before the horse is fully desensitized to the objects. Smaller signs of progress are usually visible along the way, however. Praise and reward the horse whenever it manages to stay calm, or calmer than usual, near the scary object.

, If the horse is becoming difficult to control and panicked, dismount and walk the horse past the scary objects. Use this as a last resort only, as the goal is to get the horse to calm down in ordinary circumstances. If this occurs often, try to find a riding route that keeps the horse further away from the scary objects, but still within visible range.

, If a horse spends more time outdoors, it will encounter more loud noises and unexpected objects. Even when not focusing on the desensitization training, exposing the horse to more of these stimuli in ""real world"" situations will help desensitize the horse.

Loosen the reins.,
Stay in the center of the saddle.,
Assess your horse's current attitude.,
Prevent a repeat rear.,
Determine the cause of the rear.,
Assess what might be the problem.,
Check the horse's bit.,
Evaluate your own riding style.,
Practice groundwork.,
Give your horse plenty of exercise.,
Get help from a professional trainer.",How to Make a Horse Stop Rearing while Riding," If your horse starts to rear, the first thing you should do is loosen the reins. This may seem counterintuitive, as your gut reaction will probably be to pull, but this will only make things worse.Continue to maintain your grip on the reins. In other words, don't just let go or loosen your grip.
Push your hands towards the horse's mouth while holding firmly onto the reins to loosen them up.
Never pull back when the horse starts to rear. This may cause the horse to rear further, potentially flipping the horse over on top of you.;
, While loosening the reins, make sure you remain centered in the saddle. This will help you keep your balance as the horse rears and flails.You may be tempted to lean with the horse or to try and lean around whatever it's afraid of (if there's something on the trail).
Leaning in any direction will only increase the chances that you will slip out of the saddle or get thrown over the horse's shoulder.
Grab onto the horse's mane or the front of the saddle (or saddle horn, if you have one) for extra stability during the rear.

, If your horse has just reared, there's a chance it may try to rear again. You'll need to assess how the horse is currently acting/reacting to determine if there's a chance the horse will rear again.If it was just a one-time rear and your horse has continued walking calmly, you should be safe. However, you should still be on guard in case it happens again.
If your horse is balking and appears to be ""threatening"" to repeat another rear, you'll need to hold on and try to prevent it.

, Now that you've pulled your horse out of a rear and assessed its attitude, you'll need to take precautions to prevent another rear. If you feel that your horse might repeat another rear, you may not be able to fully prevent it, but you can reduce the horse's ability to rear up. This will eventually calm the horse down until it is more stable and willing to ride or walk back to the stable.Tighten your grip on one of the reins (but not both).
Pull that rein out to the side as far as you can go, and with as much strength as you can.
This will lead the horse into a half-circle or a turn.
Keep that rein off to the side until the horse is fully calmed down and no longer threatening to rear.
If the horse attempts to rear again at this point, it will be significantly less powerful and less effective. The horse will be forced to move horizontally, and even if it tries to rear it won't put you in nearly as much danger.

, Once your horse is calm and the situation has been defused, you'll need to figure out why your horse reared up in the first place. The first thing you should consider is whether something scared your horse on the trail or in the field.Look around your immediate area for anything your horse might have been frightened by.
Remember that your horse may have been frightened by something other than an animal. If your horse has never crossed a creek before, for example, it could be frightened of the water.
If there is nothing in your surroundings that could have caused the rear, your horse was most likely either uncomfortable (perhaps with the bit you've used, or the way you're riding).

, Once you've ruled out a fearful stimulus in the horse's immediate environment, you can safely assume that the horse is uncomfortable or otherwise displeased with the way you're riding it.It now falls on you to assess what the problem might be and take the necessary steps to correct/avoid that problem, which is most likely an issue with the equipment you're using or the way you're riding your horse.

, A painful or uncomfortable bit is often the cause of what appears to be bad behavior. If a bit does not fit the horse's mouth well, the horse may be distracted or even in pain. If your horse's mouth is actively in pain when you ride, it's no surprise that the horse would react to the pain and try to free itself from the source.A horse's age, mouth size (height, width, and depth), tongue thickness, lip thickness, and head length can all affect the way a bit fits in a horse's mouth.
Depending on the horse's temperament and level of discomfort, a poorly-fitted bit could potentially lead to continued rearing problems.
Talk to a horse equipment expert at your stable or at an equine supply store. Take measurements of your horse's mouth and head size, bring some photographs showing the horse's lips and face, and consider trying a different bit.

, If there is nothing wrong with the bit and you're certain that nothing in the field startled your horse, your riding style could be the problem. Check your overall form and think about whether anything you're doing could make your horse uncomfortable or send mixed messages about what you want the horse to do.Your horse could be uncomfortable and frustrated if you give it conflicting signals. For example, kicking your horse forward while simultaneously pulling back on the reins will confuse and irritate your horse.
If you're poorly balanced in the saddle, your horse may also try to rear out of frustration/discomfort., Doing regular groundwork practice with your horse is the best way to control its feet. If you've been having problems with your horse rearing, groundwork should help reduce the risk of future rearing.Retrain the horse to stop by teaching it to step back in response to light taps with a long whip on the front of the horse's shins.Practice keeping your horse's head down to avoid future anxiety-induced rears. Apply downward pressure by standing next to your horse while it's ""parked,"" holding the reins under the horse's chin and gently rocking your hand side to side, then releasing once the horse lowers its head.
Practice these techniques while standing on the ground, and once your horse has relearned these skills you can practice them while in the saddle.
Reward your horse with treats that it likes, and give your horse verbal praise.

, Too much time indoors can lead to undesirable behavior in many horses. Even if you can't get your horse out on a trail, your horse will still find being in a paddock preferable to being in the stall. Spend as much time as you can with your horse, and make sure your horse gets as much exercise and outdoor time as possible.A lack of exercise may not be the direct reason why your horse balked and reared, but it could contribute towards a sense of mistrust or resentment of your command.
Your horse should ideally get several hours each day of pasture time with other horses, or riding/exercise time with you or another rider., If your horse is still exhibiting rearing problems, your horse may have learned that rearing will get it out of doing undesirable activities and following commands. If this is the case, your horse may need some retraining from a professional trainer.A professional trainer will be able to assess your horse's behavioral problems, work directly with your horse, and give you pointers on how to prevent problems like rearing in the future.
You can find professional trainers by checking in your local phone book, or by searching online.
Make sure your trainer is certified, and don't be afraid to ask about his or her experience and educational background.
Be patient with your horse. Remember that your horse is not trying to be malicious, and with time and some hard work, you and your horse can become life-long partners.

Know what it is.,
When you take your horse riding, be aware of what is most likely to make your horse crow hop.,
Always keep in mind the age, state, and physical ability of your horse.,
Pay attention.,
Try your best to stop your horse before it crow hops.,
If your horse does crow hop, make sure you discipline them so that they know that what they did was not acceptable (I am a strong believer in discipline-NOT abuse.),
And lastly, make sure that all of your horse's equipment fits properly.",How to Find out Why a Horse Is Crow Hopping," Crow hopping is like a small buck. It is just enough to get you slightly out of your seat, and forward. It can be very uncomfortable, especially if you are not expecting it. Always be aware of your horse, and its habits. It's never a bad idea to be prepared for the worst.;
, A lot of the time it can result from pushing them to canter, or making them do something they don't wish to do (however, you must continue to push your horse-as long as what you are doing is feasible for your horse to accomplish).

, Make it habit to ask yourself these questions before pushing your horse to do something. Is my horse ready to accomplish this task? Is my horse able to accomplish this task? Am I pushing them too hard?


A young horse (green) is most likely to give you a ride for your money. They will sometimes crow hop when pushed to do certain things, but can also crow hop spontaneously. You never know so be ready.

, Normally when a horse gets ready to crow hop, you can feel it. If they are in motion, usually their gate will become choppy, and ""bouncy"". Other times, they do it quickly, giving you no time to react. In either case, do your best to keep their head up. Although the hop may never develop into a buck, it is always a smart idea to keep their head up just in case.

, If you can prevent it, by all means-do! This is the best way to handle the situation (however, I do realize that some times can't be stopped.)

,

, A bridle that is too tight or a saddle that pinches will only cause your horse irritation, resulting in a very unhappy horse and rider.

"

When a horse bucks, immediately disengage the horse's hindquarters.,
Do the ""scrunch."",
If your horse does buck, sit deep in the saddle.,
If you're uncomfortable, get off the horse, but do not run away.,
If you have a close relationship with the horse, let him smell you.",How to Stop a Horse from Bucking1," This is done by pulling your reins sharply to either the left or right, and make your horse touch its nose to your leg. A horse cannot buck when it is in this position; it can only move in an incredibly tight circle. It also reinforces you as being the herd leader and loosens the horse's muscles up so that it is easier for the horse to move.


Do not release the horse until it completely stops moving, and then hold for three seconds. Repeat on the other side, just to reinforce your point to the horse. Every time the horse is about to buck, or starts bucking, repeat. If a horse is prone to bucking, do this every time you get on the horse – both standing beside the horse and once you mount.;
, Using one hand, gather your reins, and slide your other hand down the reins, creating a tight ""scrunch"" on the horse's neck. This triggers a certain vertebrate in their necking, causing them to be unable to buck. Also remember to use your legs, and the horse should back up. Once the horse has started to calm down, release the pressure of both your legs and reins.


A horse cannot buck without putting its head down. Keep a tight rein so you can pull back when you feel the horse trying to lower its head, thus preventing the horse from being able to buck.

, Keep your heels down and your shoulders back, and give strong pulls on the reins to discourage the horse from putting his head down. Remember – a horse with their head up cannot buck.


Also, make sure to keep your leg on. Many times a rider will try to correct bucking by stopping the horse. It is much more correct to reinforce forward motion. Do not let the horse stop. Many times, horses will learn that bucking can get them out of work.

, The first thing to do is to lean back; this will highly lessen the chances of you falling forward onto your head. However, if you are not a strong rider, you may find it easier to simply get off your horse. This may sound like a bad idea, but think about it: if you really think you are unable to stay on your horse, would you rather get off it yourself or be bucked off?


The safest direction to dismount is the side. Quickly loosen your feet from the stirrups and slide off in whichever direction seems most safe. It would be a good idea to pick the side where there is not another horse nearby
If there are people near you, they will probably already be trying to help the situation. If riding alone, call for help. There will most likely be at least one other human being at the stable that can help control the situation.
Once you are off your horse, do not run away. This may cause your horse to think there is a danger and run with you or even at you. Walk away from your horse while still keeping an eye on it. Once it has settled down, if you are unharmed, feel free to get back on the horse. It's not always their fault and it is cruel to judge a horse on something they did once. Let him/her prove to you they are a good horse and are trustworthy after all.

, The first step to stopping a horse from bucking is to remove the perceived threat. The second step is to signal to the horse your scent (identity) by blowing toward the horse's nostrils. They have large olfactory glands that can distinguish many smells and use this to identify different people/animals/other horses/etc. Once the horse has this, if you are familiar to them, they will usually calm down.


If they still have not calmed down, you'll just have to wait it out. Once they calm down a little, the third step is to place your hand on the upper nose of your equine friend and speak to your horse, drawing your horse's attention to you. Continue to do this pulling your horse close to you and petting your horse on the neck. After this, it's good to take your horse for a walk around so they rebuild their confidence in their surroundings and see there's nothing to worry about.

Stand about 3 feet (0.9 m) directly in front of your horse.,
Look your horse in the eye.,
If your horse does not respond to your gentle shaking, begin to shake a little harder.,
Wait several seconds, then gently shake the rope again.,
Little by little, as your horse begins to grasp the concept, you can ask for more steps backward.",How to Teach Your Horse to Back up from the Ground," Give him plenty of slack in the rope---about 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) is best to start with.;
, Beginning very gently, start shaking the lead rope from side to side. Watch your horse's reaction. If he so much as lifts his head, immediately stop shaking and praise him.

, Increase the shaking according to your horse's resistance while you continue to watch his reaction. The minute he shows a sign of yielding, such as raising his head, stop shaking and praise him.

, Stop shaking as soon as you get a response from your horse, whether it's a lifted head or a step back.

, It is very important, however, that you do not rush the learning process, and be sure to reward your horse's efforts by stopping the shaking and giving verbal praise.

Bring the required equipment with you.,
Wet your horse.,
Watch your horse for the required behaviour.,
Repeat the “wet and watch” process.,
Add a cue.,
Extend the time between the behaviour and the click.,
Provide gentle praise and encouragement throughout training.,
Change up the trick.",How to Teach Your Horse to Lie Down1," To train a horse using a clicker, you’ll need to (obviously) bring the horse and clicker with you, but you’ll also need your horse’s favourite treats. Plus, for safety purposes, you should wear the proper equipment yourself so you don’t get hurt if the horse gets spooked.A helmet is always an excellent piece of safety equipment to have when around horses, especially for children.
Don’t begin a training session if you do not have the time and patience to follow through. Training any type of animal takes time and repetition.;
, When a horse is wet, it naturally wants to lay down in order to roll around. Wetting your horse will encourage him to do the exact behaviour you’re looking for, without any prompting or commands.The best method to use to wet your horse would be a garden hose, if you’re able to find one long enough to reach where you are.
Alternatively, if a garden hose isn’t possible, use a couple of buckets filled with water. You may even be able to use the horse’s water trough to fill or re-fill the buckets.

, After you’ve wet your horse, stand back and watch him. When your horse lays down naturally, click the clicker and give him a treat. This reinforces that the behaviour of lying down is the behaviour that gets the treat.This may take a long time, which is why you have to be patient. You also have to be paying attention. If you click too long after your horse has lay down, he might not connect the right behaviour with the reward.
If your horse has already been clicker trained for other types of behaviours, he may recognize the clicker sound and know that a treat is coming. This may speed the process up because your horse already knows he must perform a specific behaviour to hear the click, and a click means treats.

, Continue to watch, click, and reward your horse for the behaviour of lying down. If you’re horse isn’t use to clicker training, and it takes awhile to connect the dots between the behaviour, the click, and the treat, you may need to re-wet your horse so he'll continue to do the behaviour naturally., Once your horse has connected lying down with a click and a treat, you want to add a cue or signal to the process. This cue or signal is the sign you’ll give when you want your horse to lie down. You now need to get your horse to connect the cue with the combination of lie down-click-treat.The key to this step is to ONLY click and provide a treat when your horse lies down WHEN you’ve given the proper cue or signal.
If your horse lies down on his own, without the cue or signal, do not click or reward the behaviour.
A cue for this step can be anything that works for you and your horse, including a word or verbal command, hand gesture, whistle, or other sound. You will want to select a cue that isn’t related to a gesture or word you may say on a regular basis, otherwise your horse may be confused.
Like all the other steps, this may take a while, so be patient.

, The purpose of training your horse to lie down isn’t to also have him jump back up immediately. You’re likely training your horse to lie down because you want him to stay in that position for at least a short time (maybe during a vet appointment, etc.). In order to train your horse to stay lying down, increase the pause between when your horse lies down and when you click the clicker.Start with a short pause and slowly work your way to longer pause.
If your horse doesn’t stay lying down until you’ve used the clicker, do not give him any treats.

, Regardless of whether your cue/signal ends up being a voice command, continue to talk to your horse in a gentle manner while training him. Praise him at the same time as you click and provide him with a treat., If you’re training your horse to lie down because you want him to eventually perform a trick, you’ll need to work this into the training after he’s learned the lie down behaviour properly.For example, maybe you don’t want lying down to the be the final phase, but instead the look of your horse actually sitting down on his rump but his front hooves on the ground. This position would come naturally to your horse when he goes to stand up (since he’ll usually start with standing up on his front hooves). You then need to time the click and treat with the exact position you want.
There is no need to turn this into a trick. Simply being able to get your horse to lie down may be all you need or want.

Find out what training your horse had.",How to Get a Horse to Not Buck," Start by reading the part below on managing a bucking horse, and also learn from experienced riders or guides.;
, Wear a helmet, sit deep in the saddle, and keep your heels down.

, Even a burr could bring a horse to bucking, so don't take this task lightly.

, Pay special attention to where the saddle and girth will be.

, The horse will usually let you know if it is.

, You do not want to take a chance at being dragged.

, When the horse's neck is turned, the horse doesn't have the balance it needs to buck.

,, Make sure you don't end the riding session until the horse behaves and stops trying to buck.

, If you cannot get the horse to stop bucking, have a more experienced rider ride the horse and give you suggestions. This may be the only choice if you are a novice, as your attempts may have taught the horse that he can get away with bucking. An experienced rider will be ready to deal with such shenanigans firmly and swiftly.

, All horses buck for one reason or another.


Check to make sure that your horse does not have a burr under the saddle pad, bug bites, or anything else that could trigger bucking.







, It's possible that he may not be trained properly. Some horses that are not trained properly will find riding tasks confusing and hard. You may be putting too much pressure on him, so he wants the pressure to lessen. And what's a better way to achieve that than to buck?

Keep his head up, neck soft and flexed.,
Keep your weight centered – don't hover forward.,
Keep forward momentum.,
When jumping, avoid ""chipping"" right before a jump.,
Keep your calm so you can calm your horse in turn.,
Get to know your horse.",How to Stop a Horse from Bucking2," You can do this with soft half halts and making sure you always have a ""live"" connection between mouth and hands. Don't let him bite the bit and pull your hands and don't let your reins go slack or rest your hands on his neck.


Most horses only do ""pig-roots,"" which are a smaller version of a buck as proper bucking has the horse's head between its front legs with the back legs extended far above its rump.
A horse may buck because it helps him to balance. Some ex-racehorses tend to do this when cantering in an open field or arena.

, Communicate your intentions – your body weight is a really effective communication tool. Be relaxed with your weight centered over your horse. Visualize where you're going and let your head turn in the direction you're going – this will shift your weight and indicate that turn without much need for strong hand aids.


You need a firm command over your horse, but not too firm. If he associates you as a rider with pain, this may be the reason he's bucking you off.

, If you hesitate your horse will know immediately and might take this as an opportunity to buck you off. Keep solid contact with lower legs and if you start to sense a buck coming, try to keep moving forward – a horse can't buck without planting his front legs.


Don't let him stop. A horse might buck and then stop; the only reason he would buck was because he knew that his rider would stop him for misbehaving. Just keep going if that is the case, and he will learn that there's no reward involved.

, If a horse is prone to bucking, they will use this as an opportunity to plant those front feet and send you flying. Make sure you practice spacing out your strides in front of a jump to get a comfortable distance for that last stride. When you get it right, keep that forward momentum!


Encourage your horse with leg aids and give him ample room to stretch his neck by sliding your hands forward and letting your center of gravity move forward as well.
If a horse is bucking, this means they are lifting up their back feet. This can be very dangerous for you if you are on top of the horse and it can also be dangerous for the riders around you. If another horse is bucking, try to ride yours away from it by steering away.

, You must not share your fear or panic with your horse as it will pick up on it through your voice and smell. If you are on the horse at the time, then bend low on the horse, grip firmly, and keep your head to the side of its neck and away from its thrashing head. Speak as soothingly as possible while repeating its name.


Don't talk to it like a baby, but as if it were a scared child. After several seconds, you can try a firm and loud (but not angry) command to try to cut through to its learned responses. It is desperately expending nervous energy, so channeling that into movement is a good idea; however, do not encourage a gallop in that state lest you want to be on a runaway train.
Calming it of its fear or anger is all you can do. If you are on the ground, then keep your calm, turn slightly sideways and look downwards as to avoid its eyes. Speak soothingly and calmly. Considering it is in a panic, try smiling, yawning, sighing, or laughing. You will develop an instinct for relaxing when your horse gets out of hand.

, Often horses buck off inexperienced riders or riders they're not familiar with. In these cases, this will just take time. Get to know your horse and develop a relationship with him. That way when you ride him, he'll know he can trust you.


One suggestion to help you and your horse gain each others' respect is to get out of the saddle and just walk. Talk and soothe him first. Have him follow you around the paddock or bring him some treats and teach him some tricks! Developing a good bond with a horse is the key to respect and a real bond doesn't come just from riding.

Check all tack and equipment.,
Tune into how your horse is feeling.,
Try to notice if there is any correlation between any outside factors and when your horse bucks.,
Take it slow, studying his behavior with every step.,
Get him retrained.",How to Stop a Horse from Bucking3," Check your horse for signs of discomfort such as a hollow back, pinned ears, or a sallow expression. He could be in physical pain, bucking to get rid of it. After all, horses buck for a reason.


Make sure all equipment you use actually fits your horse properly. A poor fitted saddle will not only cause back pain and scarring but it can also lead to physiological fear of being ridden which can make handling and catching much harder.
Get a specialist to check your saddle fits correctly get your horse's back/spine checked out too. once these two have been checked look at the bridle and the bit. If all these potential problems have been checked out then the next thing to consider is you.

, You need to figure out what the problem is. Is the horse getting enough exercise? Are you sure that he is not in any pain? Try watching his ears. If his ears are forward, he might just be having a good time and getting some of his energy out. If his ears are pinned back against his head, he may either be upset or somehow in distress.


Sometimes horses buck or act up in order to tell you something. It's important to listen to your horse because a lot of the time he's just trying to tell you something is wrong. Another reason may be because he just has a bunch of pent-up energy – even the best horse can buck if it has lots of energy to let out. In this scenario, lunge or free lunge your horse till it gets its wiggles out.
Lunging before a ride can also help. He might get his frustration and energy out before you get on and you two can have a peaceful ride. Also, thread the lunge lines through the stirrups and drive the horse around to get it used to the pressures of reins and learning what is expected of it.

, If he got spooked near a certain rail one time, he may buck every time he goes past it. Do some lead line work and try to calm him down about it. If he gets ornery when doing certain drills, try to limit how long you spend on those drills or give him a lot of positive encouragement when he does well. Then go through some drills or activities he enjoys.


Don't push him to do frustrating activities for too long – gradually build up how long you spend on them instead.

, If you can't successfully sit on him without him exploding into a fit of bucks, then start out slow at a walk and build your way up. Study him and figure out when he bucks, bringing punishment and reward as needed.


For example, if your horse throws a buck when you ask him to canter, express respectfully yet firmly that that was incorrect and then bring him back down to a trot. Ask again and again until he does not buck when you ask him to canter and then give him praise. Rewarding is a huge part of the training process and you must be clear to him whether or not you are pleased.

, Do not overlook the possibility that your horse was deliberately trained to buck. Perhaps the horse was used as a rodeo bucking horse, or perhaps a person with a grudge against a former owner taught the horse to buck as cruel revenge. You may find that much retraining is needed, or that for safety you should give up your bucking horse and get another.


Horses quickly discover that bucking is a very effective method in stopping an inexperienced rider from riding them. If this problem is a reoccurring one due to lack of training, your horse probably doesn't respect you. In these cases, it is best to send your horse for re-training and get some lessons yourself or consider getting a different horse as the current one may be too much for your riding ability level.
If you do decide to continue with your current horse, be aware that they may ""test"" you on the next ride (even if they have behaved with the trainer) so if you don't think you can handle another buck, move on.

Make your horse feel comfortable and safe.,
Build a connection with your horse that doesn’t include riding.,
Reward your horse for imitating your movements.,
Approach your horse while he’s lying down.,
Pretend you’re going to lie down.,
Sit down or lie down.,
Do not overdo any one training session.,
Repeat the process again.",How to Teach Your Horse to Lie Down2," While horses do naturally lie down, they only do so when they’re feeling safe and comfortable. Training your horse to lie down will only work if he’s in a place where he feel comfortable, and around things that make him feel safe. If you are not located in such a place, you may want to move the training to another location.You may already know your horse’s comfortable and safe places, but if not, observe your horse to determine where he likes to rest and sleep. This is likely the place where he feels the safest.
Horses like to roll around in the dirt or mud at certain times. If there is a location they prefer to do this, it is at this location you’ll want to train them to lie down.
If you ever start training and you’re horse isn’t interested in participating, stop. Even if your horse has a connection with you, and is comfortable around you, they may not be having a good day.

, While riding your horse is definitely a lot of fun, and will build a connection between the both of you, you also want to spend time with your horse when not riding. This more peaceful time shared together will build a different connection between you and your horse that will be invaluable with training him.One great way to spend more one-on-one time with your horse outside of riding is to take him for a walk after you’ve removed his tack after a ride.
When walking your horse around, reward him for his excellent behaviour.
Pay attention to your own body language. Your horse will notice if you’re tense or uncomfortable. You want to make sure you remain relaxed and calm.

, Before you attempt to train your horse to lie down, you want to train him to repeat or imitate you. Once your horse learns he’ll be rewarded for doing what you do, he’ll want to imitate you all the time.This step can only be done when you are not on your horse. You need to be at the ground level with him.
You’ll also want to let go of the lead, as you want your horse to decide what movements he’s going to make and when.
Do something simple like walk around the paddock. If your horse follows you, reward him.
Walk around and then stop, if your horse does the same thing, reward him.

, If you’re able to, enter the paddock when your horse is already lying down. Approach him and encourage him to stay lying down. When you get beside him, reward and praise him for staying in that position.Make sure to approach your horse calmly, quietly, and slowly. Speak softly while on your approach, telling your horse how wonderful he is.
You may need to try this over and over again if your horse doesn’t want to stay lying down when you walk up to him.
Remember that your horse needs to trust you completely to stay lying down. If you attempt this step before your horse truly trusts you, you may not be successful. If needed, re-try the previous steps to gain your horse’s trust before attempting this step again.

, Once you’ve build a good connection with your horse, and he’s interested in imitating you, act out the movements required to lie down. Stand still in one spot and bend over at your waist. Bend your head forward so you’re looking at the ground. Reach your hands and arms towards the ground.If you notice that your horse also makes certain sounds when lying down, you can imitate those sounds when making your movements. That might help signal to your horse what you’re trying to get them to do.
This only works if your horse is actually paying attention to you and is interested in what you’re doing. If you’re horse ignores you and walks aways, try to walk after him and get his attention.
Always reward and praise your horse when he copies your behaviour. If he actually lies down at this stage, give him a LOT of praise and treats.

, It may even help if you actually sit or lie down in front of your horse. If your horse is paying attention, and wants to imitate you, he too will lie down. Reward and praise the proper behaviour., If things are going well, or your horse just isn’t interested, stop trying after 15 minutes or so. Longer than this and your horse (and you) might just end up getting confused, frustrated, or both., Training takes more than one session or day. Whether a particular day was successful or not, try it again the next day. Even if your horse has picked up on all the cues, keep going.Again, the most important point about training a horse is to be patient.
Also remember that your horse isn’t ever doing anything wrong, that’s why punishment isn’t involved. You’re only rewarding for the behaviour you want your horse to repeat, but other behaviours are just as acceptable (although not rewarded).
This method is based on your horse imitating or copying your behaviours. While you may need to act out the process of lying down until your horse understands the process, eventually your horse may lie down when he sees you starting your “lie down” movements. In other words, eventually you won’t need to physically lie down every time you want your horse to lie down.

Have your horse reach a good, balanced gallop.Before a horse can execute a successful sliding stop, it must build momentum by galloping.,
Keep the horse balanced.Your horse should reach a relaxed gallop, running forward with good alignment and no obstacles or problems.It should be pushing forward with its hindquarters, since these will provide the momentum used for the sliding stop.

,
Maintain your own balance.Your job is help guide the horse as it approaches the sliding stop.,
Train your horse to react to a cue.,
Reposition your body as you give the cue.,
Condition your horse to respond quickly to your cue.,
Have the horse stop.,
Don’t pull back on the horse’s reins.To successfully complete a sliding stop, the horse should come to a stop on its own.If you yank back on the reins, you will be forcing the horse to stop.,
Analyze the horse’s stop.You should observe your horse’s stop from the vantage point of the saddle.,
Work on the follow-through.,
Maintain your body position throughout the follow-through.As the horse completes the sliding stop, keep your own body position unchanged.,
Have the horse raise itself back up as it completes the sliding stop.By keeping your body and the reigns loose, your horse should be able to gently and smoothly raise its hindquarters up again at the conclusion of the sliding stop.",How to Teach a Horse to Do a Sliding Stop," The horse’s gallop must also be balanced so that it does not lean to one side or turn as it slides to a stop. If your horse’s gallop is off, work on correcting it before you begin training it for the sliding stop.;
,, Keep your body squarely positioned on the saddle, and your arms straight and forward so that the reins are kept loose for the horse. Your legs should be against the horse, helping to signal to it that it needs to keep straight and balanced.


Don’t pull your shoulders or body back as you begin the stop. This may make your horse “skip,” or lower its body, then raise it again before lowering it a final time.A galloping horse has considerable momentum; if you don’t maintain your balance, you may flip over the front of the horse as it begins to stop.

, A horse should be trained to do a sliding stop upon your command. You can start by making sure that your horse understands the cue you give to ask it to stop.Depending on your horse, this cue may involve a call (such as “Whoa!”), a slap, a kick, a repositioning of your body or the horse’s reigns, or a combination of these.

, When you are ready for your horse to attempt a sliding stop, you should move your body in several ways.These movements, along with your cue, signal the horse to lower its hindquarters and come to a stop.


Use your body to push down on the saddle.
Drop your heels.
Pull your legs slightly away from the horse’s sides.

, A sliding stop essentially asks a horse to stop quickly, so work on getting your horse to respond rapidly to your command to stop. Keep practicing, and whenever your horse responds quickly, reward and encourage it.

, To complete a full sliding stop, the horse should round its back and lower its hindquarters toward the ground, while the front legs stay loose and in motion., This will make the movement seem jerky and/or stiff.

, It may also be helpful to have another person on the ground to observe the horse’s form, and your own. Look for the following:


The horse’s back should be rounded as it stops.
The front legs should continue to move in a “walking” motion as the horse stops.
Your own legs and hands should remain slightly off the horse.

, The follow-through in this case is the end of the sliding stop, in which the horse and rider come to a complete stop. This should be done fluidly and with balance.If you are the horse seem to jerk or lose balance at the end of the sliding stop, keep practicing it until it becomes smoother.

, Your hands and legs should remain firm but not tense. You should keep a hold on the reins, but not pull back on them. All of this will encourage your horse to come to a smooth stop.

, Afterwards, you and your horse can halt, or proceed to the next reining movement.

Refresh your horse on stopping, so he'll stop right after you ask him to.,
Teach your horse to neck rein.,
Ride without the saddle.,
Ride without the bridle, and instead with a halter and lead rope.,
Ride the horse with just a lead rope!",How to Teach a Horse to Ride Tackless," Start either bareback or with a saddle. This may take a few sessions to master.


Lean back, putting your legs forward and saying ""woah"". Squeeze/tighten the reins if needed. Praise your horse as soon as he stops. (The easiest way to do this is to release all physical pressure and then verbally praise your horse will scratching along his neck and withers.) Repeat this throughout your ride until your horse stops before you pull on the reins.;
, The idea is to teach the horse that when you set the rope against the left side of his neck, he turns his head away from the pressure (to the right), and vice-versa. Lean inwards into each turn (while turning left, balance more of the left of your body). Teaching your horse to respond to leg pressures can also be beneficial.


Practice first with a bridle (and saddle, if you want). While pushing the right rein on the horse's neck, pull on the left rein, so your horse's head turns to the left. Keep doing this until your horse responds to the pressure on his neck without any help from the bit. Practice until your horse has got it on both sides equally.
You can also ride a horse tackless by direct reining, but neck reining is easier if you have the time to teach it.

, Keep things slow for a couple rides so you and your horse can get a feel for it. Walk the horse and practice stops and circling in both directions. Ask your horse for an easy trot if you feel up to it.


If your horse's back is rather slick, feel free to use a bareback pad during the first few rides. This'll offer you a bit more grip.

, If you want, you can keep the saddle on for the first few times so it's easier to stay on. You'll want a lengthy rope for this; one that's both tie-able and doesn't have any metal latches. The halter and rope should be situated correctly before mounting:


Tie the lead rope to the halter. With the rope over the horse's neck, take one end and put it under (going towards the front) the side buckle, and then through it. Tie a half knot with the end, but before tightening it put the end through the knot once more. To tighten this properly, pull on both the tail and the long length so it's nice and snug. Do the same thing with the other side, making sure you have about the right length of reins.

, While sitting on the horse's back, put a rope around your horse's neck. Remove the halter (if you can't manage it yourself, then get someone to do it for you). Hold the rope like a pair of reins or in one hand. The further up the neck the rope is, the more control you have (though many horses like to stretch their heads right down while riding tackless).

Put treats in your pocket.,
Give the treat.,
Do not reward pushy behavior.,

Give a treat.,
Teach them a cue.,
Allow the horse to approach you.,
Use a different reward.,
Give commands outside of work.,
Use different rewards.,
Spend quality time.,
Groom your horse.,
Be consistent.",How to Teach a Horse to Come when Called," Your horse must learn that a treat is a reward for specific behavior. Your horse should be in a stall or in tied in a quiet area where there are no distractions. Place 8 treats in your pocket or in a small pouch.


The treats must be hidden from your horse. Your horse needs to associate the treat with whatever cue you give and not be able to see the treats.;
, Stand in front of your horse. Use a clicker, whistle, or say “yes” to get your horse’s attention. As soon as you make the sound, present the treat to your horse. Your horse will then associate a treat with whatever sound that you make.Timing is extremely important. The sound you make is a signal that a treat is coming. Never present the treat before you have made the sound.

, Horses love to get treats and will always want more than you give. Your horse may try to grab the food, lean into you, or bite your hand. This type of behavior is called mugging. If your horse misbehaves, do not give them the treat until they have calmed down.If you give your horse a treat when they mugs you, they will think that behavior is acceptable. They will then begin to misbehave just to get a treat.
Some people think that giving treats as a reward is a problem. However, the problem is reinforcing bad behavior with treats. As long as you teach your horse how to properly get treats, you should be fine.

, Use your horse’s name any time you are near them. This will help your horse learn what their name is. Only use their name when you are doing something pleasant. Your horse needs to associate their name with good experiences.For example, shots, deworming, or long workouts are not pleasant for your horse.
Scratching your horse in their favorite spot, brushing their mane, or going for a walk are pleasant experiences for your horse., Give your horse a treat each time you use their name. Again, adding a treat reinforces that hearing their name is a good thing.Your horse should already know that treats are a reward for expected behavior. Treats your horse may like include apples, carrots, horse raisins, grapes, bananas, strawberries, melons, celery, pumpkin, and snow peas.Call your horse by their name and give them the treat when they look at you or respond to their name. Try not to reward them, though, when they look at you without your prompting.
Cut treats such as apples and carrots into smaller pieces so your horse will not choke. Only give your horse one or two small pieces as a treat. You can also find safe horse treats at local supply stores, or make your own from recipes online.
Many horses are known to like peppermint, and may be responsive to the crinkling noise made by the wrappers.
Avoid giving your horse onions, potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts These foods will give your horse gas.

, Approach your horse, say their name, and give them a cue such as “cookie time.” Once you have their attention, you will give them a treat. You may say, “Cookie time, Max.” You can use whatever cue you like; just be consistent.Your horse will eventually learn that the cue plus their name means that they are getting a treat. They will start taking steps toward you when you say the cue and their name.

, Once the horse makes the connection between the cue and their name, they will begin to approach you. Gradually increase the distance that your horse has to walk. Each time the horse comes, take a few steps back.As you increase the distance, you should also change the order of the cue and name. You would say, “Max, cookie time.”

, When your horse begins to regularly come when their name is called, reward them by rubbing their face instead of giving them a treat. A face rub is an alternate treat that is very pleasurable for your horse.You do not want your horse to expect a treat every single time you call them. The treat is used as a training tool, not a permanent reward.


If your horse expects a treat but does not get one, they may become disobedient., Start by having your horse come close to you and rewarding them verbally and with a treat. Don't place their halter on them too frequently early on. This way, they will learn that coming to you doesn't always mean work. Alternate having your horse come to you and putting on their halter with having them come and then releasing them., Alternate giving treats with rewards like face rubs. This way, your horse learns not to expect a treat every time they are called. This can also keep horses healthy or help reward overweight horses who should not have excessive treats.

Other alternate rewards include scratches or rubs, soft words of encouragement, and spending quality non-working time with them.

, Developing a relationship with your horse requires time just like any other relationship. Go and sit with your horse while they are eating in their stall. Sit and watch them graze in a field.Go for a walk and allow them to explore.


Spending time with your horse outside of training and vet visits helps them associate you with relaxation and allows the two of you to bond.
If you go for a ride or train your horse, let them graze at the end of your session.

, Horses groom each other when they are in the wild and groom each other to show affection. When you groom your horse, you are doing the same thing. This will also help you know how your horse likes to be touched.Grooming your horse also helps you understand them and identify what normal behavior is. Through regular grooming, you can notice when something may be wrong with your horse.

, Your horse will thrive and trust you if you are consistent. Your horse will know what to expect from you and feel comfortable around you. Reward positive behaviors and do not reward negative behaviors. You do not want to send mixed signals.Consistency also includes having a regular feeding schedule, riding schedule, and training schedule. Be patient. learning these schedules will take time and require practice for both you and the horse.
Horses do not like surprises.They are designed to run and be fearful of anything that may be threatening.
The ultimate goal is to have your horse want to work with you. It's up to you to recognize their behaviors and personality and learn to work with rather than against that.

Have some basic riding skills pre-taught before you start.,
Mount up.,
Start off at a gentle walk.,
Turn the horse with a direct rein.,
Simultaneously lay the outside rein against the horse's neck.,
Use the rest of your body to cue the turn.,
Repeat the training process.,
Test your horse's skill by turning with an indirect (neck) rein.,
Correct any errors in your technique early.,
Don't use extra pressure to turn when neck reining.,
Don't let accidental hand movements guide the horse.,
Don't underestimate the importance of shifting your weight.,
Be consistent.,
Be patient.,
Don't be afraid to contact a professional.",How to Teach a Horse to Neck Rein," Ideally, neck reining isn't the first skill you teach your horse. The horse should already be trained in certain riding skills before you begin — neck reining is essentially a culmination of these beginner skills that gives you greater control over the horse. The skills you'll want your horse to know already are:


How to travel in a straight line and stop
How to steer (direct rein)
How to disengage the hips
How to control the shoulders
How to pivot on the hindquarters;
, Start by getting your horse ready to ride. Saddle your horse and connect your reins to a smooth-cheek snaffle bit.You may use either one-piece or split reins. The reins should be long enough that they can be held with one hand behind the center of the horse's neck — usually, for split reins, this is about seven and a half feet.Don't use a shanked bit, as this can be painful for the horse to learn with. Some riders choose to eventually switch to a shanked bit once the horse learns this skill., Go to a safe, secure place and ask your horse to walk forward or in a large circle. Make sure you have plenty of space on all sides to move around.

, When you're ready, cue your horse to turn with a direct rein. In other words, gently guide the horse's nose to the side that you want to turn by pulling on the rein on that side.


For example, if you want the horse to turn left, pull on the left rein so that the horse's nose turns slightly to the left. The rest of the horse's body should follow.

, This step is crucial. As you cue your horse to turn, lay the outside rein (the rein on the opposite side as the way you're turning) against the side of the horse's neck. For example, if you're turning to the left, lay the rein against the right side of the neck.


The goal here is to connect the act of turning with the sensation of the rein against the horse's neck so that eventually this is all you'll need to do to cue the horse to turn. Thus, you want to be decisive — don't be harsh or rough, but make sure your horse feels the rein against his neck.

, At the same time as you're using your reins to cue the horse to turn, use your leg muscles and body weight to drive the point home. Apply gentle pressure with the calf of your outside leg (the leg on the side opposite the way you're turning) just behind the cinch.Simultaneously, look in the direction of the turn and ever-so-subtly shift your weight to guide the horse into the turn.

, Your horse won't learn this skill immediately, so you'll probably need to repeat the process outlined above until your horse starts to ""get it."" For consistency, it's best to practice neck reining in a variety of conditions. Vary your routine with the following guidelines:


Try turning both left and right.
Make both sharp and shallow turns.
Practice at a range of speeds (for example, a walk, a trot, and a lope.)
Practice in multiple locations.

, When you think your horse has learned to neck rein, test your new skill. Hold the reins in one hand behind the horses neck. Cue the horse to turn by draping the reins against one side of his neck (rather than gently pulling on his nose as you would when riding direct rein.) As you do this, push with your leg on the same side and lean your weight slightly into the turn. If your training has been successful, the horse should turn away from the draped rein.


Keep in mind that you are cuing your horse to turn by laying the reins against the opposite side of the neck as the direction you want your horse to turn. In other words, to turn left, you'll lay the reins against the right side of the horse's neck (and vice versa.)

, For experienced riders, neck reining can seem almost second-nature. However, for a beginner, it can be deceptively difficult. Since making errors while training your horse can cause the horse to start to expect these errors while neck reining, you'll want to nip them in the bud early. In the rest of this section, we'll discuss a few common errors (and how to avoid them., If you're neck reining and you can't get your horse to turn, don't pull extra hard to turn the horse's head in the correct direction. Because of your one-handed grip, this actually forces the horse's head to turn in the wrong direction. Instead, switch to direct (two-handed) rein and pull the inside rein to turn the horse's head.

, It's easy to forget that, from the horses perspective, any minor movements of the reins can be interpreted as a cue to turn. Try to keep your hands reasonably steady while riding, especially while neck reining.

, Your horse can feel even minor shifts in your body weight. Be sure to look into each turn — this should make you subconsciously shift your weight. If you're having a hard time getting a response from your horse, you may guide it by more deliberately shifting your weight and applying leg pressure as noted in the section above.

, As when training any sort of animal, consistency is key. Once you start training your horse to neck rein, stick with it, using the proper technique outlined above each time. Don't make sudden changes in your training technique — remember that the horse won't ever be able to understand your logic for making the change, so it can easily become confused if you use inconsistent technique. Repeated inconsistencies can even cause the horse to learn ""bad"" behaviors.


Remember — being consistent when you train your horse is just as much for your own benefit as it is for the horse's. If you plan on riding your horse, you'll want to be confident that it will react to your cues predictably, and the only way to ensure this is to train consistently.

, Compared to other riding commands, neck reining is fairly simple (both to learn and to teach.) In general, most horses should start to get the hang of neck reining within about six to ten training sessions.However, all horses are different and it's not uncommon for it to take longer for a horse to master this skill. Be patient and persistent and you'll eventually be neck reining with ease.

, If you're worried about being able to teach your horse to neck rein properly, don't worry — help is available. Consider contacting a horse professional (like a trainer, a breeder, a rancher, etc.) to help you get your horse to neck rein. Though these options can tend to be expensive, it's money well spent if it helps you ride your horse safely in the long term.


To find a trainer near you, consider using the online ""Find a Trainer"" service offered by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) at http://aqha.com/findatrainer."

Introduce the halter to your foal when he is anywhere from three days old to a week.,
Make sure that you buy a halter that will fit well.,
Learn the first haltering lessons.,
Once your foal is very comfortable with you taking the halter on and off without any help, snap a lead rope to the halter and hold it while he walks around.,
Have a helper stand behind the foal as you snap on the lead rope.

,
Stand next to the foal's shoulder, so his front legs and your legs line up.

,
Have your helper give the foal a tap on the rump with their hand, or a small riding crop, and give a small tug on the lead while giving whatever command you want your foal to know means, 'go', such as a kiss, or the simple words, 'walk on'.

,
Do not make one continuous pull, or your foal will immediately resist.",How to Teach a Foal to Lead,";
, It is a good idea to buy one that can be let out quite a bit as your foal will grow very fast. Your foal should be very friendly and should trust you fully. If not, you should gain his trust before you try to teach him to lead, or he could get scared and loose any trust that he had with you before.

, They are around five minutes long each.


Walk up to your foal and show him the halter.
Let him sniff it and bite it and get totally comfortable with it. Then have someone hold the foal gently while you quickly slip the halter on. You want to do this fast, before the foal learns that he can pull away.
When the halter is secure, let him loose and let him run around with it on for a few minutes, keeping him in sight.
After about five minutes, walk up to him and have your helper hold the foal while you quickly take it off.
Do this every day, increasing the time that he has the halter on, until he will let you take it on and off with no problems.

,


Do not let go and let it drag, because he will step on it and get scared as his head is jerked back.
Make sure his first experiences are always good, or he will refrain from it the second time.
Follow him around, holding the lead rope in your hands.
Do this every day until he doesn't seem to notice it. Then you can move on.

,,,, Instead, always use short tugs.


If your foal does not move forward, give the command again and a short tug. Usually the foal will get the idea.
Once the foal is moving, walk around the pen with your helper right behind the foal, to give him a tap if he stops. When pulling his head to the side to turn, do not give one continuous pull; remember, always short tugs, and stop immediately when he obeys.
After around ten minutes of leading, stop and take the halter off and praise your foal. Only stop on a good note, not if your foal has just stopped on his own, or if he had just resisted and pulled against you.
If he does this, correct him by giving him a tug and the command to keep going. It is best to give your foal two lessons a day, ten minutes long each.
Make sure to stop before your foal starts to get bored, so he doesn't act up. Foals are young, and have very short attention spans. A bored foal will resist to whatever you want to teach him, and he might react by nipping, pulling against you, or kicking.
Keep lessons at 10 minutes or less to keep this from happening. Many short lessons are way better then one long lesson.
After your foal will easily lead without having a helper behind to encourage him, and when he will listen to your commands immediately, you have successfully trained your foal to lead! # Remember to have lots of patience, and most of all, enjoy your foal!

Prepare your horse.,

Stand just behind your horse’s front legs.,

Draw your horse’s head down with the treat.,

Stretch your horse’s neck straight back.,

Stretch your horse’s topline.,

Repeat the stretches on both sides.",How to Stretch a Horse1," Move to an open area where your horse has a free range of movement. Grab a small treat that your horse will be interested in; carrots work particularly well for this stretch because of their length.
, The following stretches should be done on both sides of your horse, and from a position parallel to or just behind their front legs., Hold the treat near your horse’s head so that they become aware of it, and then bribe them into stretching by moving the treat down past the fetlock. Try to have them hold this stretch for 10-15 seconds before releasing and giving them the treat. The stretches the horse’s neck back and downwards.

If your horse can’t reach as far as you would like them to, simply lessen the distance at first and over time their muscles will become accustomed to it.

, Take another treat and, standing in the same location, get your horse’s attention and direct their head straight back towards their withers. Hold the treat just below their shoulder (a bit above their belly) and keep it there for 10-15 seconds. Then, release the pressure and give your horse the treat., Using another treat or the rest of your carrot, guide your horse’s neck down and back a bit between their legs. Instead of reaching to the outside of the fetlock, reach to the inside of the fetlock and hold the position for 10-15 seconds. Release the stretch and reward your horse with the treat., In order to prevent your horse becoming one-sided or pulled out of shape, be sure to stretch them on both sides. Follow the aforementioned directions for stretching downwards and straight back on both the right and left side."

Stretch your horse’s front legs.,

Stretch your horse’s shoulder.,

Stretch your horse’s hind leg backwards.,

Stretch your horse’s hind leg forwards.",How to Stretch a Horse2," Stand to the side of your horse, and cue them to lift one of their front legs. Pull it forward so that it is fully extended with little-to-no bend in the knee, and the hoof close to the ground. Hold their leg in this position for 10-15 seconds, or as long as your horse is able., Standing to the side of the front legs again, cue your horse to lift one of their front legs. Pick it up and bring it forward, with a little bend in the knee. Then, hold their leg just under their knee and lift it up so that it has a 90 degree angle bend, while the lower half of the leg is hanging freely. Rotate this leg in a circular motion 3-5 times in the direction of the other leg., Move to your horse’s backside and stand facing one of their back legs. Cue them to lift their leg, and keep the hoof extended outwards (the same way you would if you were going to pick it). Hold the lower half of their leg, and slowly extend it backwards and downwards. Hold this stretch for 10-15 seconds., Ask your leg to pick up their foot as you stand next to them, and grab it just below the knee. Pull their leg forwards a bit and slightly diagonally without losing all the bend in their knee. Hold this stretch for 10-15 seconds and then slowly bring the horse’s leg back into the resting position."

Starting at the top of your horse’s back at the start of the tail, scratch the muscular sections on either side of the tail/spine, about four inches away from the center. Scratch this area downwards until your horse lifts their hips/back and tucks their rear end. Hold pressure for 20-30 seconds to maintain the stretch, and then release., Perform the horse version of a crunch by standing to the side of your horse and tickling the bottom of their belly near where you would place the girth. Continue tickling/applying pressure until the horse lifts its back in response. Hold this stretch for 10 seconds, and then move further back down the stomach to stretch the entire topline., Stand to the side of your horse’s back leg, and cue them to lift their foot. Pick up their hoof, and stretch their leg forward while gently lifting their leg in the process. Pull their leg forward so that the tip of their hoof touches the back of the knee on their front leg of the same side. Hold this for a few seconds, and then slowly bring the leg back down into position."

, Various breeds and individuals mature at different rates, but the minimum age should be 3 years to enter light work. No horse is too old to be backed.

, Many people use a cheap ""breaking"" saddle, as the horse will change shape quickly. Some people use a treeless saddle that is easier to fit.

Linger nearby as it grazes, or spend time talking to it in its stall.,

Praise the horse for stopping, and if you can, walk up to it and give it a pat.",How to Tame a Horse or Pony1," Let it loose in a round pen to just hang out, and watch it for a while. If the horse is afraid of people, keep doing this until it settles down and starts grazing nearby. If you notice it start paying more attention to you (looking at you with its ears forward, licking its lips, etc) you can move on to ground work, as these signs mean it's interested or comfortable with your presence.;
, Otherwise, you can sit nearby and read a book - the point is for it to get familiar with you. Take your time doing this!

, If you try to rush the horse's training, you or the horse can get hurt.

,, If it's hard to catch, or you're breaking it for the first time, you may need to keep it turned out in a small pen for the time being. If it needs a refresher, get it from the paddock or stall, and put it in a roundpen.

, It's ideal to remove the halter when doing this, but if the horse is hard to catch, you may leave it on. If the horse is dangerous, or tries to rear up and thrash at you, go back to lingering nearby as it grazes.


Do this until the horse comes to you. You want it to be comfortable with you to proceed in its training.

, If the horse isn't familiar with people, it may move to the rail on its own, as it's trying to get away from you.


In both cases, talk calmly to the horse, and use slow, deliberate movements until you can start lunging. Raise the whip in one hand (or both if you need the leverage to operate the whip) and swing the line toward the horse's haunches. #*Don't crack it just yet. If the horse is easily spooked, you can get it moving just by the sheer motion of something coming toward it. If the horse is used to being lunged, you may crack the whip.

, This tells the horse it is doing something right, and will allow it to focus on you, as opposed to the whip.


Don't worry about what gait the horse takes on at first, just focus on keeping its hooves moving. The horse might pin its ears and buck at you - this is okay, just make sure it's not attacking you (horses will buck when being lunged, and they'll return to the rail soon after.)
Crack the whip each time it bucks, to discourage it from doing it again. If it starts getting more dangerous about kicking at you, next time you crack the whip, let it sting the horse. Some trainers (and owners) will oppose of this, but if it's becoming a habit, the horse needs to associate the bad action with something uncomfortable, such as the sting of a whip.
It doesn't have to be a full-on lash - the grazing of the edge is enough to sting it. Think of the whip as an extension of your arm - when the horse does something bad, it should be your instinct to correct it. In this case, if the horse gets dangerous about bucking out, you need to correct it by making it uncomfortable.
If the horse is afraid of you, a simple crack of the whip (not stinging it) will usually be enough to keep it from doing it again.

, Keep on the horse - if it starts slowing down, encourage it to keep going. if you're working in a small arena, there might be corners or gates the horse might try stopping at.


Find out where the horse will usually stop, and prepare to crack the whip as it approaches the next time around. You need to get the horse to focus on you, not on escaping. If the horse does get ""stuck"" in these areas, leave the center, jog toward the horse on the side opposite you want it to go (approach on the right if you want it to go to the left and vice versa) and crack the whip.
Don't get too close, as the horse will almost always buck out at this.

, After the horse has tried exploiting every nook and cranny (and failed) and has calmed down some, stand still, lower the whip, and look at your horse


Tell it to ""whoa"" even if it doesn't recognize cues. This inactivity tells your horse that you are no longer driving it, and it can stop. The horse should stop and look at you. If not, that means it doesn't trust you yet. Regardless, if the horse stops, praise it.
Tell it ""Good boy/girl"" and go back to slow movements. Some people may find this to be the perfect opportunity to attempt the join-up, however it's best to switch hands with the whip, point in the opposite direction, and to get it to move in the other direction.
The horse will try its games again, so remember the spots it tried to stop at, so you can be prepared to drive it forward. Horses have to be taught on one side, what they were taught on the other, so you may find that the horse will be as rambunctious as before.
Keep doing what you did when it was going the other way, and soon the horse will be calmed down and should be trotting (or cantering) past the problem spots.
Praise the horse each time it ignores corners and gates, and remember to keep the whip lowered when you're not using it.

, If it trots after cantering, and you want it to trot, make it canter again and tell it to trot after a few strides. You want it to listen to you, not do what it wants.


Even if the horse trots when you want it to, if you didn't give it the command, it will see that as something it can get away with, and not something you told it to do.

, Keep looking at it and tell it ""whoa."" This is a perfect time to get the horse familiar with commands if it's not already, but make sure you remember your body language. At this stage, your inactivity is what tells it to stop, not the words. Only later will it start associating ""whoa"" with ""I need to stop.""

, If the horse is still unfamiliar with you, simply turn around. (If the horse is familiar with you, turn and walk away after you pet it, and stay in the center facing away.)


If the horse trusts you, it will walk up to you, or follow you. This is what we call the join-up. You may put the halter back on or clip the lead back on the halter if the horse successfully joined up. If it hasn't, you can try again with another lap or two in both directions, or you can leave it at that for the day.
Short sessions are better than long sessions, and always try to stop on a good note. Keep doing this every day until the horse joins up, and even if the horse did do it the first time, it's good to start out each training session with a join-up, as this gets the horse focused on you, and helps build trust.
Even with seasoned, trusting mounts, the occasional join-up will keep it in shape and give you both something to do when you can't ride or don't have a lot of time in your current schedule to exercise it under saddle.

Choose a day when you have lots of time and people to help you.

,
Introduce the saddle in the same way as you did the rugs, roller etc.

,
Have someone hold the horse at all times; do not tie him.

,
Gently place the saddle (without stirrups) on the back.

,
Unless the horse is very distressed, do not remove the saddle until he is calm.,
Do up the girth (one hole at a time) just tight enough to keep the saddle in place.,
Walk the horse to allow him to get use to the feel of the movement.,
Ask the horse to stand beside a mounting block.,
Push down on the saddle adding more and more weight until you’ve leaned across the horse with all your weight in the saddle.

,
Mount the horse from the block, putting your weight gently in the saddle.,
Mount the horse from the block.,
A horse learns by being given a new aid and then an old (understandable) aid.",How to Start a Horse Under Saddle2,",,,, Removing the saddle is a reward. You want to reward calm behavior.

, (The horse should be used to this from the roller.)

, You could also lunge or long rein in the saddle.

, Stand close to the horse leaning over him. (Most horses are more worried about something over them then the weight.) Make sure the horse is balanced.

,, Unmount after about 10-15 seconds. This shows the horse that you do intend to get off, and is in itself a reward.(in the wild a predator would hang on and not get off!) This step should be done a number of times before moving on.

, The horse should then be led to get use to the feel of a rider. He can also be lunged with a rider. The rider isn’t giving any aids.

, For example, if the horse understands ""walk on"", squeeze the horse with your legs and then say ""walk on"". In time when you give the leg aid the horse will know you’re going to ask him to walk on and will walk before you give the verbal command.

After your horse or pony has successfully joined up move on to ground work the next day.,
Try again, but this time, pull back on the rope when giving the ""whoa"" command.,
After you get the horse to stop on command teach it to back up.,
Once the horse responds well walking, stopping, backing, and turning start working on showmanship patterns (even if you don't show) to get it to handle well.,
Take it back to the round pen and make it stand.,

Lower the whip and let the horse sniff it.,
Move on to scarier objects, such as bags, bags on a stick, tarpaulins, umbrellas, a bouncing ball, and just about anything you can think of that would scare a horse.",How to Tame a Horse or Pony2," This is the stage where you'll teach it basic manners, and it'll set you up for later when you attempt to ride it or train it to be ridden.


 Start out with the join-up, but once you get the horse, praise it and start leading it around.
Get it to walk next to you around the pen, in both directions, and teach it to ""whoa"" or make it stop every once in a while. This teaches it responsiveness, and gets it thinking about what you're asking of it. If the horse doesn't stop immediately, face it, give a couple sharp yanks of the rope, and walk into it.
If the horse knows how to back up, it will take a couple steps back, which is what we want. Otherwise, the jabbing pressure will be uncomfortable, and the horse will know that was a bad action.

, If the horse remembered how uncomfortable it was to have the halter bop its face, it should stop this time. don't expect it to stop immediately at the command, but if it does, praise it.


If it takes another step after the command, repeat the correction, and try again. Keep doing this until the horse stops when you tell it to. You can keep pulling on the rope each time you give the command, however, after a while, the horse will stop when you stop, regardless if you give it the command.
Unlike in riding or lunging , this voluntary halt is what you want, so praise it when it stops with you.

, Just as you corrected it for not stopping, turn to face it, walk into it, and give light jabs of the rope, pushing the rope toward the horse's chest each time, and say ""Back.""


Keep doing this until the horse takes a step back, and then praise it, and walk off. Keep repeating this, until the horse takes a step back with ease, and then move on to two steps, praise, and walk off. eventually, you can ask more of your horse - asking for six or more steps in one go.
Regardless, praise your horse whenever it does something you like, so that it knows that was a good action. You don't need treats for any training - a simple scratch behind the ear, or pat on the neck is enough assurance the horse needs.

, Most showmanship patterns will require trotting in-hand, stopping, backing, and pivoting, so these are perfect patterns for training a horse to handle well on the ground, and to get it to think about focusing on you, and trusting you.

, If the horse doesn't stand well, work on this before moving on. Each time it takes a step out of place, correct it and make it take a step back. The goal is to get it to stand in the same spot you had it in, but as long as it re-claims its leg(s).


It'll be okay if it's slightly off. Praise it as soon as it stands quietly. The horse might see this as praise for the bad action, so be prepared to correct it again, and praise it again when it stands still.
After a while, it'll stand quietly for a little bit, and praise it when it does. Then, walk a few steps and stop it, and count. Fifteen seconds is a good start for a horse that'll stand quietly for a short time, but depending on our horse, you can shorten or lengthen the time as you feel the need.
If the horse steps out, correct it and start again. After it stands quietly for the time, praise it, and let it walk on, and do it again. Before you end, count the time, praise it when it stands, and let it stand a few seconds more.
Be careful not to get it used to walking on after a praise, so you can do this even before you end, so it doesn't try to walk before you've given it the command. Once the horse stands quietly even after you've praised it for standing, you can be done for the day and let it back out into its pen or stall (or pasture/paddock if you can catch it.)

, By now, the horse should have been in training for over a week, and should be fairly comfortable with you. If you've done the join-ups every day, you should notice that now the horse licks its lips when it's standing, looking at you with its ears perked, and maybe even turning toward you while changing directions.


These are all signs that the horse trusts, respects, and is comfortable with you. Once you've gained the trust of your mount, you will be able to do this with little risk of the horse acting out dangerously (IE rearing, bolting, charging, etc). #* Get the horse in the center of the arena and wave the whip around. Use slow, deliberate movements, and don't hold the whip too close at first.
Keep slack in your lead, as the horse will want to move around at first. While we want it to stand still, this is a completely normal response to anything scary (fight or flight) and if you try to hold it in one place, it could act out (fight).
Talk to it in a low, calm tone, and slowly wave the whip around until it stands still, then praise it. Wave the whip overhead, side to side so that the excess rope hits the ground and flies overhead. The horse may back up, or raise its head, and this is okay, just move with it.
You don't want it to be able to escape the whip, so you have to keep it the same distance regardless of the area of the arena. After a while, the horse will realize that it's nothing scary, and will settle down. Praise it.

, It knows that it's not going to hurt it, and allowing it to sniff it and subsequently touch it, allows it to realize this. Once the horse is done sniffing it, start rubbing it over the horse's body. The horse may move away from it, and this is okay, just move with it, and keep talking calmly to it.


This is a perfect time to get it used to things touching it in sensitive spots, such as the belly, thigh/groin area, rump, back, etc. If the whip can reach it, let it touch it. This is especially needed with geldings/stallions, as they need their sheathes cleaned and require to be handled for that.
Once the horse accepts the whip, praise it, and do the same thing for the other side.

, Which is everything. Do two or three items a day, and leave it on a good note.


Praise it really well (you can give it a treat for the end of the day, but a good scratch and pat, and lots of ""good boy/girls"" will do just as well) and turn them back in their stall/paddock/pen/etc.

Start working on getting it used to weight in the saddle.,
If you weren't working in the round pen before, return to it.",How to Tame a Horse or Pony3," If so, you have done an excellent job of training your horse so far! Now it's time to get it ready for saddle work.


Chances are, the only thing that's been harnessed to your horse's head was a halter so far, so now we have to decide what we'll be using to ride the horse. Some people prefer hackamores and bitless bridles for their horses, but most shows require a bitted bridle in order to enter.
Because of this, the horse needs to be taught to accept the bit, and to respond to the bit. We start with this, because the horse already knows how to be lead around, and we're coming fresh out of the groundwork stage into the conditioning stage. This is a perfect time to bridge that gap, with a little bit of both.
Even if the horse has had a bit in its mouth before, it's always good to start from the bottom and work our way to the top. So, for this, we'll take a good snaffle - preferably egg butt  or D-ring, but a loose-ring will work as well. Just make sure to get the right size, as one too small is very prone ot pinching the horse's mouth, and will ruin what we're trying to accomplish.

, We're not going to ask too much of it, as this is more than likely a new thing to it.


Take the bridle (a piece of twine tied to the bit as a headstall will work just fine for this stage) and put the bit in your hand as you normally would to bridle a horse.
Proceed with your normal bridling routine, and press the bit to the horse's lips. If the horse is face- sensitive, work on rubbing your hands all over its face for a while, even if that's all you do today.
Get it to accept it's head being touched, and then move on to bridling. The horse most likely will not open its mouth for the bit, as it doesn't know to yet. If the bit has touched its teeth, and it still won't open (be gentle if this happens), take your thumb, push it in the corner of its mouth, and shove it in as far as you can, until the horse opens its mouth.
Take this opportunity to place the bit behind the teeth, and pull the headstall up and over the ears. Give it a good pat if it accepted this, and then carefully take the bit out and do it again.
Do this 3-5 times at first, and then go back to your normal ground work routine.

After a while, the horse should accept the bridle, and you can start using that in place of a halter. Depending on your horse, this could be the next day, or in five days.



, After you do your normal join-up (at this point, catching your horse should be a lot easier) switch out the halter for a bridle, or bridle over the halter altogether and give it praise when it accepts it.


Continue your groundwork routine as normal, but remember that the horse has a bit in its mouth, so if you have to make any corrections that involve the reins, do them lightly, as the mouth is more sensitive and doesn't need a lot of pressure to get your point across.
Work on pivoting, turning, backing, halting, walking, and trotting while the horse is bridled, and do any patterns you have found, or do new ones. (heck, make up your own!) After a while of this routine, you should be able to bridle the horse straight from the paddock, though it's still recommended to get them out normally beforehand.

, Back when you were desensitizing it, one thing you could've done (if you didn't) was to take a saddle pad and gently throw it onto its back. If not, we can do that now.


Take a saddle pad, or even saddle blanket and let the horse sniff it. Rub it over the horse's neck and side, as well as back, and really all over the horse's body.
Take it and place it on the horse's back as it would be under a saddle. Praise the horse for standing and accepting it, then drag the pad off it's back, and do it again.
Do this on both sides, exaggerating the movement more and more, letting the saddle pad fly over the back to land on it, and yanking it off. Aside from a few twitches in the skin, the horse should stand quietly after about five to ten minutes of this. Praise them for accepting it.

, However, it won't hurt to to the same thing with the saddle soon after. Let the horse sniff it, and then rub it over its body, before setting it on its back.


Expect the horse to fidget with the weight, and tell it to ""woah"" if it moves, but move with it, just like when you were desensitizing it. let the saddle sit on its back, but don't fasten the girth/cinch.
Pat the horse when it stands, and then remove the saddle, walk over to th other side, and do it again. It won't hurt to let it sniff it again, and to let it rub over that side as well, before setting it on its back.
Praise it once it stands still, and then repeat on both sides until it stands still, and then give it praise. Leave it at that for the day, and come back to it tomorrow.
Once you get back through your routine join-up and get to the saddling part, you'll do something different once the horse accepts the saddle the first time. Praise it as usual, but now, reach for the girth.

, This is where the desensitizing with the whip comes in. If you desensitized every day after your join-up, the horse should be okay with being touched everywhere by now.


If it fidgets too much, wait until it stands still, praise it, unfasten the girth, remove the saddle and pad, and work on it letting you touch it everywhere. Come back to saddling it later.

, Work on both sides so as to give even pressure. Work only as far as the horse is comfortable.


As soon as it puts up too much of a fuss, wait until it settles down, praise it, and unfasten the girth. Then, do it again, but only fasten it as far as it allowed last time. Remember to pat it each time it stands quietly when the girth is fastened.
Eventually, be it today or over the span of a few days, you should be able to get it cinched all the way up with no problems.

, You can do this with or without a lunge line if you're in a round pen, but regardless, you're going to want to pay extra attention to your horse. As soon as you let it go, it will gallop around and buck. I recommend you wear a helmet for this, just in case its hoof were to get you.


Keep on it, and let it buck. This is the equivalent of a bronco buster, only without the rider. Since there's no rider, as long as the saddle is fastened and you make sure the horse doesn't fall, the saddle will always win.
Crack the whip whenever it tries to stop or lay down, and keep it going in one direction until it's calmed down to an easy canter and you can order a trot. Just like the join-up, switch hands and order it to go the other direction.
Remember, it may start bucking again, so keep it moving forward until it stops bucking. Then, change directions two more times (about 5 laps each) and halt the horse. It's gotten this out of its system today, but you may need to do this for a few more days until it no longer bucks with the saddle on.

, Start doing your ground work routines with it completely tacked up.


Do the showmanship or trail-in-hand patterns with the bridle and saddle on for a few days, and then you can move on to getting it used to weight. You want it to think of the saddle and bridle as nothing, and by doing this routine, you'll get it to focus on you while working under the equipment it'll be wearing when you're on its back.

, Grab a buddy to either hold the horse for you, or to be the guinea pig for this part - whoever's lighter or more capable.


Step or have them step onto a mounting block so that they'll be taller than the horse's back (if a horse - a pony may not need either if the rider is tall enough. Just remember that they can carry up to 20% of their bodyweight when deciding who should ""get on"")
Put your foot in the stirrup, and grab the pommel and cantle of the horn.
Stand like this for a moment until you know the horse has calm down. This part might not bother the horse. Now, put weight in the stirrup, and be prepared for the horse to step away. if it steps too far, release the saddle and place your foot back down until your helper can get the horse situated back at the block. You may need to step down at first, depending on the horse.
Try again, until you can successfully step into the stirrup and hold your weight there. Stay there for 5-10 seconds and do it again for the other side. Then, step up and lay across the saddle.
After a while the horse should be calm enough to let your helper lead you two around like this. It may not be flattering, but it is needed as you can easily dismount should the horse decide to act up. If at all the horse does act up and you end up on your feet again, go back to stepping up and laying over the saddle, and then leave it at that for the day.
Keep doing this until you can successfully be lead around from both sides. Remember to wear a helmet for these stages, and give the horse praise an time it does something good.

, Warm up your horse as usual, and this time, mount the horse, still with your helper holding the horse (or however you did it last time). Just sit there, and dismount the other side.


Mount that side and sit there for a while, and dismount the opposite side. This gets the horse used to not only you sitting on its back, but having action happen on both sides. Once the horse accepts being ridden at a stop, have them lead you around/lead them around until they can trot in-hand. Then, move on to lunging.
You will need to have a line for this, as the horse isn't being actively ridden. The rider is there simply to train the horse to carry a person, but it still needs to be worked out. At this stage, it may be best to lunge it in only a halter, and to provide a grab strap for the rider if they are riding english.
The horse may buck this time, but not as severely as with the saddle as it is already used to the weight being on its back. So, whoever rides the horse has to be good at staying on.
An experienced jumper may be best if no one experienced in this stage of training is available, as they have good seats from jumping their horses. Otherwise, just try to center yourself (or tell the rider to center themselves) and hang on.
Make sure the rider especially is wearing a helmet. Lunge the horse as normal in both directions. The rider shouldn't do anything but sit there, and you or whoever is lunging should be giving the horse commands.
After a successful session, leave it at that for the day, and repeat the next day. Eventually you will be able to lunge with the bridle, and progressively introduce cues (nudging with the heel/squeezing for example) until the rider can take over completely.

Mount the saddle on a stable object.,
Practice by standing on the pedals of a bike.,
Use a chair.",How to Practice Two Point Position Without a Horse1," If you have a saddle but not a horse, you can to improvise in order to practice your two point position at home or when you can't get to the stables. You will need to find an object that you can use to secure the saddle above the ground. Ensure it is sturdy and can take your weight before you use it. It could be a wide fence outside, or a barrel, a wooden polo practice horse, or something similar.Secure the saddle on the object you are using, and be sure it does not slip around or fall off.


Now mount up and push yourself up into two point position and hold it for as long as you can. Concentrate on your form and body position. If possible set up a mirror or camera so you can correct your position.
If you find yourself losing balance and falling forwards or backwards use this to improve your position.
If you fall forwards, try to open your chest a little and concentrate on pressing your shoulder blades down and back while in position.
If you fall backwards, try to press your hipbones forwards towards where the horse's ears would be.;
, If you don't have a saddle or an object to use as a practice horse you can try to replicate the position by standing up on the pedals of a bike. You can do this static or on the move. If you do on a static bike, you will need to secure the bike so you don't fall over. Stand up in the pedals and try to mimic the two point position.


Lean slightly forward and take most of the weight on your ankles and heels, as you would in the saddle.Doing this can also help you improve your balance, and with practice you might find you are able to keep your balance on the bike when it is static.

, One very simple way to try and practice two point position at home is just to use a chair as your imaginary horse. Turn the chair around so you are facing the backrest and then squat over it with your hands on top of the back rest holding imaginary reins. Lower yourself down towards the seat of the chair, but don't let your backside touch it.


Lean forward with a straight back and try to your body into a position similar to the two point position.
This will help improve the strength in your legs, and can allow you just to focus on your body position without thinking about your balance.

After working on the horse's gaits for weeks or months, start introducing the half-halt.",How to Tame a Horse or Pony4," Cue it to walk, teach it to ""woah,"" back up, get it to flex its neck for turning. You'll be in this stage for a while, as you'll want to get the horse moving off your leg with little to no hesitation and pressure.


Dressage tests are perfect for this stage, as they have tons of circles and figures to keep you and your horse thinking, but you can also do horsemanship and trail patterns as well.
Stick to walking until you can get a good ""woah"" and good response from your leg, and then do the same for trotting. Make sure these two gaits are solid, and that you're getting good flexion from the neck and body in your turns. Figure-eights are a must.
Try not to stay still too long, as you'll want to keep the horse thinking and moving to prevent it from potentially testing you and forming bad habits. (Pawing, head swaying, etc)

, Make sure you have a solid ""woah"" for this, in case the horse gets carried away. Work in a large, enclosed area, such as an arena.


Get the horse to pick up a canter. It will feel unbalanced and you may get a rough, brisk trot beforehand. That's okay, just keep urging him to canter. Get a few good strides, and then ask for a trot again.
Slow down to a rideable trot, and then ask for a canter again. Slow down again after a few good strides. The reason for doing this is that the horse - if it's just now being trained - doesn't have a strong canter yet. It can't balance well, and if you ride an unbalanced canter, you and your horse can both get hurt. The goal is to strengthen his canter.

This may take months, so be prepared for a lot of trot work. To do this, form a circle in your arena. 20 metres if available is best, otherwise the width of the arena will do just fine.


Get a good trot going, and then ask for the canter. Canter the circle, and keep light pressure on the reins. Don't hang on his mouth, just ask for him to turn the circle. This forces him on his haunches to turn, and will strengthen them enough for a good, balanced canter. Always start with the side they are better at. You can find this out by watching them in the roundpen. What side to they like to canter better?
Keep yourself centered in the saddle, and let your arms and elbows stay pliable. As soon as the canter goes unbalanced, or the horse tried to rush, go back to a trot and immediately half-halt. Trot the full circle once or twice to regroup, and then ask for it again.
Repeat as needed. Eventually, the horse should transition soundly into a rhythmic trot from his canter, and if he doesn't after he's had plenty of time to realize what you were asking, do a trot-halt transition.

This gets him thinking again, and you can continue and try again.



, Eventually, you'll be able to lengthen the time you stay in the canter and shorten the time you trot, until you're able to canter the whole circle. At first, however, you may only be able to canter half the circle balanced, and have to trot the whole circle to get a rhythmic trot again.


Work on this every day to get your horse to strengthen and balance his canter, for a month or two depending on how long it takes your horse.
Now, your horse should be able to canter multiple circles without needing to trot in-between, and he should be getting the transitions between trot and canter immediately. Now, do a figure-eight, cantering the circle at one end of the arena and then dropping down to a trot.

,, Once you've got this down, start shortening the spans of trot, so that most of it is done in a canter.

, Start at one end of your arena and pick up a trot. Trot a 20 meter circle to start, and then pick up the canter at the short end. go into the first loop for whichever lead you're on, and then transition to a trot as you straighten out.


Ask for the opposite lead, and finish the next loop. Repeat for the final loop, trotting as you straighten out, and ask for the final lead. Return to a trot as you complete the pattern. Try to gradually shorten the span of trot each time.

, Trot a 20 meter circle at one end of the arena, and then canter the circle. Now, drop down to a trot at the corner, and trot a 10 meter circle, and ask for a canter to go down the length of the arena.


Do the 10 meter trotting circle at that corner, and repeat the pattern round the entire arena. Feel free to trot the 10 meter circle twice if you find it difficult.

, Return to the original 20 meter circle. Trot one half, and canter the other. Gradually shorten the trot length, until you trot for roughly 3 steps before taking the canter again.


Next time,silently ask for a trot by dragging the reins and shifting your weight for a downward transition, but keep a gentle, supporting leg, and as soon as you feel your horse shift for that transition, apply more leg and ask for the canter again. Alternate this between actually trotting, so he can associate it with something he knows.
Remember to repeat for the other direction. After he gets the half-hald down clearly, you should be able to ride a balanced canter all around the arena!
Now you should be able to ride your horse walk, trot, and canter, and you can start schooling for the events you want, or just go hit the trails!
Remember, though, wear a helmet when doing new things, and if you're going out alone, let people know where you're going and how long you plan to be gone. Should the horse spook and dump you somewhere, people will know where to look for you. Enjoy working with your horse!

Find an enclosed space for lunging, preferably a ring or small enclosed pasture.,
Apply polo wraps or brushing boots to the horse before starting work.,
Ideally, use a lunge cavesson.,
Never leave side reins tight when the horse is walking.,
Prepare the lunge line, by folding it back and forward over itself, not by coiling around your hand.,
Practice using the lunging rein and whip until your are comfortable with them and can handle them nimbly.,
Snap the lunge rein to the center ring of the cavesson.

,
Whips may 'only' be used as an aid, never as a tool to harm, injure, or frighten the horse.",How to Lunge a Horse1," Be sure that the footing is safe for your horse throughout the ring and that you can make a circle that is at least twenty meters in diameter. Do not work the horse on a tight circle for an extended period of time, as it can cause damage to their legs. Avoid bringing your horse to these places only for lunging, spend time doing activities to desensitize the horse to the new location.;
, It is important to protect the horse's legs when working on a relatively small circle, especially with green horses.

, If you do not have one a halter or bridle on the horse can also be used. If using a halter, take care to ensure it does not twist and rub your horse in the eye. Do not just clip the lunge line to one bit ring, this can cause the bit to be pulled through the horse's mouth.

, The horse must be able to freely move the neck and back to have a proper walk. Also it is important to allow the horse to warm up freely before attaching and tightening the side reins. An alternative to side reins is a Master Rein which does not fix the horses nose to it's chest but allows the horse to move freely forward into a contact whilst bending and flexing on the lunge.

, Make sure it’s not twisted and is comfortable in your hand.

, Any clumsiness will confuse and upset the horse. Take extreme caution to use good body language and avoid using frantic body language. When the horse does poorly, do not yank multiple times on the rope, Apply consistent and escalating pressure. Give the horse the opportunity to answer correctly to the lowest amount of force. When the horse behaves because of your pressure, release it. Continued pressure after this point will only confuse the horse, as it's mind is searching to get you to release the pressure it's feeling. Whatever causes you to give less pressure becomes the correct answer to the horse. To reiterate, practicing your body language and the use of your rein and aids will help you to give clear direction to the horse. The ultimate goal of any horse training exercise including lunging is to get the horse to understand the ""trick"" to getting you to leave it alone is to do what you say.

,, The whip is only to keep you out of the kicking range. To move the horse away from you, point the whip at his shoulder (not touching); and to move the horse on, point the whip behind his hindquarters. The use of aids must be managed carefully so as to not give the horse the impression that misbehaving results in a release of pressure. When you have time, desensitize the horse to the whip by also using it to rub or stroke and give positive interaction. The horse should learn to respect your direction, not simply be afraid because you have an aid.

Ride a bike.,
Do calf raises.,
Do squats.,
Practice yoga to improve your balance.",How to Practice Two Point Position Without a Horse2," In order to have a good strong two point position you need to have strong legs which can carry your weight for extended periods. Practising two point on a horse will work your legs, but it is easy to supplement this with some targeted strength training at home.One of the best ways to strengthen your legs is to go cycling often. Try to ride everyday when you can't ride a horse to keep your legs strong and improve your stamina.


Riding a bike out of the saddle to some extent mimics riding in two point position on a horse. You will have to lean forward a little and keep your balance in the same kind of way.Improving the strength of your legs will help your remain stable and balanced in two point position, as well as improving your endurance.

, If you have been working on your two point position you will have noticed how much it makes your calves burn. Calf raises are a great and very simple exercise which you can do at home. There are some variations which increase the difficulty, but the basic movement remains the same. To start with, stand up straight and lift yourself up onto your toes, contracting your calf muscles as you go. Keep your knees straight as you do this.You can increase the intensity by standing on a block or a stair, and dangling your heel off the end. Doing this will increase the range of motion available, allowing you to drop your heel below the level of the rest of your foot.
You can add weight to increase the difficulty simply by holding onto dumbbells or any weighted object as you do the raises.
If you do regular sets of calf raises you will begin to notice your calves strengthening and the muscle becoming more defined, which can translate to a more stable and enduring two point position.

, The second main exercise you can do at home to help you develop your leg muscles for a better two point position is squats. Like calf raises, you can do squats anywhere and you don't need any equipment, but you can increase the difficulty by adding weight. Stand up straight with your legs shoulder width, or slightly wider, apart and turn your feet out to around 45 degrees. Inhale, contract your abdominal muscles and drop down.


You backside should go out behind you as you go down. The movement is as if you were sitting down on a chair that is a little behind you not directly underneath you.
Keep your knees in line with your feet, your chest forward, your chin up and your back with only a slight bend as you drop down.
Go down so that your thighs are as close to parallel with the ground as you can before pushing back up to a standing position., As well as strengthening your legs, it will be beneficial for you to work on improving your balance when you are away from the stables. One very good way to do this is with regular yoga routines. Yoga can help you improve your core strength and flexibility which can translate to better balance on and off your horse. Try regular routines which involve the tree pose, the eagle pose and the dancer's pose.


The tree pose involves you standing up on one leg with the sole of your other foot pressed up against the inside thigh of your standing leg.For the eagle pose stand on one leg and bend the knee of the standing leg so you are squatting. Then raise your other leg and wrap it around your standing leg. Your arms should be crossed in front of you.To do the dancer's pose stand on one leg and raise your other leg up behind you. Grab the foot of the other leg with the hand on the same side and pull it up towards your back as you lean forward and extend your other arm in front of you."
"
Position yourself in the center of the ring, and, if you're lunging to the left, hold the lunge rein in your left hand and your whip in your right hand.

,
You should grasp the lunge line, with the excess folded back and forward within your hand in loops.,
Carry the whip pointing slightly behind the horse and pointing down when not using it.,
Face the middle of the horse.",How to Lunge a Horse2,", You should be forming a triangle, with the horse's body, the lunge rein and the whip.

, Keep your wrists, arms and shoulders relaxed and supple, the same as you would for riding.

, Staring at the horse in the eyes adds stress to the horse, so as a reward for good behavior avert your eyes to the shoulder.

"
"
Control the horse's speed and pace with voice aids or clicking your tongue, using commands such as ""stand"", “walk on”, “trot on”, “canter”, ""steady"" and “whoa”.

,
Ask for more forward action by bringing the lunge rein slightly forward and ‘squeezing’ the horse with the whip by bringing it up and closer to the hind quarters.

,
To slow the horse, bring the lunge rein back slightly, let the whip point down and slightly away.,
To stop the horse, ask the horse to slow and also point the whip in front of the horse.,
Control the rhythm of your horse's pace with your own feet.,
Flick or crack the whip to back up your aids only when necessary.,
Send the horse out on the circle by asking for walk or ""move out"" and letting the lunge rein slip though your fingers.,
Keep the horse from turning in or falling in on the circle by pointing the whip at the horse’s shoulder.

,
To lunge the horse in the other direction (called 'changing the rein'), first halt the horse.,
When you are finished, halt the horse and walk towards the horse taking in the lunge rein as you go.",How to Lunge a Horse3,",, Do not pull back on the lunge, just add more contact and release immediately when your horse obeys.

, You can also do this to slow a horse if they refuse to slow down. Whip-shy horses may be affected in the opposite way, so be careful.

, Keep your feet moving.


In the same way, you can control your horse's pace with your seat when riding; your horse will follow the pace of your feet.

, Be ready if the horse reacts, and wait for the horse to relax and listen to you again.

,'Important: Never Let the lunge rein get too slack or the horse may step on it and injure himself or you.'When the horse is on the line you want, take up a contact. A twenty-meter circle is normal.

,, Take the lunge rein in your right hand and whip in your left. Raise the whip in front of the horse to block movement that way, and move the lunge line away from your body to invite the horse into that space. Wait until the horse has turned and then ask for walk.

, Make sure you fold the rein rather than roll it to lessen the danger of the rein tightening around your hand if the horse takes off.

"

Prepare your horse.,
Lead your horse to the area you are lunging.,
Walk your horse around in a big circle.,
Move your horse into a trot.,
Move your horse away from you.,
Speed your horse into a canter.,
Move your horse back down into a walk.",How to Lunge a Horse4," Get your horse's headcollar, a lunge line and a whip - preferably a dressage or schooling whip. Put the lunge line on the headcollar. Just do this like you would the lead rope, and then put the head collar on.

, You need a bit of space to lunge, but you can do it in any enclosed arena. For easy lunging, using a round pen (it forces the horse to continuously move in a circle). A large arena will also work, so long as there are not other people or horse inside with you.

, Standing in the center of the round pen or arena, cue your horse to being walking by gently clucking or wiggling the lunge line at them. Have them walk in a circle around you for several minutes, making sure that they stay rated and don't try to come too close to you or pull away.

, When they've perfected the walk, cue your horse to trot by waving the whip behind them and clucking. Give them forward pressure by standing slightly behind their hips in the center of the circle, and pushing towards them with your body. Have them do this for several minutes to make sure that they don't try to slow down, speed up, or spiral in or out from you.

, Let more of the lunge line go to make your horse go out. Do not let it touch the ground though. Letting the horse out is a cue from you to them that you're trusting them to respond to you, with less physical connection. Continue to have them lunge in a trot around you, using your whip or body language to push them forwards if they try to slow down or turn away.

, After 5-10 minutes of successful trotting, you can ask your horse to speed up once more into a canter. This is the most difficult part of lunging - maintaining control over the horse while moving at a high speed, far away from you. Make a kissing noise to your horse and use wave your whip in the air behind them to cue the canter. Ask them to maintain the canter for 3-5 minutes before letting go, and having them move back into a trot.

, Slowly release pressure to cue your horse to slow down. To do so, lower your eyes, back away, and drop the whip so that it's pointing away from them. They should respond accordingly by slowing their pace until they're back at a walk. Finish lunging by having them walk for a few minutes in a circle around you, and then let them join up with you at the end.

Say ‘whoa.’ This verbal cue indicates to your horse that he has walked forward to the correct location.,
Lead your horse through a narrow opening.,
Lead your horse through a swing gate.,
Remove the halter and lead rope.",How to Lead a Horse," You will need a few tools to lead your horse: halter, lead rope, gloves, and dressage whip. The halter will fit snugly yet comfortably on your horse’s head, and the lead the rope will attach to the halter. The gloves are useful to protect your hands from rope burns and/or irritation.The dressage whip is a semi-rigid rod that is about 36 to 44 inches (91 to 110 cm) in length. The semi-rigidness will prevent the horse from experiencing painful or bothersome pokes from the whip.Lead ropes come in different materials. Cotton lead ropes can be more forgiving on your hands (if you are not wearing gloves),but may rot or mildew if stored when wet. Polypropylene lead ropes have several advantages, including being soft and flexible and easy to grip.Nylon lead ropes are also available.Choose a lead rope that is about 8 to 10 feet (2 to 3 m) long.A rope halter with a rope crown snap is useful when teaching a horse to yield to pressure. Pressure is sometimes needed when leading a horse.Treats will also be helpful to have on hand. Examples of tasty treats include cut-up apples or carrots and horse cookies.;
, Attach your lead rope to the halter before placing it on your horse. Holding the unbuckled halter in your left hand, stand on your horse’s left side and slowly guide your right hand over his neck to guide his head toward you. With your right hand, slowly guide the halter’s nosepiece over your horse’s muzzle and the headstall over and behind his ears.Do not poke your horse’s eyes as you are positioning the halter.Secure the halter. Keep in mind that halters have different ways of being secured (e.g., buckles, snaps, clips).Talk to your horse in a reassuring voice as you are placing the halter on him.
Having the lead rope already attached will give you some control if your horse tries to pull away as you put the halter on., A halter that does not fit properly will create challenges when leading a horse. You should be to fit two fingers easily and snugly between your horse and the noseband.Adjust the halter accordingly if it fits too tightly or too loosely.


Your horse may signal his discomfort if the halter is too tight on his head or behind his ears.

, A horse’s left side is the customary position to lead a horse.You can stand so that you are either even with your horse’s head or about halfway between his head and shoulder.Stand about 12 inches (30 cm) away from your horse.Leading a horse is possible from the lead (in front of your horse) or drive positions (behind your horse’s withers), but is not as safe as standing by your horse’s side., How you hold the lead rope is essential to safely leading your horse. Hold the lead rope with your right hand.Fold or coil the excess lead rope in your left hand.Never wrap the lead rope around your hand—if your horse decides to bolt, you could get dragged by your horse and seriously injure yourself.Keep the excess lead rope off of the ground to prevent you or your horse from tripping over it., An important aspect of leading your horse is teaching him how to yield his hindquarters from a standstill. To begin, face your horse’s left side. With the lead rope in your left hand, apply even pressure with the lead rope to get your horse to turn his head turns towards you.


Teaching your horse to yield his hindquarters is important because he may have the tendency to do a partial halt when being led: stopping his front legs while moving his hindquarters in a quarter circle.A full halt is when your horse can yield both his front and hindquarters.

, Hold the dressage whip in your right hand. Use gentle taps on your horse’s left ankle (inside hind leg) to coax your horse to move that leg in, forward and in front the outside hind leg.Continue tapping until he move his inside hind leg correctly.Your horse may not care for the tap of the dressage whip, but it will not hurt him.
Space your taps about one second apart.When your horse can yield his hindquarters when you are on his left side, switch to his right side., Initially, your horse may kick the leg you are tapping. In addition, he may move his outside hind leg.If he moves his outside hind leg, follow his movements, but continue to tap on his inside leg. Eventually, he will stop moving the outside hind leg and move only the inside hind leg.


Keep your practice sessions relatively short—about 10 to 15 minutes., Position yourself as when you taught him to yield his hindquarters: facing his left side with the lead rope in your left hand and the dressage whip in your right hand. As you take your first step forward, give your horse a verbal cue (e.g., a soft clucking or kissing noise).Although you will be moving forward, you will need to face him to closely watch his forward movements.Pick a spot about 10 feet (3 m) in front of you before starting your forward movement., Start tapping your horse’s hip with the whip after you give the verbal cue, but before your foot hits the ground. The timing of when you start tapping is important so that your horse learns to associate the verbal cue with forward movement.Space the taps about one second apart.Continue tapping until your horse moves forward. If he moves in any direction other than forward, follow his movements and continue tapping. Make sure not to apply any additional pressure to his halter or lead rope if he moves in the wrong direction.Stop the tapping immediately when he begins to step forward., He may not understand this cue initially, and may even continue walking past the desired location. If he does this, say ‘whoa’ again and apply backward pressure to his lead rope to encourage him to walk backward to the right spot.It is important for you to stop tapping when he reaches the correct spot.In time, he should be able to stop according to your verbal ‘whoa,’ rather than when you stop tapping.

, Narrow openings, such as a stall door, can be dangerous to move through with your horse. He may be reluctant to move forward because the inside of the area looks different from the outside. This reluctance may lead to bolting or extreme resistance, both of which could injure you.To safely lead your horse through a narrow opening, it is advisable for you to walk through the opening first, then let your horse walk through when he is calm.Make sure to quickly move to the side of the opening after you move through and before you cue your horse to move forward.This will prevent your horse from crowding you as he walks through the opening., A swing gate is wider than a stall door. However, you will still need to control your horse as he moves through it. While leading your horse from his left side, approach the gate with as much room as possible to open the gate. Unlatch the gate with one hand while keeping a firm hold on your horse’s lead rope with your other hand.Open the gate widely enough for you and your horse to walk through easily. Your horse should not have to back up and reposition to get through the gate.Make sure to swing the gate closed when you and your horse have gone through it to prevent other animals from entering through the gate.Do not walk in front of the horse when walking through the gate. Horses tend to move quickly through openings, and he may injure you if he moves quickly when you are in front of him., Once you and your horse have safely moved through the opening, you can release him by removing his halter and lead rope. You should remove his lead rope before removing his halter. This will prevent your horse from rearing back and developing a bad habit of pulling on his halter.Before removing the halter and lead rope, turn your horse so that he is facing you and the opening.Although this may be easier said than done, do not let your horse bolt after being released.You may want to consult with your veterinarian or equine behaviorist for tips on how to keep your horse from bolting.

Horses must be able to escape in an emergency, so they should never be tied up directly to a wall or object.",How to Handle a Pony With Care," He may be startled if he can't see you coming, so never approach him from behind. It's best to approach his shoulder. Put a hand out, palm upwards so he can sniff it. Stroke the side of his neck and talk to him in a calm reassuring voice. It's important for the horse to see you clearly. Let him approach you quietly.;
, If you really do need to go behind him, put a hand on his back so he knows you're there. Never walk close to his back legs, as he can kick and seriously hurt you. It's important to show him affection too. Do so by talking to him and scratching lightly his neck and withers.

, You can tell a horse off with a scolding firm voice. If he still misbehaves, smack his shoulder or neck. If he can take a whip, he can take a hand. Never smack his head. This can make him nervous of having his head touched by others which is called ' head shy.

, To catch a horse, you need a headcollar or halter with a lead rope attached to it. A difficult horse to catch can wear a headcollar in a field, to make him easier to grab. It must be leather, so that it will break if it catches on something. Take a tidbit to offer the horse, and approach him quietly, hiding the headcollar behind your back.

Try to keep this in mind as you begin training your horse.


Remember, this is a very large animal that is scared, could be belligerent and want to hurt you just to get away from you. Your life, and those around you could be in danger. So be smart, find someone who knows what they are doing before you attempt anything close to ""taming"" this animal. You might just save the horse's life too.;
, The decision to train a horse should be researched well before the animal is even purchased. Begin with the breeder or owner and find out the ""personality"" of the horse. Is it friendly and willing? Or is it a man killer in disguise?


Get a ""pre-purchase"" examination by a qualified equine veterinarian. Your vet specialist can help you to discover any underlying medical problems, joint conditions, dental problems that may impact training regimes. Not every horse is friendly, or going to make a good candidate for training.

, All horses need to be checked out for health and vaccinated against infectious diseases and other problems unique to horses. Quick changes to nutrition can have a serious effect on the horse's stomach and could lead to serious problems, such as Colic. This is another reason it's essential that you visit a licensed and qualified equine vet before you attempt to train a horse.

, Horses intended for pleasure riding, simple trail riding, long distance riding, athletic events, or high level competition like polo or barrel racing need to be trained differently. Likewise, horses being used for work such as cattle cutting need special training, as well. Match your horse with techniques that will blend well with your intended purpose, the breed of the animal, and what you expect the animal to accomplish for you.


There is a huge spectrum of training. From Dressage to Endurance to Hunting and Jumping to Track Racing, the list is more complicated than possible to get into for the purposes of this article. It's important to consult with experienced trainers where you stable your horse and develop an appropriate plan for your purposes.

, Put them out in a pasture with a very patient horse. Every day, come out with a bucket of oats or treats. The patient horse should come up to you, accepting your treats. Pet the horse and make it clear that the other horse is being treated well. Eventually your horse should start coming to you for these delicious treats too. Stroke your horse, use a kind, warm, and inviting tone, and be very patient.


After a while, when your horse just starts coming, stop bringing treats. Your horse will eventually come to realize that when you come out, they should too.

, Training a horse to accept a person takes patience and common sense. Horses are big animals and can hurt you if you are not paying attention and don't understand how they react to certain things. A horse is a prey animal therefore they are constantly on the lookout for danger as a result they are hyper alert and can run or rear up or kick in self defense so it is best to not make sudden moves around them or ""surprise"" them.


That being said it is not hard to gain a horses trust. First you will want to tether your horse with a halter and a lead rope so the horse won't walk away from you. It is always a good idea to have someone who knows about horses with you to help you manage the horse at first.

, Horses are large and potentially dangerous animals, so it's important to stay aware at all times when you're handling them. Look for any potential situations that could trigger a fear response.


Always wear boots and pay attention to where the horse hooves are because you will eventually get stepped on.
Whenever possible approach your horse from the front or side. Horses have wide angle vision but if you are directly behind them they cannot see you.

, Hold the lead rope in one hand a gently start rubbing the horse on their neck or between their ears or on their sides. Horses will let you know whether they like it or not by moving closer or moving away from your touch.


A carrot or some grain in your hand will get their attention. When feeding a horse with your hand give them the flat of your palm not your fingers. Let the horse smell you and get to know you. Run your hands over their back and hind end.

, To get comfortable with your horse, a good brushing is essential. Remember to be soft and gentle with your strokes. If you are standing directly behind the horse, they can not see you so it's important to keep talking and maintain contact with the horse with your hands and talk in soft gentle tone.


If you want to build a bond with your horse brush and stroke it daily, it will go a long way. It is a good idea to begin any ride with 10 minutes of gentle brushing and massaging your horse.

, Once your horse is calm enough, start putting a halter on and start walking the horse around the pasture. Stroll along, and if your horse tries to run away, let them. Eventually, the horse will come back, as they see you mean no harm and don't pose a threat. Eventually, once your hose seems comfortable, ask them to pick up a trot, then canter, then, if you feel up to it, a gallop. Remember to take your time, and that you don't need to ask for the gallop before moving on.


To begin with, just start bringing a lead rope, but keep strolling around. If your horse seems okay with this, start strolling around other places. You can even go into an arena, so they get used to it.
Remember not to wrap the lunge line, so if your horse bolts or spooks, you won't be dragged.
Once your horse can properly perform a walk, trot, canter, and halt in both directions, add a saddle. Keep lunging your horse from a halt to the canter, and gradually add weights to the saddle.

, Consult more experienced riders for more information about saddling and tacking your horse. Tie the lead rope so it will break away if the horse should spook and pull tightly but otherwise keep the horse tethered. Allow only enough slack in the lead rope to allow her head to move but not enough to touch the ground.


If your horse is standing too close to you or leaning on you, then push back gently. Horses respond to pressure. So firmly push the horse into position don't ever yank or yell at a horse. You will find that applying pressure will often get a better result.

, Before saddling up, brush off the area where the pad and saddle will rest on your horses back, being sure no dirt or grit will rub the horse under pressure of your weight in the saddle. Place the pad gently on the horses back after first showing to her and allowing her to smell it. This is important especially if she is fairly new to the process. same with the saddle let the horse see the saddle then place it gently on her back.


Once the saddle is on, the front should rest on the blanket close to the base of the horses neck and the girth strap should hang just behind her foreleg. When tightening the girth strap gently apply pressure do not jerk the strap.
Have a friend help you with tying the cinch off and putting on the bridle which takes some practice with placing the bit between the horses teeth without knocking the teeth with the bit.

, Every time you come near the horses, you need to take stock of the horse physically and emotionally. Assess the condition of its hooves and legs, as well as the breathing rate. Is the horse calm, or excited and antsy?


Often there is a good reason for this and you must try to figure it out and fix the problem. Sometimes leading the horse away into a different direction and circling back is enough to get them to cooperate.

, Once your horse can perform the gaits in both directions with weights in the saddle, a bit, and reins collected to where a rider's hands would be, your horse is ready to be mounted. Be extremely careful when mountain your horse at first.


Some horses don't even go forward, but will just back up endlessly while you're on.
If your horse displays bad habits (bucking, kicking, rearing) after the first few minutes, try being a bit sterner. You want to make it clear that bad habits are a no.
After thirty minutes, get off. Your rides will get longer with time, but you want your horse to get used to a rider.

For best results, have the horse’s main rider or trainer ride for a few minutes. Then, trade places and feel how the horse responds naturally, and the ride feels smoother. Most importantly, you should gain an understanding of how the bit helps the horse maintain a more comfortable, natural posture and movement., If it’s too large, you could injure your horse and undo the work you’ve already put into training it. Even large horses don’t really need large bits. The bit sits at the back of the mouth on your horse’s gums. This soft tissue is full of nerve endings that make this spot extremely sensitive. When selecting a bit, you’ll need to consider the width and shape. For the best results, a wider bit with a curved shape is ideal.


Thinner bits can be painful for the horse. Thinner bits put more pressure in a concentrated area, leading to discomfort.
A curved bit allows more space for the horse’s tongue, so the movement of the bit has the intended interaction with the sensitive soft tissue in your horse’s mouth without gagging the horse., Consider them your best resource in learning to bit train a horse. Much of bit training relies on feelings, not specific movements, so it’s important to talk to other trainers for advice and assistance. If it’s your first time bit training a horse, you may want to observe the experienced trainer as they train your horse., A healthy horse is more likely to keep up with their bit training, so exercise your horse regularly. One of the best ways to improve the strength of your horse is to walk and trot up and down hills. A thorough daily warm up and ride will keep the horse in great shape, build the connection between you and your horse, and make it easier to train them on the bit., Place a small amount of honey or molasses on the bar that goes across your horse's tongue. This makes the bit seem interesting to your horse. It will likely take the bit into its mouth happily. However, once the sweet stuff is gone, your horse may spit it right back out. Keep practicing. After awhile, your horse should start to relating the bit with a sweet treat and take it willingly., This is contested by some trainers, but if you use a large enough bit and do not leave it in your horse's mouth for more than a half hour at a time, allowing the horse to hold the bit on its own can be helpful. Without associating the bit with riding, training, or work, your horse should become more willing to transition into doing these things on the bit. Additionally, it allows your horse to become accustomed to the feeling of having the bit in its mouth., Once your horse will hold the bit in its mouth for several minutes at a time up to a half hour, you can start some basic bridle training. You may simply want to connect the bridle and allow your horse to feel the difference in sensation, or you can attach a lead and take the horse for walk. The goal is to get your horse used to the feeling of a full bit and bridle. Again, don't leave the bit and bridle on for more than a half hour at a time., Many older horses fight the bit because they've never used it. If you want to bit train your horse, start as soon as you begin training and riding. The bit should feel natural and comfortable to your horse, and the younger they are when you start bit training them the more likely they will be to perform well on the bit., Depending on the age of a horse, training should only be done for about half an hour at a time. Think about your own learning ability. Most people retain information delivered in smaller sections, and horses do too. Additionally, the bit will likely feel uncomfortable for your horse as it adjusts, so it’s best to limit the amount of time with the bit at first. The bulk of your thirty minute session should be a simple warmup.


Younger horses may do better training for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time.
Better trained horses may be able to handle larger periods of training, especially if you extend the warmup., Many trainers start off training the horse on the bit, and if you’ve decided to do this, it is even more important to start with simple movements that your horse is becoming familiar with. If you’re training an older horse, warming up with the basics creates an association in your horse’s mind between their “usual” ride and how this “new” ride is connected. During the warm up, you’ll need to start with simple forward motion and check for straightness, rhythm, and contact., This is the key to a successful training session or ride. If you gently squeeze the side of your horse and it starts directly forward, you’re all set. If a gentle squeeze does not start your horse forward or your horse is fighting the bit instead of moving forward, you may need to provide reprimand and reinforcement. Always avoid squeezing harder and harder to urge your horse forward. In the long run, this will leave you with a poorly trained horse and an exhausting ride.


When the horse does not move forward, you can use a whip, tap with your leg, or whatever method of reprimand you choose to use with your horse. Give them a firm “no” movement. Then, try squeezing again, gently.
As soon as the horse moves forward with a gentle squeeze, reward them with encouraging words like, “Good job.” You can also have a helper offer them a small treat, if this is something they’ve been struggling with., Once your horse begins to move forward, you’ll need to make sure the hind feet are following the same line as the front feet. This is called straightness, and it is how you can determine whether your horse is comfortable moving on the bit. If you notice curving of the spine when your horse is moving forward or spinal stiffness as it turns, your horse is not straight. Bring it to a halt, reassure it, and start again. Repeat until the horse’s movement is straight.


For a well-trained horse, a change in spinal straightness may be the only way to tell that it is not truly accepting the bit. Because the horse may not otherwise “fight” the bit, changes to the alignment of the spine and coordination of the back and front legs will let you know the horse is struggling., Every horse is unique, but no matter what your horse’s natural rhythm is, there should be equal intervals between each step. If you notice a halting or jerking quality as your horse moves, their rhythm may be off. To determine comfortable rhythm, count your horse’s steps. As you count one, two, three, four, there should be even spacing and smooth flow between the beat of each hoof. If the horse’s rhythm is off, slow or stop it. Then, begin again, increasing speed gradually.If you play a musical instrument, counting your horse’s rhythm is very similar to how you count a measure of music. This musical experience may give you an advantage in determining when one beat is too long or too short.

, Known as contact, this may be the most important part of your warmup. If your horse isn’t connected to you, responding easily to your commands and concentrating on following your lead, they are not going to be as successful with more advanced instructions. Your hold on the reigns, posture, and leg movement all affect your connection with the horse. Be aware of every moment and how it impacts your connection to your horse.


Keep the weight of the reigns even between hands. This places consistent pressure on the bit, ensuring your horse will notice when you place more on either side to begin turning.
Establish a consistent resting state of the reigns. Your reigns shouldn’t be constantly pulled tight or left lax. Instead, find a happy medium between the two, and continue to hold this contact.
True connection takes time. You will not achieve this natural feeling of communication with your horse in one ride. Keep practicing every day., There is a “go to” command for almost any skill in horse riding. A good rider and well trained horse know these commands. The half halt is the key command for bit training. Half halt may be a bit of a misnomer. Instead, think of it as half start or half go. The half halt is how you change your horse’s direction or gait. You don’t stop, you simply shift to another activity. It’s a combination of leg pressure and pull on the reign.


A horse that’s on the bit will respond quickly and naturally to half halt command to change speed or direction.
A horse that is not on the bit will fight, feel unbalanced, or respond incorrectly to the change., This is an easy method to train half halt. You’ll need to slow the horse slightly by squeezing both calves and sitting lower in the saddle. Then, use the reign to shift the pressure on the bit slightly to one side. Allow the horse to follow all the way through the curve and straighten out facing the opposite direction. Then, perform the same change to go back the other direction.


Do not pull the horse from the front. Use gentle pressure to tell them where you want them to go, and allow the horse to proceed., This is one of the most difficult maneuvers to teach your horse. It’s best to start out of the saddle, and simply lead the horse first in a large, gentle circle. Then, shift to a smaller circle. Next, switch to performing this circle in the saddle. Again, begin with a larger circle, and bring the circle in as your horse seems more comfortable.


Try going onto a 20 meter (65.6 ft) circle, bending the horse around your inside leg. When your horse can do this easily, it is responding well on the bit.
As your horse bends around your inside leg, make sure that it is still stepping with its hind legs and moving forward into the bit.
With practice, you will notice that the horse reaches into your hands, seeking the contact, and accepting the bit., This is not something you or your horse can learn in one day. It takes time, effort, and flexibility to build a connection with your horse. Being on the bit must come from behind, not from the front. This means it’s your horse’s choice to follow instruction, and not that you’re pulling the horse through the bit.

Change up your horse's schedule.,
Don't only ride your horse.,
Teach your horse to be alright with being ridden away from other horses.,
Do ground work with your horse.,
Do things that your horse likes.",How to Get Your Horse to Pay More Attention to You1," If you usually ride your horse to a certain place at a certain time, try riding to a different place at a different time of day. If your horse is used to being ridden in arenas, go trail riding with him or teach him how to herd cattle.
, Switch it up by grooming your horse, giving your horse a massage, and taking your horse on walks with you around the neighborhood., If your horse can be okay with leaving all his buddies to just hang out with you, he'll tend to focus more on you and less on other things (such as his buddies)., This involves leading, lunging, and trotting-in-hand. The more your horse listens to you while you're on the ground, the more he'll listen to you while you're in the saddle., If your horse likes trail riding, go do that during the week between practicing arena riding. If you keep your horse's schedule fluid and different every time, your horse will get into less habits that may let him to move automatically and without actually listening to you."
"
Try out multiple rewards and see which ones make your horse happier or more willing to do what you had asked again.,
Give them vocal praise as well as a pat on the neck.,
Give them a treat if you have one with you.

,
If you are having them work, such as teaching them voice commands while lunging, allow them to relax.,
If you are riding them, always remember this rule- pressure then release.,
If it is a hot day, make sure you reward them for their hard work by giving them a drink after a long cool down.

,
After a good day of work done by the horse, let them graze while you walk around with them or tell them they did good and give them a hug before you let them out.

",How to Reward a Horse During Training,";
, Anything such as ""good boy/girl!"" works.


If the horse will be used for showing though, don't only reward them with a pat on the neck- because in the show ring you most likely won't be able to touch your horse, and your horse may stop behaving if you don't reward them.

,, Relaxation is the best thing for both you and your horse, and if either being is stressed, the other will just feed off of that, and it will continue to worsen.


Example: If they are cantering around you, allow them to stop and come into you for a treat.

, How you do this is by asking them what you want, and then the split second they start doing it, release the pressure. From a horse's perspective, why should they do what this human wants us to do when we won't gain anything from it? Using the pressure-release method will reinforce good training, and will also let the horse know when he's doing something right.


Let's say you're trying to get their head lowered so they'll be more collected. What do you do? Pull in the reins a bit (the amount depending on how sensitive their mouth is and the severity of the bit), and then as soon as their head goes down even half an inch- release the pressure. A horse is sensitive about the bit pressure and will feel the release, making it more willing to work and let him know he's doing the correct thing.

Identify your horse’s poll bone.,
Stroke his poll bone lightly, applying pressure.,
Try stroking his neck and face with your hands.,
Consider a different method if your horse is shy or fearful.",How to Get a Horse to Put Its Head Down1," You can train your horse to put his head down by using the power of touch on his head. Some riders prefer to use touch only so they do not have to rely on props or assistants like the reins, the halter or the wand. Using touch will also help to strengthen your communication skills with your horse.To use this method, you will need to first locate your horse’s poll bone. This is a bone that is located on the top of his head, between his ears.;
, Use two fingers to lightly stroke his poll bone, applying a little pressure. Some horses respond easily to a lighter touch and some horses respond better to more pressure on their heads. Gauge your horse’s reaction and adjust the pressure on his poll bone as needed.Your horse should lower his head slightly. As soon as he does this, remove your hand and stroke his neck and withers. You can also give him a small treat or a verbal “Good job”. This will indicate to him that he has done something right and is getting a reward for his efforts.
Get in the habit of rubbing his poll head and then rewarding him with strokes once he lowers his head. Over time, he will understand that rubbing his poll head means “put head down”.

, If your horse does not respond to pressure on his poll bone or if he seems to dislike touch on his poll bone, you can try stroking his neck and face with your hands instead.


Start by using both hands to stroke your horse’s neck from his withers forward toward his ears. Stroke in a rhythmic motion, moving back and forth with both hands.
Keep stroking his neck with one hand and gradually move the other hand toward his face. Stroke his face with one hand and gradually move the other hand so it strokes his face forward from his ears to his nose. Eventually, your horse should relax and lower his head.
Reward him with words of praise, a treat, or a gentle stroke of his withers when he lowers his head so he knows he has done something right. Continue to use this method until he understands this stroking motion on his neck and face means “put your head down”.

, Some horses are uncomfortable with their rider touching their face or neck, especially if they are shy or fearful. Most horses are protective of their heads so this method may not be ideal if your horse is not bonded with you or generally shy.


You may need to work on establishing a trusting bond first with your horse before you attempt to use touch to get him to put his head down.

Spend time with your horse everyday, starting with just being near him and grooming him. Grooming helps connect you with the horse and forms a bond between the two of you. Work around him in the pasture, giving him time to build confidence in you. Talk to him and reassure him if he is spooked by something.


Horses are prey animals, so they get spooked easily. If your horse hasn't grown up around people, he may be scared of people.If you have a foal or horse too young to be trained, go ahead and start getting the horse used to people and gaining his trust.
You should spend a significant amount of time gaining the horse's trust before starting to train him.;
, Horses are powerful animals that can cause a lot of damage. While training your horse, you want to make sure you are safe. Stay where your horse can see you most of the time. If you have to move where he can't see you, run your hand along his side so he knows where you are going.


The best place to stand is on the horse's left side, aligned with his ear, angled towards his head. This spot is easiest for the horse to see you.
Talk to your horse when you are out of his eyesight. This helps him know where you are.
Don't walk behind your horse. Also don't stand directly in front of your horse.
Don't kneel or sit around your horse. When working on hooves, bend down to work instead of squatting., Breaking a horse is a slow process. You have to fully make each step a habit before moving on to the next step. When you are training the horse, each new concept you introduce needs to build off what you have just taught him. Remember, you want the horse to fully develop a habit because otherwise, he won't be fully trained.Never give up. Some steps may be easier than others for your horse. Breaking the horse is a big commitment.
End each lesson on a success. Even if it's just a little bit of progress, like the horse letting you get the halter near its face, always end on a good note.

, Never scream at the horse, hit him, throw things, or act aggressively. This could scare the horse and break any trust you have built. Talk to the horse in a calm, low tone.If the horse disobeys you, correct it in a calm manner without showing aggression. Try using a ""shh"" sound to let the horse know he is doing something wrong., Giving the horse positive reinforcement helps train the horse to do what you want. This includes giving him treats or stroking him. You can also use negative reinforcement. This includes a finger push or whip tap, if the horse isn't afraid of that. You can also try light lead, rein, or leg pressure.


Never use negative reinforcement as a frightening or painful motion. They should be consistent and steady, not abrupt. Continue holding the negative reinforcement move until the horse corrects himself. Stop immediately after the horse does the right thing., The first way to start halter training the horse is to get him used to having your hands near his head, ears, and neck. Do this slowly. Stay within the horse's eyesight so you don't startle him. Reach out slowly. If you reach out too fast, he may misinterpret your action. Continue doing this until you can touch the horse.


Make sure to give the horse verbal praise each time he improves. It might just be that your hand got closer to his face this time, or that he lets you touch him for a few seconds.
Reward the horse for each success by giving him treats.

, Start by letting the horse see and smell the halter in your hands. For the first few days, simply keep it near him and allow him to see and smell it and recognize that it is not dangerous. Then, start slowly placing the halter over the nose and onto the head. At first, you may want to leave it on without buckling. When the horse gets used to that, then you can buckle the halter behind the ears.


This may take multiple attempts. Be patient and calm, trying to make a little bit of progress each day.
Leave the halter on for a few days after you finally get it on.

, Start by introducing the bridle to the horse along with the halter. Rub the bridle all over the horse's face gently. Try to get the horse to open its mouth for the bit. Be very gentle.

, In addition to halter breaking the horse, you will also have to break the horse into using the bit. Slowly introduce the bit into the horses' mouth. At first, only do this for a few minutes. Slowly build up to having the bit in the mouth for longer.Adding a layer of molasses to the bit can help encourage the horse to put it in his mouth and make it more enjoyable., Once the bit is in the horse's mouth without the horse fighting you, put the ear pieces over the ears. Do not fasten the straps yet.


Gradually work your way up to fastening the straps. Remember to let the horse get used to the feel of the bridle on its head and ears.

, Longing, or training with a rope, lets you lead a horse around an arena as you train it. When longing, make sure to use the largest circle you can. Circles that are too small can hurt the horse's legs, ligaments, and tendons. Make sure your circle has a minimum diameter of 60 feet.


As you start training the horse to longe, don't do it longer than 10 minutes in each direction. Build the horse up for longer sessions, because long periods of longeing can put a lot of strain on a horse's body. Longing should take around 15 to 20 minutes total.

, Before attempting to mount the animal, it is important to gain its trust with ground breaking. Attach a lunge line to the horse's halter.

, If you hit the bit abruptly, you can make the horse uncomfortable. Making the horse's mouth uncomfortable or painful will make the horse fear longeing.


Move your body with your horse so that the longe line has a steady contact. The horse will eventually accept this contact and walk in a circle to maintain that contact instead of pushing and pulling away., Longeing a horse is the process of showing leadership through working them in an arena. Spend time at least once daily longeing your horse. Use your body language to direct and speed them up. Eventually, build up the speed and intensity of longeing, until they can do a full canter, all while listening to your cues.


You may want to have a second horse person stand behind you or otherwise near you as you longe, moving with you. Whenever your horse tries to turn inwards, have them walk towards it until it returns to its circle.
You should never touch your horse while longing; all cues should be given through changes in energy and body position, or with swinging the end of your longe line.
Longeing is a trust exercise; every time your horse does as you ask, break eye contact and release the pressure you're applying.

, Teach the horse to properly walk beside you while leading it with a lead rope. As the horse moves in the circle around you, you need to teach it voice commands. Introduce the horse to the words: ""halt,"" ""stand,"" ""walk,"" and ""back."" Make sure that you train the horse to understand ""halt"" and ""walk"" before doing anything else. Then, you can start introducing them to other faster commands, like ""trot.""


Try using ""wait"" instead of ""halt."" The words ""halt"" and ""trot"" can sound very similar, and might confuse some horses.""Woah"" should be reserved for riding, to tell the horse to slow under saddle.



, Horses will test you when you are lead training them. They may try to shoulder you out of their space to see who the leader is. You must assert that you are the leader. When the horse moves too close to you, place pressure on the horse's ribs about a foot behind the shoulder. This is where the lead horse in a herd would discipline the horse. The horse will move sideways and give you space.

, The horse should learn how to respond to pressure on the halter. Attach the lead rope to the halter. Stand to the near (left) side of the horse, standing parallel to it, looking straight (as it should be). Hold the lead a few inches below the clip. Pull the lead to the right, away from you, and the horse should eventually give in to it and turn its head to the right. Immediately release the pressure and use positive reinforcement.


Alternatively, stand on the right side of the horse. Pull the lead rope to the right to apply pressure. The horse should learn how to turn his head towards you from that command.
Repeat for turning left, doing the same things as for the right except pulling in the direction that you are.
Do the same thing for forward and backward by applying pressure on the halter in the correct direction.
The horse will learn to follow the pressure to release the pressure.

, A horse must become familiar with the weight and sound of a saddle on its back. Just like with a halter and bit, spend a few days getting the horse used to the sound of the saddle, how it smells, and how it looks.


After the horse is used to the sight of it, hold the saddle over the horse's back without touching., After the horse has gotten used to the saddle, place the saddle pad/blanket on the horse's back. Leave it on for just a few minutes. Then, if the horse responds well, take it off. Repeat several times. Do this on both sides so the horse gets used to you doing this from both sides.


If the horse becomes very frightened, more than is controllable, quickly remove the saddle pad/blanket and start again when it's less stressed.
Whether English or Western, if the horse's saddle fits less than perfectly, and you plan on showing it or otherwise want it to look 'prettier', you may want to introduce both, as a saddle blanket provides little comfort for the horse, but is available in pretty patterns and colors, while a saddle pad provides comfort (hence 'pad'), but is not as pretty. If the saddle fits perfectly, the saddle pad is optional.

, Slowly introduce the saddle onto the horse. Make sure to give the horse a lot of reassurance by talking to it and stroking it.Leave it on for a few minutes, then remove it. Do this from both sides of the horse.


Make sure you remove the stirrups and leathers while saddle breaking a horse.

, Do this very slowly. Tighten the girth little by little each day, especially if the horse seems skittish. If the horse seems too scared, stop and keep getting it acclimated to the tack.


When your horse allows the girth to be tightened all the way, lean gently on the horse's back.

, Next, longe with the saddle on and the stirrups down. This helps the horse get used to things by his sides and legs.Also start placing the leathers back onto the saddle.


Do this slowly. Only introduce one new element at a time. Let the horse lose his fear of the item before introducing him to something new., When the horse can wear the saddle for longer periods, start longeing around the arena with the saddle in place.

, Until this point, the horse has likely only seen you at or below eye level. Move the horse near a fence post crossing. Climb up on the post and stand at a height so that you are above the horse's head.

, Get an experienced rider to help you introduce the horse to the weight of a rider on its back. First, leg the rider up and get him to lie across the saddle. He needs to lower his weight on to the horse gently so you don't spook the horse.When the horse accepts this, stroke him and reward him.

, The rider should slowly and gently place his left foot in the stirrup. Keeping the weight on the horse's back, ask the rider to swing the right leg over the horse's back, making sure the rider doesn't kick the horse. Then the rider should place his foot in the right stirrup.Remind the rider to stay low as the sight of the rider on the horse's back will spook him. Get the rider to hold on tight to the saddle, but not to grip the reins tightly because if the rider is bucked off this will spook the horse even more.

, With the rider on his back, walk the horse around slowly, gradually moving further away from the animal.

Ask the rider to collect the reins and start making contact with the horse's mouth, gently as not to spook the horse. Get the rider to slowly ask the horse to walk on using the verbal command and a gentle squeeze., After having an experienced rider mount the horse, you need to mount the horse. Mounting your horse for the first time can be very dangerous, and should not be done without the supervision of a skilled horse-person or trainer. Carefully get on your horse, being sure not to kick or pinch him in the tack. Have the horse walk out for a few strides, stop, and dismount.


Slowly build up the time you are in the saddle over a period of several weeks or months. Do not attempt to increase the speed until your horse is 100% comfortable with you while walking.
It may take a full year or longer before you can trot and canter on your horse. Don't rush the process, as it could train your horse to be fearful or to have bad habits.

Work on riding transitions, such as asking your horse to increase or decrease speed of gait while being ridden.,
Ride your horse in figures (figure-8s, etc.).,
Get your horse on the bit and engaged.,
Ride your horse at a faster, more engaging gait.",How to Get Your Horse to Pay More Attention to You2," For example, going from a walk to a trot, a canter to a walk, or a trot to a halt. Transitions will make your horse pay more attention to when you ask him to stop or increase speed. He'll also need to focus a lot more because he'll need to balance himself. Make sure to always change the amount of strides you make per technique, otherwise your horse will anticipate. Practice these until the transitions are smooth and fluid., Ride many different figures so your horse will pay attention to what you're asking.

Figures to try with your horse: Circle, Diagonal, Half-Volte, Eight Figure, Serpentine, Shallow Loop, Down The Center Line.

, When riding on the bit your horse is searching for your hands, which means he is paying attention to what you are doing with your hands. That's why it is really important to be precise with your cues, because if you're always tugging or pulling your horse will become oblivious to them., If you ride really slow it'll be easy for your horse to zone out, but if you keep him in a faster pace, he will inherently have to pay more attention."

Practice on verbal cues and transitions.,
Change the direction in which you're lunging the horse.,
Try free lunging.",How to Get Your Horse to Pay More Attention to You3," By training your horse to transition by listening to your voice, he will have to pay attention to what you're saying.

By using many transitions, your horse won't be able to zone out.

, By changing the direction your horse will have to focus on turning around when you ask, and stay alert for when you do ask., Free lunging is basically the same as lunging, but without the ropes. This will make it easier for the horse to ignore you, but once you can get his attention during free lunging, you will be able to keep more of his attention during riding and normal lunging.

Make many transitions and change the horse's direction frequently. Use a whip as a help (don't hit your horse with it, you should try to hit the ground if you want to speed him up or hold it in front of him for him to reverse direction.)
Your body language is also really important. By having an open position, your horse will know he's not allowed to come near and it will keep him forward. By taking a closed position, your horse will come up to you and hopefully even follow you if you walk around.

Use a knotted rope halter or a traditional halter and lead.,
Attach the lead over your horse’s nose.,
Apply pressure to his face, nose, and head with the halter.,
Use the wand to stroke his neck and chest.,
Practice this command on the ground and in the saddle.",How to Get a Horse to Put Its Head Down2," You can also cue your horse’s head downward by applying pressure to his face, nose, or head with a halter. You can also use a traditional halter and lead to help him learn the head down command.Another option is to also use a wand or dressage whip to help him learn the head down command. You will not be using the halter, lead, or wand harshly. Instead, you will be using light pressure and stroking to teach your horse how to put his head down.

, Start on the ground, standing on the left side of your horse. You will be doing this training on the ground, standing slightly in front of your horse.Slide the snap on the lead through the lower side ring and cross it over the noseband. Then, loop it out the opposite side ring, moving away from your horse. Finish by clipping the lead to the top side ring so the knob of the snap faces outward.
Another option is to run the snap through the bottom left side ring and then clip the snap to the top ring on the same side. This may depend on the preference of your horse, as some horses respond more positively to the lead over their nose and some prefer the lead attached to the side of the halter.

, Your horse may respond by pulling away or throwing his head up. This is a natural response. Avoid pulling down on the halter or jerking at the halter. Simply wait and follow the motion of your horse’s head, while keeping the constant pressure on his halter. Eventually, your horse will lower his head to see what your response will be.


Once he lowers his head, immediately release his halter. This will be seen as a reward by him and he will start to learn this cue. Your horse may lower his head for a moment and then lift it up again. This is natural and fine at first. The more you practice this move, the longer he will lower his head.

, If your horse is not responding to pressure on his halter alone, you may try using the wand. Start by squatting in front and slightly to the side of your horse’s head. Take the wand in one hand and stroke down his neck, chest, and legs. As you do this, apply pressure to his halter.He should lower his head as he relaxes due to the stroking with the wand. Once he does this, release the pressure on his halter and slowly stand up. You want your horse to keep his head down as you rise up. If he does not do this, encourage him to stay down by pressing lightly on his halter.
If your horse loses his balance while he lowers his head, reposition him and start again. Repeat these actions until your horse responds to light pressure on his halter by lowering his head.

, Continue to practice this command on the ground. Over time, and with enough practice, your horse should also respond to this command when you are in the saddle.To practice this command in the saddle, reach forward with one hand when you are riding him and gently press his harness until he lowers his head.

"
"
Practice this method in an enclosed area.,
Apply pressure on the bit with one rein.,
Repeat the request.,
Get him to lower his head further.,
Test the command.",How to Get a Horse to Put Its Head Down3," You want to ensure your horse is focused and calm so use this method in an enclosed area, like a rounded pen. This way, you can control your horse’s movements when you are in the saddle and ensure he does not get distracted.You should also make sure your horse is saddled and standing still in a relaxed position. Because you will be directing his movements from the saddle, you may want to try this method with a horse who is comfortable with saddle riding and direction using his reins.

, Hold one rein in your hand and apply light pressure on the bit. Your horse should raise his head as a natural response. Continue to maintain light contact on the bit when he does this. Do not pull or tug hard on the rein. Simply hold it with slight pressure.To release the pressure on the rein, your horse will drop his head. Once he does this, reward him by releasing the rein pressure and stroking him on his neck and withers. You can also verbally reward him with a “Good job”.
Once you release the rein pressure, your horse will likely raise his head again. This is fine, as you will teach him to keep his head down with repetition and practice.

, Apply pressure to the rein again until he responds right away to your lifted rein by lowering his head half an inch. This indicates that he is starting to understand that applying pressure and releasing pressure on his rein means “put your head down”.Once he lowers his head, release the pressure and let him bring his head up. As soon as he raises his head, apply pressure on the rein again, releasing it only when he lowers his head again.
Repeat these steps several times until he leaves his head in the dropped position, even after you release the pressure on his rein. You may need to use verbal praise, small treats, or strokes between each attempt to reinforce the command.

, To get your horse to drop his head to lower levels, you can apply and release pressure on his reins. Start by getting him to drop his head by applying and then releasing pressure. Then, ask him to drop his head another half-inch by applying and releasing pressure again.Continue to do this until he drops his head further down. Work in one-half inch increments until his head is as low as you require. Every time he drops his head another notch, make sure you reward him with praise, a stroke, or a small treat.
If you are trying to get your horse to drop his nose close to the ground, you may have to work on this technique over a period of time. The last six inches from the ground are usually the most challenging. But with patience and practice, your horse should understand the command.

, Once you feel your horse has mastered the command, you should test his abilities. Do this by lifting the rein lightly. Your horse should actively pull his head down when you put pressure on the rein. This indicates he understands you want his head to go downward, not upward, when you put pressure on the bit.You can also practice this command using the opposite rein. Follow the same steps using the opposite rein until your horse feels comfortable doing the command no matter which rein you use.

Before riding, always make sure your horse is groomed and properly outfitted (saddle, blanket, bridle, et cetera).,
As soon as you get on your horse, have your horse stand still for at least 10 seconds.",How to Familiarize Yourself With Horse Training," Because horses are such big animals, you aren't going to be able to overpower them. Instead, you'll have to outsmart them. This is not to say that horses are dumb, just that humans can be trickier. Outsmarting a horse means making the horse enjoy what he or she is doing even if it just refused to do that very thing a minute before. To accomplish this, you will need to do something like present your task in a different way so the horse doesn't really think that he or she is working or about to face something unpleasant. Let's say your horse is refusing to rein left and balking whenever you ask her to. To get around this difficulty, make it more interesting by using positive reinforcement (instead of yelling or using a crop). To take another example, when you want to fit a halter on to a horse, carry it behind your shoulder. This way, the horse probably won't see the halter until it is too late.;
, This is essential for owning or training a horse. You need to be extremely aware and use your ""horse sense"" at all times.


Make sure you never shout around a horse. Just as anyone would be spooked or jarred by a sudden, loud noise, a horse is also sensitive to such outbursts and change in the tone of your voice. You want your horse to feel as calm and secure as possible when training it. Otherwise, it might jump or sidestep.
Take care of your own safety before your horse's. Even if you really love your horse, you need to face the fact that people are more important.
Avoid looping the lead rope around your hand or wrist at all times. If your horse gets spooked and runs, you could very well be dragged along by the lead rope and risk great injury.
Alert your horse as to where you are, especially if you are walking behind it. Connection and careful communication with your horse is key!

, Horses need to trust you. Because they are animals of prey, they can instinctively and easily move into fight-or-flight behavior. Your horse should not feel threatened by you, but rather safe at all times. With the exception of stallions, a horse's preference is to take flight. If that is not an option, then it might very well fight.

, When entering the horse's field of vision, do so smoothly and slowly, talking or making soothing clicking noises to alert him or her that you are advancing. When entering the horse's field of vision, enter smoothly and slowly, talking or making soothing clicking noises to alert him that you are advancing toward him.

, Solid and steady respect from your horse is an important requirement for successful training. Without respect you might get kicked, and your horse might get abused if you do not respect them at times.

, Let's say that you're trying to teach your horse to back up; keep tugging lightly on the reins until the horse backs. Do this every single time you're introducing a horse to a something new. This way, the horse will begin to understand what you are asking for and will respond more quickly between commands.

, When putting on a bridle, try not to shove the bit into the horse's mouth, and try not to bend the horse's ears too much.

, You also need to be correctly outfitted (helmet, riding boots, et cetera). If you or your horse aren't outfitted accurately, either of you may be hurt seriously.

, In the long run, this should keep your horse from trotting off while you're still settling into the saddle.


While your horse is standing, bring his head around to your knee (both sides). When horses do this, they can't run off, and if they try to then they'll just run in circles and then stop.

Get your horse warmed up and ready to ride.,
Place a single trot pole in the center of the ring or riding area, parallel to the long side.

,
Practice a lot of figure eights at the trot.,
Do a lot of bending exercises.,
Warm your horse up with a canter or two both ways.,
Determine your horse's stronger lead.,
Ride to the right, canter a circle, then do a figure eight.,
After a few time of trotting 5 to 6 strides before the pole, make the simple change in three to four strides, then again once it gets the feel of that, decrease it to one or two strides.,
Keep practicing until the horse is comfortable with this.,
Canter around the ring with a strong, collected canter.

,
Ride across the diagonal of the arena.

,
Keep your inside leg pressed gently to the girth and your outside leg pressed gently just behind the girth.

,
Cross the pole or centre line and swap the positions of your legs, so that your new inside leg is on the girth and your new outside leg is behind the girth.

,
Bend your horse gently through its entire body, not just the shoulder, while keeping the canter in a controlled and steady pace.

,
Keep your hands gentle throughout the transition and allow your horse to stretch through its back.,
Continue the canter through the corner regardless of the lead.,
If the horse doesn't get it when you go over the pole, bring it back to a trot, then ask for a canter on the correct lead, then circle over the pole with the correct lead.",How to Do a Flying Lead Change,";
,, Some horses are not always trained to do flying lead changes. To train the horse, start by doing figure eights; canter one circle, slow down in the center to a walk, then go the other direction at the canter. Doing this helps the horse figure out that it is to switch leads when given a certain signal.

, For example, spiraling in at the trot, 5 meter circles, etc.

, Ask it to change direction normally (at a walk or trot).

, For the purpose of clarity in this explanation, the article will say the horse's stronger lead is its left.

, About 5 to 6 strides before the pole in the center, bring your horse down to trot, then once it trots over the pole, bend it to the left, push its haunches in with your inside (right) leg, then ask for a canter on the left lead. This is a simple lead change.

, You want your horse to be strong with simple lead changes in one or two trot steps, before you attempt a flying change.

, Once your horse is strong with simple changes with one or two trot steps, you can move on to flying changes. Similar to when you do a simple change, in a flying lead change you want to ask your horse to switch its leads over the pole.

,,,,,, Younger horses especially may have difficulty with this if they hollow their backs.

, If the horse did not change its canter lead, return to the trot at either A or C and begin again on the next long diagonal.


The most common reason a flying change will fail is because the horse will misinterpret the aids as an invitation to increase the speed rather than an aid to keep the horse balanced into the hand.

,


Once your horse is 99 percent correct with its flying changes over the pole, remove the pole.
When the horse gets the change, continue to canter for a few seconds, then bring it down to a walk and give it its head (for praise).

Look locally.,
Consider leasing.,
Confirmation Matters.,
Ride the horse on the pattern before you buy.",How to Find and Train a Barrel Horse1," Don't look for barrel horse breeders, as they probably won't be in your area and will probably be too expensive. Go to your local tack shop, 4-h club, or ask your instructor if they have any suggestions on where to look.;
, If you don't have time to commit to the responsibilities of owning a horse, ask your instructor if you can lease one of his/her horses, or look locally for a horse for lease.

, Once you have found a horse that appears to have athletic ability, take a hard look at his confirmation. Some rules of the thumb are: the hind legs should appear larger than the front end, the top line should be shorter than the underline, the cannon bones should be shorter than the forearm/gaskin, and the stifle should be wider than the hip.

, Walk it first, then trot, then lope. If the horse bucks when he turns the barrel, don't buy. If the horse tries taking off to run the pattern full speed, don't buy. You want a horse with little to no experience on the pattern, but is still willing to do it and to listen to your speed request. If all goes well, proceed with a vet check. If the horse passes as sound, buy the horse. If he is lame, don't buy.

"
"
Take training slow.,
Develop an every day routine.,
Don't train with every ride.,
Don't gallop when he wants to gallop.",How to Find and Train a Barrel Horse2," This may sound odd because you're training a barrel horse, but it is better to take things at a slow pace and not rushing it. When you see a horse that is rearing before they run or fights a bit when they see a pattern, that's because they were rushed on the pattern and think that it's the only thing that matters when they see a barrel is to win.

, When you run barrels, warm up a lot. Lope around the arena a lot, switch directions, do roll backs, and let the horse know you are always in control, while having soft hands. Walk the pattern one time, then turn him and make him face the pattern until he drops his head. Once he does, trot the pattern, then stop and do the same as before. Then lope it a few times, and after each run make him turn, face the pattern until he drops his head. Then, walk the pattern one more time and leave the arena.

, Don't let your horse think that once he's saddled up it's time to run. It's good to let him do other things. Play with him in pasture, go on a trail ride, or even mess with cows. Another thing that can ruin a barrel horse's mindset, is when it thinks it's only job is barrel racing.

, This is where things go wrong. After continuing your training routine for about a year, your horse may start fighting and wanting to go fast. Don't let him. When he does this, it means he's close to being a well controlled, lightning fast barrel horse, but wait until YOU want him to. Usually, he will carry this behavior for a while, from maybe a few weeks to a couple months. But once he's back to normal and is being very responsive on the pattern, it's time to let him go. If he ends up acting crazy once you start galloping him, take it back to square one.

If your boyfriend is becoming obsessive, however, it's important the issue be addressed. Let your boyfriend know you want to talk. Make sure to pick a time and place that will help a conversation run smoothly.If possible, choose a neutral setting. You don't want anyone to feel they have the home team advantage. A quiet coffee shop may be a good place to talk.
Choose a time free of outside constraints. If your boyfriend attends a ceramics class Wednesday nights, do not ask him to talk an hour before the class starts. Choose a day of the week when neither of you have plans or commitments. A Saturday afternoon may work.;
, Going into the conversation, you should get a sense of what you want to communicate. It may help to jot down your thoughts or talk them over with a friend or family member. Have a few sentences ready to go that best express your frustrations and concerns.Do not over plan, however. Leave some room for flexibility. If you write down everything you want to say word-per-word, you risk sounding scripted. This may also disrupt the natural flow of the conversation, as you may have strict expectations and become frustrated when they are not met.
Plan a few sentences that express what you need to express. However, go into the conversation without strict expectations. You do not need to plan a monologue. You can also try practicing what you want to say while looking into a mirror.

, It's vital to set boundaries when dealing with an obsessive boyfriend. Lay out, with no uncertainty, what behaviors you feel are inappropriate. You boyfriend needs to know where the lines are in the relationship. Behaviors that make you feel unsafe are especially important to address. Make it clear to your boyfriend you will not stay in a relationship where you are habitually made to feel unsafe.Behaviors that make you feel frightened or uncomfortable are not okay in a romantic relationship. Let your partner know that, while you understand he has issues with trust or jealousy, he needs to find appropriate means to express these issues.
Figure out what behaviors bother you, and tell him they are no longer acceptable. For example, your boyfriend may raise his voice and accuse you of infidelity when you get home late. Say something to him like, ""I understand it makes you nervous when I'm out late with my friends. It's okay to feel what you're feeling, but you cannot raise your voice to me and throw around accusations. That is not appropriate and I'm not going to tolerate it.""
Keep in mind that obsessive behavior is often present along with other abusive behavior patterns.

, ""I""-statements are statements phrased in a way that minimizes blame. When you use an ""I""-statement, you focus primarily on your own feelings, and how a person's behavior affects your feelings. Rather than saying a behavior is objectively right or wrong, you're telling someone how that behavior affects you on a personal and subjective level.An ""I""-statement has three parts. It begins with ""I feel,"" after which you immediately state your emotion. Then, you explain the behavior that led to that emotion. Lastly, you say why you feel the way you do.
Without ""I""-statements, certain sentiments can sound accusatory. For example, you may be inclined to say something like, ""You make me feel like I'm doing something wrong when I go out with my friends. I don't like the guilt trips and I'm entitled to my own social life.""
You can rephrase the above sentiment using an ""I""-statement. Try something like, ""I feel guilty when you get mad at me for going out with my friends and I don't like the idea that I can't have a social life independent of you.""

, After the discussion, make plans to move forward. Talk to your boyfriend about how to proceed with the relationship in the future. Work on setting new boundaries that respect both you and your boyfriend's emotional needs.


Be willing to compromise in areas that don't violate your needs. For example, you could agree to allow your boyfriend to accompany you to certain social events if it doesn't bother you.
Encourage your boyfriend to take steps to be a better partner himself. You could ask him to seek the help of a therapist to work on his obsessive thought patterns. You could also ask him to stop pressing you for information about where you're going and who you're with.

, Empathy, or at least some understanding, can help a conversation run smoothly. Think about what your boyfriend may want from you, and what you're willing to give. What expectations does he have that feel like reasonable requests? Where do you need him to meet you halfway?Recognize what you're not willing to give. You should never give in to a request that violates your sense of integrity and security. If something makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, your boyfriend needs to cease that behavior. For example, while you can agree to be more vigilant about answering texts, your boyfriend needs to understand it is not appropriate for him to call you repetitively when you are at work or social events.
However, there may be some things you can do to help assuage your boyfriend's worries. Maybe your boyfriend feels insecure. He may have been cheated on before, or have a history of bad relationships. If this is the case, he may want you to check in more frequently, to return his texts quicker, and to allow him to occasionally accompany you to events and parties.

, Obsession can be a sign of an emotionally abusive relationship. Emotional abuse can be as damaging as physical abuse. If you are in an emotionally abusive relationship, it's important that you recognize as much and take steps to get out. The following are common signs that a relationship has become abusive:Your boyfriend monitors what you are doing. He needs to know where you are at all times. He may ask to read your texts, email, or messages on social media.
Your boyfriend frequently loses his temper, and may yell at you, curse at you, or call you names.
Your boyfriend may discourage you from seeing friends or family members. If you take him out with you, he may do things to embarrass you in front of others.
He may control how you spend your money.
He may threaten to hurt people you care about or your pets.

, If your emotional needs are being violated by a controlling boyfriend, it's important to recognize as much. You should never sacrifice your own sense of fulfillment and happiness for the sake of a relationship.Are you able to feel fulfilled on your own in this relationship? Does your boyfriend allow you to pursue things like a career or a social life? Have you given up anything essential to your own happiness to be with this person?
If you feel like your boyfriend's obsessive behavior is making you lose your sense of self, you need to address this. Obsessive boyfriends, especially those who cross the line to emotional abuse, will push back. Do not be intimidated. Practice firmly saying ""No"" and asserting your own needs. For example, ""I am going to happy hour after work. I like socializing with my coworkers and I don't need to justify that to you.""

, Obsessive boyfriends, particularly those that are emotionally abusive, want their partners all to themselves. If your boyfriend is limiting your contact with others, this is not a healthy relationship.Does your boyfriend not like you to be on the phone or Facebook when he's around? Does he denigrate your personal relationships? Does he try to exert control over who you do and do not see?
Your boyfriend may try to make it sound like he has your best interests at heart when trying to limit your contact with others. For example, he may say things like, ""I'm not sure Alyssa is an appropriate friend for you. She's really wild, and I feel like she'll get you in trouble. I don't know that she really cares about you.""
In a loving and healthy relationship, partners support one another's friendships. Your boyfriend should want you to have positive relationships with a variety of people outside your romantic relationship.

, Your boyfriend may be obsessive because he has little going on outside of the relationship. As you evaluate the relationship, look into your boyfriend's personal life. Is he able to maintain healthy relationships with friends and family members? If not, you may be better off without this person.Your boyfriend may have little going on outside of you. He may rely on you for social contact and support. In a new relationship, it's normal to spend a lot of time together. You may not see your friends as frequently during the first few months of a romantic relationship. However, if your boyfriend expects this intense level of contact longer than a few months, it may be a bad sign.
Your boyfriend may try to romanticize this attachment. He may say things like, ""You're my everything"" or ""You're my world."" While such statements sound sweet and romantic, they are not necessarily healthy or sustainable longterm. If you truly are your boyfriend's whole world, this is unhealthy obsessive behavior that needs addressing.

, Many obsessive and jealous people have had difficulties with relationships in the past. Your boyfriend may be bringing issues from the past into his present relationship. Ask him if he's been hurt in the past, and if there's anything you can do to help him move forward.Ask your boyfriend what his home life was like growing up. If there was a lot of instability in his household, he may seek stability in a romantic relationship.
Ask about past relationships. If your boyfriend was with someone who cheated on him or abandoned him in the past, this may be driving his future obsession.
Remember, while your boyfriend's past can help you have more empathy, it does not justify his behavior. Make it clear that, while you understand where he's coming from, he needs to change his behavior. Say something like, ""I get that your father abandoned you as a child, but you need to accept I'm not your father and our relationship is different. Your abandonment issues are really damaging to me and to our relationship.""

, Once you've evaluated the relationship, and had a frank talk with your boyfriend, you need to take some of your power back. Do not make decisions out of fear of your boyfriend's reaction. Decide what you need to do for yourself and your own sense of fulfillment.Reassert your boundaries when necessary. If your boyfriend gives you a hard time about answering a text in front him, say something like, ""We talked about this. It's important I have my space and you need to respect that.""
Be ready to walk away from the relationship if things don't change. In cases of emotional abuse especially, it's important to get away from the situation.

, If you've concluded the relationship is emotionally abusive, end it. It's very important you not subject yourself to more bad treatment, and it's unlikely an abusive partner will ever change. Periods of normal behavior, in which your partner compromises and treats you well, are cyclical. Eventually, the abuse will occur again and periods of normalcy tend to get shorter as time goes by., If you end an obsessive or abusive relationship, it's normal to suffer feelings of low self worth in the aftermath. A good way to counteract such negative thoughts is through seeking out people who value you as a person. Seek the support of friends and family members who care about you and want to see you successful and happy.Find your most supportive friends. Connect with people who are positive and care about who you are.
Have people you can share your passions with. If you're a writer, for example, host a small workshop with your friends where you share one another's work. It's important, in the aftermath of an obsessive relationship, to be around people who support you and want you to succeed.

, Whether or not you choose to stay with your boyfriend, it's important you seek the help of a therapist. Individual counseling or couple's counseling can help you sort through relationship issues and learn coping techniques.


You can find a therapist through your insurance or you can get a referral from your existing doctor. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.

This makes normal, friendly interactions you have with other women seem like grave dangers for the relationship. In extreme cases, this can even extend to your family members and mutual friends.



Example: You and your girlfriend are enjoying a pleasant lunch at the local cafe. When you finish, your waitress brings you the check. The bill is only $14, but you're feeling generous, so you give her a $20 and tell her to keep the change. She thanks you graciously and leaves. In the car, your girlfriend turns to you and spits, ""What was that all about?"" You ask her ""what?"", but she won't answer and stays silent for the whole ride.;
, A jealous girlfriend won't trust you to behave when you're not under her supervision. When she can't chaperone you directly, she will often try to keep track of what you're doing from afar. She may get upset or angry if you can't (or won't) give her an exact record of your whereabouts.



Example: You and your friends are excited to enjoy a well-earned night out. Your plan is to meet up at your house before going to a movie. The night is a strictly ""guys only"" affair. While you're waiting for your friends to show up, you get several inquiring texts from your girlfriend asking about your plans. You field these for a while, but eventually turn off your phone for the movie. As you're leaving the theater, you switch it back on to find a string of frantic texts and missed calls asking about what you're up to. Your girlfriend is furious the rest of the night and gives you the cold shoulder the next time you see her.

, Jealous girlfriends may suffer from irrational fears that their boyfriend is being tempted by the other women in his life. Their desire to uncover the ""truth"" can lead them to ask or suggest things that aren't usually appropriate for casual conversation. These can have to do with the other woman's relationship status, her sex life, the nature of her relationship with the boyfriend, and so on.



Example: You have a (strictly platonic) female friend that you've been close to since kindergarten. However, you haven't seen her for a year because she has been in a study abroad program. The day after she gets back, you meet for lunch to discuss her adventures. Later that day, when you meet with your girlfriend, she asks you questions that make you a little uncomfortable: ""So did she get with any foreign men? Did she come on to you? What was she dressed like?""

, Jealousy can make romantic partners stop respecting each others' privacy. Trust, which is the foundation of a strong relationship, gets set aside in favor of petty suspicions. If you uncover evidence that your girlfriend has been going through your possessions or your correspondences with other people, jealousy may be the cause.



Example: When she's at your house, your girlfriend asks to use your computer for a few minutes. You don't think anything of it until a few days later, when a friend asks you, ""Why didn't you reply to my message?"" You log into your social media profile to discover that several new messages are marked as ""read."" When you ask your girlfriend, she gets defensive and refuses to talk about it.

, It's very difficult to be consumed with jealousy and not show any sort of external sign. Most people who are jealous of their significant other will gain a certain hard-to-define tenseness around them. Conversations may seem ""forced"" and happy emotions may seem somehow fake. Fights and petty arguments may become more common.



Example: Ever since you went to your best friend's bachelor party, your girlfriend has been acting a little strange. You can't quite put your finger on it, but it seems like she's got something worrying on her mind that she won't acknowledge, even when you're having a good time together. When you ask her about it, it seems like you always end up getting into a fight about something unrelated.

, The way you feel can also tell you about the state of your relationship. Do you feel slightly anxious when you're around your girlfriend? Does part of you dread your meetings with her? Do your favorite activities and date ideas not seem to lead to the same sorts of happy emotions that they used to? There are many things that can lead you to answer ""yes"" to one of these questions, but if you've noticed some of the things above as well, jealousy may be the root cause.



Example: You can't lie to yourself. You're a little worried about the road trip you're set to take with your girlfriend over the weekend. It's not that you're not excited to see Mount Rushmore — in truth, it's that your girlfriend's behavior has left you feeling on-edge lately. The idea of having yet another argument makes you feel emotionally drained and it hasn't even happened yet.

, Left unchecked, jealousy can ruin a relationship, so you won't want to waste time talking about it. Find a peaceful, quiet place to talk, like a bedroom or a secluded spot at a local park. Acknowledge your fears directly. Listen carefully and courteously to her replies before continuing with your own thoughts. Do your absolute best to stay calm and considerate.


You might start the conversation by saying something like, ""Lately, I've gotten the feeling that there's some tension in our relationship. Do you feel the same way?"" If she doesn't bring up the topic of jealousy herself, you might follow up with something like, ""Do you feel that I'm earning your trust as a partner?"" Shift the focus off of her and onto the relationship itself to keep strong personal emotions in check.
Being delicate is important here. Saying things that sound like accusations can hamstring your chances for working your problems out. For example, if you start by saying ""So, why are you jealous of me?"" you're immediately putting your girlfriend on the defensive and setting yourself up for an argument.

, While you will want to stay considerate of your girlfriend's feelings, you shouldn't ""leave anything on the table"" when you discuss your relationship problems. Being open about your fears and concerns encourages her to do the same. In addition, if she can tell that you're not telling her something that's bothering you, she may think that you're hiding something.

, The rest of this article assumes that your girlfriend's jealousy is unwarranted. However, even if you've been completely faithful, you may unknowingly be doing things to cast suspicion on yourself. Below are just a few ways to avoid putting unnecessary strain on your relationship:Don't compare your girlfriend to other women, especially in terms of looks. Many women feel pressured to be gorgeous all the time and will feel hurt if you point out ways that someone else is more attractive.
Limit your displays of affection to other women. Friendly conversation is fine, but flirting is not.
Limit your ""crushes"" on celebrities, models, etc. Appreciating someone's beauty on an objective level is fine, but constantly harping on it or plastering your house with their image is a bad idea.
Don't talk about how you'd like your girlfriend to change aspects of herself. See below for more on this.

, Everyone has flaws. This includes your girlfriend and yourself. People are capable of change, but only gradually and with lots of conscious effort. Most of your girlfriend's flaws will be still be there in a few years — same as yours. Your girlfriend wants a partner who will accept these flaws as part of a greater person, not someone who secretly wishes to be with someone else. Assume that the core of your girlfriend's personality will not change much in the near future. If you truly accept this, she will know (and appreciate it).


Keep in mind that her jealousy is one of these sorts of flaws that are unlikely to change soon. You can certainly work with her to assuage her fears and minimize her jealous tendencies, but on some level she will probably always be a little jealous.

, There's no easy way to say this. If your girlfriend shows no sign of at least trying to keep her jealousy under control and that jealousy makes your relationship a tense, unhappy one, it may be time to call it quits. You never need to stay in a relationship that makes both of you feel worse.


Breaking up with someone is never easy. While strong emotions are basically inevitable, there are a few things you can do to make the process smoother. See our article on the subject for step-by-step help.

How you want to word your disorder is up to you, but it is important to disclose your problems. You may want to be upfront and let them know on or before your first date, or you may want to wait a couple of dates. The timing is ultimately up to you, but you do need to bring it up.At first try to keep things simple. Just say, “I have a sensitive stomach, so I need to watch what I eat.”
If you fell like you must go into more detail, say, “I have IBS and need quick access to a bathroom.”;
, If you tell your date about your disorder, they may try to be overly-cautious by asking, “Are you okay? Are you sure? Should you be eating that?” When telling a date about your disorder, be clear about what kind of support you want or need.Say, “My stomach does bother me at times, but don’t feel responsible for me. I can take care of myself.”
If you need to make a request, say so simply. For example, say, “I’d like to have a seat near the aisle so I can leave easily if I need to use the bathroom.”

, Some people choose to isolate themselves or not date due to their digestive disorder. Recognize that your disorder is nothing to be ashamed of and doesn’t make you any less worthy of finding a great partner. You might feel embarrassed about your symptoms, but they don’t define who you are.Stand confidently in your disorder and let your date know that it’s part of your life but it doesn’t define who you are.


For example, say, “My disorder makes my life a bit harder, but I’m determined to live a great life even though I experience digestive problems.”
Many people will be sympathetic to your symptoms. Even if you pass gas loudly, it’s unlikely to make someone close the book on dating you.
Look online for tips or videos on dealing with your specific disorder. If you have difficulty explaining your condition you might even consider showing a video to your date at some point to help them understand your condition and how you deal with it.

, If you want to avoid any potential problems or uncomfortable exchanges, suggest date activities that are non-food related. Go bowling, watch a movie, or go ice skating. Especially if you’re meeting for a first date, choose an activity that doesn’t revolve around eating.


Consider not including food or drinks early on in your dating relationship. Keep the focus on getting to know one another, not on managing your disorder.

, If you’re planning an activity, schedule your date after dinner or at a time that isn’t a typical mealtime. Eat before you meet up. When choosing your clothes, wear something that is comfortable that won’t irritate your stomach or other sensitive parts. If you take medication, make sure you’ve done so beforehand.


Don’t eat any risky foods earlier on in the day. You want to feel good going into the date.

, Stress can often worsen your symptoms, so make sure you feel comfortable and relaxed before your dates.Dealing with your stress on a daily basis can improve your physical and emotional health. Try activities such as yoga, meditation, or guided breathing techniques on a daily basis to help lower your overall stress levels and improve your mood.If you’re having a flare-up, do some relaxation at home. For example, instead of going to a yoga class, do some yoga at home instead.

Power naps may also help if your stress is related to not getting enough sleep.
If you struggle to manage your stress and your digestion suffers as a result, consider talking to a therapist and practicing coping strategies to deal with stress on a regular basis.

, Have an emergency kit ready for any potential problems. For example, carry some medications that can help you out in a pinch. If you struggle with incontinence, carry wipes and a change of clothes if necessary. While you may feel embarrassed to carry these items, it’s best to come prepared to avoid more embarrassment.Having an emergency kit with you can make you feel more confident on your date since you know you can handle anything that might come up.
Carry a backpack with you that has all necessary items. You don’t need to explain why you carry these things around to your date.

, During the date, focus on having fun and getting to know the person. If you’re concerned about your digestive disorder or having a flare-up, try to relax as much as possible and deal with it only if it happens. Be open and show who you are outside of having a digestive disorder. Put your attention to having a good time and finding similarities with your date.Ask questions and get to know the person. Be open and share your own experiences and perspectives.

, Be proactive in anticipating potential problems with food while on a date. For example, bring some food or snacks with you when you go on activities and offer to share. That way, you won’t have to rely on potentially harmful food while out catching a baseball game or movie.Know what restaurants you can safely eat at or what activities may cater to your needs. Write a list of activities that you enjoy that a potential date may also enjoy. Then, choose one and invite a date to join you.

, If you do choose to go out to eat, suggest a restaurant you know you can eat comfortably at. Especially if it’s a first date, you want to feel comfortable and not worry about your stomach. Choose a restaurant that you’ve been to already or know is responsive to special orders.You may want to check the restaurant out or research it online before you go on a date to make sure it will accommodate your needs.

, Know what foods specifically trigger your symptoms, and stay clear of them. Get to know what foods you react to and find some alternative options.Find restaurants that offer menu items you feel comfortable eating that won’t cause distress.


Some foods that may trigger reactions include grains, dairy, alcohol, sugar, and legumes.
For example, if you know dairy sets off your symptoms yet your date wants to go get ice cream, suggest a place that has alternative options like dairy-free or sorbet.

, If you’re out to eat and your problems start to bother you, find a place to enjoy a soothing tea. This can be a way for you to relieve some pain and also keep the date going. Look for teas that can help soothe digestion. For example, chai tea has a blend of herbs and other medicinals that can help soothe the stomach.Green tea can also help with digestion problems.If you’re in a pinch and need a little relief, look to herbal teas to help calm your stomach.


Stash some tea bags in your purse or wallet so that you can drink a tea when you’re out. Just add hot water.

, If you’re feeling comfortable with your date, invite them over for dinner at your place. This way, you can show them how to cook foods that you can eat. You can also anticipate feeling well and not fearing unpleasant reactions.Make sure you feel safe having the person over to your house and knowing your address.

Examine your horse or have a vet examine them.,
Determine the amount of exercise your horse is currently getting.,
Take your horse’s heart rate.,
Set a conditioning schedule.",How to Condition Your Horse1," Determine your horse's current weight and physical condition. If they are severely underweight or limping, you don't need to be giving them tremendous  amounts of exercise. It's best to care for them until they recover rather than rush the process and try to ride him now.


Keep in mind that a horse under 3 years old is almost never ready to be put under a hard workout or conditioning schedule - it's too stressful for them, and you can harm them by doing so. Stick to light riding for young horses.
Horses in their late 20’s will need special conditioning as well, as their age makes them more likely to become injured or overworked quickly.;
, Before you can begin making changes to your horse’s exercise routine, you must first figure out the amount they workout at this point in time. Is your horse stalled for most of the day/night or winter, or do they have a large paddock to run around in? How frequently are they ridden, and for how long? What is the highest level of work they’ve done with you recently?

, In order to determine the amount of physical increase that can be performed, you need to know your horse’s heart rate. Hold a stethoscope to the chest or shoulder of your horse, and count the number of beats you hear in one minute. A healthy horse will have a resting heart rate of 35-42 beats per minute. Then, have your horse perform some moderate exercise and allow them to cool down for 10-15 minutes. Take their heart rate again.


A healthy horse will have their heart rate return to 35-42 BPM after only 10-15 minutes. If this is the case, they are able to increase in their physical activity.
If your horse’s heart rate has not returned to normal after a 15 minute rest, the amount of physical activity they perform should be increased very slowly and over a long period of time., To start, you should not be conditioning your horse more than three days a week - especially if your horse has been out of shape for several months. In off time, leave your horse out to pasture, preferably with another horse. They’ll get even more exercise naturally that way, with no work on your part. After about six weeks - the amount of time it takes to regain basic cardiovascular and ligament strength - you can begin increasing the difficulty of the work."
"
Warm your horse up.,
Trot the horse.,
Ride up and down hills at a walk.,
Lope or Canter circles.,
Cool down after each conditioning session.,
Slowly increase the difficulty.,
Take adequate breaks from work.",How to Condition Your Horse2," In order to prevent injury after such a long period of time off work, you must always warm up your horse prior to heavy exercise. Walk your horse around for five minutes, followed by a bit of light posting trot. This will help to increase heart and respiration rate without putting their ligaments and muscles (the parts most likely to become damaged) at risk.


If your horse is too out of shape to be put under tack yet, you can longe them for 10 minutes or so at differing speeds.

, Trotting, or hacking, is very helpful in getting any horse into shape. Western or English, gaited or stock, a horse can build endurance and stamina by trotting. Start out at a brisk trot (extended trot) for about 2-5 minutes straight. Stop your horse. Is he winded? You can tell if a horse is winded or out of breath by feeling with your legs. If they are rapidly heaving in and out, then walk the horse forwards or in a circle and wait until his breathing returns to a normal rate.


Once the horse has recovered, trot him again for a couple of minutes. Let this go on for about 45 minutes to an hour of stopping, walking and starting again.
Over a couple of months, you will increase the time you spend trotting by a few minutes here and there (assuming your horse is ready for it), and continue trotting for longer periods of time.

, This will condition both the muscles in the hindquarters and many other muscles the horse doesn't use often. It is very important that you maintain a walk. A horse that is trotting or jogging up hills will not build as much muscle, though most horses prefer to move quickly up hills and avoid straining their muscles. You might have to hold them back a little.


Steep, short hills are best for building muscle, but you can go much farther on a hill that slowly inclines. If you find a tall, steep hill then go a quarter mile or so up the hill, turn around, and go back down.
When going up a steep hill, never heave back on the reins or use them to keep your balance. This could cause the horse to lose his balance. Lean far forward in the saddle when going up a hill, with your feet back a little, sit deep in the saddle, and tip your feet slightly forward going down a hill.
Stop every 10-15 minutes to check your horse’s pulse and respiration. If both are very high, give your horse a few minutes to cool down before continuing. Don’t do this for longer than an hour at a time.

, Loping circles is a good way to condition a horse; it will help them make quicker turns and will build stamina. Some horses take a while to catch on to loping circles and may require training to be able to lope a good circle. You may want to begin by walking the circle, since this gives you a chance to establish the size of your circle. Start out with a large circle. Move up to a trot. Once your horse is comfortable trotting a circle, you can move up to a slow, steady lope.


Once your horse can lope a good circle (keep in mind it can take a few training sessions for them to learn this), you can increase the amount of time they can maintain a lope.
A horse can't keep a lope or gallop for more than 1–3 miles (1.6–4.8 km), so don't push too hard with this exercise.
Make sure and work the horse on circles going in both directions, so that they don’t become one-sided.

, The same concept as warming up, cooling down lets the horse slowly return its heart and respiratory rates back to normal. This also helps it to literally cool down, as their sweat begins to evaporate. Cool down by walking along level ground for 5-10 minutes after your workout., After several weeks performing each individual exercise or task, you can increase the difficulty of the workout. Your options are threefold: choose to increase the duration of your workout, the speed at which it is performed, or the distance you go. Increasing two or more of these simultaneously puts your horse at risk for constant fatigue and physical injury.

, Equally as important as conditioning regularly is taking enough time off from work. Working your horse too hard is a recipe for disaster; there are several very dangerous ailments (azoturia, tying-up, thumps, etc.) that can arise when a horse is overworked. For the first 2-3 months, work should consist of 3-4 days on, and 1-2 days off.

Check social media for clues
Recall if you've seen them out with anybody;
, There was a reason (or reasons) why you rejected them in the first place. It can be easy to ignore these issues if you haven't seen them for a while, or if you're just feeling lonely. But it is really important to acknowledge the concerns you had before, and determine if you can overcome them. Otherwise, you are likely to hurt them again.Did you find them unattractive or annoying? If so, has this changed?
Did they hurt you or lose your trust? If so, will you be able to get past it?
Were you simply incompatible? If so, do you think you'll be able to compromise and find balance?

, If you are still in touch with this person, try to assess how they feel about you. This can help you determine whether or not it's worth it to put yourself out there. Spend some time objectively evaluating how they act when you're around. You might also ask for the opinion of a close friend.Negative signs include: changing their phone number, not responding to your texts, avoiding you.
Positive signs include: lighting up when you come into the room, making time for you when you ask, standing close to you when you're out with friends.

, If you previously rejected this person, you are approaching the situation at a bit of a disadvantage. (They may still have hurt feelings, and this can affect their attraction toward you.) You can compensate for this by making some self-improvements! First, brainstorm some ways to make yourself more desirable.Some ideas include:

Changing or improving your look
Getting more in touch with your emotions
Making a positive career move
Improving your living space

, Try to think about how you can be more attractive to this person, and choose that method for improving your life. Once you've settled on a goal, break that goal down into manageable steps. Set deadlines for each step.If you are trying to look better, break this down into different parts. Make a plan to have your hair done. Ask a stylist friend to help you pick out some new clothes. Join a gym.
If you'd like to be more in touch with your emotions, schedule some time each day to reflect on how you feel. Start a gratitude journal. Speak with a close friend, family member, or therapist.
If you'd like to improve your living space, start by cleaning your space and clearing out clutter. Then move on to organizing your things and adding some decorative pieces.

, After you have a plan in place, you have to start making changes. This is the most difficult (but most rewarding) part of self-improvement. Just focus on each small step at a time, and try not to be overwhelmed by the big picture. As you continue to improve your life, you will become more attractive to the person you want to reach.Choose a start date (no more than 2 weeks in the future) and determine your first step. When that date comes, don't hesitate! Hit the gym, start your gratitude journal, or begin cleaning!
Stay motivated by celebrating every small victory.
Seek out a community of people striving toward similar goals.

, If you are ready to reconnect with them, start by sending a text. This is a casual way to start a conversation, and test out how they feel. If they respond within a few hours, and if their tone matches yours, it is probably a good idea to keep pursuing them.Try not to make it seem like you're looking for a booty call.
You could say, ""It's been so long since we've hung out. I hope you're well.""

, Keep communicating casually via text message for a few days or a week. If there is a good back and forth happening, eventually work up to telling them you miss them. You might say, ""Talking with you has been so much fun. I really miss spending time with you.""Do not send another text until they have responded to your last one.
Avoid sending more than a couple of texts per day.
It is OK to take a day off between communications.
Respond to any texts from them within 2 hours.

, Even if they seem open to reconnecting, they probably have some reservations. You are going to need to acknowledge any ways you might have hurt them in the past, and try to reassure them that you won't do it again.You might say, ""I know I hurt you last time we tried this. I was selfish and scared, and I'm sorry.""
You could follow up with, ""I have really tried to change and improve myself. I like to think I'm a better person this time around.""
Avoid rehashing every detail of the past. This should be a chance to start fresh.

, If everything goes well, ask them out for a date. Start with something casual, like meeting up for a cocktail or coffee, to keep the stakes low. You will know right away if it feels like it's working. If you are both enjoying each other's company, plan a second date."

Someone who is loyal and supportive will always be there for you in a relationship.;

Introduce them to your favorite bands.
See if you have similar tastes in movies.
Tell them what values are important to you.

, Take a break from focusing on how you feel about the person and think about how you feel when you’re around them. It may be wise to overlook some of their flaws if they make you feel great about yourself.


Do they always know exactly what to say to help you feel better when you’re down?
Do they help you feel at ease by listening to your problems without judging you?
Do you feel confident to be yourself when you’re around them?

, Decide whether or not you can see yourself having a future with this person. Remember that attraction is a feeling that comes and goes.The things you’re attracted to may even change over time. What’s more important for a long-term relationship is whether or not you have fun being around a person.


Intense attraction to someone usually only lasts for the first few months of a relationship.
Even if you’re not attracted to this person now, can you see your attraction to them growing in the future?
Do they have any attractive traits you may have overlooked?

, If the person has permanent traits or behaviors that you don’t like, then you should decide if it’s worth it to start a relationship with them.


Traits like a person’s style, hygiene and manners can be altered over the course of a relationship.
Traits relating to a person’s physical attractiveness or personality will be very difficult to change and will likely remain the same throughout the duration of a relationship.

, The thing that you find unattractive about someone might be something that makes them happy. Even if they do agree to change it, they might end up resenting you down the line. However, if they can benefit or grow from changing the traits you find unattractive, then you should let them know.If someone feels comfortable wearing casual clothes but you are attracted to people that dress in formal wear, then you shouldn’t ask them to change their style to fit your preference.
If what turns you off about someone is a bad habit like smoking, then you should tell them. You may be able to help them improve their health.

, Let them know exactly how you feel.They may not want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn’t feel immediately attracted to them.Don’t assume that they’re willing to wait for your attraction to grow.Ask them how they feel about the situation and be sure to listen intently to everything they say.

Say something like:

“I really enjoy spending time with you but I don’t feel attracted to you at this point. I’d like us to take some time to get to know each other to see if that changes. Are you willing to take things slow?”
“I think we have a real emotional connection. I may not feel physically attracted to you yet but sometimes it takes me a while to feel that way. I’d like to try starting a relationship with you. What are your thoughts about that?”

, Tell them if you don’t see the relationship going anywhere. The longer you wait to let them know, the more you could hurt their feelings. It’s not fair to lead someone on if you’re just keeping them around until someone better comes along.


If one person person expects a passionate relationship while the other person is just looking for a caretaker, the relationship could end in a disastrous break up.

, Be clear with yourself about all the qualities that you need in a partner. You may find that there are more important things to you in a relationship than attraction. Does your date have any of the qualities that you’re looking for? You may want a partner who is:supportive
kind
intelligent
outgoing
polite

, If you seem to always find yourself in relationships that don't fulfill you, you may be putting too much importance on immediate attraction. Intense attraction to someone can sometimes blind you to the fact that you may not be compatible with them.What initially attracted you to your former flames?
What worked and what didn’t work in your past relationships?
Does your current date have different qualities than your former partners?

, Maybe you want things from a partner that are contradictory. For example: Do you want someone who’s very driven to succeed at their career but who also has plenty of free time to spend with you? If you have traits that you look for in a partner that are contradictory, you may have to choose which ones are more valuable to you.


You’ll have a tough time finding someone who’s dedicated to physical fitness but who will enjoy eating with you at your favorite fast food restaurants.
If you want someone who’s extremely social, you can’t expect them to also like spending weekends alone with you at home.

, Do you have a mental image of your perfect partner that is impossible for people to live up to? If so, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. Understand that even though a person might not have every trait you look for in a partner, they could still have a lot of great qualities.If you’re unwilling to bend, you could be miss out on a really amazing person.


You may be shutting yourself off from being attracted to people who don’t meet your intense qualifications.
You might be holding people to such a high standard because of your own insecurities. It might be easier for you to look for reasons to shut a person out than face potential rejection from them.

, Do you think your dates should be as ""hot"" as the celebrities on magazine covers? If so, you could have an unreasonably high standard of beauty. Remember that those celebrities have make up artists and stylists who work long hours just to make them look beautiful.Even then, the pictures still need to be photoshopped to look perfect.


If you’re holding people to an idealized standard of beauty, you’re being unfair to them.
Think about how you’d feel if people compared you to your own standards for physical attractiveness.

, Are you focusing on every imperfection that a person has in order to rank their looks? If so, you could be training your brain to look for people’s flaws rather than to appreciate the whole picture. Look for what you do like about a person’s looks rather than what you don’t like.If you’re overly critical about people’s looks, you won’t be able to be attracted to them.
You may find that when you stop trying to pinpoint someone’s flaws, they magically become more attractive.

, If you’re looking for someone to be with long-term, you might want to take their physical attractiveness out of the equation. People’s looks change over time. If you decide who to date based on their appearance rather than their personality, you might find that you have nothing in common with them in the future.


Some physical traits do show aspects of a person’s character. If a person is very physically fit, it may show you that they are committed to taking care of their body and can someday commit to taking care of you.

, Try to look beyond a their physical attractiveness to see what kind of person they are on the inside. A person’s looks are no indication of how they will treat you or whether or not you’ll be compatible with them.


If you’re too enamored with a person’s physical attractiveness you may overlook flaws in their character.

, If you’ve only been attracted to and dated a certain type of person, it’s likely that you’ve been on many of the same type of dates. By dating someone who doesn’t fit the mold of your usual type, you may open yourself up to broad spectrum of new experiences. For example, your date could take you to:


a sporting event
a ballet
an exotic new restaurant
a comedy show

, By dating a new type of person, you could find out new things about your own personality.They might show you an entirely different side to yourself that you were completely unaware of.


If you’re an introvert and your date really enjoys being around people, you could find that you enjoy socializing more than you realized.
If your date takes you to a volunteer event, you could find that you really love giving back to the community.
If your date likes to talk to you about politics, you could find that you have strong opinions about the political process.

, You could become attracted to this person in ways that you haven’t experienced before.You may grow an intense emotional connection to them or you could find that their intelligent conversation stimulates your mind. Sometimes attraction takes time to develop. At some point, you could look back and wonder why you weren’t attracted to them in the first place. You might be drawn to their:


humor
kindness
positive outlook
charm
ambition

, It can be rewarding to take the time to see who a person really is. Sometimes you can’t see a person’s character right away. By delaying your judgement of a person, and giving a connection time to form, you open yourself up to a new realm of possibilities. You could find that someone you weren’t initially attracted to becomes someone you can’t live without.


Being compassionate could also help you grow your social circle. If you hold off judgement for people you initially don’t like, you could find that they grow into some of your best friends.

Project confidence.,
Be genuine.,
Present yourself well.,
Don’t dwell too much on a girl’s appearance.,
Be a sincere conversationalist.,
Let her get comfortable.,
Put effort into your first date.,
Don’t get too nervous.,
Get physical.,
Call her when you say you will.,
Introduce her to your friends.,
Throw in some surprises.",How to Date Girls," One of the most attractive qualities a potential date can have is palpable confidence. Girls will be interested in you if you seem to have a lot going on: you’re involved in activities, you have friends, you speak your opinion, and you have long-term goals.


Confidence can stem from a lot of places. You don’t have to be a basketball star to attract a girl; just get involved in something that shows you at your best. What activity allows you to shine?
There’s a big difference between confidence and arrogance. Confident people are admired by others for their talent, but also their grace and humility. If you’re confident in yourself, you won’t find the need to brag about it.;
, Don’t pretend to be someone you aren’t - girls will be able to see right through it. There’s nothing wrong with reading up on a band you know a girl likes so you can have a conversation about it later, but don’t pretend you know how to play the guitar unless you’re prepared to play her a song at a moment’s notice. Be real, and you won’t have to lie.

, Every girl has different preferences, or “types,” but don’t worry too much about trying to wear all the latest trends. Dress appropriately for the situation - no sleeveless shirts at a martini bar, for example - and don’t overdo it with the cologne. If you show up to a party dressed at your personal best and feeling confident, you’ll act that way - and there’s a good chance the girl you’re trying to impress will forget she even has a type.

, Everyone likes receiving compliments, especially when they’ve obviously gone out of their way to dress up and look good, but that shouldn’t be the main topic of conversation. Give the girl you’d like to date a chance to be more than the cute dress and heels she’s wearing.


Especially avoid making sexual comments about a girl’s appearance when you’re trying to date her. Stick to tasteful comments about her clothes, hair, or smile.

, Avoid pick up lines, because they don’t sound sincere. When you’re talking to a girl, say something you actually mean. When she responds, don’t just pretend to listen, really listen, and try to move the conversation to a place that feels “real.”


Of course, the conversation should be appropriate for the setting. If you’re in a noisy bar, the girl you’re chatting up might not be in the mood to talk about personal or philosophical subjects. Still, it should be possible to say something meaningful about the music, the crowd, or the feel of the evening that shows her you’re enjoying the moment with her.

, When you’ve just met a girl and you want to ask her on a date, it’s very important that she feels comfortable being herself with you. Enjoy her quirks and unique qualities, and try not to be judgmental.


If you say something critical, even in jest, it could come off the wrong way and make her close up.
Ask a lot of questions and follow up with comments that let her know you’re listening and care about what she’s saying.
Joke around to keep things fun, but avoid making fun of the girl, her friends, her family, or anything else that hurt her feelings this early in the game.

, Take her somewhere special. It doesn’t have to be expensive, but it should be clear you put some thought into it. Share your favorite restaurant with her, or take her to a beautiful scenic spot for a picnic. If you know she likes a particular sports team, buy tickets to a game.

, Don’t focus too much on the structure of the date. Instead, try to genuinely have a good time getting to know someone you’ve recently met. Think about all you have to learn about her, and all she has to learn about you. If you enjoy her company now, chances are she’s enjoying yours, too.

, Whether you place your hand on her back while you’re waiting in line for tickets, hold hands during a movie, or go back to your place after dinner, some kind of physical touch will increase the intimacy you feel with the girl you’re dating. Just make sure it’s all consensual.

, If you ended your first date with a promise to call, follow up within the next few days.


If you reflected on the date and realize you’re no longer interested, give her the courtesy of letting her know you don’t think it’s going to work out.
If you want to continue the relationship, don’t play hard to get. Be consistent in your communication.

, Once you’ve gone on a few dates, a great way to get to know each other better is to introduce the girl you’re interested in to your friends. If they hit it off, you might be encouraged to take the relationship to a deeper level.

, Consistency is important when you’re dating, but you should also throw in some romantic surprises. The surprises will depend on the personality of the girl - maybe she’d love it if you cooked dinner for her, sent her flowers at work, or planned a fun weekend trip. She’ll be impressed by your thoughtfulness if you mix it up sometimes.

Take stock of your priorities.,
Get to know your significant other.,
Talk about your ages.,
Learn how to deal with people who point out your age difference.,
Enjoy one another as you would someone who is your age.",How to Date Despite an Age Barrier," Determine if dating at this time in your life is worth it. This is always a good idea, even if you aren’t dating out of your age group. Make sure that you are going into a relationship with the idea that you may stay in this relationship for a long time, even forever. It will take time, money, and other resources to make your relationship work.;
, It makes sense to get to know them. With an age difference, you are more likely to enjoy different things and think different ways. Get to know the person and find out all of their likes and dislikes; what makes them tick.

, This seems a little strange, but it’s helpful to clear the air. If one or both of you has a problem with the age difference, but you still want to try the relationship out, go ahead. Often times, you will forget about the age difference and enjoy each other’s company.

, In social settings, mean-spirited people will often call the older person a “cradle robber” or some other such thing. More often than not, they are jealous of the fun and happiness the two of you share.


At first, you will try to ignore people like this. When that gets tiresome or impossible, don’t try to reason with them or explain why you are in the relationship. You don’t owe anyone an explanation. Simply say something like, “You’re right, we are a few years apart, but I don’t think I’ve ever been happier.” You’ll be surprised how quickly that quiets busy-bodies.

, The first stages of dating involve learning how to be the best of friends. Do that! Beyond getting to know each other (step 2), learn about each other and how to know what the other is feeling. Learn body language, changes in voice, etc.

Be more than just a boyfriend.",How to Date an Otaku Girl," The trouble with any label is that it tends to reduce people to nothing more than stereotypes and hollow shells. Before you approach an otaku girl, remind yourself that she is an individual person with her own quirks, beliefs, and personality. Some of her characteristics might scream “typical” otaku, but many won't.


The same thing can be said about impressing her once you've already met and started to date. There is no single set of steps that can be used on every girl who falls under the “otaku” label—including the steps listed in this article. Use the label as a starting point, but always personalize your approach based on the specific girl.;
, Otaku girls can often be found online in chat rooms, forums, and various social media websites. Moreover, these girls are often comfortable interacting in the digital realm and can appreciate an online meeting just as well as an offline one.


Navigate forums related to anime, manga, or other aspects of otaku culture. Join active groups on Facebook or other social media websites about those topics, as well, and participate in the discussions that go on as much as possible.
When you find an interesting girl, start following her on her blog or on one or two social media websites. Don't follow all of her accounts at once, though, since doing so may come on too strong and scare her away., The vast majority have lives in the real world, and if you want a more traditional meeting, your best bet is to track down the otaku girl in her natural habitat. In other words, go someplace related to her interests since she'd be likely to visit there in her free time.


For example, try going to a store that has a wide selection of anime or manga. Spend time at an arcade. See a movie that has a large female fandom or, if you're feeling especially daring, try going to an anime convention.

, Once you find a girl who piques your interest, you need to make a good first impression. You don't necessarily need a flashy, witty pick-up line, though. Striking up an interesting conversation might be more than enough.


Discussions about shows, movies, and related media tend to be a good place to start, especially if you see her looking at a similar series in a store.If you don't know enough about her likely interests, you could even start the conversation by confessing your lack of knowledge and asking her to make a recommendation.

, In the United States, the term “otaku” is usually reserved for people who are hardcore anime or manga fans, but in Japan, “otaku” basically defines anyone who is a hardcore fan of any one interest. Even if the otaku girl in your life is a huge anime fan, it helps to know which series and genres she's most interested in.


The Japanese concept of “otaku” is similar to the American idea of a fangirl (or fanboy), geek, or nerd. A person could be an anime otaku or game otaku, but someone could also be something like a train otaku. Anyone who loves something enough to obsess over it can be labeled as an “otaku.”
The American concept of “otaku” tends to be someone who is obsessed with some part of Japanese pop culture or Asian pop culture in general. Anime, manga, and computer games are the most notable obsessions, but an otaku could also obsess over J-Pop music or Korean dramas.

, Simply knowing the title of her favorite series isn't enough. If you really want to impress your otaku girl, you should do a little research into her favorites so that you know what they're all about. You don't need to love everything she loves, but you should have a basic enough understanding to follow along with her rants when she starts talking about one of her passions.


Another advantage to your research is that you'll learn more about the type of things she loves, rather than knowing only a few examples. Most otaku girls will branch out from their original obsessions and latch onto things related to them.If you learn enough about what interests her, you may eventually be able to introduce her to something else she'd enjoy, which will definitely leave her feeling impressed with you.

, Take her to places that cater to her passions. Give her gifts that are related to the things she loves. Otaku girls like to be romanced, but standard “cookie cutter” actions only scratch the surface and fail to address her as an individual.


Keep in mind that your gifts do not need to be expensive to make an impression. As a general rule, otaku girls tend to enjoy inexpensive merchandise related to their favorite series and characters just as well as expensive merchandise. Something as simple as a Totoro plush toy might be enough to charm a girl who loves Studio Ghibli characters.
If traditional romance is your style, you can stick with it, but try putting a twist on things. Take her out for dinner and a movie, but pick an anime movie (for an anime otaku). Similarly, you can buy her jewelry, but look for jewelry connected to one of her favorite franchises.

, Some otaku girls might be a little embarrassed by their interests, but most don't see any shame in it. Either way, you need to show her that you don't feel embarrassed by her interests. Cutting her down for loving the things she loves is a quick way to make her push you away.


Many otaku girls even enjoy the fact that their interests are somewhat obscure. After all, an obscure interest is unique, and people generally like to feel as though they're one-of-a-kind.

, An otaku girl is still a girl, after all, so you'll need to pamper her with occasional sweet talk. Make your compliments honest and try to be a little creative. As with everything, a compliment that addresses her as a unique individual is better than something stereotypical.


Like most women, she'll want to be complimented on her appearance sometimes. Instead of saying something general--""You're really pretty""—compliment something specific, like a certain feature—""I love the color of your eyes""—or a specific accessory—""Your glasses perfectly frame your gorgeous eyes.""
You should also compliment her personality, as well as her appearance. Remark on her intelligence, her cheerfulness, her generosity, or any other positive feature.

, More specifically, know what sort of things bother her. The otaku girl is a very passionate person overall. Most of her passion is directed at things she loves, but she can be equally passionate about things she hates. Once you know what she hates, do your best to avoid it.


For example, if she's picky about grammar and spelling, you probably shouldn't send her texts like, ""wanna hang out??? c u l8r!!"" Instead, take the time to spell things out and double-check your messages for errors.

, While some otaku girls can be quite extroverted, most tend to be somewhat introverted. She may not be “shy,” per se, but she may not enjoy large crowds or similar settings as much as you do. Relationships require both parties to make compromises, but if you want to work your way into her heart, know when to take her out and when to let her stay in.


For those girls who are extroverted, also keep in mind that certain settings may still make her uncomfortable. She might like socializing with close groups of friends, but that doesn't necessarily mean she'll enjoy going to a packed club full of strangers.

, There are times when the otaku girl might want to enjoy her hobbies on her own or with friends who pursue them just as vigorously as she does. Let her do this. Wanting to be with her as she does what she enjoys is a good thing, but forcing yourself will only make both you and her more miserable.


When she's out enjoying the things she loves, take time to enjoy your own interests. Visit friends, have some alone time, or go to an event you know your otaku girlfriend would never enjoy.
If you feel the need to be constantly connected to her, ask yourself why. You might be feeling neglected or jealous. Figure out what the issue is and talk it over with her before it gnaws away at the foundation of your relationship.

, Once the two of you enter into a more serious relationship, though, you'll need to find balance between the two of you. One of the best ways to do this is to make trades. In return for doing something she loves this time, the two of you will do something you love next time.


When you do spend time doing what she loves, try to be genuinely interested in it. If she wants you to watch a favorite movie, pay attention to it instead of staring at your phone. If she drags you along to a convention, try to find something about the convention that you can be interested in, as well.
You can also let her instruct you on her hobbies. For instance, if she happens to love a certain game, let her teach you the best way to play it

, Some of the friends who share your otaku girlfriend's interests might be guys, but typically, you won't need to worry about her turning her romantic attentions toward them once the two of you are already in a relationship. Remember that the otaku girl is fiercely passionate about the things she loves. If she loves you, she's not likely to drop you so easily.


When you show that you trust her, it may also make it easier for her to trust you. By demonstrating that you are dedicated and secure in your relationship, you'll show that she has no reason to doubt your affections.

, As the two of you get more serious, you need to demonstrate that you are comfortable around her. Since many otaku girls have introverted personalities, they'll find it oppressive if they feel like they always have to be “on” for you. Make yourself comfortable around her so that she'll be more comfortable around you in return.


Dropping your guard should be done in moderation, though. You don't need to show up at her door in polo shirt and khakis, but on the other hand, you don't want to wear the same stained t-shirt four days in a row, either. Be casual, but take care of your appearance and exhibit respectful behavior.

, In spite of her love of two-dimensional characters, you'll need to be deeper than that. Instead of being the perfect charmer, you need to be her friend. Become someone who she can turn to for acceptance and comfort if you want the relationship to last.

You have spent many years with this person, and whether your relationship was happy or not, you should fully grieve before moving on. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to grieve, and there is no exact time when grieving ends.


If you are unable to discuss your spouse without an extreme emotional display, you may need to wait longer before getting back in the dating game. In the meantime, take good care of yourself by eating well, getting physical activity, and avoiding behaviors that jeopardize health, such as drinking or using drugs. Join a grief support group or see a counselor.;
, Yes, you will have to move on and live a life without your loved one. But, you don’t necessarily have to “get over” the loss. “Getting over” a death implies that you will somehow return to normal at some point. Considering how closely interconnected your life was with your spouse’s, returning to normal is impossible.What you want to strive for is acceptance. Learn how to integrate the loss into a new identity in which you plan for a future without your beloved. It can help to fill your social calendar with new and exciting activities, such as checking out books from the library, getting a part-time job if you are retired, taking up a new hobby, participating in group fitness classes, or adopting a pet., The object of dating is not to replace your spouse. You may long for someone just like your previous love, but having such a desire will only lead to disappointment. Think about what qualities you would like to find in a new partner. Be realistic – having a laundry list of desired traits will make it hard for you to find a match.


For example, consider some things you would like to do, such as traveling, and look for a partner who shares that same passion., It’s common for widow(er)s to feel a sense of guilt for wanting get back out on the market. You believe it is a betrayal of your spouse to smile at a new man or enjoy coffee with a new woman. You must release these feelings and recognize that you are, indeed, single. Your spouse would want you to enjoy the remainder of your life as you see fit., Your first idea may be to tell close friends and family that you are ready to get back on the circuit. Hopefully, these individuals will support you fully and be happy to connect you with a potential date who shares your interests. The problem is, it’s unlikely for you to meet someone new through such close social ties.


Your circle of friends is probably limited to friends of yours and your spouses’ – not people you want to date. Pass the word along a little further to other people you know in passing like church members, friends of neighbors, or people you know from the local grocery or shops. Research shows good dating opportunities arise from such “weak ties”., Fill your social calendar with events where you can meet new people. Attending the same events you went to with your spouse may make you feel out of place going alone. Find new group activities that you enjoy and forge new friendships, opening yourself up to the opportunity of meeting potential dates., The courtship process may not have been carried out online before you were married. You may cringe at the idea of searching for dates online. You’ll be surprised to learn that many widows or widowers find successful and quality matches on many popular dating sites.


Be sure to practice online dating safety when connecting with others over the web.Refrain from posting your contact information like addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses. And, check your security settings on other social media platforms.
Does a potential match seem too good to be true? Do your due diligence in verifying that the person is who he/she says by googling their name or conducting a reverse image search of the profile photo.
Always make first acquaintances in public places and drive yourself to the meeting. Ensure that someone else knows where you are going and the time you anticipate being home. You may even consider bringing a friend along to sit at another table during the date.
A good rule of thumb is daytime dates for first meets in a public, casual setting, such as a coffee shop or ice cream parlor. When you do progress to a dinner date, you don't have to pick your date up from her home or vice versa. It's perfectly acceptable to drive separate cars and meet up at a restaurant.

, Wait until you feel comfortable progressing the relationship to do so. Don’t rush things. Take your time to truly get to know the other person, and examine your interest and/or feelings for this person before advancing the relationship.Don't be afraid to keep it casual and simultaneously see several people before becoming exclusive with one. Refrain from feeling the need to hurry up and settle down again. Take the time to have fun, enjoy yourself, and see what compatible dates are out there for you.

, You date will likely already know about your spouse's death. If you are dating online, you may have this information in your profile or share it early on in a message to prepare the person before a face-to-face meeting.


Even after you share this information, trust your instincts to decide what else to share, such as details about your spouse’s death or other information from your previous life. In some ways, confiding could build a stronger bond between you and a new person. However, talking too much about the past can cause a date to feel left out.

, Chances are, it’s been quite some time since you’ve been on a first date. Show respect and consideration for your appearance by showing up properly groomed and in well-fitting clothes. Ask a close friend to come with you shopping and select a few items that can help you feel most confident on your date.You don’t have to undergo a major makeover to date, but it’s nice to look and feel your best. Working out and grooming can help you feel better. Plus, exercising and staying active lifts your mood and promotes a positive outlook., Start the date off with a smile and a positive attitude. If you are feeling at all hesitant about the dating process or uncomfortable with the person, cancel the date and give yourself more time. Both of you deserve to be with someone who is fully present and enthusiastic about dating., Even when it’s with the right person, dating can be a roller-coaster of shaky beginnings and false starts. Accept that a successful relationship may not be the outcome of your first month of dating, or even your first year. Exercise a positive outlook by going on each date with the mindset that even if you two don’t make a connection, you will have met someone new and interesting.Applaud yourself for getting back out there, and leave your expectations at the door.

Put your best foot forward.Sometimes with children, careers, and more, life gets in the way.,
Be confident.,
Have a good attitude.Think positively; not only about your dating future, but about life in general.,
Act friendly.",How to Date After Fifty1," You may stop paying as much attention to your appearance as when you were younger. Making sure that you look as nice as you can is an important part of being approachable at any age.You don't have to look like a movie star, but now that you are dating again, you should be mindful of your appearance.


Dress appropriately. While you don’t want to dress like a teenager, you also don’t want to wear clothes that are dated or unfashionable. Wear clothes that flatter your body and that make you feel good about yourself.Have good hygiene. You don’t necessarily need to have all of your original teeth or a full head of hair to look great, but you do have to take care of your hygiene. Freshen your breath, get a haircut, keep your nails neat, etc.
Try to spice it up a little. You don’t need to buy a new wardrobe; just try adding a little something extra to your everyday look.Brush your hair a different way, splash on at little fragrance, or add a hat to your outfit.;
, Regardless of age, both men and women like confidence when meeting someone new. Feeling good about yourself will also make you more comfortable and more approachable. So remind yourself that no matter what age you are, you have many great characteristics that would make someone want to date you.


Give yourself a little mental pep talk and remind yourself of all your great qualities. For example, tell yourself, “I’m mature, witty, intelligent, and I can still hit a homerun.”
Take a deep breath, hold your head up, put your shoulders back, and smile. Physically appearing confident can make you feel more confident.
It’s okay to take the time you need to build up your confidence, then start finding people to date when you feel more comfortable.

, If you don’t have a good attitude about dating, then you may feel rejected and give up too soon. If you don’t think positively about life, your negative attitude might run potential dates away.Keep in mind that, although dating after 50 is different from when you were younger, you still have to take rejections with a grain a salt and believe that your next date is coming.
Think about all the good things in your life and enjoy the small things that make you smile (like a great cup of coffee or your garden in bloom).
Remember the positive things about dating, even if you don't make a love connection, like meeting new people, experiencing new things, and the funny dating stories you can tell your friends.

, You won’t have success in getting a date if you seem surly, grouchy or just generally don’t seem nice.It will be much easier for potential dates to approach you if you seem friendly. People will also be more receptive to you asking them out if you seem like a friendly, amiable person.


You don’t have to go out of your way to greet every single person that crosses your path.
Try keeping a pleasant look on your face with a slight smile.
Smile and speak to people when they greet you. You can even initiate a spontaneous, “How are you?”
If you’ve been on your own in a while, your social skills might seem a bit rusty. Practice in the mirror first, even if it feels a bit strange, and this can help you feel better about acting friendly.
If you don’t feel like acting friendly, you could have a larger issue other than developing social skills. If you’re finding that you’re truly having difficulty with the concept of dating, but you really want to try, finding a therapist to work out your feelings can be really helpful. Your therapist can also help you develop a plan, and also develop skills for situations like trust, commitment, and developing healthy relationships.

Whenever you pass each other in the hallway, make eye contact (this might be hard) and smile. Use her name, and greet her in a friendly way.;
, Friend her on Facebook, or other social networking sites, to learn more about your crush. Talk to her friends to find out if she's dating anyone, or what kind of people she likes to date. Try to learn about her hobbies, how she spends her free time. Learn what she likes.


Often, shy people will feel more comfortable talking online, or texting. Becoming online friends first is a great way to get to know a shy girl.Don't assume girls who act shy around you like you, or don't like you. Shyness isn't a sign of anything except being shy.

, If you want to date, you need to do more than say ""Hi"" and scamper off. Once you feel like she's comfortable enough with you saying hi to approach her, just walk up to her some time and have a short conversation. Make sure she knows who you are before you ask her if she wants to date.


Keep it simple: ""Hey, my name is _____, we have Biology class together.""

, Shy people are often quite good at one-on-one conversations, but struggle in big groups. Don't try to engage a shy girl in class, or while you've got four of your friends with you, or it's going to be rough. Bring up something simple to talk about, something that you know you have in common, and have a short one-on-one conversation.


If you're in class together, just talk about class: ""I really messed up that last test. It was so hard. How'd you do? Do you like this class?""

, Lots of shy people fear that they're ""bad"" at having conversations, and don't like to talk because they're afraid of messing it up or being awkward. This usually makes it worse. Instead of drawing it out, just exchange a short little chat and then break it off. Say, ""Hey, good talking to you. See you later!""


If it seems like she feels uncomfortable, don't draw extra attention to it. Just end the conversation in a friendly way, with a small compliment. ""It's so good talking to you. You're funny. Let's talk again soon.""

, Keep talking to this girl. Have your little conversations, making them gradually longer and longer. When you start to feel comfortable talking with her, just ask her out.


Keep it simple and keep it short: ""Hey, I've always noticed you and I think you're a really sweet and really nice person. I like you a lot. Would you like to go out with me sometime?""
Sometimes, things like dances or other big events can be intimidating for shy girls. It's actually sometimes better to just keep it vague: ""Would you like to go out sometime"" might be better than, ""How about this Friday?""

, If you call up a shy girl out of the blue, it's possible that she'll give you an excuse to avoid going out. This isn't because she doesn't like you, but because introverted or shy-types like to have their plans in place. Shy girls need a chance to get ready mentally for a date.


If it's 4:30 on a Friday night and a shy girl doesn't have plans, she's probably looking forward to a quiet night at home. Make your plans ahead of time to give her enough opportunity to prepare.
In general, try to make plans at least 1-2 days ahead of time at least.

, It's good to plan an activity for a date with a shy girl, so you'll have something to do together. If conversation is going to be hard, try to pick an activity that'll let her loosen up and have a good time, without having to do a lot of talking.


Going for a bike ride, bowling, or playing mini golf might seem like silly ways to go on a date, but it's a good way to keep yourself active and busy. You'll have a fun shared experience.
Dinner is a good opportunity to talk, but it might end up being pretty awkward if you have a hard time talking together. Alternatively, movies mean you can't talk at all. Not the best choices.
Make sure whatever you do is quiet enough for her to talk if she wants to. If you go to a booming club with loud electronic music, you'll never be able to talk.

, Shy girls aren't generally big partiers. If you ask a shy girl if she wants to go to a big dance, or to the football game, or to a loud dance club, don't be offended if she'd rather stay in and watch Netflix on the couch with you. Make the time that you're together special, even if you're not doing something that sounds like a date.


Cook dinner together, instead of going out to a fancy new restaurant. This gives you the chance to do an activity that will get you talking, even if you're just talking about the chicken and rice dish you're making together.

, Shy girls are often intimidated by large groups. While it might sound great to you to hang out with all your friends and watch football together in a huge group, it might be her worst nightmare. Try to give yourself some private time.


Of course, some girls might be more comfortable in group dates and feel more shy one-on-one. All girls are different. Talk to her and find out what she prefers and do what makes her feel comfortable.

, Being shy doesn't mean that she doesn't have a strong opinion. When you're going out, give her the opportunity to pick the activity. This will help her feel comfortable and confident that you enjoy being together. Give her the opportunity to open up.


Don't be afraid to take charge, though. Some shy girls might give you a lot of ""I don't know"" answers when you ask what she'd like to do on Friday night. Have a plan in place, if she doesn't have one.

, Shy girls are often, but not always, somewhat self-conscious. But even if a girl isn't self-conscious, it's a good idea to offer compliments to make her feel comfortable and loved. Keep them simple and genuine to make a shy girl feel more confident around you. If she does, she'll open up more and be less shy in some cases.


Don't pile it on, just keep it simple, and make it something that she has control over, not something abstract about her looks. ""Your eyes are pretty"" might be nice, but ""I love your hair like that"" is a great one, because she did her hair. You're complimenting her choice, not her looks.

, Shy girls or introverts often need a lot of private time, and won't want to spend hours and hours texting with you or talking on Facebook. That's ok. It doesn't mean she doesn't like you, or that she's about to dump you. It just means she's being who she is. Relax and move at her pace.


If you call or text her and leave a message, don't get in touch again until she responds to it. You left the message. She'll get it.
Let her decide how much of your relationship to share on social networking. Don't put up a bunch of pictures and updates about what you're doing together unless she wants to. Shy people might want to be more private than you're used to.

, Secret to dating a shy girl? Talk less. Shy girls will just want to be quiet sometimes. That's ok. Learn when to pull back and just be quiet. She'll open up and talk more when she's ready.


Just enjoy being together. If it's quiet because you don't have much to talk about, just enjoy sharing silence together. There's no need to constantly talk. It may even turn her off.
Don't ask her why she's shy. Sometimes people will ask this question when they're feeling awkward. Drawing attention to it only makes it worse. There's no good answer to this question, and she'll just withdraw more.

, If you struggle to get a shy girl to open up and talk more, maybe it's because your'e not talking the right way. Ask her genuine, specific, and open-ended questions to get her to feel more comfortable and open with you. Listen to her answers and follow up with more questions. This has the added bonus of allowing you to get to know each other better.


Encourage her to talk more by asking follow up questions. If she mentions that she loves going to the lake, that's an opportunity to learn more. How long have you been going? What do you like to do there?Keep questions open-ended to give her the chance to talk more. Don't ask, ""Did you have a good soccer game last weekend?"" because that only has a one word answer. Instead, ask, ""How did you feel about the soccer game last weekend?""

, It's important to be a good listener. If you're used to waiting for your own opportunity to speak, you might find it hard to talk with a shy girl. Use good listening skills and give her the chance to open up and share her life with you.


Look her in the eyes while she's speaking. Nod along and encourage her when she's talking. Put away your phone and other distractions. Give her your undivided attention.

, Never rush a shy girl, or you'll lose her. Dating needs to move at a slow pace, letting her dictate the tempo of things. Shy girls need to feel comfortable, relaxed, and free with someone that they date. Let her decide when she feels comfortable enough.If you want to move in for a kiss, but you're not sure whether or not it's appropriate, the best way to know is to ask her first. ""You look so pretty tonight. I'd like to kiss you. Is that ok?""
Don't try to ""cure"" her. There's nothing wrong with being quiet, shy, or introverted. If you want to change someone to date them, you shouldn't be dating.

Be open.Don’t limit yourself to a specific type of person, height range, body type, age range, income level, etc.,
Try online dating.",How to Date After Fifty2," Even though you are over 50, most people still want to date someone who is active and likes to enjoy life — not just sit on the couch and watch the world go by. Not only will socializing and being active help you meet people to date, it will also make you more attractive to people interested in dating you.Participating in activities and events will give you something to talk about on your dates.
Check your local newspaper, libraries, and community centers for events you are interested in.
Take a daily walk around your block or join the neighborhood association.

, when considering who you might date.Also be open to where you meet people. You could miss out on a great date or relationship because you are stuck on finding the ""perfect"" person or limit yourself to certain places when trying to meet people.


Look around when you are at the bank, grocery store, or even tire shop. You never know where you might find your next date.
Don’t pass someone up because she isn't ""your type"" at first glance. Be open to getting to know them a little before you decide you don’t want to date them.
For example, don’t overlook the cashier at your local drugstore. She could be single, charming, caring, and adventurous.

Plan an interesting date.Dating is more than just eating a meal or watching a movie together; you should be getting to know one another as you enjoy your surroundings.,
Listen more than you talk.,
Flirt a little.Flirting is fun at any age, and everyone likes to feel that someone is flirting with them.,
Be honest about what you want.,
Skip the deep stuff.",How to Date After Fifty3," You don’t necessarily have to spend a lot of money, but you can still be creative and plan a fun outing that will be enjoyable for both of you.Ask your date what types of things he likes to do to get ideas of what might be fun and what might not.
For example, you could tour an art museum and then go for a painting class or a glass of wine.
You might want to have frozen yogurt and then photograph nature as you take a short walk together.
Keep in mind any physical constraints your date might have (for example, trouble walking long distances) when planning your date.

, While you should definitely tell your date about yourself and hold up your end of the conversation, you also need to listen to what your date is saying.People like talking about themselves and it will give you the opportunity to get to know more about your date.


Ask open-ended questions to prompt your date to tell you more about herself.
For example, you might say, “That’s really interesting. How did you become involved with that?”
Listen to what she is saying rather than thinking about what you will say in response to impress her. If you are too focused on yourself, you aren't really paying attention to what she is saying. If you are worried about what to say next, being a good listener will actually make that easy — follow-up questions should come naturally, or you can simply say, ""Wow, can you tell me more about that?""

, So don’t feel that just because you are 50 or over you can’t flirt a little.You don’t have to go overboard, but giving your date extra attention won’t hurt.


Gaze at your date for just a beat too long. Touch his arm. Smile.
Lean towards him when he is talking to you. Pay him a compliment.
There isn't anything wrong with a gentleman opening a door for his date, or seating her at the table.

, Just like when you were younger, dating can be confusing when you aren’t sure what the other person wants out of the situation or haven’t talked about what you want. Is it just pleasant company for an occasional evening, or are you looking for that special someone to share your golden years with? Whatever it is, let your date know that upfront so that there is no confusion or misunderstandings.Be ready to initiate the conversation. Even though you are both adults, it may be difficult for your date to bring the topic up, so you should be ready to.
Don’t feel that you have to have sex or even kiss, if you don’t want to. Talk honestly about your expectations for sex before the date moves in that direction.
You might try saying, “I almost feel like a teenager bringing this up, but let’s be clear about where this is going…”

, A date isn’t so much fun if the whole time you are both reliving and rehashing your pasts.Eventually you will want to talk about past relationships, life experiences, and more. In the beginning, however, touch on topics such as ex-spouses, finances, your ailments and children only lightly.


Talking a lot about your ex or deceased spouse can give your date the impression that you haven’t moved on from that relationship.
Mention that you have children (or grandchildren), but don’t spend the majority of the date talking about them. Your date wants to get to know you right now, not your family.
Don’t spend the date talking about all your aches, ailments, medicines, and doctor appointments. This is a date not a therapy session!

",How to Date an Educated Black Woman,"  There's nothing more rewarding to a woman than for a man to be comfortable in his own skin.  This will also allow you to see if the person that you are dating accepts and loves you for who you are and not a possible ""representative"" or persona.;
,  Is she passive? Assertive or shy?  Regardless whether if your person of interest is the life of the party and/or extremely timid, how well you all compliment one another in personality will determine how personal she is willing to get.

,  Regardless if she is a stunning ebony bombshell that every woman secretly wished she looked like; don't lose sight of getting to know her.  Find out what things she care about the most.

,  How serious you guys are will determine when you meet the people that she cares about the most.  Not to worry.  Even if you haven't had the honor to meet her loved ones yet you can still get to know them by asking questions.  Some women may be a bit more open and some more private.  No matter what, be respectful and don't be intrusive.

Get out and socialize.,
Use social networking.,
Be yourself.,
Show your confidence.Acting confident around your extrovert will help attract them to you because it will make you more noticeable and more memorable.,
Start a conversation.",How to Date an Extrovert1," Extroverts like to go places, meet people, and generally be out and about in the world. You’re not going to attract an extrovert by sitting at home. If you want to attract and date an extrovert you’re going to have to get off the couch and go socialize, too.


Attend parties and other events that your extrovert might be interested in.
Even if you don’t see them there, you’ll have something to talk about when you do get together.
For example, if you hear that your extrovert is attending a mutual friend’s birthday party, you could, too.;
, Extroverts are active on social media because it allows them to share their life and keep up with what’s going on with their friends.There are lots of ways you can use social networking to attract your extrovert.


Social media can help you learn more about your extrovert. For example, their posts and check-ins can give you clues as to where they like to hang out.
Your profile and the things you post are a way to let your extrovert get to know a little about before you actually meet.
Tag your extrovert in a post or two. They might like the recognition and attention.

, This gives your extrovert the chance to get to know you and all the great qualities about you. Don’t try to act like someone you aren’t to date an extrovert. They will find out and won’t like that you’re being fake. Attract them by being yourself.


If you need to, make a list of your qualities. Be sure to list personality traits, hobbies and interests, and skills you have.
You list might include qualities such as: hardworking, great cook, creative, attractive, organized, good at lacrosse, etc.
Remind yourself of all your great qualities and just act like yourself when you are around your extrovert.
For example, say to yourself, “I’m charming and friendly. I can just be myself right now.”

, You don’t need to be over-the-top or change who you are, but showing a bit of confidence will help you date an extrovert.


Hold your head up, relax your shoulders, and stand up straight.
Look around you and look people in the eyes instead of looking at the ground when you are in public.
Smile and greet people in a clear and calm voice.
For example, when you see your extrovert, stand up a little straighter and hold you head up. Look him in the eyes and in a clear voice say, “Hi! How’re you doing?”

, Extroverts like to meet new people and are known for being talkative and asking questions.Starting a conversation will help you attract and date an extrovert. It will also give you the opportunity to get to know one another.


For example, if you see your extrovert at the local café, go up to them and ask them how their day is going. You might say, “Hey! How’s your day going so far?”
Start a conversation about current issues or things going on in the community. For instance, you could try, “What do you think about the presidential debates?”
Use the conversation as an opportunity to get their contact information if you don’t have it. You might say something like, “I know you have places to go. What’s a good way for me to get in contact with you later?”

"
"
Communicate honestly.,
Socialize together.,
Spend time one-on-one.,
Plan a surprise.,
Engage in self-care.",How to Date an Extrovert2," The key to dating an extrovert is the same as the key for dating anyone — honest communication. Talking with your extrovert will help you understand each other better and find the things you have in common.It will also help you prevent and overcome any misunderstandings.


Extroverts like to talk a lot, so make sure you are actively listening to what they tell you.
At the same time, make sure that you express your feelings when you disagree or something bothers you.
For example, you could say, “Can we talk about our plans for this weekend?”
Ask your extrovert for their input and opinion just as much as you tell them what you want and need.
For instance, you might ask, “How do you feel about stopping by the party for a while and then the two of us go for pizza?”

, Extroverts like to get out and do things. If you are dating an extrovert you will have to accept this and also socialize with them. You don’t have to hang out with them every time they go somewhere, but you should plan on socializing together.


Volunteer together at a local community organization or for a charity event you both support.
Go out on a double or group date. Or hang out with a group. For example, you could join a group for bowling or a game night.
When you are hanging out with others remember to give your extrovert time and space to interact with the others in the group. An extrovert gains energy by conversing with many other people, so they may not want to spend all their time in one spot, talking to one group. Accept that you might not have their full attention when you are out with others, but it doesn't mean the introvert doesn't like you or isn't interested in you.
For example, if you all are at a party, give your extrovert time to work the room and greet people.

, Although extroverts are social people, they also need quiet and peace sometimes.When you date an extrovert make sure that you are spending one-on-one time to balance the time you spend time socializing. Spending time with just the two of will also give the chance to get to know one another better.


Do something that doesn’t involve other people. Plan a quiet night at the movies or dinner at a cozy restaurant.
Spend some time just talking with each other, getting to know one another. For instance, the two of you could take a quiet afternoon walk.
Be careful, though, because too much one-on-one time can bore an extrovert. Try doing one ‘quiet’ activity for every two or three social activities.

, Extroverts like meeting new people, going new places, and trying new things. When you date an extrovert, plan new and exciting experiences for them.This will let your extrovert know that you understand them and their energetic lifestyle. It will also give you also something to talk about during your one-on-one time.


For example, if your extrovert mentioned zip-lining then plan a surprise trip to your local outdoor adventure park.
Or, for instance, you could plan a surprise dinner party to celebrate your extrovert’s promotion at work.

, If you are not also an extrovert — you may be an introvert or simply less of an extrovert than your partner — you will need to take care to make sure you are getting the alone time you need to recharge. If you find you ""recharge"" when alone, as opposed to when you are around other people, plan some ""me"" time to make sure you don't get burned out or resentful of your partner. You don't need to keep up with their social lifestyle. You can let your partner know you need some time to yourself in order to enjoy going out with them. Let your partner go out while you stay home and take a bath, read a book, watch a movie, or do something else that helps you feel replenished.


You might say, ""It's important to me that I have at least a few hours each week when I can be by myself and recharge. You go ahead to the party — I'm going to stay at home and do a little reading. We'll catch up later!""
Just as the extrovert paying attention to other people isn't a reflection of their feelings for you, let them know that your need for some alone time isn't a reflection of your feelings toward them or your relationship. Assure them that it doesn't mean you don't like them or don't want to spend time with them — this is simply how you take care of yourself.

"
"
Develop your own interests.,
Be secure in yourself.,
Spend time with your friends.",How to Date an Extrovert3," There will be times when your extrovert makes plans without you or you need to take some ""me"" time or simply don’t want to participate in what they are doing. Having your own interests will make it easier for you to date an extrovert because you won’t be dependent on them for all your entertainment.Spend time doing things you enjoy like drawing, writing poetry, swimming, or gaming.
If you’re not sure what you enjoy, then make a list of things you’ve been wanting to try.
Pick two or three activities off of the list and give them a shot. For example, you might want to try rock climbing or meditation.

, Extroverts are friendly, chatty people. Just because they are super social doesn’t mean they have eyes for anyone else.Instead of being jealous and thinking that your date is flirting, accept that your extrovert is a social person and be secure in yourself.


Trust that your extrovert is into you and only you because of all your great qualities.
Tell yourself, “He’s dating me because of my great personality, good looks, and the way I make him smile.”
Remember that meeting new people and socializing are two of the big traits of extroverts. It doesn’t mean your extrovert is flirting.
You might say to yourself, “She’s talking to that guy, but she’s here with me. I don’t need to be jealous.”

, It can be easy to get caught up in an extrovert’s world —spending time with their friends, going places they want to go. While you are dating your extrovert, make sure that you are still keeping in touch with your family and friends.


Schedule time to spend with your family and friends. For example, take an afternoon or evening for a family meal every once and awhile.
Invite your friends along sometimes when you and your extrovert go out.
Do things with just you and your friends. For example, plan a girl’s night out without your extrovert.

Be honest with yourself.,
Expect grief.,
Accept second place in the beginning.,
Know that you’re beginning more than one relationship.,
Expect the unexpected.,
Realize that you won’t be sharing “firsts.” Whether you’re hoping to marry the father and/or have children of your own, accept the fact that the father has already achieved one or both of these milestones.,
Reassess your needs.",How to Date a Man Who Has a Child when You Don't1," Assess your own needs. Know from the start what you truly expect from this relationship. Ask yourself whether you intend to pursue and commit to a lifelong relationship with the father or whether you’re only interested in a casual relationship.;
, Whether the father is a widower, a divorcee, or a parent out of wedlock, know that he’s most likely in a period of mourning for his previous relationship.Also be aware that men are more likely than women to hide their feelings,so don’t assume everything’s fine just because he says it is. If you’re interested in pursuing a longterm relationship, invite him to openly discuss his loss. Use your conversations to evaluate how well he’s coping with it., Embrace early on that his child should be his #1 priority. Be flexible when scheduling your own quality time with him.Appreciate the fact that his money should be earmarked first and foremost for his child’s needs.This may sound like a bummer, but think of it as an excellent way to judge the father’s character. Whether he’s a widower, divorced, or otherwise estranged from the mother, imagine that you’re the mother in this situation. Ask yourself if he’s acting as responsibly toward his child as you would expect him to act toward your own. If he’s showering you with time, money, and attention while neglecting his kid, consider that a red flag.
Remember this is only temporary. Look forward to becoming an equal member of the family as you gradually integrate over time.

, If you’re expecting your relationship with the father to become permanent, be prepared to have one with the child and mother as well.Even if the mother has passed on or is largely absent from your own life, they will still maintain a large presence in both the father and child’s mind.Ask the father early on about the family’s history. Learn about both the child and the mother before you meet them: their character, their interests, their strengths and weaknesses, etc.
Use the father’s answers to better understand the man you’re dating. For instance, while he may have criticisms about the mother that are perfectly valid, be wary if he places 100% of the blame for everything that’s ever gone wrong entirely on her. Judge for yourself how well he’s able to assess a situation objectively and accept responsibility for his part in it.

, Know that you’ll be facing many more variables than you would be in a relationship with a single man without children. Understand that the father’s relationship with the mother may change over time, for better or for worse. Appreciate the fact that the child’s thoughts and feelings may alter as well, both as they age and as your own status in their lives changes. Expect to face far more stress and challenges than you’ve grown accustomed to in childless relationships.Think positively! While it’s important to be realistic about the situation that you’re entering, don’t let challenges and stress dissuade you from pursuing a future with the father if you think it’s worth it. Remember that challenges met and overcome can be rewarding experiences in their own right.

, Ask yourself how much importance you really place on reaching these steps together as mutual “firsts” in your life journey.At the same time, consider the fact that you’ll have a partner who has prior concrete experience with things that, for now, are only hypothetical for you personally. Whether it’s committing to a long-term relationship or having another child, you’ll have a partner with more intimate knowledge about the situation as a whole and what to expect, as well as more self-knowledge about his own capabilities in that situation.

, Once you’ve considered the reality of dating a single father, reevaluate what you honestly need from a relationship. Based on that, ask yourself if you can really expect those needs to be fulfilled in these circumstances. Decide then whether to walk away or continue dating.


If you’re only seeking a casual relationship, let the father know. If he’s fine with that, continue to date without involving yourself at all in the child’s life.
If you want to keep things casual but he wants more, or if you’d like to pursue a deeper relationship as well but feel way too daunted by the circumstances, let him know that there’s a conflict of interest here. Tell him that, while you like him just fine, the situation is simply too much for you. Don’t allow yourself to be backed into a situation that you can’t handle.
If you’re willing to commit to a long-term relationship and become part of the child’s life, find out as much as you can about what you’re walking into. Ask other people in similar circumstances about their own experiences. Seek professional help about what to expect. Find out more about the child and their mother, both from the father and from any other mutual acquaintances you may have for a more rounded view. Every situation is different, so learn as much as you can about your own before taking the bigger plunge.

Know from the start what he expects from your relationship together as well as your future relationship with his child., Resist the urge to please. Avoid taking on more responsibility than you’re comfortable with or obligated to accept. Clearly define yourself as a source of support for him, the parent, and not a parent yourself.Due to learned gender roles, widowers and male divorcees may often finding themselves lacking in certain parental skills possessed by the mother.To compensate, the father may hope for you to step in and fill the mother’s role, whether or not he’s even conscious of it. Make it clear to him that his duty is to learn these skills himself and not merely replace the mother with you., Whether you’re dating casually or already madly in love, avoid rushing into the relationship at any step. Appreciate the fact that your status as a couple will almost certainly be an upheaval in his child’s life. Avoid upsetting the child’s world by stepping into it too quickly.

, Emphasize honesty for the child’s sake. Accept the fact that your situation will produce a large amount of stress and potentially negative feelings. Express any doubts or misgivings that either you or the father may have. Know where each of you stand at any given point in time, especially before making the larger step of involving yourself in his child’s life."

Honor the deceased.",How to Date a Man Who Has a Child when You Don't3," Know where they stand with each other. Find out whether their split was amicable, bitter, or somewhere in between.If their current relationship is openly vicious, brace yourself for the extra drama and stress that this will undoubtedly add to your own relationships with the father and his child.If their current relationship is quite friendly, politely but firmly establish yourself as the father’s new partner. Appreciate the fact that the two have a prior intimacy that may inform their interactions, but don’t be afraid to speak up when you believe either one has crossed a line., Remember that she’s the child’s parent. Understand that she will always occupy a space in the child’s life, and vice versa. Accept the fact that, to some degree, you will have to hold yourself accountable to her as a presence in her child’s life.Even if she’s a negligent or otherwise poor parent, remember that her status as mother will never change. Don’t feel obligated to respect the woman, but do respect the fact that she will always play some sort of role in both the father and child’s life.

, Even if you can’t stand each other, make a point of being civil. Earn respect and/or the moral high ground by showing respect in order to better ensure a positive atmosphere for all concerned, especially the child.Also be aware that the child will feel more loyalty toward their mother than they will toward you.Earn their respect by always treating their mother with courtesy.

, If the father is a widower, accept the mother’s continued presence in both his life and the child’s. Allow them to speak freely of her so they can honor her memory and so you can evaluate how each is coping with their loss. Although a jealous twinge here and there may be a perfectly natural knee-jerk reaction, avoid poisoning your relationships by making the father and/or child feel like they must suppress her memory in your presence."

Talk it over with the father first.,
Wait a little longer.,
Keep it simple.,
Take it slowly.,
Imagine the child’s perspective.,
Establish your role.,
Keep taking it slowly.,
Maintain your role when challenged.,
Respect the mother in their child’s presence.,
Be patient.",How to Date a Man Who Has a Child when You Don't4," Be sure of your own relationship before beginning one with his child. If either one of you still feels more casual than committed toward the other, forego any involvement with the kid. Avoid disrupting the child’s life prematurely or unnecessarily., If you and the father both feel ready for you to meet his child, give yourself some extra time before actually doing it.Allow yourself more time to get cold feet. If you do have second thoughts, ask yourself whether it’s just jitters or a sign that you’re really not quite ready for this.

, Take a baby-step approach to entering their life. For your first introduction, plan no more than an opportunity to say hi to the child and then introduce yourself as a friend of their dad’s.Choose a low-key setting to meet.Keep it casual as opposed to a formal setting where you would be clearly identified as the father’s “date.”
Pick a time and place that are both clearly part of the father and child’s time together, rather than a date between yourselves with the child in tow.
Plan to make a brief appearance and then exit by yourself, leaving them alone together, so that your presence comes across as incidental. Avoid leaving the child with the impression that you’re “taking Daddy away.”

, Increase the time you spend together very gradually. Pop up here and there to say hi and establish that you’re a presence in Dad’s life, but limit your exposure in the beginning so that the majority of the kid’s time with Dad is spent one-on-one with him., As you spend more time with them, remain conscious of what impressions the child might take away from your encounters. Prioritize the father-child relationship. Be careful not to come across as competition for Dad’s attention., Once you and the father have made the child aware of your relationship, assume your role as the father’s new partner. Make it clear to the child that you’re not here to be the new “Mom” or another “Dad.” Equate yourself with the role of aunt, uncle, or a similarly respected adult figure with an invested interest in their well-being, like a teacher., Allow the child time to accept your new role in their life. Understand that even once they do accept it, their acceptance may not develop into an emotional bond. Accept this as a reality. Avoid trying to force a bond between you.In the meantime, be present and consistent in their lives, offering yourself as an added resource for them should they ever choose to make use of it.

, No matter how well-adjusted or behaved the child is, expect them to act out at times as all children do.Be prepared for a delicate balancing act. When confronting the child, expect to hear that you are not their mom or dad. Accept the truth of that statement.At the same time, assert yourself as an adult figure to whom they must show some respect.Demand support from the father. Remind him that while your role is to support him as a parent, his role is to be the parent. Don’t allow yourself to be backed into the position of being the disciplinarian by default., Remember that they will most likely continue to feel more loyalty toward their mother than toward you.Regardless of your personal feelings toward her, be careful what you utter within earshot of their child. Don’t lose the child’s respect by disrespecting their mother in front of them.

, Accept the fact that your new role in the child’s life will test them continually. Expect them to take a while to accept your presence. Also expect their progress to be upset by each milestone that you and their father achieve; for instance, while they may have grown to accept your role as Dad’s new partner, they may be knocked back a couple steps once you and Dad announce that you’ll be moving in together or getting married."

Practice ""the lean.""",How to Date a Short Guy As a Tall Girl," When trying to date online, don't filter out guys based on height. You might be filtering out someone who's actually perfect for you just because he's a few inches shorter than you'd like. In fact, try not to specifically mention a height you want in your profile, as it can turn some people off.For instance, if you mention your height or you say, ""Only tall guys!"" many guys may figure you don't want to date them and move on, even great guys.
The same is also true in real life. Don't dismiss a guy who's striking up a conversation with you just because he's an inch or two shorter.;
, That is, many women feel like they need to be with a taller guy because they feel insecure about their own size. Having a taller guy makes them feel smaller, and subsequently, more feminine. However, how you feel about yourself shouldn't be based on how your body relates to your guy's body. You need to feel secure in your own body to feel secure in a relationship with a shorter guy.Start by thinking about why you're finding it hard to be with a shorter guy. Does he make you feel too large? Are you embarrassed to be taller? Spend some time exploring your feelings.
Try to change your thinking. Being shorter than a guy doesn't make you more feminine. It doesn't make you a giant to be taller than your boyfriend. Only you can decide if you feel feminine (if that's what you want) or unfeminine.
Spend some time affirming yourself in the mirror. You could say, ""I love the soft wave of my hair."" Building your confidence this way can help you get over some of your insecurities.

, That is, maybe you shouldn't wear your tallest heels if you're going on a first date with a short guy. That doesn't mean you should slouch--own your height. However, there's no need to draw attention to the height difference by adding more inches. Also, try to skip any comments about the height difference unless he brings it up with a joke.

, Just like you probably don't like people cracking jokes because you're tall, he probably doesn't like hearing jokes about how short he is. Try to skip the wisecracks, particularly when you're first starting out., If you've mostly dated guys who are taller than you, it may take you some time to adjust, and that's okay. You can even date other guys while you're adjusting, as long as you all agree you're not exclusive. Give yourself the time you need to get to know him and adjust your feelings about his height.Remind yourself that him being shorter than you doesn't make him less of a man and that you being taller than him doesn't make you less of a woman.

, That is, if you're concerned about the height difference, you're somewhat focused on the externals. Instead, think about what you like about him as a person, such as his charm, his wit, his intelligence, or his compassion. You can't build a relationship on height alone, but you can build a relationship on personality., If you have a guy who's significantly taller than you, you really have to strain to kiss him. With a shorter guy, you're more likely to be closer in height, making kissing easier. Pay attention when you're saying goodnight to him, and appreciate the fact that you can kiss him without pulling a muscle., Height really does open some doors, so guys who are shorter have to work harder to get ahead. That turns out to be a bonus for you because studies have shown that shorter guys usually do more of the housework than taller guys., While at first being taller than your boyfriend may make you feel tall and out of place, try to look at it another way. That is, most models are on the taller side, so standing next to him makes you look more like a model, not tall and gangly., While a short guy with a tall girl isn't as common as the opposite (a short girl and tall guy), you'll find many happy couples in the world who are similar in heights to you and your guy. Once you've observed a few couples (whether ones you know, a couple in public, or even celebrities), you'll likely find that they don't care at all about the height difference. Rather, they just care about loving each other., That is, when you're trying to meet guys or when you're going out with a shorter guy, you shouldn't feel you need to hide your height. Most people find confidence sexy, so don't try to slouch or hunch over, as that will just make you appear like you're ashamed of it. Instead, stand up straight, look people in the eye, and flash a big smile.Of course, once you're dating someone, you may decide you want to even out your heights a bit, but that is totally up to you.

, If you don't want to emphasize your height difference, you can stick to flats most of the time rather than wearing heels. As a bonus, you're feet likely won't hurt as much!If you want to wear heels, try a shorter pair, rather than the 4- to 5-inch variety.

, One way to even out your height differences, particularly when you're wearing heels, is to lean a little bit to the side by sticking out a hip. Obviously, you need something to lean on, such as your boyfriend. You don't want to slouch. Rather, you just want to look casual, putting you at a more even height with your boyfriend."

Check his age.,
Get familiar with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.,
Dress modestly.,
Remember to be yourself.,
Understand the Mormon lifestyle.,
Know the Law of Chastity.",How to Date a Mormon Guy," Is he over 16? If he is not 16 yet, don't date him yet. Mormons are taught in ""For the Strength of Youth"" not to date until they are at least 16. If the Mormon guy you want to date is 16 or over, that is great! You can ask him out.;
, It may be safer to get familiar with the church so that you can understand more of the guy you are dating. Get to know his culture and background. For example, don't ask ""So, how many moms do you have?"" because polygamy was stopped in the church in the late 1800s. Ask him questions. Mormons are usually happy to share their beliefs. Be respectful.

, All Mormon guys will admit they are often more attracted to and have more respect for girls who cover their bodies. Avoid wearing sleeveless shirts, low cut shirts, short shorts, short skirts, and anything that exposes your body immodestly. Always cover yourself, and have a nice appearance. The Mormon guy you are dating will highly appreciate you.

, Be kind, and respect his beliefs. You may find it difficult to be yourself while following this guy's standards; realize that some people just aren't meant to be together.

, Praying before meals. This is usually done at home and with family and not in restaurants. (If you don't know how what to do during a prayer being said, close your eyes and fold your arms. You will see others around you doing the same.)


Attending Seminary. Seminary is a religious class on the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and other scriptures. It is held before or during school. Children attend while they are in high school; 9th-12th grade. When in college, Mormons go to Institute, which is the same as seminary but for college students.

, Mormonism, along with many other Christian faiths, follows the law of chastity. This means Mormons do not have sex until after they are married. They also do not live with people they are in a relationship with until they are married. So do not participate in passionate kissing, lying on top of the other person or touching the private, sacred parts of another person’s body with or without clothing.

Ponder what actually embarrasses you.,
Consider whether these qualities truly are embarrassing.,
Come to terms with the “embarrassing” traits or qualities.,
Figure out if the embarrassing aspect is something you can talk about together.",How to Date a Man/Woman Who Embarrasses You," Do you get embarrassed over a few off color jokes he/she tells or does his/her shrill laugh at an intimate cocktail party make the small hairs on the back of your neck stand on end? In order to successfully date someone who may embarrass you, you have to come to terms with what exactly mortifies you.


Physical features. Perhaps no one has told your significant other that the 1980’s were a few decades ago or a solid hair washing isn’t a priority. Some physical or style features that may not bother one person may be appalling to another.
Personality. From dating a “close talker” to someone who drops the “f” bomb like candy, some aspects of his/her personality may be pushing you over the edge.
Social interaction. Some folks act differently in social situations. For example, during a cocktail party, your date may ask inappropriate questions or get just a little too hammered at your office holiday party.
Education/worldliness. The fact that your honey didn’t realize that they were still fighting in the Middle East embarrasses you or his/her grammar isn’t quite up to snuff.;
, If you really like this person, think about whether these qualities are really all that disconcerting.


Could it be you, not him/her? Could you be approaching the relationship like a teenager? To many teens, literally “everything” and “everyone” is completely embarrassing and you may finding fault in just about everything he/she does.
Is this something that perhaps only you finds to be embarrassing? In some cases, you may be the only one who is embarrassed that your date isn’t a snappy dresser or loves to dye his/her hair purple on occasion. Take an honest look at what is really embarrassing and whether you could be too sensitive.

, If you are going to continue dating this person you are either going to have to embrace the traits that make you cringe or end the relationship.


Think of the trait as endearing. So he/she mixes plaids and stripes, or leaves the house looking like a homeless person---it’s part of his/her personality and likely part of the reason why you fell for this person.
Ignore the behavior or trait. If he/she laughs too loudly at movies or wears funny hats resign yourself to ignoring and just enjoying his/her company. Why get upset or uncomfortable due to a little quirk?
Excuse yourself from situations where the behavior or trait rears it’s head. If you just can’t move past it, leave the room or excuse yourself for a few minutes to collect yourself. So when you hear him/her tell the joke about the jackass, the teacher and the plumber again…you know it’s time to make a graceful exit.

, Perhaps if he/she knew something he/she did embarrassed you, something could be done to minimize or eliminate the behavior or trait.


Have you been dating long enough to be totally honest? Of course if you’ve been dating only a short time, you may want to hold off on a talk. However, if you know each other well, take some time to tell him/her how you feel, but do so in a private setting.
Can you present your position without sounding like a jerk? Telling someone that they are embarrassing isn’t the easiest (or the nicest) thing to do. Consider if you can approach your boyfriend/girlfriend about the matter without coming off sounding shallow or mean.
Try to determine if your boyfriend/girlfriend would automatically take offense to a discussion or may be open to hearing how you feel. Does your squeeze tend to be defensive about certain things or may be open to hearing what you have to say? It may not even be worth telling your boyfriend/girlfriend about how you feel if it will only result in a fight or hurt feelings.

Talk to his friend.,
Make sure your date knows.,
Be nice.,
Be considerate.,
Rebuild.,
Make sure your boyfriend is a part of everything.,
Help him move on.,
Beware.",How to Date a Guy when His Best Friend Likes You," Sit down with your partner's friend. Remember to explain this kindly but be very clear. You need to tell them that your feelings are with their friend and that you want to commence a relationship with that person. If they try to continue this relationship confront the person again. Tell him that hitting on you any further will make you think less of him. If it gets even worse and he still won't leave you alone, try telling the guy you like, maybe he will try to reason with his best friend. Usually, this is a time to think about your actions towards him carefully one small step at a time. When you tell him you want to date another guy be nice and careful when you tell him.;
, Talk to your date about the conversation you had with his friend so that he knows as well about his friend's feelings for you and can be aware if he tries anything on you. Remember to be respectful of the other boy. They are good friends. Hopefully, your date's friend will not harbor any ill feelings towards your date, because if he does he would be proving to be a very lousy friend. Don't be afraid to talk to your date because you think he might choose his friend over you. If he does, drop him like a hot potato because you deserve better. If he chooses you and this leads to their friendship cooling off, do not feel guilty. It wasn't your fault. People gain and lose friends all the time. Be sure that if he does dump you that you have done your best at any cost to explain.

, Don't show him that you are sad or he might want to keep you a little closer to him. Not only do they not feel them for you, they feel them for your friend. Let him down gently because if you do end up dating the guy you want to date, this friend will still be a part of his life and yours too. Being rude may hurt your possible relationship. Consider the possibility of him talking bad about you to your date.

, Being rejected hurts everybody, even the toughest of us all. It is important that you remember this. Do not go taunting your newfound happiness with his friend in front of him until you are sure that all his feelings for you are completely gone. It will only make him miserable and jealous. When you and your date are around this person keep it low key in the romance department but a happy and positive vibe to help him recover. If he still is having a hard time getting over it, for a while afterward try to build him up but don't make it so that he might get led onto that you like him. Tell him you think he is a fun person (if you indeed think so, remember, be honest) but that you are not attracted to him. It will help him realize that you want to be friends, not anything more.

, Because of this guy's presence in your date's life, it is important you build a connection with him based on friendship, not love. He will hurt for a while after your initial rejection but as time passes, it will get easier for him. When it does set about trying to build a friendship with him. Encourage him to join you in group outings and participate, If he really did have feelings for you eventually he will be happy that you and his friend are happy. Do not, I repeat, do not baby him. He is not a small child, he is a grown man, and while yes rejection hurts us all, he does not get extra coddling just because he is your dates friend.

, Let him know that you are doing your best to be friends with this person. He will most likely appreciate it. If you are worried that he may be thinking you are spending to much time with his friend in your efforts to become friends, think it over because you might be. Make sure you are communicating with him and have a relationship built on mutual trust.

, This is optional. It is not your job to find him a girlfriend. If he has been a good sport and has respected you and agreed to be just friends, and if you are happy that you have found happiness, maybe give something back to the universe and help him find someone new. Suggest date nights between you and your date (if he gets over you) and him with a friend of yours. Suggest some cool girls he could approach at a bar or school. Initially after rejection, this is going to be the last thing he wants to do but as time passes, re-entering the dating world will come. If you care about your date then it would be cool if you also cared about the important people in his life.


If you do not want to do this, ask your date to do it, after all, that is what friends are for. Anyway, he should be happy to do it, especially if it means getting his friend to stop looking at you the same way he does.
If nothing else works, do not avoid him. Do not let him affect your decisions. If you want to go hang out with your date you go do that. If he is there and tries to talk to you, and you don't feel comfortable with it tell him that and walk away.
Give him a serious talk. If he is ignoring all your efforts to be a friend and acts inappropriately toward you, it is time for straight talk. Be direct and maybe even blunt if he is just not getting the message. Make sure that you make it clear to him that you are interested in his friend, not him. You have to get the message to him one way or another, and it may have to be somewhat rude if all else fails.

, If you make the friend mad, that friend can easily turn on you and lie about you to your date. Depending on how long you have known your date, this could easily turn your date against you, especially if your date doesn't know that this friend likes you romantically. Make sure to have a conversation about the friend who likes you to your date. Also, make sure he knows you only like him and want nothing to do with the friend. Communication is key, make sure your boyfriend knows what's up. Still, if his friend turns around in spite of your efforts to be kind to him, then do not be afraid to spite him. Stop caring about how he feels because he clearly does not care how you feel. If he does try to turn your boyfriend against you (if you have talked to him), hopefully, your date is confident enough in your relationship to trust you. But if he believes his friend's lies over you (no matter how long you have been dating), then you may be dating the wrong person. Just be careful.

Share common interests.",How to Date a Millionaire," There are a variety of websites that focus exclusively on finding mates for wealthy individuals, including DateAMillionaire.com and MillionaireMatch.com, which makes it easy to find a prospective partner with millions in the bank. Keep in mind that there tend to be more wealthy men on these sites than women, so you have better odds if you’re looking for a boyfriend.To improve your chances of getting a millionaire to look at your online dating profile, have a professional photo taken. You don’t necessarily need to go for a full-on glam look, but a high quality profile pic can make a big difference.
If there’s an option to include more than one photo in your profile, post as many as possible. It can help set you apart from the crowd.
When possible, incorporate humor into your profile. A fun, lighthearted profile is more likely to stand out than one that outlines your entire dating history.
Make sure to proofread your profile carefully for grammar and spelling mistakes. A millionaire is likely on the hunt for a high quality person, and it’s the little details that they’ll pay attention to.;
, Many wealthy, successful people prefer a more personal, hands on approach to finding a possible partner than online sites provide. Matchmaking businesses run background checks on all potential partners, and even conduct simulated dates with clients to get a better feel for what they want in prospective mate. To make it into the prospect pool, you’ll probably need to complete a questionnaire with details, including your education, professional, and travel history, as well as your height and weight, and pay an application fee.The best way to find a matchmaking service in your area is to search online. Google matchmaking and the name of your town to see if there are any nearby that are accepting applications.
If your application is accepted by the service, you’ll likely have to go through an interview process, which may be a one-on-one appointment or a group meet-and-greet event.

, If you’d rather meet a millionaire on your own, you’ll need to hang out at the types of places that wealthy people typically frequent. Because they enjoy the finer things in life, you can usually find them at five star hotels, hotel bars, and steakhouses. Identify the posh restaurants and bars in your area, and hang out at the bar to meet some high-powered, successful people.The best time to hit the upscale bars and restaurants in your area is between 5 and 7 in the evening. People who’ve been busy with business meetings all day will often visit at the end of a long work day for a dinner or drinks., Millionaires are used to having the best of the best in their lives, so they want a partner who brings a lot to the table. Physical appearance definitely matters, but having a good personality and intellect is also important. That means you should make sure that you look neat and attractive, but also be able to engage in interesting conversation.To make a good impression, dress to impress on your date. Forget jeans and a t-shirt, and go for a more polished look, such as your best cocktail dress or suit and tie. Make sure that your clothing fits well too.
Just as with any potential partner, a millionaire may be looking for specific traits in a significant other, such as a love of the outdoors or an Ivy League degree. As you get to know him or her better, you'll be able to tell if you're really a good fit for each other.

, On your first few dates, it’s best to avoid controversial or potentially uncomfortable topics of conversation, such as politics, finances, or failed relationships in your past. Instead, make an effort to keep things lighthearted, and try to get to know your date on a more personal level. Ask about their hobbies, pets, and other playful topics.While you don’t want to be intrusive, it’s important to be curious, so your date knows that you’re genuinely interested. Ask follow up questions that show that you’re really listening to what he or she has to say.

, Millionaires are often wary of people being interested in them solely because of their money, so you want to make sure that your date knows you genuinely care about who he or she is as a person. You can do that by being enthusiastic about his or her interests and background. If he or she wants to share a special experience with you, such as a ride on his or her boat, let your millionaire know how excited you are to go. Don’t fake it. If you aren’t a fan of polo, don’t pretend that your millionaire’s story about his team is the most exciting thing you’ve ever heard. If you don’t like horses, don’t pretend that you can’t wait to go horseback riding with him. He’ll likely be able to see through your act, which will probably turn him off.
You shouldn’t only be excited when you’re going to expensive restaurants or clubs. If that’s how you feel, you’re probably not in the relationship for the right reasons.

, In any relationship, honesty is crucial, but it can be especially important with a millionaire. That’s because wealthy, successful people are often used to people using them for their money and connections, so they want to find a loyal, sincere partner who they can trust. Honestly communicate your intentions and feelings in the relationship, and expect the same in return.If money becomes an issue in your relationship, be honest about that too. For example, if you’re uncomfortable with how your partner is always picking up the tab or showering you with expensive gifts, let him or her know.

, Because most millionaires are highly successful and used to getting what they want, they usually want to have a similar sense of control in their personal lives. As a result, they’ll often want to be in the driver’s seat when it comes to your relationship. They may want to plan most of your dates and organize other social commitments according to their schedule, so you may need to be flexible and open-minded.While it’s important to understand that a millionaire is used to being in control of most things in his or her life, you shouldn’t allow your partner to dictate your entire relationship. For a relationship to work, your opinions, thoughts, and feelings must be just as valued as your partner’s.

, Dating a millionaire can be very exciting because of all the fancy restaurants, clubs, trips, and other perks. However, if you really want a relationship to thrive, there must be more drawing you to your partner than his or her bank account. Make sure that you share similar interests, such as traveling or sports.If you use an online dating site or matchmaking service, it can be easier to find a millionaire who has similar hobbies and interests. However, when you’re trying to meet a millionaire on your own, it may be more difficult to find the right one.
The fact that a prospective partner is a millionaire shouldn’t be enough to convince you to date him or her. You should be able to have fun with your partner, and understand what’s important to one another.

Recall the reasons why you wanted to date him in the first place.,
Consider why he loves to wear costumes.,
Establish ground rules.,
Embrace his love of wearing costumes.,
Decide if you can honestly live with the behavior.",How to Date a Man Who Always Wears Costumes," What made you decide that you wanted to date him? Was it his intellect or his style? Perhaps he was in a costume when you first met––you know he wore costumes regularly when you initially started dating? It may well be his sense of humor or belief in all things being possible that attracted you to him, as regular costume wearing often signifies a person comfortable with assuming other personas, stretching boundaries and having limitless imagination. It’s important you ask yourself questions about your initial attraction as your answers may reveal to you that the aspect of his personality that you adore is also the one that feeds his love of wearing costumes. Things to consider include:


He’s incredibly creative. If you sought a dude who is more imaginative than the average bear, you may (consciously or subconsciously) really love the fact he’s into dressing up.
He doesn’t care what others think of him. True evidence that he’s very self-assured and confident, a man who doesn't care less if someone makes fun of his costumes may be just the kind of person you’ve always wanted to hang around with, throughout your life.
He’s the boss. In line with being confident, if your man runs his own company and is an entrepreneur, he may feel as if he wants to dress up like Batman, then he should be able to go for it. There's nobody telling him not to, so why be the first?
He’s an actor, performer or an undercover cop. In some instances, your man has to wear a costume since it’s part of his gig. In this case, all will be revealed as you get to know him more.;
, If he’s wearing a costume every day, chances are he really enjoys dressing up. Try to remember when you were very young and how you may have enjoyed dressing up. Many adults say that they miss the days of make-believe and the societal acceptance of being able to become something they're not. Perhaps your boyfriend simply wants to play a superhero for the betterment of society.

In Dunedin, New Zealand, a costumed student has been delivering food and other items to students in need. Known as ""Flat Man"", the ""mysterious caped avenger"" has been doing good anonymously and people love it.If your costumed man has the spirit of an angel and is delivering help to those in need via his costume, admire his compassion and realize that your guy really is a superhero!
For additional reference, check out the film/graphic novel, “Kick-Ass.” Dave is a teen boy who decides to fight a persistent string of robberies and crime, but the only way he feels confident doing so is by wearing a costume. Is your man like the loveable character, Dave in “Kick-Ass?” To some Dave is awfully sexy.
On the other hand, if your man is acting like a vigilante and actually harming people while wearing the costume, then you should be very wary. Not only is acting like a vigilante illegal but your own safety may be at risk.

, While you may have fully accepted his love for costume wearing, average society typically does not accept a grown man’s passion for flamboyant accoutrements. Instead of banishing his Batman getup to the basement, establish rules that ensure common ground for both of you and to reassure you that the costume won't turn up when it's least wanted.

Determine what types of situations are off limits for wearing the costume. Whether it’s having dinner with your boss or parents or date night on Friday, come to an agreement as to when he cannot wear the costume. Be kind when explaining why this matters to you but also stay resolute––there are just certain times when the hidden persona is not welcome.
Identify situations where he should be able to wear the costume. If you're comfortable going shopping with him or going to the dog park in the costume, let him know this. He should have a clear understanding as to when he can wear the costume to avoid having an argument with you. But you should equally be prepared to make some compromises which show your love for him.
Keep the rules fluid. While you will want to make a few rules as to when and where he can wear the costume, let him know that nothing is set in stone. As you become more comfortable with his costumes, you may feel more flexible about when and where you are okay with him wearing it.
If it gets this far, consider what will happen at the wedding. Are you up for a costumed wedding? Or perhaps just a costumed wedding reception? If the two of you are serious about staying together, this is likely to be an issue when discussing wedding options.

, Take an interest in his passions for costume wearing. For example, if vintage is his thing and he simply likes dressing up like a 1940’s gangster, explore other aspects of retro-ware including frequenting swing clubs, checking out films of the time and listening era music. You may end up becoming a devotee too!


If he is attending an event or a performance when in costume, ask if you can come along too. This will allow you to see how other people who love wearing costumes interact and you'll get to see what all the buzz is about. You may even want to join in! Be open-minded––you just don't know until you've allowed yourself to investigate some more.

, Be true to yourself––you owe it to the both of you. If you honestly feel too embarrassed or annoyed by his desire to dress up, tell him. If wearing the costume is a priority to him, then you need to make some tough, personal decisions. If you feel as if you are constantly embarrassed or feel the need to make excuses or hide him, it may be time to part ways. On the other hand, if you choose to see this as an occasion for your own personal growth and expansion of your ability to accept difference in your life, you may just find yourself strengthening your own ability to tolerate and let live. Which is always a good thing for every human being.

Realize that you have your own quirks. If you accept his love of costumes, he may be far happier to accept your need to get tattoos, wear a nose ring, party all hours, devote yourself to running a marathon, whatever. Relationships are about tolerance and give-and-take and your acceptance will usually be repaid in kind.

Understand that the firm “owns” your target.,
Prepare to have spirited conversations.,
Embrace your own career and independence.,
Decide if this is the life for you.",How to Date a Lawyer," In most cases, unless your attorney works for the government, his/her entire career is based on billable hours. This means that the law firm partners will be counting on the attorney to work on cases as often as possible--including weekends and evenings.


Be cool when he/she has to cancel dinner or weekend plans. Be flexible with your time and understand that if he/she has to cancel at the last time, the decision may not be his/her own.
Ask about your attorney date’s goals. He/she may want to make partner relatively quickly, which means that more hours in the office or in court may be required.
Have a flexible approach to dating. You may have arranged for a romantic dinner for two at a restaurant that took months to obtain a reservation, but then he/she has to work. Instead of sulking or ditching him/her, create a picnic dinner and show up at the office instead.;
, While not all attorneys thrive on full-blown debate opportunities with everyone, chances are if you are dating a lawyer, he/she will enjoy engaging in lively conversation on a variety of topics.


Avoid being intimidated by his/her law degree if you are in a debate. Just because your date went to law school does not put him/her in a position of power over you. Be confident in your own knowledge and intelligence and be comfortable to discuss a wide range of topics.
Learn when to agree to disagree. There’s no point getting into a spat over a difference of opinion. While perhaps your attorney mate may be used to a fiery conversation with colleagues and then go back to business as usual, let him/her know that once things get a little too heated you’d rather just agree to disagree (rather than get into a knock down, drag out fight).
Identify topics that are off limits. Perhaps its politics or religion, but find those hot button topics that make your blood boil (and where you differ in opinion) and agree to leave those topics off the table.

, An attorney is going to be happier dating someone who is just was passionate about his/her career so instead of waiting for the phone to ring, dig deep into your job or passion.


Adopt the “work hard, play hard” mantra. If you put in a 12-hour day you may not feel like hitting the clubs after work. However, commit to a fun activity once the weekend hits such as a pub-crawl, venturing into the city or even getting out of town.
Make him/her wait for you sometimes too. Your attorney boyfriend/girlfriend doesn’t dump work the minute you snap your fingers so don’t be expected to do the same every time he/she has a free minute.
Decide whether you will discuss work while on dates or leave it behind. Some couples do better if work is kept out of the relationship, whereas others thrive on discussing what they did during their professional day.

, If you prefer to date someone who can be at your beck and call at a moment’s notice you may be better off dating someone from another profession.


Many non-attorney spouses spend a considerable amount of time on their own. Whether he/she is in trial or traveling, getting serious with an attorney may mean that you won’t have as much time together as you would with someone from another discipline.
Look beyond the money. While many attorneys make a sizable income, it comes at a price. Decide what is most important to you--can you live comfortably, but with limited time with your partner or is money not enough?

Focus on one specific feature.,
Make the compliment about your date.,
Avoid sexually-charged compliments.,
Use compliments on appearance sparingly.While overdoing it with any type of compliment can make your date feel that you are trying too hard or not sincere, throwing out a lot of compliments focusing on your date's appearance is always a bad idea.,
Admire your date’s interests.,
Make your compliments specific.,
Point out your date’s inner beauty.,
Focus on your date's kindness.,
Tell your date that you like talking to them.,
Do not give backhanded compliments.,
Make sure that your compliments are genuine.,
Never give empty compliments.,
Avoid impersonal compliments.,
Don’t exaggerate.The best compliments are truthful compliments.If you exaggerate when you are complimenting your date, they will recognize it as a lie.",How to Compliment Your Date," While it’s nice to hear something general like ""You look so handsome,"" or ""You’re beautiful,"" it’s nicer still to have a compliment paid to a specific feature. Perhaps your date has naturally alluring eyes or full lips. Tell your date about your favorite part of their face and why. This will boost their self-esteem and self-confidence.It also might make your date more comfortable around you.;
, Rather than complimenting your date's clothing or makeup, make sure that you are complimenting your date.For example, instead of saying, “Nice lipstick,” or “I like your dress,” you might say, “You look sexy in red lipstick,” or “You really wear that dress well.” This way your compliment is directed at your date, which makes it feel more personal.You might tell your date, ""That blue shirt really brings out your eyes,"" or ""I like the way you look in those jeans.""

, If you are still early in your relationship and you want to compliment your date’s appearance, be sure that you don’t say anything that could come across as overly sexual or crass.If you’re on a first or second date and you think that telling your date that you like the way that his or her backside looks in those jeans is a compliment, think again. You’d do better your date that they have glowing skin, warm brown eyes, or shiny hair.

, This will give your date the impression that you are superficial and it might even demonstrate that you are objectifying his or her body, which could lead to the end of your relationship.


Try to limit compliments on your date's appearance to one or two at the most. For example, you might offer a compliment at the beginning of your date, when you first see each other, to let your date know you think they look great. Then you might mention a specific facial feature that you really find attractive later that evening.
If you want to compliment more, try to focus on his or her personality, sense of humor, or intellect.

, The things that make people deep and fascinating are their interests. As you get to know your date, try to find out what he or she loves, and then, compliment those interests. This shows your date that you see their depth and can appreciate that they've spent time learning about the things they enjoy.For example, if your date knows a lot about music, you might say, “I like how you know so much about jazz music. I feel like hanging out with you is going to teach me so much.”
You might tell your date, ""It is really interesting talking to you about your work. I never really thought about how interesting numbers can be, but when you talk you make it interesting!""

, Rather than telling your date that you like his or her sense of humor, instead analyze it just a bit.Focus on it until you can adequately describe what you like about it.


For instance, instead of just saying, ""You're funny,"" you might say, “I love that your sense of humor is so quirky. You can think of a pun for anything!” This type of compliment is more personal and shows your date that you've really been paying attention.

, Rather than focusing on superficial beauty, express your appreciation for his or her depth and character.Reinforce that your date is a beautiful human being inside and out.


For example, if you like that your date is driven and motivated, tell him or her, “You’re already so good looking, but your ambition just makes you that much more attractive! I love that you are so driven.”

, Letting your date know that you’ve recognized that he or she is kind and generous shows that you are paying attention and that you’re connecting with them on a deeper level.Maybe your date always holds the door for strangers, or maybe he or she gave up their seat to an elderly person on the subway. Let your date know that you see this generosity and that you appreciate it. You might say something like:


“I love how kind you were when you gave your seat up on the subway tonight.”
“I find your generous spirit quite sexy.”
“Your act of generosity, when you gave that homeless man your leftover food, was really inspiring.”

, Let them know that you appreciate being able to share your thoughts on a subject with them and being able to hear their thoughts on a subject in return. This way, you are celebrating your date's intellect and passion, and pointing out that you have much in common.


If you enjoy the philosophical conversations that you share over coffee, be sure to tell them. If you like listening to them talking about smart things, tell them so. If you find them easy to talk to, be sure to let them know., A backhanded compliment is an insult that is disguised as a compliment. Sometimes these might be completely unintentional, but that doesn't mean they won't hurt your date's feelings.For instance, if your date is a woman, avoid the backhanded compliment , ""Wow, you really drive great for a woman!"" This type of compliment suggests that you assumed she wouldn't be able to drive well just because she's a woman., If you compliment someone too often, you begin to sound disingenuous.You should also only compliment a person if you actually mean what you are saying. People are usually pretty good at recognizing fake compliments.

, Your compliment should be specific to the person you are delivering it to.If you give a general compliment that could be meant for anyone, it will sound empty and disingenuous., You want to make sure that you are tailoring your compliment to your date in a specific way.Everyone wants to be noticed and appreciated for who they are, so it is much more effective and meaningful if the compliment feels personalized.


For example, saying, “You look nice,” is nice but it’s not personal, and as far as compliments go, it’s a bit mediocre. Instead, you might say, “That blue shirt matches your eye color. You wear it really well.” This is a much better and more personal compliment as it shows that you’ve taken notice of your date's shirt and eye color, and that you think they look good.

,


Don’t say things like, “You’re the most beautiful woman that I’ve ever seen” if it isn't true.

If you and your partner are focused on talking over one another or trying to ""win"" an argument, your relationship will ultimately suffer.Focus on working together to solve issues that arise in your relationship.
Put aside your pride and try not to think of conversations as contests that are won or lost. This type of thinking will only damage your relationship.
Take your partner's thoughts, feelings, and input into consideration, even if you disagree. Ask him to do the same for you.
Try to find some type of middle ground that combines both of your opinions on the issue.
If you can't find any middle ground, try asking your boyfriend, ""How can we resolve this without either of us feeling like our needs aren't being met?"";
, Having fun with your boyfriend isn't just an enjoyable way to spend a day, it's also a way to strengthen your relationship. You should dedicate time to having fun together on a regular basis to help ensure a strong, satisfying relationship. If you're having fun doing things together, your relationship will only grow stronger.


Try to inject some spontaneity into your relationship. If you both have a day off with nothing planned, do something adventurous and unexpected together.
Spend some time snuggling together. You can do this while you watch TV or movies, or any time you're sitting next to one another.
Be silly around one another. You and your partner should feel comfortable expressing yourselves, even if it's in absurd or goofy ways.

, Every relationship needs a romantic component. Romance doesn't necessarily have to mean sex, though for many couples the two are related. Making time to show affection for one another, no matter how that is defined in your relationship, is important for you and your partner to bond and grow closer with one another.


Make your relationship a priority. Put off the extra work you brought home from the office and take time to do something special together, even if it's just getting dinner or watching TV.Physical intimacy is important. If you're not sexually active, you can still be intimate by kissing, giving one another massages, or simply holding hands on a regular basis.If you and your partner are sexually active, make sure you are both meeting each other's needs. Sex should be mutually enjoyable and emotionally satisfying; if it's not, let your boyfriend know what you need and ask him to do the same.

, If you're used to being single and have never had kids, dating a single parent can be an adjustment. While it's easy for you to make it to dates on time, it may not always be so easy for a single parent. It can make dating a single dad much easier in the long run if you understand this going into the relationship.Remember that his kids are probably his top priority. If arrangements with a babysitter fall through or an emergency arises, he may have to cancel plans at the last minute.
Be flexible with him if he has to cancel or postpone plans because of his kids. Remember that this is actually a sign that he's a good dad and a mature adult.

, Many divorced, single parents feel insecure and unstable. Divorce can be difficult, and some single parents worry that if the mother (or father) of their child didn't stay then a new dating partner might abandon them as well.Making him feel secure doesn't mean committing to a lifelong relationship; it just means you may need to offer reassurance and boost his self-esteem from time to time. Let him know that you find him very handsome and attractive, that you appreciate him, and try to do little things to show affection (like holding hands in public, for example).
Avoid asking about his ex unless he brings it up. Focus on building a strong relationship between the two of you.
Make sure your boyfriend makes you feel supported as well. Talk to him about ways you can mutually support one another in your relationship. For instance, you might tell him that you feel loved and appreciated when he compliments you. Ask him what makes him feel loved and supported — is it with compliments, physical affection, or something else?

, If you've never dated someone with kids before, you may not know much about interacting with them. He may also have his own expectations about your dynamic with his kids. It's important to discuss this thoroughly with your boyfriend, but only once things become serious between you.Remember that you're never going to replace the other parent in his kids' eyes.
You can still be affectionate and loving towards his kids, but you have to remember that they are ultimately his kids and not yours.
Let him know what your comfort level is and talk about setting boundaries accordingly (if needed).

, It may take a while before things are steady between you and your boyfriend and he decides to introduce you to his kids. That's okay; in fact, it's probably better that you don't rush into meeting his kids.If you're dating casually, things may end up fizzling out between you.
Kids can get attached to people very quickly and easily. Getting to know his kids if you're not serious about the relationship could end up hurting them.

, When you're ready to meet his kids (and when he thinks they're ready to meet you), it's best to meet in a setting that makes them as comfortable as possible. This can make it easier for them, which will make it easier for you as well.Suggest that you meet his kids at his house. That way you're in a space that's comfortable and familiar.
After you meet them and chat for a bit you can have a pizza dinner together and watch a family-friendly movie.

, After you've met his kids, you'll need to get to know them a little better; however, it's important to avoid rushing into this as well, since you don't want to overwhelm the kids or become an imposing figure.If he's comfortable with it, try spending some one-on-one time with his kids. This can help you get to know them and let them get to know you.
Offer to take his kids someplace they like, such as their favorite park or their favorite restaurant; however, make sure that this isn't somewhere his ex takes them, or the kids may feel like you're trying to replicate that experience.
Ease slowly into spending alone time with his kids. Pace yourself: start out spending a few hours alone with them once every week or two (if you're comfortable doing so) and take it from there.

, When you first meet his kids, they might be excited or they may be resistant. This is normal, and it's not a reflection of you or your potential to care for the kids. They're simply afraid of change, and meeting their dad's new significant other is a really big change for kids.Even if you're charming and affectionate, it can take kids time to adjust to new situations. If they're used to just being with your boyfriend and his ex, the kids may be a little standoffish with you at first.
Let the kids know that you're there for them. When they eventually come around to you, it's important that they know you want to support them any way you can.
If they're being resistant, say something like, ""I understand this must be difficult for you. I just want you to know that I care about your father and I care about you; I'm here if you ever want to talk.""

, This may be a sensitive subject. It takes a good deal of tact to ask properly about his ex, so it's important to choose your words and your timing carefully. You want to avoid sounding accusatory or insecure, which could sour your relationship, but it's still an important factor to learn about. With a little tact, though, you can overcome this awkward hurdle and better understand their dynamic.Make sure your relationship is somewhat serious before bringing up his ex. Asking about the ex is important, but doing it too soon could make it seem like you're trying to rush into things.
Ask in a respectful and genuine way. Say something like, ""I hope this isn't too intrusive, but things seem to be going well with us... Is it okay if I ask about your relationship with your ex?""
Try to ascertain from his response what his boundaries are with his ex. Do they hang out socially and call or text each other on a regular basis, or are they more focused on just keeping things cordial?

, The first time you meet his ex, it's probably going to be very awkward for everyone involved. There's no need to rush into this; in fact, you should probably put off meeting his ex until things are very serious between you and your boyfriend. Otherwise, his ex might feel like he's trying to stir up jealousy.If/when you do meet his ex, do so in a setting where the kids are absent. This kind of introduction can be tense for everyone, and kids can pick up on that tension.
You may want to meet in a neutral place, like a coffee shop or at a park. That way you avoid feeling like you're intruding on his ex's territory and vice versa.
Make sure your boyfriend is there when you meet his ex. It's important for you to meet his ex with him there to mediate things and act as the middle man.

, Whether your boyfriend and his ex are close friends or are very distant, you need to be respectful of their dynamic. The only exception might be if he still has feelings for his ex or vice versa; otherwise, their dynamic doesn't concern you, and neither does his ex's dynamic with their kids.


Just as his kids may worry you're trying to replace the other parent, his ex may also worry that you're trying to take over that role.
Never critique the ex, either directly (to his/her face) or indirectly (trash talking the ex with your boyfriend). Save the criticism for your friends, or just keep it to yourself or write it in a private journal.
Even if you've developed a good relationship with the kids, stand back and let the ex be their parent whenever they interact. You can fulfill your role at home; let his ex do the same with their kids.

, While it's important to respect his ex's role with the kids (and possibly in his life as well), you also have your own comfort level and your own emotional needs. If your boyfriend's relationship with his ex makes you uncomfortable in any way, it's important to convey your concerns and your needs to your boyfriend.


Be calm when you convey your discomfort. It should be a polite, respectful conversation, not an argument.
Setting boundaries may involve some give-and-take. It's not necessarily realistic or fair to demand that your boyfriend cut off all interaction with his ex, but you can politely ask him to limit phone calls/texts or social visits with his ex.

Let her vent and get the story out, just nodding and adding a small comment when necessary. If she doesn’t want to tell you, don’t pressure her. Some girls don’t like to talk about why they’re so upset. If this is the case, just tell her that you care and let her cry it out. ""How're you feeling?""
""Hey, is something bothering you lately?""
""You seem upset. What's going on?""
""I'm here to listen if you want someone to talk to."";
, It doesn’t matter if you don't agree with her issues. Reassure her that you’re there for her. Take her to a private spot and tell her that it’s alright to cry. Ensure her that you’re on her side.


""I know that this must feel terrible right now. I'm so sorry.""
""I can't imagine how you feel. I know this can't be easy.""
""I’m sorry that you’re upset. Please let me know if I can do anything to make it better.”

, Just showing someone that you see and understand their problem means the world. Keep it short and simple.


""I am so sad to hear that your mom is sick.""
""I know you really deserved that promotion. I'm sorry it didn't work out.""
""She was a great friend, and I'm upset she's moving away too."", Most people are upset because there is no easy solution. So don't try to offer her one. She's more than likely thought it all out before, and your advice will just keep her circling around how ""hopeless"" her problems are. Instead, say:


""This must be really hard for you.""
""I wish I had an answer or solution. Just know that I'm here for you no matter what.""
""What do you think comes next?""
""How do you want to handle this?"", This one can be hard, but as long as you let her take the lead you can help her get a hold of her feelings. Get her to open up about how she feels instead of the situation or the outcome by drawing on your personal experience. Labeling the feelings will help her control them:


""I know you really wanted that job. I would be really let down in your shoes.""
""You absolutely have a right to be sad; I would be too.""
""I know you're angry and upset right now. I understand, and it sucks."", This is very important. While supporting her, constantly remind her that things will get better. She’s going to be looking to you for advice, so make sure not to be negative. Bring your positive energy to the conversation and she will slowly, but surely, start to pick up on it.""Let it out. You know that, however terrible, these feelings will pass.""
""Let's remember the good moments together. Remember when...""
""This sucks right now, I know. But I will be here for you until things feel better.""

, At the end of the day, remember that you aren't there to make things magically better, you're there to support her. Telling her ""it's no big deal"" or that ""you went through the same thing"" will make her feel like you don't take her seriously. Things not to say include:


""You were too good for that job anyway. They're not even worth your time."" Clearly, since she's upset, she thinks it was worth her time.
""I know exactly how you feel."" Everyone's problems are unique -- you don't know exactly how she feels, and she'll sense it.
""You're so strong -- you'll be fine."" Sometimes people need some time not to be strong. Don't make her feel like she can't be vulnerable unless she looks ""weak.""
""I know this is terrible. Did I tell you about the time I......"" This isn't about your past problems, so don't try and change the subject., This doesn’t mean be passive. Rather, you should watch, wait, and know when to act.It may take a while for your girlfriend to open up depending on how upset she is. Knowing when to act will only be possible through communication. Consistently ask her if she’s ready to talk about it.


Only leave her alone if she tells you to. Even if she seems angry or upset, stay with her until she has calmed down.

, Light touching works wonders. It releases the hormone oxytocin. This hormone elevates feelings of attachment, connection, trust, and intimacy.If you’re holding hands, run your thumb over her knuckles or rub small circles on the back of her hand. You can also place one hand on her shoulder or the small of her back for the same effect.


Holding hands is a great stress reliever. This simple act increases a sense of trust and security and lowers cortisol (“stress hormone”) levels., Be firm but gentle-soft rocking or patting on the back is fine if you need to calm her down a bit before you can talk. Remember, you’re hugging her to help comfort her, so ensure that she feels safe and protected.


Hugs provide a sense of security. We are wired to find touch reassuring., A gentle touch or hug is plenty to comfort your girlfriend. If she wishes to kiss you, she will.

But if he’s the kind of guy who gets his energy from other people and who is always laughing and feels engaged when other people are around, then setting up a low-pressure social outing can actually make him feel better.


Try to make the event alcohol-free as much as you can. Even if drinking will temporarily make your boyfriend forget his problems, it will end up making him feel worse. Alcohol is a depressant, after all.
If you and your boyfriend do end up hanging out with friends when he’s upset, be sensitive to his needs. If he wants to go home early, you should be respectful of that.;
, Who says you’re too old for Monopoly or Clue? Pick a game you both used to love when you were kids, or one that you still play sometimes, and spend a night together, or with another two or three friends, playing board games and having a fun, simple night. Make some popcorn or bring out a few snacks, like Cheez-Its or Fruit Roll-Ups, that remind you of your childhoods, and make a fun night of it.


This will work best if your boyfriend isn’t really competitive when it comes to games. You don’t want to end up making him more upset because he keeps losing property in Monopoly.
You can even go to Target or another store together and tell him to pick out any game he wants. This may seem corny, but it could cheer him up for sure!

, Think about it: is there something your boyfriend has always wanted to do or try, whether it’s to check out the new deep dish pizza place in town or to watch Twin Peaks? As long as it’s fairly simple and doesn’t require a lot of emotional energy, you can surprise him with how thoughtful you are by setting up an evening to do something that he’s always wanted to do.


Of course, don’t push it. You don’t want to make a reservation at an expensive restaurant he’s been wanting to try when he’s just not feeling it. But if there’s a simple or low-pressure activity you two can do together, then you should try it.

, If your boyfriend needs to be cheered up over something that isn’t super serious, then one of the best things you can do is to get him out of the house. Just being around people, breathing some fresh air, and letting the sun hit his face can have a big impact on his mood and can make him feel less alone. If he’s been sitting in a dark room sulking all day, then of course he’s going to be upset. But if you make him come out, even if it’s just to take a quick walk, it can have a big impact on his mood.


It may help to give him a short goal instead of just saying you want to go outside. Telling him you want to walk to get some coffee or to run a quick errand can make the trip outside have more of a purpose.
If you’re both doing something inside you can easily do outside, such as reading, then try to get him to do the same thing in a park so it doesn’t feel like he’s exerting too much effort.

, Get your boyfriend out of the house to go hiking, running, walking, or to throw around a Frisbee or to kick around another soccer ball. It doesn’t really matter what you do, but it does matter that you get your boyfriend’s endorphins going and that you help him get out and about a bit more. Even hitting up the gym together for half an hour can have a major impact on his mood. If he’s bummed out but not so upset that he can’t leave the house, then making time for some exercise together can help cheer him up.


When your boyfriend is upset, he’s much more likely to stay in one place, to eat unhealthy foods, and to pay less attention to his body. Being active together can help get him out of that rut.
Of course, if he seems really weak and tired, than he may not be up for much more than a walk, and you shouldn’t try to force him to be too physical.

, Sex or any form of intimacy may not always make your boyfriend feel better, and he may even feel worse if you act like the only way you can make him feel better is to get intimate. Still, giving him more affection can definitely cheer him up if you go about it the right way. Hug him, give him a kiss, and put your arms around him to make him feel less alone. Squeeze his hand, put a hand on his shoulder, run your fingers through his hair, or do whatever you know will make him feel better.


If your boyfriend is really sad and wants some distance, then you shouldn’t force affection. Pay close attention to how he responds to your touch. If he responds positively and moves closer to you, then give him more of your loving. But if he seems to back away, then take it easy on the physical affection for now.

, Another way to cheer your boyfriend up is to surprise him with his favorite treat. This could be as simple as picking up food from his favorite Thai place, baking him brownies or presenting him with an ice cream sundae or even inviting him over to make him his favorite pasta dish. This will not only make his taste buds feel better, but it will show him how much you love and care about him.


If he’s alone at home, coming over with his favorite treat can also make him feel extra cheered up.
Of course, if he’s seriously depressed, then he may not want to eat much. But if he’s just upset over a bad test grade or something that won’t last, then this can be the best remedy.

, Take your boyfriend out to the park, a nearby grassy location, or even your backyard and have a nice and simple picnic with him. Make him his favorite sandwiches, bring along some treats he likes, and prepare some soda, sparkling water, or another beverage of his choice. You don’t have to make it too elaborate as long as he sees you’ve made an effort to make him feel better. This can make for the perfect mid-day surprise when you know he’s feeling bummed.


You don’t need to try extra hard to make it feel romantic; it’s more important that it’s fun and lighthearted and that he genuinely enjoys himself.
Bring some comic books, sports magazines, or something else he might like to make the picnic even more fun, or to cheer him up if he doesn’t feel like talking.

, Invite your boyfriend over, make some popcorn and get some other movie theatre treats, like Snow Caps or M&Ms, and have him pick his favorite movie from his childhood to watch. This could be The Goonies, a Rocky movie, The Sandlot, or really anything he used to love as a kid and hasn’t seen in a long time. It doesn’t matter how silly it is or if he worries it may not stand the test of time; this will make watching it even more fun.


Making a cozy home theatre for him can be a better option than taking him out to the movies if he doesn’t feel like going on a big outing or being around too many people.

, Of course, if your boyfriend is upset, it makes sense that you want to do everything in your power to cheer him up and make him feel better. However, sometimes the best thing you can do is just to be understanding and to give him some alone time, knowing that he’ll feel better soon. You don’t want to force him to do too many things or to put pressure on him to be in a good mood, or that may actually make him feel worse.


Though you may think that your boyfriend can only feel better if he’s around you, he may actually feel worse because he’ll feel like you’re trying so hard to cheer him up and he just can’t do it. He may just want some time alone to sort out his feelings and you have to be okay with that.
Another possibility is that your boyfriend wants your company, but he doesn’t want to do too much. If that’s the case and he’s really too upset to do much more than eat or talk to you, then you shouldn’t try to force him to do more.

, If your boyfriend is upset, then the best thing you can do is to have a conversation with him about his feelings. This can help him feel better by getting his feelings out there and having someone who cares about him understand what he’s going through. You don’t have to put the pressure on and make him talk too much in a high-pressure setting, but you should casually let him see that you’re there if he wants to talk. This will help cheer him up and will help him deal with his emotions.


Of course, if he gets too angry or emotional when he talks to you about it, then you can stop or take a break. He doesn’t have to tell you everything all at once.
When he talks to you, practice reflective listening. Hear what he really wants to say and then repeat it back to him in his own words, showing that you really care for him and understand the situation. Make sure he’s done talking before you say anything and don’t interrupt him or give him advice if he doesn’t ask for it.
Make eye contact, put away your distractions, and let him see that he has your full attention.

, Make it clear that you’re there to listen to what he has to say or just to provide support even if he doesn’t feel like saying much. Your presence is more important than anything, so let him see that you care and that you’ll be there when he needs you. Just making it clear that you care for him can cheer him up and make him see that you really do want him to feel better. This doesn’t mean you have to do a million activities together, but just that you want to spend the time together.


Let him know you’re there for him and make this clear when you’re with him in person while also telling him the same thing over the phone when you’re not together.
Remember that he may be feeling self-conscious about the fact that he’s upset, so it’s important that he knows you’ll be there no matter what.

, Though talking to him and hearing what his problems are can make him feel better, sometimes he may be feeling so overwhelmed or so sad that he can barely get a word out. If this is the case, then don’t force him to talk about it, ask him a million questions, or try to reassure him over and over again. Maybe he’s not ready to talk about what’s happened or maybe he’s just grumpy about something minor and it will only make him feel worse to rehash it; whatever the case may be, you should look out for signs that he really doesn’t want to talk and be understanding of that.


Of course, if your boyfriend has been upset about something serious for weeks, then it’s important to talk to him about opening up. You don’t want him to feel worse or to let those feelings keep bottling up inside him.

, If your boyfriend is upset because of his last soccer match or a botched interview, then chances are that he’ll be able to recover from it pretty smoothly. But if something more serious has happened, such as a death in the family, then you should be sensitive of the fact that things really won’t be better any time soon. Try to avoid any cliches like, “Your grandmother is in a better place” or “Things happen for a reason,” because this may just make your boyfriend feel more frustrated and upset.


Though it’s not easy to help your boyfriend when he’s going through something truly challenging, the best thing you can do is to be understanding of how hard it is, even if you can’t feel what he’s feeling.

, Sometimes, the best thing you can do when your boyfriend is upset is to let him know how much he means to you. Just taking the time to give him real compliments, to remind him of all of the things you love about him and all of the great qualities he possesses can help him feel that he’s an amazing person who can recover from whatever has happened; praising him can be especially helpful if he’s upset because of something that made him doubt himself, such as some negative comments from his boss or a failed test grade.


Make sure that this comes off as sincere, and not like you’re just saying nice things to cheer him up. Take some time to think about your favorite qualities of your boyfriend and to let him know how special he is and how much he means to you.
You can also remind him of all the times he has been there for you and has helped you out. Show him that it’s okay to be the one who needs the help, and that he’s done plenty for you.

, Though telling your boyfriend how much you care about him through your words can make a huge impact on him, you can also write him a letter about all of the things you love about him. This can cheer him up and can make him see, in writing, how much he means to you. Having all of the things you love about him written down can also give him something he can pick up and read when he’s down.


You can hand him the letter, read it to him, or even mail it to him for a nice touch. You can also sneak it into his bag or one of his books.

, If your boyfriend is suffering from depression or has been really upset about a certain event for a long time, then the important thing is that you don’t blame yourself. You may think that, if your boyfriend can’t seem to cheer up, it’s your fault, somehow, but you need to know that sometimes, there’s nothing you can do to make someone feel better, no matter how hard you try.


If your boyfriend feels like you’re blaming yourself for not being able to cheer him up, then this will make him feel even worse, like he’s failing not only because he can’t cheer up but because he’s also disappointing you in some way. Try not to let your disappointment show.
Sometimes a problem is so serious that only time or professional help can make it better. Don’t put that on yourself.

, If your boyfriend is really going through emotional trouble and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better, then you can talk to him about potentially going to therapy. Talking to a professional can help him get a better sense of his situation and to understand which steps should be taken. He may be reluctant about therapy and it may not be for everyone, but you should at least suggest this as an option so he knows what is available to him.


This may not be an easy conversation to have. However, if he’s been upset, sad, or disengaged for a long time and there seems to be no way out of the woods for him, then it’s time to take action.

, If your boyfriend is depressed or going through a really hard time, then you may think that you’re perfectly capable of being loving and supportive all the time. However, everyone’s patience has a limit and nobody is perfect, so you shouldn’t be mad at yourself if you find that you can’t be in the supportive role 24/7. You may even feel actively annoyed with your boyfriend after a while, wondering why he can’t just “cheer up” as if it’s no big deal; it’s perfectly natural to feel this way and you shouldn’t be down on yourself because of it.


It’s normal that you may want your boyfriend to just be like everyone else, especially if he’s been down for a while. It’s important to be honest with yourself about your feelings and to give yourself space when you need it.
If you’re really frustrated with him for being in a bad mood, especially if it’s not about anything serious, then you can talk to him about it. But if he’s grieving over his father’s death, then you shouldn’t tell him you’re annoyed with him for being so sad all the time; instead, explain that you love him but that you need some time to yourself, too.

, If your boyfriend really is depressed, then you shouldn’t try to get him to go on a weekend trip, take five yoga classes a week with you, and to meet your three best friends from college. He may be barely able to take care of himself and to talk to you, let alone to try to do a million different activities to get him out of a slump. Telling him to smile, put himself out there, or to move on won’t really help unless you show a sincere interest in his problems, so you shouldn’t try to get him moving out and about too much if his real problem is a deep sadness and depression that a walk in the park won’t fix.


Of course, if he really is depressed or deeply upset, some activity, especially some of the ones in the first section, really can make his day better. However, you have to understand that, if he’s deeply sad, it’ll be a struggle for him to complete even the most basic tasks, so you shouldn’t ask too much of him.

, Though this may not be the easiest thing to hear, if your boyfriend is seriously struggling, then the best thing you can do is to offer your support and to be patient with him while he goes through what may be the most difficult time of his life. You have to be there for him, not expect him to do too much, and help him get through this difficult time. If you really love and care about him and see him in your long term future, then you have to be willing to be patient for him.


Of course, everyone’s patience has its limits. If you feel that you’ve been holding him up for months, or even years, and he’s shown no sign of improving or wanting to improve, then you shouldn’t feel obligated to be in that role forever.

, If he’s struggling through a life crisis, then you may think that taking him on picnics or making him dessert can really help break him out of his funk, but the reality is that the best thing you can do is to reassure him with your loving presence. Let him see that you’re there for him and that you don’t want him to go dancing, to laugh more, or to do eighty million things with you—that you love him and simply want him to feel better.


You should know that your presence enough is what he needs. You don’t need to jump through a million hoops to cheer him up. Give him your love and support and the rest will follow.

This, alone, will help her feel better regardless of why she's upset


Obviously, you won't be able rush to your girlfriend at the drop of coin. Most times, you will have to balance the criticality of your current activities and the severity of her emotional distress. If you're at work or school and her situation is dire, you should clear your mind of your responsibilities and give her all the emotional support and caring that you can verbally. Let her know that she is your number one priority and that you will be there physically as soon as you can practically clear your plate.;
, Until you know what your girlfriend is specifically upset about, you can't offer any but the broadest consolation. Whether the situation is minor or a life-changing issue, any consolation necessarily starts with listening intently to what she's saying. And any positive comforting begins with empathetic understanding by the listener.

, The best thing you can do is to become an active listener and let her work through her feelings and come naturally to her own realization/insight.


Resist injecting your solution into the process. Instead, facilitate her settling into her own understanding of her emotional quandary. Let her vent while you assume the role of empathizer.Engage in active listening.

, Remember that the focus should be entirely on your girlfriend and her feelings while you are offering comfort and support.

This might be difficult if you're emotionally involved in the situation which upset her, but you must put your feelings on the back burner and let hers be fully worked out. If you get overly upset and start folding in your thoughts and feelings, it will only make matters worse. And, in the end, you will have done little to comfort or console her.

If you're upset, it's best to make her feel better, then tend to your side of the issue at a future time.

Not only will you bring less emotional baggage and strain into a relationship, but you will have a better idea of what you are looking for in another person.


Identify what your values are. You can do this by taking some time to reflect on what is important to your life and what you envision for your future. Writing down a list may be helpful. Some questions you could ask yourself are: “What is most important to me in a relationship?” “What are some deal breakers?” and “What is my communication style?” Decide what kind of relationship you are looking for. Are you attracted to someone as a potential fling or are you looking for a long term, committed relationship? Will that person’s habitual marijuana use be difficult or impossible for you to accept? If that is the case, it may be better to let go of that person early on in the dating stages.;
, In the beginning stages of dating, people tend to idealize their date and wonder how to best impress them when they should be focusing on compatibility.For example, instead of thinking about how the date is going, consider what you two have in common. Do you share interests and goals? Does the conversation flow easily or is there lots of awkward silence?

, Don't interrogate your date but you do want to get a good sense of who they are. Regardless of how attracted you are to them, you should be aware of potential red flags, such as shows of aggression, allusions to unstable relationships, or addiction problems. Contrary to popular belief, marijuana is not a “gateway drug” to other, more addictive substancesbut this is still something you should watch out for in any relationship.


Don’t be too alarmed if your date brings up their marijuana use fairly early in the dating process. After all, 49% of Americans say they have tried marijuana and it is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States., The stigma of smoking weed is fading as time goes on (at least in the United States), but many people still assume stoners are lazy, have bad personal hygiene, or only care about getting high.However, these generalizations simply do not apply to all stoners and going into a relationship with one having preconceived notions about them just because they smoke weed is only going to prevent you from seeing and appreciating them for the unique person they are.

, Every relationship takes patience but this is especially true of stoners as it is widely known that marijuana temporarily disrupts short-term memory.For example, if your partner asks you to repeat yourself, understand that they are under the influence of a drug that impedes their ability to form new memories in the moment and don’t take it too personally.

, Many people use marijuana recreationally but others use it for medicinal reasons as well. Talk to your partner about their reasons for using marijuana.


There are a vast array of medical conditions that cannabis can treat or help alleviate the negative symptoms of such as skin disorders, various forms of cancer, anorexia, chronic pain, sleep disorders, eye diseases, and others. While it is possible that your partner simply enjoys the sensation of being high, they may also have an underlying medical condition you should be aware of., Don’t be afraid to ask your partner and do your own research to better understand the effects of marijuana. Doing so can strengthen the bond between you two by helping you understand your partner’s perspective.


Marijuana often creates a feeling of euphoria and relaxation, due to a release of dopamine in the brain, but other changes can also occur including: paranoia, heightened sensitivity to noise and lights, increased appetite, anxiety, increased heart rate, difficulty concentrating, decreased coordination, and a shorter attention span. There is also a “come down effect” after the effects of the drug fade which can result in the user feeling tired or sad.It’s useful to know about these common effects of marijuana, but every person is different so talk to your partner to find out how it personally affects them.

, Marijuana laws vary by state and knowing the specific laws will help you protect both your partner and yourself. After all, if you are living in a state where one can carry up to a certain amount of marijuana on them, you should ensure your partner never carries more than that amount.


So far, four states (Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska) have passed new legislature legalizing marijuana, while 14 more states have decriminalized marijuana possession. In fact, 23 states (including Washington DC) now allow medical marijuana.That being said, marijuana is still illegal at the federal level., Have a conversation with your partner to let them know exactly what you are and are not comfortable with. Doing so will help maintain the balance of the relationship and prevent resentment from building up.


For example, if you do not want to be exposed to smoke, let them know! If they respect your wishes (as any good partner should), they can smoke before or after spending time with you or find other methods of ingesting marijuana (such as consuming edibles).

, Since you have made the decision to continue dating a stoner, you must also respect your partner’s choice to smoke.However, if you find that their weed habit is negatively impacting your relationship, find ways of compromising.


Compromise takes effort from both sides but you can initiate by asking to have a conversation about what changes you would like to see in the relationship. Don't start an argument or harshly criticize your partner. Instead, come up with constructive suggestions for what you and your partner could do better and be prepared to listen to their perspective with an open mind.
For example, if you feel like you don’t get to see your partner in their sober state often enough, suggest going on sober dates every so often. Unless your partner must be high (due to a medical condition), spending time together that is free of substance use is a great way to strengthen a bond and also allow two people to get to know each other more fully.

, Never allow your partner to do anything that goes against your values, especially regarding their drug use.


For example, if they are pressuring you to ingest marijuana with them or asking you if they can store drugs at your home, it may be time to seriously rethink whether this stoner is someone you really want to be with.

, An upside of dating a stoner is that many of them tend to be relaxed and enjoy having a good time.


For example, indulge their munchies by checking out a new bakery together or surprising them with some home baked goods!

Know what you like, what you don't like, what you're good at, and what you're bad at. Know what you want out of life and what you want from your partner. Be realistic and honest with yourself. If you're having a hard time examining yourself, try asking your closest friends to help you.


Most important of all, love yourself, flaws and all. You can't expect someone to love you if you can't love yourself. If you try to have a lifelong relationship when you have a negative self-image, you're likely to self-sabotage and hurt the people closest to you, so sort this important first step out before you continue.;
, Two people who are spending their lives with each other need to be on the same page for almost all of life's major decisions (if not every single one). Having a disagreement about a major, non-negotiable aspect of your life can stop a relationship in its tracks even when two people get along perfectly otherwise. Be open and honest about these goals — trying to lie to yourself can lead to long-term resentment and isn't fair to your partner. For more discussion on this topic, see the ""Priorities"" section below. Below are just a few very important questions that you'll want to know the answers to before you choose your life partner:


Do I want to have children?
Where do I want to live?
Do I want to work or manage the home (or both?)
Do I want my relationship to be an exclusive one?
What do I want to accomplish before I die?
What kind of lifestyle do I want to have?

, If you're having trouble determining what you want in a partner or what you want out of life, think back to relationships you've already been in. The choices you make in your relationships, conscious or unconscious, can help clue you in to the sorts of things you're looking for in a partner and even the sorts of things that you may need to work on to make a long-term partnership work. Below are just a few of the types of questions you may want to consider for your past relationships:


What did you like about your partner?
What did you enjoy doing the most with your partner?
What did you disagree with your partner about?
What did you criticize your partner for?
What did your partner criticize you for?
Why did the relationship end?

, As you meet and begin to date a new person, talk to them about themselves. Ask them about what they like in a partner, what their life goals are, and what their long-term plans are. Your partner's ethics, interests, spiritual outlook, and even diet may be important to your long-term compatibility, so don't be afraid to ask about any of it!


You'll need to consider questions in all areas of lifestyle choices. For instance, do they smoke, drink, or do drugs? Do they have any personal demons? Will they be a supportive and understanding person if you wish to change or advance your career?
To be clear, these types of questions aren't necessarily things you should ask at your first date. Asking very personal questions early on can be a major turn-off that can sabotage your efforts to start a relationship with someone. However, these types of major lifestyle questions are probably things that you'll want to know the answer to within, say, the first six months of your relationship.

, This decision is hugely important — perhaps the most important decision you'll make with your partner. In spite of this, a surprising number of couples fail to discuss this sufficiently before trying to commit to a lifelong relationship. Raising a child can be the most rewarding thing you ever do, but it's also an enormous responsibility, a huge financial commitment, and a decision to spend at least about 18 years or so (possibly more) directly responsible for the care of your child, so it's not something to be treated lightly.


In the U.S., most people want children,but this is by no means universal, so don't make assumptions about your partner until you know for sure.

, Many people's cultural or religious traditions are a huge part of their life — others are agnostic or atheist and have little in the way of non-mainstream culture or tradition. Both lifestyles are equally valid, but, for some partners, someone at the opposite end of the spectrum may not be a viable long-term choice. Before you commit to someone, it's important to have an honest idea about whether or not it's important for your partner to be like you in this aspect of life.


To be clear, people from different races, religions, and cultures are perfectly capable of having happy life-long relationships. For instance, in the U.S., interracial couples are more common today than ever before., Money can be an awkward subject to talk about, but it's something that it's important for two life partners to be on the same page about. Money can play an important role in the way a couple's life plays out — it can determine how long the members of the couple work for, the sorts of jobs they'll take, the lifestyle they'll be able to live, and much more. Having a frank talk about the ways you plan to save and spend money as a couple is essential for anyone considering a life-long relationship.


As an example of the sorts of financial decisions couples have to make, consider this: in a couple where one partner wants to spend his late 20s and early 30s taking lots of trips and exploring the world and the other partner wants to spend this time building a successful career and saving to buy a house, both partners may not be able to get their way.

, Our families shape the way we think and act throughout our lives. Having a clear picture of how you want your partner to fit into your family is a must for anyone thinking of spending his or her life with someone else. You'll want to know both what role you want your partner to play in your immediate family (i.e., you and any kids you have) as well as what role your partner to play in your extended family (i.e., your parents, siblings, cousins, etc.). Conversely, your partner should also have this figured out for you.


For example, for some couples with children, it's very important for one parent to be a full-time caretaker. For others, it's OK if a nanny fills the gaps. Similarly, some people may want to live near their parents and visit frequently, while others may want more independence.

, This decision is a major one, but, luckily, it's usually quite clear how your partner wants to live once you begin spending serious amounts of time with him or her. You and your partner should have compatible ideas about how you want to spend your free time, how you want to interact with your friends, and the types of material comforts you want to pursue. While you don't have to like all of the same things your partner does, you shouldn't disagree about things that require major decisions or commitments.


For example, a couple wherein one partner likes watching pro wrestling on Monday nights and one partner likes watching nature documentaries at the same time will probably be able to make things work (especially if they agree to buy a DVR). On the other hand, if one partner wants to buy a house and the other doesn't or one partner wants to be a ""swinger"" and the other doesn't, these are major roadblocks to long-term happiness.

, Sometimes, location is key to a couple's happiness. People often want to live near friends or relatives that they're very close to or live in places where certain types of activities are possible. If both partners can't be satisfied living in the same place, this can (at the very least) make it necessary to spend lots of time traveling.

, When you're trying to maintain a relationship, don't expect the other person to be someone they are not. While it's possible for the members of a couple to compromise on a variety of important issues and even change minor aspects of themselves for their partner, at their cores, most people are the same person for the long haul. Avoid having any sorts of illusions about your partner or assigning them qualities that they lack. Similarly, don't expect a partner to change a major part of who they are to appease you.


For example, it's OK to ask your partner (politely, of course) to start taking the garbage out sometimes — this is a reasonable place to look for compromise. However, it's not OK to expect your partner to suddenly decide to want kids if they don't already — this is a deeply personal decision that can't reasonably be undone.

, Just as you shouldn't try to conceal or change any major part of your partner, it's important to do the same yourself. When dating, it may be tempting to appease someone you like by manipulating the truth about your past or present situation. However, this not only leads to personal guilt, but also poses the risk of problems down the road. When the other person inevitably learns the truth, the level of trust in the relationship can seriously suffer.For example, while it's perfectly OK to dress a little fancier than you normally would for your first few dates, you wouldn't want to pretend that you're agnostic when you actually are quite religious just to make your date happy. Misleading your partner about yourself — either by lying or omitting information about yourself — is an act of deception that, for many people, can be difficult to recover from.

, What's the best way to find out if you can spend long amounts of time with someone else? Try to do it! To know if a relationship will work in the long-term, it's very important to spend lots of time in the other person's company (ideally in a wide range of environments). If you can stand to be around someone for days, weeks, or months at a time, you may have a keeper.


You'll probably also want to see if this person gets along with the people who are close to you (and vice versa). Bring your partner to your social engagements and introduce them to your friends and family. If your partner gets along well with these people, you have one less thing to worry about.

, You're looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with, so there's no reason to rush into things. Give your relationship the chance to grow organically. Don't stick to an arbitrary schedule for progressing through major relationship events like ""going steady"", moving in together, and getting married. If you rush into these decisions, you run the risk of finding yourself in situations you aren't prepared for with someone who may or may not be on the same page as you in terms of life priorities.


You'll definitely want to avoid becoming intimately involved with a potential partner until you get to know the person. While it's certainly possible to turn a casual relationship into something more serious, sexual intimacy shouldn't be the foundation for long-term happiness. Though sexual attraction and compatibility are key to a good long-term relationship, waiting allows you to gain a better understanding of whether you are compatible.

, If you find yourself acting ""fake"", pretending to feel differently than you actually do, or laughing at things you don't think are funny, this might be a sign that you're not truly comfortable around this person. If, however, you are relaxed and feel completely natural in the person's presence, you are on the right track. It's important to be able to be completely genuine around your partner. Eventually, everyone runs out of the energy to keep ""faking it"" — you don't want this to happen to you five years into a marriage.

, No relationship is perfect. There will be times when you may have to sacrifice your own needs for the sake of your partner. It's up to you to decide exactly how far you're willing to go in terms of sacrifices — most good relationships involve a healthy give-and-take of sacrifices from both partners.


When it comes to making sacrifices for the good of your relationship, small things, like minor personal habits and behaviors, should be on the table. However, major life goals usually shouldn't be, as a serious disagreement about one of these can be a sign that two people are incompatible. For example, deciding to go out drinking with your friends less often is a reasonable sacrifice to make if you have a spouse and children. On the other hand, deciding not to have children when you desperately want them isn't something you should put yourself through.

, There's someone out there for just about everyone — all you need to do is go find this person. If you don't make any effort to meet new people, try new things, or even leave the house, the odds that you'll find the person who's right for you can be seriously slim. So, if you're looking to find your life partner, start by getting up and getting out! Try to spend at least some of your free time attending fun social events, getting to know new people, and just getting out into the world around you in general.


Most dating ""experts"" will recommend a proactive approach to dating. Some even rank it as high as your career in terms of the effort you should spend on it!, Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to spend every Friday night in a loud, crowded, overpriced nightclub to meet potential dating partners, nor do you have to be an immaculately-dressed, debonair, Hollywood type. While these sorts of approaches work well for some people, most people will have the greatest success finding partners by simply exploring activities that they love. By doing this, you're likely run into people with similar interests and outlooks as you, naturally leading to compatibility.


Even solitary hobbies can lead to opportunities to meet people! Love reading comic books and playing video games? Attend a convention! Love painting? Host an exhibition! Like writing? Attend a writer's workshop! There are exciting activities for almost every interest out there, so start searching!

, You're looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with, so isn't it reasonable to assume that both you and your potential life partner should be completely open about who you are? In fact, many people are unwilling to completely ""open up"" until they've gotten to know someone intimately. If you can stomach the idea, try to be completely true to yourself from the very get-go through all the stages of a relationship: asking someone out, going on your first few dates, getting to know each other more closely, committing to each other, and beyond! By doing this, you give your partner the chance to fall in love with the real you, rather than forcing them to ""hold on"" until you're comfortable being yourself.

, The path to finding your life partner can seem like a perilous one. It can seem like there's almost no hope you'll find someone who's right for you, especially if you've recently had to deal with romantic setbacks. No matter what you do, don't ever give up hope or give in to the fear that you won't find someone. People all over the world struggle with the same sorts of romantic difficulties that you may be going through right now. Everyone periodically has personal setbacks. There's no single ""right way"" to find your life partner, so don't judge yourself against other people or couples. Don't let negative thoughts derail your quest to find a life partner. Confidence, fearlessness, and persistence are key to finding the right person for you!


As an added bonus, confidence is generally considered quite sexy!Fearless confidence is a self-reinforcing trait that makes you much more attractive to potential partners: the more confidently you approach dating situations, the more relaxed you'll be during them, the better time you'll have, and the more confident you'll be when you approach the next situation.

Accept your lack of confidence.,
Aim to boost your levels of confidence to aid your dating prowess.,
Give yourself confidence by faking it to begin with.,
Avoid bashful innuendos and mutterings.,
Get this person alone.,
Concentrate on one specific goal.,
Break the touch barrier.,
Take it slowly but not too slowly.,
Before you ask them, give them reasons to consider dating you.,
Think it through before asking this person out.,
Be ready for rejection as much as acceptance.",How to Build Confidence to Ask That Special Someone Out," Even though it has been proven through research that confidence is a very attractive trait, it doesn't mean you have to have it innately. Accept that everyone, including yourself faces a lack of confidence throughout life and many a person isn't naturally confident. Confidence is one of those skills you have to practice regularly to both get and to maintain. Nobody perfects it all the time.;
, A lack of confidence can be especially difficult when pursuing a romantic interest. Your date is going to be wanting someone who looks capable, seems self-assured and appears to know what's what. It's a guarantee that they're doing the right thing by choosing you.

, If you've been looking for your confidence for years now, then it's time to fake it! According to Time magazine writer, Martha C. White, ""Research shows that people unconsciously defer to people who project an air of confidence...."" Or as the cliché says, fake it till you make it. In time, that confidence will take on a life of its own and feel more natural. Until then, practice faking it.

, Other people can't read your mind. So throw on that smile and go speak to your crush.

, It doesn't matter how you do it. It's all about what happens at the end. Other people will automatically run interference even if they aren't interested in either of you. It is the nature of group dynamics. Thus, make a beeline for your romantic interest when you can see nobody else hovering around.


Get a kik, a phone number, an email address, whatever; just make sure when you speak to this person, that there is no one but the two of you.

, Start small. You shouldn't be looking to score right away. Instead, aim for small confirmations, mutual experiences, and the opportunity to share common interests. Narrowing your focus even in a two person conversation proves to your listener that you are committed., Physical contact is powerful and important in indicating your caring and serious intentions.Begin with small bits of physical contact. A nudge on the arm, a playful push, or a casual hug actually cause a positive biological reaction if there is any mutual attraction. If there isn't any prior attraction, these small gestures could spark the interest.

, Take a deep breath, so that your choice of words won't sound as if you're uncertain. Speak clearly and audibly. Speaking clearly indicates intelligence and reinforces that confidence you are channeling. Avoid using words you don't know well. Misused vocabulary may be overlooked, but if the person you are trying to charm has a strong vocabulary, you may diminish their impression of you.

, Tell them little things that you are good at. Talk up your positive traits.


For example: ""I'm a fantastic cook."" ""I bet I could impress you with my ability to sing like Arianna.""
Even suggestions of nurturing skills will evoke thoughts of you as a possible partner. ""I know exactly how to make you forget your stress."" The open ended suggestions lead to opportunities to demonstrate your affection.

, Know exactly what you plan to say, then say it. Don't beat around the bush.


For example, ""Hey, Sam? I've been thinking, we've known each other more than a year, and I think you're fantastic, so I was wondering if you would want to go out with me?"" Just to give them an idea of what you're getting at.
Sometimes asking someone out in context is even better. ""There is a new cafe on Biele Street, why don't we go check it out together?"".

, Accept that everyone is different, so the suggested approaches might not 100 percent work. Accept the rejection and move on. It doesn't mean you're not a cool person; don't less this dent your confidence. The reality is that this person didn't make the connection or feel the compatibility. Better now than later; anyone willing to reject you isn't worth the sacrifices of a deeper relationship. If a friendship does continue, the opportunity may arise again in the future. Just don't get hung up on the rejection.Grace is key.

You might get in a little over your head, depending on what your significant other likes to read, but your partner will appreciate the effort at bonding over a book together.Talk to your partner about the next book they plan to read and ask if you could read it at the same time.
Have nightly or weekly ""book club"" conversations. Agree to read up to a certain point and discuss your favorite and least-favorite aspects of the reading.Talk about whether you find the characters convincing, whether the narrative is plot-driven or character-driven, and how you generally experienced the book as a whole.Discuss whether the book has a central premise, whether the issues presented in the book are still culturally/socially relevant, and what the author's reasons for writing the book seem to be.;
, People who are passionate about their hobbies often get excited when others want to participate in or discuss those activities. Bookworms are no different. If you ask your significant other for a list of books to check out, they'll probably be more than happy to oblige.Start by reading your significant other's favorite book. Most avid readers will be excited that you're reading their favorite book since it means you'll be able to talk about it together.
You can also ask for general recommendations based on things you like. You and your partner might even find that you have overlapping areas of interest.

, If your partner is a die-hard reader, they might enjoy doing literary things beyond just reading. Most cities and college towns have plenty of literary events happening every month that any avid reader would enjoy.


Visit a bookstore together and browse the shelves for things that appeal to each of you.Go to a literary conference or see your partner's favorite author at a reading/book signing.
Visit literary places together if you live near the setting of any books your partner likes.Go see a play together. People who like to read are also often interested in the theater. You might take your love interest to see a stage play or check out a Shakespeare in the park production.

, The best way to bond with your bookworm crush is to immerse yourself even more in literature. This doesn't mean forfeiting your own interests and hobbies, but by extending yourself beyond your significant other's favorite books you might end up developing a real interest in reading.Figure out which genre you like best. This may take some exploration since there are many subgenres within the primary genres of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.
Find authors whose work you enjoy. Then get recommendations by asking a librarian or bookstore employee about similar authors, or by searching online.
Get into the habit of taking a book with you wherever you go. Dedicate time to reading every day, even if it's just a few fleeting minutes here and there., If you're only taking an interest in what your partner is reading to ""score points,"" they'll probably notice pretty quickly. Instead of phoning it in, try to take a real interest in reading, specifically in what your partner likes to read. Even if you've never been a reader, you'll get to know your partner a lot better and you might end up finding a book you really love.


Never hold it over your partner that you're taking an interest in their hobbies. This can spoil the joy of reading for your partner and it may make them feel guilty for having a passion for literature.If you're really having a hard time getting interested in reading, try setting up little rewards. For example, if you finish a book that your partner is reading, you can have a fancy date night and discuss the book over dinner.
Find other ways to make reading more fun for you. For example, you might bring a book and visit a new coffee shop you've never been to before.
Read books that were made into movies, and have a special night to watch the movies together after you finish the book.

, If you are really serious about learning more about what your love interest loves, then taking a literature course may be a good option. Try taking a course at a local community college or check your local library for free courses on how to read and analyze literature.


Taking a literature course can help to add depth to your conversations with your love interest.

, Whether your hobbies and interests consist of photography, sports, culinary work, or something else altogether, they're important to you and your partner should understand why. If your significant other has never taken an interest in your hobby, invite them along or ask them to try it out with you.


Offer to be your partner's teacher or coach as they try out your hobby for the first time.Don't be pushy. If your partner doesn't want to try your hobby don't push it, and if they try but struggle don't be too demanding of them.

, If your partner is new to your hobby, they might struggle with how to do it correctly. Your significant other may even struggle with staying interested in your hobby. However, if they're giving it an earnest try to get closer to you, they deserve to be praised and supported for that effort.Give your partner plenty of praise.
Say things like, ""You're doing great!"" or ""Wow, you really finished that quickly!""

, No matter how much you love your hobby, your partner might not enjoy it as much as you. They may grow to like it, but they may also realize they hate it. Either way, it's important to remember that your significant other is trying out this new hobby for your sake and try to reward them for it.Take your partner out to eat or treat them to coffee or drinks (if you're both old enough to drink) as a way to thank your significant other.
Sometimes just verbally thanking your partner is enough. Say something like, ""I know _____ isn't really your thing, but I really appreciate the way you've taken an interest in it. Thank you.""

, When you start dating someone, it's important to do things together and take an interest in one another's hobbies. However, it's also important that you don't lose yourself in the relationship. One way to do this is to designate some time apart every week (even if it's just a day) to do separate things.Spend some time doing things that you like but your partner doesn't like. Encourage your partner to spend some time doing things that you don't like.
When you spend time together after doing separate things, you'll have more to talk about since you'll be able to fill one another in on what you both did.

, Whether you're aware of it or not, you almost certainly act differently when you're alone with your friends than you do when your partner is there. This doesn't mean you should stop inviting your significant other to get-togethers (in fact, it's important for your friends and your partner to get along and spend time together. It simply means you need some alone time every now and then with your friends.Don't stop inviting your partner; just make a point of having boyfriend/girlfriend-free time together every so often.
Suggest that you each have your own respective friend day where you and your partner both get hang out alone with one or two of your best friends. If you coordinate days, it can reduce the chances that one or both of you feels left out.

, It's important to envision a future with your partner, but it's equally important to have and pursue your own dreams for yourself as well. Your significant other can fit into those dreams, but they should ultimately be your own dreams for what you hope to accomplish in your life.Figure out what you want for yourself out of your career and/or your artistic/creative pursuits.
Decide what you need to do to achieve your personal goals.
Don't factor your significant other into those plans. If they're willing to support you along the way then they're a good partner, but don't change your plans because the person you're dating doesn't fit into your dreams.

Approach her on her terms.,
Use attentive body language.,
Buy her a gift.,
Offer a tissue if she's crying.A tissue is a common offering to give someone if you find her crying.,
Hug her.,
Cuddle up together.",How to Comfort Your Girlfriend2," When you meet with her, it's important not to overstep your bounds. This includes keeping a cap on physical affection or romantic gestures unless you think she's in the mood for it. In many cases, a girl who is furious over something isn't going to be receptive to cuddling. When you meet her, come close but respect her personal space at the start. If she wants something, chances are she will let you know.


Depending on how long you have been with your girlfriend, you should be able to predict her behaviour in certain situations. If you've comforted her in the past and she was receptive to certain actions, repeating them again is a good trick.

, While you're talking to her, the best thing you can do initially is to let her know she has your complete attention. Although you'll be getting this impression across through your words as well, attentive body language shows her that you're listening with your body as much as your brain. Steady eye contact, leaning and pointing your body in her direction, smiling, and nodding your head when appropriate all will show the girl that you care.

, Gift-giving is surprisingly well-suited for times of stress. Although a bouquet of flowers obviously isn't going to make the problem itself go away, it is a physical sign of love and affection. The symbolic nature of a gift can go a long ways towards making your girlfriend feel better.


Giving her a present can be effective, but only if it's backed up with honest talk and warmth.
Try to consider whether the reason your girlfriend needs comforting is really appropriate for whatever gift you're getting her. Flowers are suitable for just about any situation, but getting her favourite video game after her parents have died probably isn't going to get the reaction you're looking for.

, Crying can be an embarrassing thing, even in the midst of someone you're deeply involved with. A tissue doesn't make it any less embarrassing, but it does help clear up the evidence. Offering your girlfriend a tissue to wipe away tears is especially helpful if she wears any eye makeup. She will probably thank you for it later on.

, Provided your girlfriend didn't rush into your arms for comfort from the get-go, giving her a hug is recommended at some point. The positive effects of hugs are well-known.It's a quick way to feel better, as everything from the stress level to one's blood pressure become regulated during a hug.

, Cuddling is a bona fide remedy to most emotional troubles. If your girlfriend has been feeling upset about something, there's usually nothing better than to cuddle up once things have been relatively resolved. Even if she's not feeling totally fine by the time you get down to cuddling, the act of cuddling itself comes with an impressive range of benefits, including boosts to feelings of well-being and happiness.Once you're cuddling up, you might think about watching her favourite movie together. Something light-hearted and fun is usually best, and the entertainment is a great way to keep her mind off the issue at hand until she's calm and rested enough to properly deal with it."

If the ""man of your dreams"" doesn't like you for who you are- then he's not the man of your dreams and that should not matter. Do not EVER change for someone to like you.;
, Don't try to dress just for a guy. You don't need to show too much skin to attract guys because that's the wrong kind of attention. Wear whatever you want. You want a guy who likes you for your personality, not for what you wear or how you look.

, All that matters is personality and not your clothing.

, Don't fake laugh, just be happy. If he sees that you're comfortable around him, he'll have an easier time talking to you.

, Feel free to tease back if he teases you, but don't take it to a mean level. You should always be nice, anyway. You can come up with a witty comeback then laugh so he knows you weren't serious. Be nice and witty to his friends as well. Hey, this could help him try to date you sooner, because he won't want his friends to get you first.

, Sometimes it's good (especially with shy boys) to turn quickly and blush. Shy ones blush and find it adorable if you blush too. This will tell him that you like him.

, Is he interested or does he ignore you? If he does ignore you then he probably doesn't care and is a waste of time, you can find someone better than him anyway!

, That can make you seem rude. Once you get to know him better, do what you want of course, but it might not make the greatest first impression until he knows how awesome you really are.

, There's scientific proof that when people look into each other's eyes, they are more likely to develop feelings of attraction. Don't go too long, it's natural to look away during a conversation, and its creepy if you're staring at them, but try to meet their eyes more than you might meet a friend's.

, If it doesn't work out, then all this thought on him won't do you any good anyway. Act as you can totally live without him and he will find it hard to resist wanting to hang with you. It's like you could not hang out with him and not even miss a beat, it'll drive him insane that you can be fine without him, but you won't have to be without him because as long as you've followed these steps, you'll be the girl every guy dreams of.

Refrain from providing personal details on your dating profile page.,
Never give out your phone number until you truly know someone.,
Trust your instincts.,
Use free email accounts.,
Look for questionable characteristics.,
Request a recent photo.,
Use paid online dating services.,
When it's time to meet up arrange to meet in a public place and provide your own transportation.,
By following these tips and being generally careful, you'll help protect yourself from being an easy prey to someone who may have ulterior motives.

",How to Be Safe Dating," Therefore, in the initial stages of online dating keep your phone number and all your personal information to yourself. Once you get to know your date you can determine how much information you would like to provide. Think of it this way; you wouldn't put your phone number in the local paper or walk around in a t-shirt with it written on - so don't put it on your profile page! Remember, if someone discovers your real first and last name they can potentially track you down on social websites.;
, You can create an automatically generated phone number from Skype. Using an anonymous phone service such as Paginglist.com means you never need to give out your number again, it works on any phone, you don't need to be in front of a computer to make calls, it's free to create a tag, costs nothing to receive a call and only costs roughly the same as regular prepay to make a call, calls made never appear on your bill - and best of all you at all times have absolute control as to who can and who can't call you! So if someone turns out to be a person you'd rather not stay in touch with - you just delete them from your friends list and they can't call you again - ever!

, Sometimes you just know when something is not right! It is always important to use common sense, as your instinct is a powerful tool when dating and great way to measure when to build a relationship or turn and run. As you begin to read personal profiles, respond to emails or speak on the phone your instincts will help tell you if something is right or not. If you are in any doubt, be careful, back off, or proceed carefully!

, Should you decide to move your date from the anonymous email provided by the majority of online dating services i.e. hotchocolate@oceanlovers.co.uk to providing an email address that isn't your regular one. Sign up for a free Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo account that you use just for online dating. Don't put your full name in the ""from"" field, only your first name or your ""tag"". This will protect you from anyone trying to search your normal email address to find out more information about you on social websites.

, As you chat on the phone or on email you may be able to start to pick out characteristics of the other person. Do they seem to be short tempered? Are they controlling? Do they avoid some of your questions? Ask how long ago was their last relationship and how long did it last? If you ask a range of questions can tell you if they are Mr or Mrs Right or if it's time to move on. But try not to be too personal too soon as you don't want to scare them off! Remember our team recommends that you talk on your phone without giving out your number by using a ""paging tag"" from paginglist.com - as you stay in absolute control as to who can and importantly who cannot call you.

, If your contact does not have a photo on their profile request a recent one. It's important for you to get a good look at the person you may eventually meet. Plus your instincts from your communications and their photos may provide you with valuable insight into the person. If a person lies about their photo or profile then that is a red flag to no longer pursue the relationship.

, Free online dating services provide a greater opportunity for potentially dangerous individuals. They don't ever have to provide a credit card or other information that identifies them. There is definitely truth to the saying, ""you get what you pay for"". Use safe dating websites recommendations on facebook or twitter. Alternatively search online for recommended sites from dating magazines.

, Never accept an offer to be picked up from your house on the first date. Make sure you tell someone ie a friend, where you are going. Your first meeting will tell you a great deal about the other person. Be thinking about what questions to ask your date en route!

Give yourself time.,
Move past denial.,
Accept that it's over.,
Forgive your ex.",How to Be Happy After Love Failure1,"

It is natural to feel sad and out-of-sorts for a while when love fails. Don't expect yourself to be over your ex in a day or two. Be patient with yourself, and work through everything you are feeling about the breakup.The only way you will eventually be happy is if you give yourself time to completely move on.

Don’t immediately rush into another relationship or try find someone new to love. Make time to get over this first.
Allow yourself time to process everything that you are feeling. It's okay to think about the love and why it failed.
People may tell you to just get over it. Don’t let anyone else try to rush you into getting over your failed love.
However, if it has been several months since your love failed, you may want to put more effort into moving on.;
, At first you may not want to believe that this love has failed. Don’t get stuck pretending that nothing has changed and that your love is the same as it was. In order to move on and be happy you have to stop denying (to yourself and to others) that this love failed.Don’t contact your ex and act as if things are still the same. This will probably make your ex annoyed or angry and it will make it harder for you to move on and be happy.
Put away reminders of your ex. For example, if the background on your phone is a picture of the two of you, then change it.
Don’t lie to people if they ask you about the relationship. You don’t have to go into detail, but you should be honest with them.
You might try saying, “We didn’t work out, but I’d rather not talk about it any further than that.” Then change the subject.

, Even though you may admit that your love has failed, you might think that if you change certain things about yourself or can convince your ex the love can work, you’ll get back together. This usually doesn’t work.Instead, accept that it’s over so that you can move on with the rest of your life and be happy.


Stop trying to think of ways to make your love work. Don’t try to make your ex jealous or do something dramatic to make them realize how much they miss you.
Look in the mirror and tell yourself, “This is really over. It didn’t work out and I accept that.” Do this as often as you need to.
Give or send back your ex’s possessions as soon as you can. For example, don’t keep their winter coat in the hopes that you will be back together by the time they need it again.

, It’s natural for you to feel angry once you admit to yourself that this love has failed. You may want to blame someone for things not working out. But, anger can make you more stressed and bring negativity into your life. In order to move on and be happy, you’ve got to let go of the anger and forgive whomever you need to.Write a letter to your ex forgiving them if they did something to cause the love to fail. You don’t have to give it them.
Do something physical to get your negative energy out. Punch a boxing bag, go for a run, swim a few laps, or do some yoga.
Forgive yourself if it is your fault that the love failed. Sometimes we make mistakes. You have to forgive yourself, learn from it, and move on to be happy.

Ask her out.",How to Break the Ice and Flirt With a Girl You Don't Know," If you want to make a move on a girl you’ve never spoken to before, then it’s important to look your best. This doesn’t mean you have to look like a bodybuilder or a movie star or just someone who doesn’t feel like you; it means that you have to look and feel your best in order to get the confidence you need to make a move. Wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself, pay attention to your hygiene, and be well-groomed before you finally talk to that girl you’ve had your eye on.


Of course, if you see a girl you like and don’t think you look your best, talk to her anyway! But if you’ve been working up the courage to talk to her for weeks, then you might as well look your best to give yourself the extra boost of confidence you may need to talk to her.
It’s important to shower every day. You don’t want to distract the girl with your B.O. instead of focusing on all of the charming and funny things you have to say.;
, The first thing you should do as you get ready to break the ice with a new girl is to make eye contact for just one or two seconds, so she knows you’re interested. Once you catch her eye, you can look away or look down at the floor, as long as you know you’ve captured her attention. If you’re feeling bold, you can even give her a little smile to show that you like what you see, and make your way over to her.


You can make eye contact and then take another few minutes to work yourself up to walking up to her, but you don’t want to be that guy who lingers around forever before making a move; besides, if you do that, you may miss your chance.
She’ll be really impressed if you make eye contact and then walk right over to her.

, Once you’ve made eye contact, just walk over to the girl while keeping your posture straight and your gaze straight ahead. You don’t need to say anything fancy to get the conversation started. You can simply say something like, “Hey, I’m Jake, what’s your name?” Or, “I’m Jake, and I’d love to meet you.” Keep it simple and to the point.


When she says her name, you can repeat it to her or say it’s a nice name to show that you’re really paying attention.
You can also come up with a conversation starter, such as complimenting a piece of jewelry she’s wearing, asking her a question, or just saying something simple and funny.

, Though you may think you need to use a cheesy pick up line to get the girl’s attention, this will actually give her the wrong impression. You don’t want her to think that you look at talking to her as a game and want to show her that you want to make a sincerely good impression on her. Don’t waste your time checking the internet for all of the best ways to get a girl’s attention and focus on being yourself instead.


You don’t want the girl think that you’re just trying to pick her up; you want her to see that you have a real interest in her.
You can come up with an interesting conversation starter, but you really don’t need to start with anything too flattering or even too forward if you want to start off on the right foot.

, Though you want to make it clear that you’re interested, you don’t want to make the girl feel like you’re being too pushy. If you want her to keep talking to you, then you shouldn’t make any comments that are overly sexual, mention specific parts of her body, or just make the girl feel uncomfortable. Keep things light, flirtatious, and friendly and make the girl feel like you really care about her.


When you start breaking the ice, try to get a feel for whether or not the girl is interested. If she crosses her arms over her chest, backs away from you, or keeps looking around for her friends or checking her phone, then it just may not be your day. If you’re pretty sure she’s not feeling it, then be polite but move on.
You’ll both begin to flirt more with each other as the conversation progresses, so you don’t need to force it too much at the very beginning.

, If the girl is standing with a group of her friends, or even just one or two of them, then you have to make an effort to be nice to them, too. You don’t want the girl to think you’re only being nice to her because you want to get with her and that you’re normally disrespectful to girls; make sure to be nice to her friends and to introduce yourself to them while also making it clear that the girl you came up to is the only one you’re interested in.


It’s important to be nice to her friends so they don’t try to stop her from talking to you, but you should avoid flirting with them too much or the girl will think that you’re just a naturally flirtatious guy who doesn’t have any special interest in her.

, Once you start talking to the girl, you can flirt with her a bit by asking questions to show that you want to get to know the girl while teasing her at the same time. You don’t need to ask anything too serious and should keep things lighthearted so you have a fun, easy conversation going. You can ask her questions about her hobbies, about what she likes to do for fun, or about her pet cat; just keep things fun and easy and don’t make her feel like she’s being interrogated. Here are some examples of questions you can ask:


“So is blue your favorite color or do you just wear it because it matches your eyes?”
“Do you spend your evenings hanging out with your cat or are there other things you like to do for fun?”
“Are you really a Giants fan or do you just like wearing orange?”

, Another way to flirt with the girl is to give her a nice compliment to show that you really do like her. You shouldn’t compliment any parts of her body or say anything too sexual, but you should point out something great about her appearance or her personality to show that you want to get to know her more. Here are some things you can say:


“Has anyone ever told you that you have the most incredible laugh? I’ve never heard anything like it.”
“You’re the only girl I know who looks great in neon.”
“You’re really good at talking to new people, aren’t you? How do you do that?”

, You may be too nervous to really pay attention to what the girl is telling you when you first come up to her because you’re so worried about keeping the conversation going. However, if you really want her to like you and to show that you’re interested, then you have to make an effort to really listen to whatever it is she says to you so she sees that you want to do more than just pick her up. Here’s what you should do:


Make eye contact
Put away your phone
Don’t interrupt her or give her advice when she’s talking
Don’t try to compare her experiences to yours when she’s trying to say something serious
Bring up something she mentioned earlier in the conversation later on to show that you’re really listening

, Another simple thing you can do is just to ask the girl about how her day is going or what she’s been up to lately. This can lead into some playful teasing or can just show her that you care about who she is. It can also just lead you to find out that you have more in common than you think. Here are some easy questions you can ask:


“So have you been hanging out at the mall all day or did you do something more exciting earlier today?”
“Do you have any fun plans for this evening?”
“Do you like coming here a lot, or is this a special occasion?”

, Once you and the girl have started to talk a bit more, then you can tease her a little bit. As long as you’re both comfortable with it and she understands that you’re joking, this can be a great way to flirt with her and to show her that you’re really interested. Pick something not too serious to tease her about and make sure she returns the teasing before you take it too far. Here are some examples of things you can say to tease her a bit:


“Do you always talk about your cat this much or is it his birthday?”
“Do you always wear your hair up like that or are you just trying to look like Demi Lovato?”

, It’s important to have a balance in the conversation when you’re talking to a new girl. While you may want to charm and impress her, you don’t want her to feel like you’re talking at her and that you only need an audience. Make sure that you’re not doing much more than half the talking and that you’re learning new things about the girl and asking her questions about herself; you don’t want her to think you’re self-centered.


If you open up about yourself and mention something like your favorite band, make sure to turn it around and ask her what her favorite band is, too.
Remember that the key is to be interested, not interesting. You want the girl to see that you care about getting to know her, not about showing off.

, If you want to keep flirting with the girl and to keep the conversation moving in an interesting direction, then you should avoid talking about anything too serious or anything that will bring the mood down, such as the recent death of a relative, a tragic story you read about in the news, or a traumatic moment from your childhood. Stick to topics that will make the girl comfortable and which will make her want to open up and keep talking to you. Here are some things you can talk about:


Your pets
Favorite sports teams
Favorite hobbies
Favorite movies or actors
Funny things that happened to you recently
Your weekend plans
Places you’ve traveled to
Something interesting you recently read

, If you want to keep flirting and keep the conversation going, then you should try to be as positive as you can. You don’t want to get the girl down by whining, complaining, or even criticising everything around you; you want her to see that spending time with you is a positive experience. Though you can make some negative comments if you really want to, you should try to keep things upbeat overall.


If you catch yourself making a negative comment, you should counter it with two positive ones.
Focus on talking about the things you love, such as your favorite subjects in school or your favorite sports, instead of complaining about the things you hate.
Smile, laugh, and be happy and open as often as you can. The girl will feed off of your positive energy.

, If you want to keep the conversation going, you can ask the girl for advice on something not super serious. This shows her that you care about what she thinks and that you take her seriously. People also love giving advice because it makes them feel important, so this is a win-win situation. Pick something you think she might know something about and show that you really do want to know the answer. Here are some questions you can ask:


“Do you think the new Hunger Games movie will be as good as the last one?”
“Do you think I should see Drake or Imagine Dragons next month? They’re playing on the same day.”
“I can’t decide what to get my little sister for her birthday this weekend. Do you have any ideas?”

, Another way to flirt with the girl is to not take yourself too seriously. Try to poke a little bit of fun at yourself without being too self-deprecating and show the girl that she can say anything she wants around you. You don’t want her to feel like you have a sensitive ego; you want her to see that you’re secure enough in who you are to take a little teasing. Here are some comments you can make:


“I started playing guitar to try to pick up girls, but actually, I just love it now…”
“I may be a little too obsessed with my dog, but I like her more than most people I know!”
“Ha, well, I guess not every one of my jokes is golden.”

, If there are other guys around or the girl mentions another guy, then you shouldn’t put them down or make negative comments about them. Though you may think that doing this will make you look better, you’ll actually come off looking insecure and like you don’t think you stack up to those other guys if you do this. If another guy comes around, be nice to him instead of being rude or outright mean; you want the girl to see that you’re a good guy.


Let the girl see that you’re confident enough in yourself to know that other guys don’t matter.

, If you’ve had a great conversation and want to see the girl again, then you should try to ask her out before you walk away. You can keep things really casual and not put a lot of pressure on her by not making it sound like a big deal. Simply wait until the conversation has reached its peak and then tell her you have to get going so she has the best possible impression of you as you leave before you ask her to hang out again. Here are some things you can say:


“I’d love to keep talking about The Strokes, but I have to get going. Can I get your number so we can pick up this conversation over drinks or coffee soon?”
“I actually have to get going but I’d love to see you again so I can give you that book I was telling you about. Can I get your number so we can meet up again soon?”
“It’s been great talking to you and I’d love to see you again. Can I get your number so you can show me if you really are the best bowler in the state?”

Match and Mirror the other person.,
Use the Law of Reciprocation to your favor.,
Communicate your commonalities with the other person.,
Assume rapport from the beginning of the conversation.",How to Build Rapport With a Woman," To build rapport with a woman, you have to assume a similar state of mind that she currently has. This can be achieved by matching and mirroring the person’s posture, movement, language, tonality, etc. The best way to describe this technique is for you to imagine yourself in front of a mirror. You will notice the perfect symmetry not only in posture and movement, but also in breathing. Now in order to build a quick rapport with a woman, you need to mirror her posture, energy level, and movement. Then, for rapport to be more powerful, you have to concentrate on her breathing pattern and try to synchronize your breathing pattern with hers. Finally, listen to her voice and words. On one hand start matching the speed, tempo and volume levels of her voice, and on the other hand try to repeat key words that she used in her conversation. For example, if she says: “I am adventurous and fun”. As you continue talking to her, like 15 minutes later, tell her: “Isn’t it amazing when you meet someone who you don’t really know but you find out they are fun and adventurous. Me, I really start to like this person more and more”. This is not as easy as it looks and takes a lot of practice, but once you have a grip on it, it will make wonders. Experts in hypnosis use the matching and mirroring techniques to prepare the subject to be more easily hypnotized and relaxed.;
, The art of reciprocation has been used by many leaders to influence people. It is covert and effective. Assume someone gives you a gift or does a favor for you without asking for something in return, doesn’t that trigger a feeling of obligation from you to return the favor? Yes it does. Well it is the same if someone shares with you something about himself/herself. On an unconscious level you would ask yourself why that person is sharing personal information with you if he doesn’t trust you. So you would open up and start reciprocating building connection and trust to that person. One technique you can use is to reveal something about yourself casually and then turn the conversation back to her. Coupled with good questions, she would usually reciprocate and start talking about herself.

, The principle of “comrades in arms”, as described in David Lieberman’s book, “Get Anyone to Do Anything”, is very powerful when applied to seduction. If you can share with a woman a common experience, it will create a strong bond. That’s why you find two people who have never met each other, but share similar experience, like winning the lottery or going through the same illness, form a strong friendship instantly. By finding common interests and experiences you build an instant sense of solidarity and trust with the woman. It is essential to keep in mind that when you find someone similar to you, your interest and excitement levels increase and you tend to give up your strong alpha frame. My advice is to keep that level low so that you don’t kill the mystery of the interaction.

, In his book “Persuasion Skills: The Black Book”, Rintu Basu reveals that the quickest and simplest way to build rapport with a woman is to assume you already are in rapport with her. On an unconscious level, she will pick up the signals your sending and she will respond by reciprocating. Do that experiment next time you are around your best friend. Notice the level of rapport between both of you. Isn’t it natural and built in? So what I suggest next time you are around a woman, imagine she is your best friend, act around her as natural as you act with your friend and then assume rapport while conversing with her.

Dating will sometimes feel like work.,
Be yourself.,
Only talk to friends that are positive and supportive.,
Water seeks its own level.,
Be honest with your dates about what’s up with you.,
Look for solutions to your problems.,
Emotional intimacy can lead to great sex, but great sex rarely leads to emotional intimacy.,
Trust the dating process.,
Learn to let people go.,
Set clear boundaries for yourself and do not continue to date anyone who does not respect them.",How to Be Prepared for the Dating World," Like anything worth having, finding a partner requires action, a clear intention, sustained focus, and time.;
, What we see people doing on reality dating shows or much of what is written in books like The Rules is manipulative. If it doesn’t feel authentic, it probably isn’t. Get advice from a reliable relationship coach or from friends that are in solid, drama-free relationships.

, Refrain from speaking to anyone who makes negative generalizations about men, women, or the dating process in general.

, No matter you say you want in a partner, you can only relate to other people from the level that you are at. As Marianne Williamson says: It’s not that you attract unavailable people, it’s that you give them your number.

, This doesn’t mean blaming them for your stuff or complaining about your life. It does mean taking responsibility for what’s going on with you and focusing on what you are learning. If you talk about an issue in your life with a date, end that story by sharing something positive that you are learning from the experience. Your date will appreciate both your optimism and your willingness to grow and learn.

, Complaining about your situation doesn’t change anything. Let’s say you send out 5 or 10 emails and get no responses. Rather than using that as a reason to quit, ask yourself what else you can do. Maybe your emails need to be more playful or you need a new picture or a different profile. Maybe you aren’t writing to the right people. Have a friend or a professional relationship coach look at what you’re doing and give you honest feedback.

, Consenting adults can do whatever they please, but we kid ourselves when we think that we can turn our sexual playmates into soul mates. Any two people can have sex. The real challenge and the reason why so many of us are struggling to create relationships that last is that we don’t know how to get emotionally naked with one another to create real intimacy at the soul level.

, Werner Erhard said that we are meaning making machines. This means that we make up stories about everything that happens. When we do this we draw conclusions and trick ourselves into thinking that we have it all figured out. The truth is that we don’t sometimes know why something happened they way it did until days, weeks or even years later when we have gained some perspective. Let’s say someone you’re dating abruptly stops calling. In the moment you might immediately think that you were to blame, but what if this experience was what you needed to help you learn to deal with rejection without giving up on your dream? Although it didn’t seem like it initially, the dating process was taking you where you needed to go.

, One of the hardest things for my clients is to tell someone that they don’t want to see them again. We do others a disservice by staying in a relationship with them just because we don’t want to hurt their feelings by telling them how we really feel. It is much more caring to set them free so that they can find someone who appreciates them and who can reciprocate their feelings.

, For example, if you tell someone that you want to wait to have sex until you are in a committed relationship and that person tries to push your boundary, do not continue seeing them. This is a clear sign that they are not concerned about your well-being.

, Women are all different, but if you ask women what they enjoy doing, for most shopping is somewhere on the list. If you are at the mall with your woman, you should carry the bags. She shouldn't be struggling while you’re walking around, hands free.

, -- but don't insist, if she objects...

, Do not cheat or give any appearance of behavior that could be construed as disloyalty to a lady-friend, your date or to others.

, It shows you are really interested and reliable, and respect her time.

, Only make dates when you know for sure you are free to go out. If a true emergency arises that will prevent you from keeping the date, call as soon as possible. If you are unable to reach her by phone, text, e-mail, Facebook email -- do something to let her know you can't make it. Try to set up a follow-up date. This shows character.

, Women can handle it. Give them some credit. Don't play games with her and have her thinking the relationship is something that it's not.

, Let her know she looks nice. Most women are wired to want to feel beautiful, but not being told in an unrealistic way. Tell her in a courteous and sincere way.

, Don't boss or attempt to control the woman. Do not be condescending, talking down, leading the woman to feel that she is not respected. It's never okay to disrespect anyone, but men are particularly to uphold and honor women. Never bad mouth or curse, call her names, deride her or roughly ""put your hands on"" her in private or in public. These behaviors reveal that you are weak, selfish and immature.

, Be there for her when she needs you. Expect her to get nice compliments. And if anybody tries to hurt her, stand up for her and protect her. Don’t allow anybody, especially another man to disrespect her, call her names, touch her inappropriately, or such. Don't permit your children to speak disrespectfully of or to a lady or their mother (support your wife in disciplining the children and in arguments with your family).

, When going to a formal occasion, you can try holding out your arm to give her something to hold onto. Historically, chivalry dictated that this was the non-dominant arm, as the other arm was used to fight off other males. However, use whichever arm is more natural in the situation.

Get into a positive mindset before the date.,
Avoid dwelling on the anxiety.,
Be confident.,
Avoid having unrealistic expectations.",How to Be Calm on a First Date1," Going into a date feeling negative or too stressed won’t make for a good date. To help combat this negativity, try to get yourself into a positive mood before going on the date. Do something before your date that makes you happy and boosts your mood.For example, you can put on your favorite music that makes you feel attractive or happy, dance around your house, or put on your favorite outfit.
Focus on your positive qualities. Look in the mirror and give yourself a few compliments. List a few positive qualities about yourself.;
, Everyone gets nervous on a first date. It’s completely normal. That means you shouldn’t obsess about your anxiety. You’re not going to ruin the date, and you can’t know if the date is going to be a disaster or not. Think about how often you feel anxiety and everything turns out perfectly fine.Instead of the anxiety, think about how it’s exciting to be going out on a date and meeting someone new, even if it doesn’t turn into a love connection.

, Going on a date is a mutual decision, which means the other person wants to go on a date with you. This should give you a bit of confidence to help combat your nerves. Try to find ways to boost your confidence as you prepare for your date so you can be your best self.

You can work on looking confident. Keep your head held high, have good posture, make eye contact, and smile. By acting confident, you'll actually feel more confident.
Focus on your good qualities. It may be a physical attribute or a character trait. Remember, the person wanted to go out with you for a reason, so don't doubt that you deserve to enjoy your date.

, If every date went perfectly, people wouldn’t need to date multiple people or feel anxiety. The reality is that some first dates are awkward, bad, or boring. That’s normal. Don’t let everything ride on this one date, and it may help lessen your anxiety.Just because your first date isn’t perfect doesn’t mean there isn’t a chance for a second date. Sometimes, it takes a few dates to start connecting well. Don’t get upset if the date isn’t going perfectly. Very few first dates do.

Come up with a few topics of conversation.,
Pick a date location that makes you feel comfortable.,
Choose a fun activity.,
Dress comfortably.",How to Be Calm on a First Date2," If you’re afraid your mind is going to go blank in the middle of your date, you may want to come up some things you can talk about. What do you both have in common? What are you excited about or interested in? Having a few ideas in mind can help calm you down.For example, if you know that you both like cooking, travelling, or being outside, think of a few questions or stories you can tell dealing with those topics.

, Though you may want to do something fun on your date, you shouldn’t do something new that will make you even more uncomfortable. You want to go to a place you're somewhat familiar and comfortable with. Even if it's not some place you've gone often, if it's in an area you know, that's enough to help calm you down.


For example, if you never go to fancy restaurants or the ballet, don't choose it as a first date location.

, Dates should be fun. Sure, everyone goes to dinner and a movie, and that may be enjoyable for you. However, you can help calm your first date jitters by doing something you know will be fun. Try something you'd never think of as a first date. It may help both of you break the ice. For example, you can go window or regular shopping, work out together, go to a bookstore or music stores and look around, go hiking, or go to a museum.
Choose an activity both of you can enjoy and are interested in, if you know what the other person likes. If you don't know what the other person likes, try to ask them. Often, doing these things help you show off your personality the most.

, Though you want to look nice and dress to impress, don’t wear clothes you feel uncomfortable in. You won't feel like yourself. You'll be uneasy, and your date will be able to tell. Choosing a casual or nice outfit is best. Think about where you are going on your date and dress accordingly.For example, if you never wear dresses and heels or a suit and tie, don't do it on a first date. If you wear clothes you can’t breathe in or shoes you can’t walk in, you may start tripping or have trouble breathing.

"
"
Stay in the moment.,
Remind yourself that you like your date.,
Think of them as a friend.,
Remember your date is also nervous.,
Encourage your date to talk.,
Avoid jumping to the wrong conclusion.,
Try deep breathing exercises.",How to Be Calm on a First Date3," One way that people give into their anxiety is getting trapped in their heads and thinking about worst-case scenarios or situations that are not real. Be present on your date by staying in the moment. Staying in the moment can help keep you focused on the person in front of you, which can help you stay calm.Tell yourself, ""I'm going to enjoy this moment and not listen to my thoughts."" Thoughts are not reality, and they keep you away from the moment. Pushing your thoughts aside can help you enjoy your date.
Focus on what is going on around you. Don't think, ""My date doesn't like me."" Instead, pay attention to your date and interact with them. They probably like you quite a bit since they agreed to go on the date in the first place.

, Don’t forget that your date likes you, too. They agreed to go on a date with you, so that means you both already have some kind of mutual attraction. Consider why you like this person. Are they physically attractive? Or do you think they have a nice personality?


It doesn't matter why you like them. Remember that going out with the person you like is an exciting and happy moment.

, If you look at your date as someone you don't know well, you may get nervous and won't be able to just be yourself. Talk to your date as you would a friend. Playfully tease them as you might your friends, tell silly stories, and don't be afraid to show off your wonderful personality.Treating them as someone you want to be around, and who wants to be around you, can help you feel more at ease. Not focusing on the romantic pressure can also help you act more natural.

, Almost everyone who goes on a first date is nervous. That means you’re not the only one nervous on this date. Sometimes, reminding yourself that the other person is just as nervous can help calm you down and help you enjoy yourself., Some people think that they need to fill up every silence because silences make them nervous. They may also think that silences mean awkwardness and that the date isn’t going well. Two people who don’t know each other that well are going to naturally experience a few silences, so don’t get freaked out by them. Instead, give your date an opportunity to talk.If your date isn’t doing much talking, ask them a question. The question can build off something you know they’re interested in or something you were talking about earlier.

, You may start getting stressed out because you think that your date doesn’t like you. Because you’re nervous, you may come up with worst case scenarios in your head. Making up scenarios just causes more stress, and many times, it’s not even true. Try to stay calm by not jumping to conclusions.You can’t read your date’s mind. Remember, they agreed to go on the date with you and a few awkward moments doesn’t mean the date is going badly. Just enjoy the date and keep the made up scenarios to a minimum.

, Taking deep breaths can have a calming effect on your body. Before and during your date, you can try some deep breathing exercises to calm down so you can enjoy yourself.Take a deep breath through your nose and hold for a count of five or six. Then breathe out through your mouth for a count of around seven. Try to repeat 10 times.

Pay attention to his attitude.,
Notice who initiates conversation.,
Watch the emoticons.,
Wait for contact.,
Watch for the showboat.,
See if he talks about you.",How to Determine if a Guy is Nervous Around You Because He Likes You1," If you talk to him online, notice if he's confident and talkative, then see if he's the same way in person. If he likes you, chances are he'll be nervous/shy when you're right in front of him., If you talk to him online, take note of who starts most of the conversations. If it's him, that's a good sign that he likes you.

, These days people throw out emoticons all the time. It’s usually a good indication of him liking you if he regularly sends you smiley faces.If you’re flattered, send a smiley face back. It may give him the courage to ask you out.

, When a guy tries to touch you in a casual way, that is a good indicator that he likes you. Beware of the creepier guys who may try to touch you in inappropriate ways. If it is done properly, then just smile and keep the conversation flowing.

, Some men will take the primal route and try to impress you with their feats. Even the nervous type can embellish a story to you.Notice if he tries to grab your attention with a story about him “rescuing sea otters off the south pacific” or how his “dad played in Fleetwood Mac.”


They’ll usually go for something small like “yeah I play the electric guitar” or “did you see my touchdown last Friday?”
If you like them back and they begin throwing out their feats, play along but quickly change the subject.

, You can’t necessarily go out looking for this. It just happens if it happens. Sometimes if guys are interested they’ll ask your friends about you. This is a clear indication that he likes you."

Watch his body language.,
Watch for fidgets.,
See how close he is.,
Notice his smile.,
Watch the eye contact.",How to Determine if a Guy is Nervous Around You Because He Likes You2," You can tell whether or not he's nervous around you from his behavior. Compare how he acts around his friends to how he acts around you. Does he convey some type of yearning around you?, A lot of men aren’t smooth and have very little experience approaching a girl. A repercussion of our current age is an uneasiness which causes fidgeting. Watch to see what he does with his hands.

, He may try to get closer to you. See if he naturally gravitates towards you in a crowd. Even if you are sitting together, notice if he becomes close enough for subtle body contact. These are good indicators that he likes you., One of the easier signals a guy can give is to simply smile. Sometimes men are just extra smiley, but if you notice a lot of smiles directed at you, it’s a good sign., See if he's looking at you when he thinks that you're not looking. He could do a variety of things if you catch his stare. He could look immediately down, look at you for a few more seconds then look down, or just keep staring.


Look him in the eyes. If you feel like you've held eye contact with him for even a fraction more of a second than you would with anyone else, then there most likely is something there."

Pay attention to questions.,
Listen to his tone.,
Notice the mumbles.,
Listen for the mundane.,
Talk on the phone.",How to Determine if a Guy is Nervous Around You Because He Likes You3," If a guy likes you and you’re in conversation, he might ask you a bunch of questions. If he’s smooth, then you may not even notice it. He’s fishing for a similar interest that you two can share.Embrace a common interest if he becomes excited. Ask him questions in return to see if he is a phony or not.

, Sometimes men will change their tone of voice depending on who they talk to. Listen to him in a group with his guy friends. Then see if he talks the same way to you when you’re alone. If he does talk the same, it doesn’t necessarily mean he isn’t into you. His voice should soften ever so slightly., Some people naturally mumble. When guys like someone and they’re prone to mumble, you might hear it. This is more characteristic of a shy guy.


If you’re in this scenario and want him to relax, rest your hand on his shoulder or his upper forearm.

, A lot of times if you both like each other, it doesn’t matter what you talk about. Two people who like each other can go on and on about the most mundane topics. Think back on your conversations. Recall if the subject matter was bleak, but your body chemistry is excited.

, If this guy likes you and you like him, try calling him on the phone. Why wait for the guy to initiate things. Take control and call him. See if the conversation moves naturally.


Some people aren’t phone people, but you can sometimes tell if they’re trying to make an effort.

Ask yourself if you want it to be a date.,
Work up the nerve to ask.,
Think about the best time and way to ask.,
Ask if it’s a date.,
Be prepared for the answer.",How to Figure Out Whether or Not It's a Date1," The answer to this question may influence your approach to how you ask the person whether or not they are asking you on a date. Are you interested in this person, or are you worried that they have romantic feelings for you when you don't feel that way about them? Try writing in a journal, talking to a trusted friend, or just spending some time thinking about how you truly feel about this person and what you'd like your relationship to be.;
, You may feel uncomfortable asking the person outright, as it is a slightly awkward situation, so it may be necessary to build up your courage beforehand. Being courageous means you acknowledge your fear (fear that they will say no, that you will feel uncomfortable, that someone will get their feelings hurt) and press forward despite that fear.


Try faking it. Pretending that you feel confident and courageous can trick your brain and help you actually feel confident.
Practice how you will ask and how you will respond in different scenarios. What will you say if they say yes? If they say no? If they say they're not sure? You may want to write out your responses or practice aloud.
Remind yourself that, while it may seem daunting, you are saving yourself a lot of time and potential heartache and anguish by being direct. If you are interested in the person and they say it's not a date, you can take some time to deal with your disappointment and then move on. If you don't ask, you may waste days, weeks, or months trying to figure it out and possibly missing out on meeting people who do want to date you.

, Is this a friend or someone you don't know very well? If it's a friend, asking over a text message may be to casual. Ask to speak with them in person or over the phone so you can use body language and tone to your advantage. Text messages are too easy to misinterpret, and may make it seem like you don't really care or take it seriously. If it's someone you don't know that well, a text might be okay, but consider talking on the phone to minimize any mixed signals. Also, consider asking before the date if you think you will feel on-edge and be unable to enjoy yourself when hanging out (you may be worried you will have to fend of a kiss at some point, for instance).


You can also ask during the date, but think about how the other person might feel. Maybe they've spent half the date thinking they are out with their dream partner, only to have you ask half-way through dinner ""Wait, do you think this is a date?"" Talking about it beforehand gives both of you the chance to back out of the date if you want to.
You may also be questioning what your hangout meant afterwards when you didn't have any questions before. For example, maybe you thought it was a date, but the other person didn't try to kiss you or send any ""date"" vibes. Was it a date or were they just nervous? It's okay to ask afterwards, saying something like, ""I had a really great time last night, but I'm feeling a little confused about where we stand. Was that a date?""

, Be kind, sincere, and honest when you ask the person if they are asking you are on a date or not. Don't laugh or act surprised when you ask, such as saying, ""Oh my God, did you think this was a date?!"" It's okay to acknowledge that it is an awkward or uncomfortable situation — just keep the other person's feelings in mind.


Say something like, “I feel weird asking this. I honestly was not sure what you meant when you asked to see me tonight. Are we just hanging out as friends or is it a date?”
Or you could say, “I know this is kind of awkward to say, but I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page before we go out this weekend. Is this a date or something more casual?”

, Asking cuts right to the chase, and you need to remember that the answer might not be what you want to hear. Know that you may be disappointed by their response, or you may have to let them down if they think it's a date and you're not interested. Run through these scenarios before you ask so you'll be prepared to handle any response.



Rejection hurts, whether you're the one being rejected or you have to do the rejecting. It's okay to feel disappointed or sad if things don't turn out the way you hoped.
If the person says no and you were hoping for a yes, it's okay to say something like, ""Oh, that's kind of disappointing. I really like you and it really seemed like you might be asking me out."" You can follow up with, ""I really like spending time with you, but I don't think I can do it as just friends, so I'm going to have to cancel"" if you would prefer not to hang out after all.
If the person says yes and you were hoping for a no, try something like, ""I think you're an amazing person, but I don't have romantic feelings for you. I'd really love to still hang out, but if you're not up to it anymore, that's totally fine.""
If you and the other person agree that it is or isn't a date, you can laugh off the temporary awkwardness and you can enjoy your time together without worrying about what it ""is.""

Pay attention to what they refer to it as.,
Find out if you are going to be alone or at a group event.",How to Figure Out Whether or Not It's a Date2," If they have ever seemed interested in you, then it might be a date. Being flirtatious (giggling and teasing, holding eye contact, etc.); joking around with you; and being touchy with you are signs they might like you. A long history of hanging out as just friends, however, may mean this is not a date.


If they seemed nervous or excited when the plans were established to see each other, it might be a date. If the person is usually calm and cool and could barely get the question out or look you in the eye when they asked, it's a sign they're probably interested in you.

, If they pick you up or want you to pick them up, it is a good sign that it is a date. They might want to pick you up because they have something planned or don’t want you to flake. If they invite you to come over, it might be more casual of an event.Notice if the person opens the car door for you. This can be standard for older people regardless of their feelings for the other person, or it may be something the person always does. If it's not their usual behavior, however, and they open the door for you, it indicates the person may care about you as more than a friend.

, If they have suggestions or a plan, it might be a date. Especially if the plan is dinner, a movie, a hike, or something else that is traditionally done on a date. It is a very good indication it is a date if they make a reservation. It is less likely to be a date if they do not seem to care what you do, invite you over to just hang out, or suggest you play it by ear. Finding out if they have a plan can be as simple as asking what they want to do. Say something like, “Hey! What did you want to do on Friday?”

, Has this been planned for a week or did your “date” invite you over last minute? If they gave you plenty of notice, it is more likely to be a date than if they suggested you come over last minute. Wanting to see you at odd times, like in the middle of the night or in the middle of work times, could also mean it is not a date. , It's unlikely the person referred to it as a ""date,"" even if that's what they are. To minimize the chance of rejection, a person may ask you to ""hang out"" when they really want a date. Or, the person may see it as a totally casual thing, and just ""hanging out"" is exactly what they have in mind. If the person suggests hanging out, don't make any assumptions about whether or not it is a date. If the person says they'd like to get to know you, see you, or spend time with you, it is more likely they are asking you on a date.


If they asked you by saying: “I would love to see you Friday night to get to know you better,” it might be a date.

, If they invite you to hang out with a bunch of their friends or go to a party with them, then it is probably not a date. If they want to see you one on one, it is more likely that it is a date. You can subtly find out if it is going to be a group thing ahead of time by asking.If you want it to be a date, try saying, “Hey! What are you and I doing on Saturday?” If you emphasize that you just want it to be “you and I” when you ask, they will hopefully get the hint.

Notice how they say goodbye.",How to Figure Out Whether or Not It's a Date3," It might be a date if they show up in a dress, heels, or slacks, or it just appears in general that they put in an extra effort to see you. If your “date” is wearing an unwashed sweatshirt and it looks (or smells) like they didn’t even bother to shower, then it is probably not a date., If they ask you questions about yourself, pay attention to you, look at you often, listen to you, and generally seem like they care about you, then it is likely to be a date. It might not be a date if they are barely paying attention to you and are not trying to make conversation., If it was a date, you would be their current love life, not whatever they are talking about. It is not a date if they are going on about another person they are interested in, asking for relationship advice, or hitting on other people during the date., You can tell a lot about a situation based on someone’s body language. If they lean toward you, put their arm around you, try to hold your hand, or turn their body toward you, they might be interested in you. Whereas, if they are leaned over in the opposite direction, barely even noticing you’re on the other side of the couch, then it is not a date.If they seem a little too comfortable and relaxed, you might be hanging out as just friends.If they are nervous or fidgety it might be because it is a date.

, If they offer to pay for you, it is likely a date. If you offer to pay and they decline, pay attention to how they decline. If they seem weirded out you offered to pay at all, then it might not be a date. If they seem flattered but insist on paying for themselves, it might be a date., If they kiss you goodbye, then you can probably assume it was a date. Giving you a hive-five or handshake or simply just saying goodbye are not signals you just went on a date. It might not have been a date if they seem really offhand and casual about the goodbye (“See you later. Bye”). If they say a thoughtful goodbye, it is more likely it was a date.

Deal with rejection in a healthy way.",How to Figure Out Whether or Not It's a Date4," If they contact you after the “date,” whether it is the next day or even a few days later, it is a good sign that it was actually a date. Saying something like “I had a great time the other night,” or asking to see you again are good signs it was a date.

, You can check their social media to help you figure out if it was a date. If they post something about the “date,” then it was probably a date. A picture of the two of you on their Instagram captioned “Had a great time last night!” means it was probably a date. If their social media is full of pictures with other girls or guys they seem interested in or they seem like they might be in a relationship, then it might not have been a date.

, If they ask you out again, it was probably a first date and they want to go on another. Even if you are pretty certain it was not a date, it might have been a precursor to a real date. They could ask you out still. They might have wanted to hang out as friends and get to know you before they asked you on a real date.

, If things didn't go as you planned, such as if you thought it was a date but walked away realizing the person clearly isn't interested in you romantically, take some time to deal with your feelings. It's okay to cry, vent in your journal, punch a pillow, eat a bowl of ice cream, and grieve for a little while. Remind yourself that most of the time, rejection doesn't actually have a lot to do with you. Though it might be hard, try not to take it personally.


Sometimes people aren't in a place where they're ready to date.
Think about other people you have loved, valued, and cared about, but have not wanted to date. Now picture that this is how the other person sees you. It doesn't mean there is something wrong with you — you can still be a wonderful, valuable, worthwhile person if this person doesn't want to date you.
Spend time with friends and people who care about you. Do something fun to distract yourself.
Let it go. If the person says they aren't interested in dating you, don't see that as a challenge to change their mind. Respect their decision and their feelings.

You should also try to tell your ex-partner before word gets around about your new relationship, as you want your partner to hear the news from you. You may decide to bring the best friend to the meeting. However, you may want to be cautious about doing this, as this may anger your ex-partner.

, When you tell your ex, you should make sure you are being accountable for your actions and choices. Do this by using “I” statements as you tell your ex about your new relationship. Speak clearly and honestly so your ex-partner knows you are trying to be sincere and mature about the situation.For example, you may say, “I wanted you to hear the news from me, directly. I have started seeing your best friend. I did not plan it or know it was going to happen. We were all out one night and one thing lead to another. I am really happy with this person and I hope you can be happy for me.”

, You should maintain eye contact with your ex-partner when you tell him about the relationship and keep your body relaxed. Avoid crossing your arms over your chest or sitting on the edge of your seat. Try to project positive body language so your ex-partner knows you are speaking with intention. This could help your ex to come to terms with what you are saying.You should also try not to get upset or emotional on your end, as you do not want to make the conversation seem too serious or overwrought. Instead, try to keep your body relaxed and maintain eye contact so you can make sure your ex-partner understands what you are trying to share.

, Be prepared for your ex to be upset and unsettled by news of your new relationship. Even if you broke up awhile ago, dating your ex’s best friend can be a touchy situation. Rather than try to get your ex to accept the news, you should give your ex time to process the situation.This may mean that you agree not to be in contact for a few days or a few weeks. You may also give your ex space to process by opting out of get together with mutual friends.

, You may also talk to the best friend and recommend that you both give your ex space and time to process. Sometimes, people just need to digest emotional information and come to terms with a sensitive situation.The best friend and your ex-partner may have a different relationship than you have to your ex. So, over time, the best friend may be able to reach out to your ex and explain their side of the story. This may help your ex accept your new relationship and also avoid ruining the friendship between the best friend and your ex.

, Though you may try your hardest to get your ex-partner to understand and accept your new relationship, it may not always be possible. Your ex-partner may be too upset by the relationship and have a hard time being okay with your new romance. Your ex may also be angry that their best friend became involved with someone from their past. You may need to learn to accept that having your new relationship means letting go of your relationship with your ex-partner.Sometimes, ex-partners can also get possessive and jealous when faced with this situation. Keep in mind that though you can feel bad for dating your ex’s best friend, this does not mean you have to give up your new relationship. Over time, your ex may come around and accept the situation. But you cannot force your ex to do this.

, To create a healthy relationship with the best friend, you should avoid comparisons between the best friend and your ex. Your relationship is not a competition and the best friend has different qualities than your ex. Comparing the best friend and your ex will just lead to conflict and tension in your new relationship.For example, maybe the best friend has a different approach to date night. Maybe he tends to plan more intimate dates at home, and your ex would go all out with an expensive dinner for date night. Rather than compare the two, focus on the positives of each approach. Then, remind yourself that you are with the best friend because he does things differently and offers different things than your ex did.

, Though you may no longer be close with your ex, your ex’s best friend may still be close with him and want to maintain a relationship with him. Trash talking your ex, in front of the best friend or with other friends, will only create more tension between your ex and the best friend.Gossiping about your ex can also create problems in your new relationship. Your hurtful words about your ex may make your new partner upset. This could then lead to tension and conflict between the two of you.

, For the sake of your new relationship, you should try to be okay with your new partner spending time with your old partner. Your new partner may also miss spending time with his best friend, despite the circumstances. You should encourage them to spend time together so it does not seem like you are trying to be controlling or selfish in the relationship.You can also try to maintain a better relationship with your ex-partner, especially if your new partner is still his best friend. Making an effort to spend time together as a group can help to normalize the situation and allow your ex to get used to your new relationship.

, If you still share mutual friends with your ex, you and your new partner will eventually end up at social events where your ex is present. When and if this happens, you should try to be respectful towards your ex's feelings and be considerate of your ex when you are around him with the best friend. This may mean not showing too much physical affection with the best friend when you are around your ex, such as holding hands, kissing, or cuddling together. Displays of affection could make your ex uncomfortable or upset, especially if you recently broke up and are now seeing his best friend.


You should also try to be inclusive of your ex, especially if your ex and his best friend are still close. This may mean including your ex in social get togethers with other friends or being okay if your ex hangs out with you and the best friend. Over time, the situation should normalize and hopefully your ex will get used to your relationship with the best friend.

Don’t get played.",How to Date Your Professor," Unless it is a really big lecture class, your professor will probably notice when you are missing. It will be hard to impress her or catch her eye if you don’t show up., You’ll want to catch your professor’s eye and make sure he knows who you are. Sitting in front will put you close to him, and probably make it easier for him to recognize you.Being physically close like this can be subtle given the setting, but it can help in the longer term.This can be especially important in a large lecture class, where the professor almost certainly won’t make an effort to learn the names of all 300 students.

, Locking eyes is a powerful way to signal a connection. Chances are you won’t get the chance for several seconds of staring into each other’s eyes, so be ready to look back at him when he scans the room. A few seconds of eye contact every couple of minutes can go a long way, even subconsciously.Just be careful about staring at the professor so much that you stop taking notes. You might miss something important, and he’ll probably notice you not paying attention to your work.
Make sure you are smiling when you make eye contact. Putting a friendly look on your face will make you look confident and more attractive.This is all the more important when you are making eye contact with him for those brief moments.

, Avoid revealing clothing, as that is inappropriate for the classroom. Instead, wear clean, form-fitting clothing that accentuates the positive parts of your physique. You will impress your professor by looking professional, or at least not ruin his or her opinion of you by dressing inappropriately.For women, look for softer colors that signal romance, like pink or coral. For style, accentuate your curves, especially those parts of your body that you want your professor to look at.For men, your clothes should be clean and wrinkle-free. Nice shoes, instead of a ragged pair of old sneakers, can help as well. In terms of color, red is always good for drawing attention, and projecting an image of strength and confidence., Professors love it when students ask and answer questions. It lets them know they are reaching students, and that the class is engaged in what is going on.Make sure your questions and comments are serious responses to the topic at hand. The important thing is that your professor sees you as paying attention and willing to learn. Avoid joke answers, as professors usually find that to be an annoying distraction.
Lean forward when you talk in class. You won’t be able to use a lot of body language tricks, since you’ll be stuck at a desk, so something subtle will have to do. Leaning forward when you talk reinforces that you want to get closer to her, even if that effect will probably only be subconscious., Running a class can be difficult, especially when it is probably one of several your professor has, and he will appreciate any help he can get. Volunteer to present something, or jump into discussions during silence. This will help give your professor a positive opinion of you.If your professor ends up in an argument with another student, jump in on his side. This can work in an in-class debate, or if another student is trying to argue about the requirements for an assignment. Keep your input brief, as it is more important that your professor notices you jumped in to help rather than what you actually said. This is also the kind of thing you can do after class, telling your professor that you appreciated the position he took.Keep an eye on your professor too. If he seems harried or in need of a helping hand, don’t be afraid to ask. He may not need your help, but will appreciate your offering.

, Your professor is more likely to notice a student who is doing well and making an effort to be successful in class. You don’t necessarily need to get an “A” grade. Professors notice and like students who follow directions and show improvement over the course of the semester.


Making sure you follow all directions given for an assignment is a great way to stay on your professor’s good side. Ignoring or missing required steps is an annoyance, while doing things as requested can help you stand out from all the students who don’t. Plus, you can always ask about your professor’s reasoning for those requirements, another great excuse to talk to her., Professors work hard on their classes, and like the satisfaction of knowing that it went well. Plus, this little bit of conversation becomes another way for him to remember who you are.This doesn’t have to be a long conversation. Tell your professor “That was a really good explanation of…” and mention a topic you covered in the class. Close by saying something like “I really understand that now,” which tells your professor he did a good job.
Be sure to smile and make eye contact when you tell him this. This gives you a friendly demeanor, and subtly suggests you are trying to make a connection.

, It is hard for class to focus on the subject material the whole time, and your professor will surely slip in comments about her life and interests. Learning this information is not necessarily for your use in class, but so you have some topics in mind to talk about later.


You want to find potential signs of common interest. Like any other relationship, your compatibility will be tied to having some things in common. If the only thing you have in common with your professor is an interest in the class material, you’ll probably find her pretty uninteresting in a relationship.Be sure to watch for signs of a relationship. Look for a wedding ring on the fourth finger of the left hand, and listen if she mentions some kind of significant other.

, If you see your professor around campus, and he isn’t talking directly to someone else, go ahead and say hello. The first few times don’t need to be long conversations, just something to help him remember you. As the semester goes along, he will almost certainly become more comfortable talking to you.Your conversation can be pretty wide-ranging, depending on how well you know your professor. In this kind of informal setting, you don’t have to talk about the class. Things happening around campus, in the news, or really anything can be a good way to start conversation.
Find other similarities. Your conversations will need to move beyond academic topics if you want an actual relationship. Use these chats as a chance to learn more about him. Listen if he starts to share his interests with you, like food or music. Go ahead and respond with your interests to see if there is further compatibility.
Another way to set this up is to invite your professor to lunch. Many schools have programs that encourage students to have meals with professors as a way to interact outside the classroom. You might even get the school to pay for your lunch that day.This is not a date, so you may want to get a few other students from the class together as well.

, Professors have usually dedicated their lives to studying in their field. He will probably find it very attractive that you have a similar interest. Similar interests are a good way to suggest compatibility., Sure, office hours are there for you to get extra help in the class, but they are also a good time to see your professor without the rest of the class around.While professors are supposed to hold regular office hours, very few students use them. Not only will you be highly unlikely to see another student there, but your professor will be excited that someone came.
When you go to the office, be sure to have something to talk about related to the class. It doesn’t need to be a serious question or concern about your grade, just that you want to talk about something that came up in lecture. If you come in only asking personal questions and don’t mention the class, he will probably see right through what you are doing and not let it go any further.
Sit as close to him as possible. Try to move as close as you can, like getting your chair closer to his in the office. You shouldn’t invade his personal space, but move closer as a way to let him know you want a closer connection., Professors spend much of their time researching and writing alone, but have probably had some very interesting experiences that they would love to share with others. Ask about interesting places your professor has visited or people she has met. She will enjoy the attention, and probably have some good stories as well., Look for speakers, symposia, or other events put on by your professor’s department. These will be more relaxed settings where you can talk to him about something interesting, like the speaker you just heard, and not have to worry about the class.Remember that these events are public, so other students and members of the department will see you. You’ll want to keep your flirting to a minimum.
Look for other on-campus events as well, especially things your professor indicated he might be interested in. If you go, you may find him there, or you can always earn points as a good listener by suggesting things he can do.

, Professors work hard on projects outside of just your class, and love the recognition that can come from it.The websites for both your school and your professor’s department will announce when faculty members accomplish something. Keep an eye on those pages to see if your professor’s name pops up.

, Before jumping in and asking him out, make sure you know that he would be open to some kind of relationship. There are a few different variables to watch for, some of which you can pick up while in class or talking around campus.


Check his relationship status. If your professor is single, then you should feel comfortable at least trying. If he is married, you may still be able to get a physical relationship out of it, but it will probably be very secretive. Of course, you have to decide if that kind of person is someone you want to be involved with.
Learn his preferred gender. College campuses are among the most welcoming environments for a variety of gender preferences. You don’t want to embarrass yourself by asking out your professor only to discover he prefers a gender other than yours, so look for clues to who he likes.

, This covers both you and your professor. Either of you could get in trouble for acting on an attraction, especially if the feeling is not mutual. If your professor does not respond to your pursuit, drop it. It’s definitely not worth getting in trouble with the university for harassing him., Most schools have policies against professors dating students, and they are strictest when it comes to students they are actually teaching. To avoid unnecessary headaches for both of you, don’t act on your feelings until the semester is over.Your best bet is really to wait until you have graduated. That gets rid of any chance you will ever have a class together in the future. Even if your relationship is over by that point, a bad ending can have lasting repercussions on your grade or classroom demeanor. It will also be much easier for your professor to see you as mature if you are not still in school.
Remember that when you are in the class, your relationship is definitely unequal. Your professor holds a significant amount of power as the person who teaches and grades the class. It is never good to be intimate with someone who has that kind of influence over your future.If your professor is younger and untenured, a relationship with a student is a good way for him to lose his job. Understandably, he will be unlikely to take a risk like that. Even tenured professors can lose their job over dating students., If you want a relationship with your professor, you will probably need to be direct about it. Given the potential complications, as well as the concern over sexual harassment complaints, he will probably be very hesitant to ask you himself.


Being direct also means both of you know what is happening. This is not the time for grey areas. If you are both clear about your romantic intentions, he will be more likely to reciprocate appropriately.

, Be warned that some professors will encourage relationships with their students (especially male professors and females students) to bolster their own egos. If you think your professor is using you in this manner, get out before anything happens.Be aware of how he acts around you. If he is willing to initiate flirting quickly or suggests things that past students have done, and otherwise blatantly ignoring school rules, he is probably signaling that you are not the first, and probably won’t be the last.
There can be other signs in the classroom. Watch to see if your professor flirts regularly with other students along with you, brags about his attractiveness, or seems to be hung up on how the students see him. These can all be signs he sees relationships with students as a way to boost his own ego.Professors who date their students will quickly develop a reputation in their department, even if the department doesn’t do anything about it. If you have a concern, older students and TAs will probably have more information."

Be confident.,
Don't get attached.,
Always think of your next move.",How to Be a Player1," You can walk and talk like a player, but if you don't have the right mindset, the ladies will be turned off. Before you become a true player, you have to work to have true self-confidence. Here's how to do it:


Ease your anxieties. Think about anything you may be worried about--your future, your family, or your career--and try to minimize your anxieties about all aspects of your life. A healthy amount of stress is normal, but if you're obsessing too much about what can go wrong, you won't be able to think in the moment, and the ladies will know you have too much on your mind.
Address your flaws. Be aware of your shortcomings, and work to improve them. Are you a bad listener, disorganized, or too easily distracted? Make a plan to work on improving these characteristics little by little. Nobody's perfect, but everyone can improve.
Think positive. When you walk into a room, think of the three things you like most about yourself instead of the three things you want to work on. If you think positive about yourself, the ladies will follow.;
, A true player should value quantity over quality, so if you're committed to this lifestyle, you need to enjoy the company of as many women as possible, and not get hung up on one girl. If you're worrying about when what a certain girl thinks of you, or when she'll call, then you're approaching girlfriend territory with her, and you should put your guard up. Here's how to keep things open:


If you feel that a girl is getting too close to you, pull away. If a girl is initiating deep conversations about your personal lives, wanting to move in with you, or plan a romantic vacation, then she definitely wants to be your girlfriend, and you should move on.
Keep things light. Enjoy a woman's company, but don't let her make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Focus on having a good time both out in the world and in the bedroom, and change the topic when things get too deep.
Don't think mushy thoughts. When you see a potential conquest, you should be thinking about how much fun you'll having dancing, making out, or hooking up--not what your grandkids would look like. Think cool, and the rest will follow.
If you've really found the right girl, it may be time to rethink your lifestyle. Even a true player can fall a victim to love, and if you've found a girl who makes you feel like she really is the only girl in the world and the person you want to spend all of your time with, then don't give her up. This is rare in the life of the true player, but if you really can't control how you feel, it may be worth it to tell the other ladies you're off the market.

, Like a true chess champ, you should always be at least one step--or many--ahead of the game. If you only focus on the present, you won't have a revolving door of women in your life. Here's how to do it:


Have a game plan for your night. If you're out at a club, think of your next location. Will you be taking the lady to more intimate bar, to your crib, or to a friend's fancy after party? Before you pick the girl, plan your moves for the night, so you don't waste your time figuring out what to do.
Have a plan for your weekends. You may have just finished saying goodbye to your latest girl, but what are you doing the next night? Unless you want to spend it sitting alone in your basement and checking your phone, you should already have a lady lined up.

Keep the lovey-dovey stuff private.",How to Date When You Have Children," If your kid is older or is in their teens, try to keep them included in what's going on. Talk to them about the prospect of you dating again. Let them give you their opinion. Know that they might be angry or resentful at first. Nobody likes the idea of their parent getting together with someone who isn't their other parent. Some kids (especially younger ones) might be quick to accept you going back to the dating world. Others will need a bit of convincing and time to adjust to the idea. When going out on a date, figure out whether it would be better for your children to tell them that you're going on a date, or just ""going out"". If telling your children the truth about your date would scare them or make them anxious, it's okay to keep it to yourself for now.;
, Don't try to hide that you're a parent. No matter how much you pretend that you don't have kids, reality is that you do, and your potential partner must be willing to accept them if you ever want to have a serious, committed relationship down the line. It's okay if your date is a bit freaked out at first. Let them know that they can talk with you about what they're feeling. Tell your date sooner rather than later about your child. If things don't work out due to the mention of a child, don't beat yourself up over it. They weren't right for you.

, If things aren't going too well, don't introduce them to your child just yet - it may cause further complications down the line. If you're not really into your date, there's no point giving out lots of information about him or her to your children just yet. Keep things on a need-to-know basis.

, When things are really starting to go well, start thinking about introducing your date to your child. Don't make the introduction too formal. Don't have a one-on-one introduction at your house over dinner - it'll be awkward for everyone. The last thing you want is for your kid and your date to sit down beside each other on the couch and feebly try to get to know each other while you're in the kitchen making dinner. Keep it casual by introducing then to your kid at church, at a sports game, or at a social gathering while you introduce them to other people as well.

, This time there should be a more intimate setting, but still not one-on-one. Your kid still needs to get used to your date. Have a small party at your house with some friends, and have your date there. Re-introduce them to your kid. Keep it casual, like this isn't a big deal.

, Once they're starting to get friendly and your kid seems to like your date, take it a step further. Your date goes from being a ""friend"" to a ""good friend"".

, Keep your kid included, even though they might resent your date. Have your date and your child have some bonding time together. This should be more of a friendship-type bonding rather than a parent bonding. Let your kid know that your date just wants to befriend them, they don't want to replace their mother or father. Take your date and your kid to do something fun for a little bit. Have them walk the dog together or play outside for a little bit, and once they get used to each other have them spend a bit more time together by going to the beach or the pool with you. If the child feels included, things will go a lot smoother.

, When a children's parents start dating, lots of kids feel like the date is stealing their parent away from them, and that their mother/father won't have time for them anymore. Make sure to spend lots of time with your child just like you did before you dated. Don't break the routine of making crafts with your child on Saturday, otherwise your kid will feel left-out and forgotten. Have some quality time with just you and your child to keep your bond strong.

, Remember that even though you're trying to work things out with your child, your date is still your romantic partner. In order to keep your relationship strong you two will need some alone time too. Hire a babysitter and go out dancing, out to dinner, to a play, etc. Bond with your date and have some good conversations together. Don't forget to keep your romance going.

, Kids are usually grossed-out by kissing and hugging, and it's even worse when their parent is doing it. When you're with your date and your child, keep things lightly flirty. Holding hands, hugging, and a kiss on the cheek are usually okay in front of children. Gradually get your child used to you interacting with your date. Start by holding hands in front of your child, then once they're used to it, move on to hugging, then a kiss on the cheek, and after a while even a quick kiss is fine. However, more romantic things such as making out and having sex should be done privately, when your kid is not around.

Have the right clothes.,
Have the right body.,
Have the perfect body language.,
Clean up like a player.,
Have a player-worthy crib.",How to Be a Player2," You have to look the part before you can act the part. A true player should look smooth, but like he's not trying too hard. His clothes should have one goal--to help him find women who want to rip them off. Here are some ways to wear the perfect clothes:


Wear a nice long-sleeved button down shirt over a tight tank top. The ladies will want to get you down to your tight shirt so they can feel your muscles. Always wear shirts that hint at or display your killer biceps.
Wear pants that are a little loose so they can hang low. Show the ladies just a hint of your boxers, and find excuses to lift up your shirt so they can see your rock hard abs. Once they see your happy trail, they'll want to follow it all the way down.
Have smart shoes. Whether you're out at a fancy restaurant or wearing more casual sneakers at the gym, make it clear that your shoes are brand-new and expensive. The ladies will think you'll shell out the same amount of cash that you spent on your shoes on your fancy dates.
Wear a few key accessories. Have a fun wallet, a big gold chain, and flashy jewelry. You are not trying to be subtle, player. Have a leather belt with a flashy buckle, so the ladies are already looking in the right direction.

, Being a player isn't all fun and games. To keep up the player look, you have to put in long hours at the gym. You won't be able to seduce the ladies if your biceps look like string beans. Here's how to do it:


Develop your cardio. Start by running for just one or two miles, but learn to run for at least five miles without getting winded. You won't be much of a Don Juan if you're wheezing while you leading your latest conquest up a staircase.
Build muscle. Do whatever you can to have rock-hard abs, impeccable pecs, and strong shoulders. Hit up the bench press at the gym, or try a sport that will help build muscle, like boxing or basketball.
Eat right. If you're taking a lady on a dinner date, you can eat something manly like a juicy steak, but when you're on your own, try to eat a healthy balance of fruits, veggies, proteins, and carbs. Eating the right foods, especially proteins, can help you burn fat and build muscle.

, Having an open and assertive body will show your lady of the week that you're not only confident but that you're focusing all of your energy on her--for the time being. Here's how to do it:


Make killer eye contact. When you're talking to a lady, look deep into her eyes, like you could jump right into them. This will make her blush and will easily turn her on. Make her feel like the only girl not only in the room, but in the world.
Lean in closely when you talk. When you talk to girl who is obviously into you, lean in real close, like you could kiss her at any moment. This will leave her wanting more.
Face your arms and body in her direction. Don't cross your arms, or turn your legs away from her. Everything about your body should say, ""Hey baby, I'm ready.""

, Hygiene is just as important as having the right clothes or body language. The ladies won't be charmed by you if you smell like you spend the night in an alley. Here's how to seduce them by your ability to clean up:


Wear a powerful, manly cologne. That will make the ladies want to faint in your arms.
Shower and wash your hair at least once a day. Use a manly body wash and shampoo to leave the ladies swooning.
Use hair gel. Give your hair an extra kick with some gel--the ladies will want to run their fingers through it.
Always have fresh breath. You'll need it for close-talking.
Have a fresh face. Shave off your facial hair, and run your hands over your face. Turn to your girl and say, ""Feel how smooth that is, girl.""

, To complete the part of a player, you not only have to look like a player, but your crib has to be worthy of the ladies too. Here's how to have a sexy crash pad for your lady:


Keep it clean. Since you can bring home a lady at the blink of any eye, you should always keep fresh sheets, clean counters, and most importantly--a spotless bathroom. If your lady is grossed out as soon as she walks into your place, she'll be calling for a cab before you can make your first move.
Always have reinforcements. Stock your home with bottles of wine and sexy snacks like grapes or strawberries.
Keep it sleek. Leather couches, shiny lamps, and a flat-screen TV will make your lady feel at home in your love nest. If you can't afford to have a killer bachelor pad, focus on keeping your place clean.

"
Choose wisely.,
Make the girl feel special.,
Focus the conversation on her.,
Be a gentleman.,
Be cool if she says no.,
Don't mislead her.,
Always be closing.,
Be sexy in the sack.,
Play it cool.",How to Be a Player3," Before you go in for the kill, you need to make sure to pick a lady who will be receptive to your player ways. If you choose the wrong girl, you may either end up with someone who is just not interested, or who wants to get wifed up ASAP. Here's how to find the right girl:


Look for a girl who is laughing, obviously having fun, and looking to have a good time. Don't talk to anyone who is obviously bored, checking her phone, or just looking around for something better to do. A girl like that is a soft target for a reason, and you want someone who is worth impressing.
Avoid ladies who are looking for a husband. Many of the ladies you approach will be looking for more than a fling. Any girl who mentions having you meet her parents, wanting to settle down, or talks about how many times she's been a bridesmaid probably doesn't want to be your tenth favorite girl. Let this lady find her soul mate, and don't waste your time--or hers.
Avoid girls who are obviously taken. If you spot a hottie who is barely interested in some guy who is trying to make a move on her, then go for it. But if a lady is batting eyes at her boyfriend or suitor, unless you're really up for the challenge, find someone who is still fun but not so clearly off-limits.

, Approach a group of ladies, and have fun chatting them up and showing you're a great guy to be around. But after a while, home in on the lady of your choosing, and find a way to isolate her and make her feel unique. Here's how:


Have a light opening. Start off by teasing her or just asking what she'd like to drink. Make her laugh and show that you're a person worth talking to.
Tell her that she's special. Say something like, ""There's something different about you."" Make her feel like she really stands out, and that you understand that there is something extra unique about her.
Compliment her. Don't overdo it, but tell her at least three things you like about her, whether it's her eyes, her dance moves, or her laugh. You don't have to say anything deep--just let her know that you appreciate who she is and want to get to know her.

, People love to feel interesting, so listen closely to her and show genuine interest in what she has to say.

, Treat her, the waiter, her friends, and strangers with complete respect. This signals to her that you're the good kind of mysterious, and that you'll treat her well.


Hold doors for people, help her put on her jacket, and listen closely to what she wants.

, Maybe she isn't comfortable with casual sex, maybe she isn't looking for that type of fun tonight, or maybe she isn't into guys. Stay cool and shrug it off.


If you get turned down right off the bat, give her a polite nod and say ""All right. Have a good night."" Then look for a more receptive woman.
If she doesn't want to take things up past a certain level, accept her decision and cool things down. Stay casual and don't pressure her.

, The difference between a good player and a jerk is that a jerk is willing to lie to a lady. You don't want to hook up with a woman who thinks this is the beginning of a long-term relationship. Let her know that you aren't looking for commitment, so that there are no awkward misunderstandings later.

, Follow your A-B-Cs and remember to always try to take your conversation to the next level. Your goal is to get your lady into bed, not to have a deep conversation about the meaning of life. When you hit it off with a lady, you should show her that you want to take it to the next level. Here's how:


Be casual. Just say something like, ""You wanna get out of here?"" Or, ""How about we go somewhere where we can really talk?""
Put the moves on. Once you get your lady alone, touch her gently, or ask if you can take off her coat. Seduce her as quickly as you can, as long as she's into it.

, To be a true player, you have to show the ladies that you're not just all talk. Here's are some tips for being great in bed so the ladies put your on their speed dial:


Give your lady a massage. Massage her shoulders, her lower back, or even her feet, to show that you know how to touch her body.
Kiss with passion. Don't shove your tongue in your lady's mouth--start with a gentle kiss and work your way toward an all-out makeout.
Once you're in bed, take your time. Give your girl enough time to be ready for sex. Tease her, bite her gently, or do whatever you need to do to turn her on. Just don't rush into sex because that can just be painful and definitely not hot.
When it's over, be courteous. You don't have to spend hours cuddling in bed once the deed is done, but spending some time with your lady, gently kissing her, or letting her spend the night, will make her feel more special than if you instantly jump in the shower once your passion has run its course.

, Once you've had a good time with your new woman, it's important to have the right attitude so you can see her again if you want, or at least leave on a good note so she doesn't talk trash about you to her girlfriends. Here's how:


Be vague about when you'll see her again. Tell her you'll see her around. Don't try to set up a dinner date for the following week--that's not how players roll.
Be a gentleman. Help her put her coat on and walk her to the door or to her car. Make a good last impression so she doesn't think you're completely sleazy.
Don't overdo it with your flattery. Tell her you had a great time, but don't tell her you had the best night of your life. Be real and don't make her think you're something you're not.
End on a good note. As you say goodbye, make her laugh, give her a gentle kiss, or remind her of something from the night before. Make sure she wants to see you again--it's up to you to decide if you want to see her again or to move on. If you do want to see her again, give it a few days before you check in. Play on, player!

You're not looking for stability.,
You love to go out and meet new people.,
You're okay hurting a few people's feelings.,
You're ready to juggle multiple partners at once.,
You're willing to try new things.",How to Be a Player4," Being a player is not about finding The One. It is about getting to know lots of people, moving quickly from one partner to the other. Neither mode of dating is ""right,"" but you should know that being a player is a shallow, surface-level way to make connections.


If you're looking for deep emotional connections, don't be a player.
If you want to find someone to settle down with, don't be a player.
If you don't feel comfortable letting people down, don't be a player.

, The player lifestyle is constantly on the move. You're going to new parties, clubs, and events every weekend, and you are constantly making new friends. A player has a wide range of friends, though only a few of them are necessarily ""close"" friends.


If you'd rather sit in and watch Netflix, don't be a player.
If you'd rather meet the gang at your favorite bar each weekend, don't be a player.
If you want the comfort and ease of long-term relationships, don't be a player.

, The reality of being a player is that feelings are going to hurt. Some people are going to get attached. You might even get unexpectedly attached. If you're committed to playing the field, you're never going to have full control over the emotions of others. Every now and then things won't end as neatly as you hope. You're going to have to firmly, though politely, let people down.


If you'd rather not break up with people, don't be a player.
If you know you struggle with confrontation, don't be a player.
If you feel bad about sleeping with someone and leaving the next morning, don't be a player.

, Being a player is not about being monogamous. But handling several partners at the same time is not easy, especially if you're not telling them who else you're seeing. This isn't to say it's wrong or unethical. You just need to know what you're getting into.


If you're uncomfortable keeping multiple relationships going, don't be a player.
If you hate managing relationships, texting, and keeping secrets, don't be a player.
If you have a moral or ethical problem with polyamory, don't be a player.

, At the end of the day, you don't have to choose between being a player and avoiding the game. You can, of course, fall somewhere in the middle. If you're unsure about this, just give it a shot. Try to meet a few new partners, and keep them all low key. The following advice doesn't have to be followed to the letter if you're just interested in exploring your relationships a bit more."
"
Show up when you can.,
Skip the practices.,
Give your partner the space he or she needs.,
Be understanding about money.,
Accept his or her bandmates will be close friends.,
Check in with each other.,
Express your gratitude and love.,
Take time to listen.,
Be an independent person.,
Learn to not take things personally.,
Set boundaries.,
Get enough sleep.,
Feed yourself well.",How to Be a Good Band Girlfriend," One way to support your partner is to just be there when he or she is playing. Showing up to gigs when they are in town and when you have the opportunity to do so to lets your partner know that you support his or her art.That doesn't mean you need to come to every show. In fact, sometimes it's good to develop your own interests and spend time with other people.;
, While you want to show your support for your partner, practice is usually not the place to do it. Practice can be awkward and frustrating for the band, and they need to be working out problems, not trying to impress you. Unless you're specifically invited, it's probably best to skip it. Plus, it probably won't be that exciting for you., That is, your partner will probably want to go on tour. If that's the case, you may need to stay at home, especially if everyone is crammed into a tiny van while on the road.It's the band's job to be out there and having an extra person around can make things uncomfortable. Unless there's plenty of room or you take your own car, you probably should skip it., When it comes to musicians, many of them are working hard for their art but not making a lot of money. That doesn't mean your partner should expect you to support him or her. However, you may need to be understanding when it comes to things like expensive dates or gifts. In other words, you may not be able to do expensive things for a few years, or if you do, you may need to provide some extra funds on your end to make it happen., Bandmates spend a great deal of time together, and they form close bonds. You may find yourself a bit jealous of those relationships. While that's perfectly natural, it's important to realize that whatever your partner shares with his or her bandmates, it doesn't take away from the relationship you have with your partner.On the other hand, because you are associated with the band, you may find you have a built-in group of people that you can develop friendships with.

, Even when your partner is on tour, it's important for you two to check in with each other often, every day if you can. Try to move beyond just saying ""hello"" and ""goodbye.""Make sure both of your needs are being met by checking to see how each of you is doing emotionally.For instance, you could ask questions such as ""How are you holding up emotionally? Are you feeling good about what the band's doing out there? Are you able to find time for yourself?""

, When you're apart often, it's important to verbally acknowledge your love and gratitude to each other, as you can't express it in nonverbal ways like hugs and kisses. Say you're grateful for him or her, and that you love the person and are proud of what he or she is doing on the road.For example, you could say, ""I just wanted to let you know how much I miss you. I'm always glad to hear your voice. Just chatting with you makes my whole day better.""

, When you haven't talked to your partner much, it can be tempting to go on and on about what's going on with you. However, it's equally important to really listen to what the other person is saying. Hear what's going on in his or her life, and respond accordingly.One way to show you're listening is to ask relevant follow-up questions to draw more out of your partner.

, Because your partner is going to be gone much of the time, you need to develop your own interests and sense of self. Of course, that's a good idea in any relationship, but it's especially good when you need to fend for yourself for months on end. Make sure to develop a social network outside of your partner, as well as your own hobbies and interests.For instance, try joining local hobby clubs that interest you or taking classes at a nearby community college.
It's important to develop your own life because otherwise, you may end up very unhappy in the relationship, as the band will draw your partner away a good amount of time. If you're unhappy, the relationship isn't going to last.

, If your partner is in a band, he or she may be moderately or even really famous. That means that you may have other people trying to cut into your time with them. You may also find that people are trying to get into bed with your partner. It can be a difficult part of the lifestyle to deal with for you, but it's part of being in a band. Therefore, if you want to stay with your current partner, you have to decide to deal with this aspect of the relationship.If people are constantly interrupting your time while you're trying to have a date, it may be time to take it somewhere private so you can actually spend time with each other.In addition, you probably worry about your partner cheating on you, especially if he or she goes on tour, but it really comes down to whether you trust the person or not. If your partner has the integrity not to cheat on you at home, he or she won't do it on the road, either., Being a band is a lot of work, and everyone around can be dragged in, including you. You need to know exactly what you're willing to do and lay that out clearly to your partner. For instance, you may be willing to help with setup, but you may not be willing to host the band every other night for a giant party., You know you need enough sleep to feel good and be healthy. When you live someone who lives a bit of an alternative lifestyle, it may be more difficult to get the number of hours you need. However, getting enough sleep is important to relationship success because it helps you maintain self-control, which is essential for healthy relationships. Plus, it makes you happier overall, which in turn, contributes to the relationship., Eating a healthy diet is an important part of taking care yourself and being present in a relationship. When your partner is often away, it can be harder to motivate yourself to cook and eat healthily. However, studies have shown that when you don't eat enough, for instance, it can make you angry and more aggressive in relationships."

Think about just how long you have been friends.,
If you have already established your feelings for one another, good job and skip this step.,
Move forward in your relationship.,
Start out slow.,
Remember that certain habits may NOT be continued on into this new relationship.,
Don't be afraid to ask them what things they like or don't like.,
You may already know their family, assuming you have been best friends long enough.,
Rules about phone calls do not apply to you as a couple.,
Treat yourselves like you really are a couple.",How to Date Your Best Friend," If you, for example, had been close friends for two years, you are two years ahead in getting to know each other and two years more comfortable with each other. Especially if you were the type of friends that told each other everything, having the following conversation with them should not be difficult or scary. Just take a deep breath, and remember that they will still be your friend no matter what.;
, But for those who have not, you need to gather your thoughts together and take a look at your behavior towards each other in the recent past. Have you been openly flirting with each other? Have either or both of you made comments about dating and being a couple? If so, then this is reassuring in letting you take the next step and telling your best friend your feelings.

, If you have not broken the touch barrier by this point, begin by doing that on the physical aspect of your relationship.

, You are still best friends, technically, so don't let old habits change. Just upgrade them. When you have that date officially, just be yourself. They fell in love with their best friend, not a stranger. Please do keep that in mind. If you HAVE broken the touch barrier by this point, feel free to show some affection. Of course, this all depends on you and your more-than friend's level of comfort with one another and physical contact itself.

, For one, do not go on about the crushes you used to talk about when you were still friends. If they liked you all that time and held themselves together while you talked about crushes then, imagine how they would feel now, when you two are a couple! If you must continue these habits, find someone else to take their place as best friend in those areas.

, For example, if any previous people you were involved with liked the smell of perfume or cologne, it does not necessarily mean your current will. Remember, even though you may have been friends for awhile, does not mean you will know or even remember every single detail about them. Even the people you find yourself closest to learn something new about you everyday. So don't feel awkward asking them about their preferences.

, If not, you have even more reason to meet them. However, what if you met them once or twice? How do you deal with the awkwardness that may come the next time you meet? Simply be polite and yourself, just as you were when you were only best friends with your significant other.

, Some people say that phone calls between couples should only last a few minutes or the guy will end up in the ""friend zone"" because his girlfriend will start telling him everything. Well apparently the guy in this relationship managed to get OUT of the ""friend zone"" so it really should not matter. If you two are serious about the relationship, it makes no difference the length of the call.

, If you say that you are, but go on acting only as friends, it will confuse both of you and irritate the other person. And lastly, don't forget to let them know that you love them. Many people forget that they shouldn't say ""I love you"" unless they mean it... But if they mean it, they should say it a lot.

Be honest.,
Don't cheat on your girlfriend.,
Be genuine.,
Express your feelings.,
Know how to talk to her.,
Make romantic gestures.,
Compliment her.,
Be open about sex.,
Learn to know when something is wrong.,
Talk about the issue with your girlfriend.,
Reach a compromise.,
Be patient.",How to Be a Better Boyfriend," If something is bothering you about the relationship, then let your girlfriend know. Be sure to do this gently so that she doesn't feel like you're criticizing her. If you need or want something, don't be afraid to tell her that! If something is bothering outside of the relationship and you need to be alone for a little while, or you need to vent, you should let her know!


In return, ask her if there is anything that she wishes you would do that you haven't been doing. This will keep both parties happy.
Let her know if you are in a bad mood and need to be alone. For example, if you are annoyed because you had a bad day at work, then tell her that rather than taking out your frustration on her. This will prevent her from thinking you are mad at her or have lost interest in the relationship.;
, Even if she finds out and forgives you, it will be much harder for her to trust you in the future, which will undoubtedly lead to trouble down the road. Remember why you decided to be with her in the first place, and resist the temptation to chase after other women.


If you find yourself constantly tempted to cheat, then you might want to reevaluate your relationship. Everybody's mind wanders every now and then, but constantly lusting after other women is a sign that something is wrong. Figure out whether you are really ready for a monogamous relationship with this person.
If you do cheat, then tell your girlfriend. For some women, the lying aspect is even worse than the cheating aspect. Find the right time and place to let her know gently, and apologize for your mistake. While this may be difficult, covering up an infidelity will undoubtedly drive a wedge in your relationship, especially if she finds out from somebody else down the road.

, Don't do or say things to your girlfriend just to make her happy if you don't mean them. This may please her temporarily, but it will ultimately cause trouble in the relationship because you are not being totally honest.


Don't make promises that you can't keep. Give the relationship time to grow, and only make commitments that you feel comfortable with. If you think it's too soon for her to meet your family, then don't invite her over for Thanksgiving dinner. While relationships require a healthy balance, constantly compromising your own happiness for hers will only lead you to resent her in the future.

, Don't be afraid of letting your girlfriend know how wonderful you think she is! This will make her feel special and loved.


Be sweet, but don't smother her. Try to compliment your girlfriend and give her the attention she deserves without getting too controlling, obsessive, or needy.

, Give your girlfriend your undivided attention, especially when having a serious conversation. It is not only respectful, but it will show her that you care about what she is saying.


Keep the conversation balanced. Don't be overly talkative or overly quiet. If you are overly talkative, your girlfriend will feel like you care more about yourself than you do about her. If you are overly quiet, your girlfriend might get bored with you or think that you have lost interest in her.

, Whether it is surprising her by cooking her favorite dinner or sending her flowers at work, small gestures like these show your girlfriend that she is on your mind and that you care for her.

, Every woman needs to be reminded of how beautiful, smart, funny, or interesting she is. Don't stop complimenting her just because you have ""won her over"" and are already in a committed relationship. Do it because you mean it, and because it will make her feel more confident and loved.

, Maintaining a healthy sex life will help keep the relationship alive. If you are worried that the sex is getting boring or that your girlfriend is unsatisfied with the sex, then maturely bring up the subject with her.


While this may feel awkward or difficult at first, it will be well worth it in the long run if it improves your sex life!
Wait for the appropriate moment. Don't bring up the issue in public, in front of other people, or in a joking manner. Joking about the topic might make your girlfriend feel embarrassed or insecure.

, The following are signs that your relationship is suffering:


You are fighting more than usual.
She hasn't contacted you in several days.
Either one of you has totally lost interest in sex. (Remember that this could be due to a variety of factors, like a death in the family, personal insecurities, or excess stress).
She continuously cancels plans without suggesting a different date.
One of you has been dating/sleeping with somebody else.
One of you suggests a ""break."" No matter what either of you says, a break is usually just a segue into an official break-up.
Either one of you has become physically abusive. If this is the case, then it's time to end the relationship and seek professional help to cope with the issue. Never make an excuse for domestic violence.


, The only way to fix a problem in any relationship is for both parties to first be made aware of the issue. Remember that sometimes people are totally unaware of their own behavior.

, Once you have talked about the issue at hand and have both voiced your views and opinions, come to an agreement about what to do next. Come up with something that both parties can get on board with and feel comfortable with.


If you can't reach an agreement, then consider couples therapy. Getting the opinion of a third party will help put things in perspective and allow you to rationally sort of the issue from an objective standpoint.
Know when the relationship can't be fixed. If you or your girlfriend are chronically unhappy in the relationship, then don't force things. Making healthy compromises to keep a relationship alive is one thing, but making yourself miserable to maintain the status quo will not do either of you any good.

, Some issues just need a little time to blow over. If you recently had a big fight, give each other space for a day or two. Chances are that the issue will resolve itself, and being apart will remind you both how much you care for one another.

Don’t lie or embellish the truth.,
Avoid trying too hard.",How to Avoid Looking Desperate1," Even if you joke about it, it makes you appear that you are desperate for any date.This might not only make you look desperate but also make you look like you do not respect your friends who are in relationships. Avoid complaints such as:


”You’re so lucky to have a boyfriend; I wish I could have what you have.”
”I hate being single! I wish I could get a boyfriend.”
”I don’t want to be the third wheel; it sucks being single.”;
, Fishing for compliments means that you are trying to get other people to say good things about you.You fish for compliments by saying something negative about yourself and expect to someone to disagree with you. Don’t fish for compliments from the person you are interested or your friends. This makes you look insecure, insincere, and desperate. Avoid statements like:


”I’m so fat. I will never get a man.”
”I’m so dumb!”
”I look awful today.”
”Do you think this shirt looks good on me?""

, Do not neglect your supportive network to try and make yourself look better. This will breed resentment and make you lose friends. Try and avoid saying or doing things like:


Telling an embarrassing story about your friend to make yourself look better.
Ignoring your friends while you try and attract the attention of a cute boy/girl.
Making negative remarks about your friends to make yourself look better. (I.e. ""Oh, Stacy isn't into basketball. Not like me."", The truth will always prevail; embellishing your attributes to catch the attention of another is a desperate maneuver that will most certainly come back to haunt you. Lying is commonplace when dating.Some common lies include:


Lying about occupation.
Lying about salary or money.
Lying about age.
Lying about relationship status.

, You must learn to be happy with yourself in order to be happy with another person. If you are trying too hard to be someone that you are not naturally, you are going to add strain on your own life and the life of your partner.Some ways you may try too hard in a relationship may include:


Over-pleasing -- Trying to make your partner feel good in a relationship is a good thing, but overdoing it may come off as desperate. It may make your partner think that you need him or her too much.
Moving too fast -- It is good to be clear and honest about your expectations in a relationship, but expecting too much too fast can come off as desperate. For example, don’t expect to talk about big life-decisions (like kids or marriage) early in a relationship.

Consider that there might be a reason your crush likes your enemy.,
Know the relationship won’t last forever.",How to Avoid Jealousy when Your Crush is Dating Your Enemy1," Jealousy is a destructive negative emotion. It will eat at you and make you miserable, while making you feel terrible about yourself. Holding on to your jealousy can make you feel bad, act angrily, and make decisions you wouldn’t normally make.One way you can let go of jealousy is to stop comparing yourself to others. Accept that you can't change your crush's mind right now. Stop obsessing about your crush and focus on other things, like yourself, your friends, or your interests.
You can repeat to yourself, ""The negative energy of my jealousy is not worth my time. I am better than this.""
Your jealousy may cause you to talk bad about your enemy or your crush. You may confront your crush or your enemy because you are angry and jealous. This can cause a lot of problems. Letting go of the jealousy or ignoring it can help you avoid these situations.;
, Your crush may be dating your enemy because the two of your will never work out. Just because you have a crush doesn’t mean the person will like you back. This is just an unfortunate part of life. One way to avoid getting jealous is to accept that maybe it was just never meant to be with you and your crush.


You can take the time to be sad and get over your crush. You won’t be able to just let it go immediately. In the long run, it will be better for you if you accept this and move on.

, One way to avoid jealousy when your crush starts dating someone you don’t like is to move on from the crush. Unfortunately, maybe your crush doesn’t like you. That doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with you, it just may mean you two are not compatible. Take this opportunity to look for other potential crushes that may work out better.

If you spend your time being jealous of your crush and your enemy’s relationship, you may miss an opportunity to start dating someone really great because of your jealousy.
Look around at the people you interact with. Are there people that you have things in common with or find attractive? These people may be your next crush.

, If your crush starts dating your enemy, don’t instantly feel jealous. Jealousy means you feel bad because someone has something you don’t, which often makes you feel bad about yourself. Instead, take it as a reason to really look at your crush. Really look at them. Objectively think about whether they are as great as you thought.If your crush is dating your enemy, maybe your crush is someone you might not like. Why do you not like your enemy? Are they mean or a bully? Did they do something to hurt you? If your crush is dating them, maybe they are not a nice person like your enemy.

, Take a moment to step away from your jealousy and think about your crush. There is probably a reason they like your enemy. Maybe they find your enemy attractive, share similar interests, or have fun when together. Your crush is a person who has interests just like you.


Just because your crush likes your enemy instead of you doesn’t means there is anything wrong with you. You shouldn’t feel jealous that your enemy got your crush when you couldn’t. There is just not one person for you.

, Just because your crush is dating your enemy now doesn’t mean they will be dating your enemy next month or even next week. If you can’t get over your crush, you should be patient while the two of them date. When your crush breaks up with your enemy, you will still be there with your crush.Even if your crush and your enemy date for a long time, that doesn’t mean they will date forever. If you don’t like your enemy, maybe your crush will realize they’re not worth it, too.

Know your deal breakers.,
Be comfortable with yourself.,
Keep an open mind.",How to Date If You're Over 65 Years Old1," There are some common deal breakers for people dating in their older age. Things like health, financial security, and physical appearance are very important to most seniors who are dating. Before you start looking for a partner, know what qualities you want to avoid.For example, if you think you could really like someone but they are very ill already, you might consider just being their friend and dating someone else.;
, Some people reach retirement age and are ready to travel the world. Others simply want to relax and enjoy their home and neighborhood. You should be honest with yourself about how you want to live life, and date people who enjoy the same things. Do not try to force yourself to do what you think you are ‘supposed’ to do.For example, if you want to travel, it would be a bad idea to date someone who is terrified of airplanes.

, Most older people have had much more experience in life and are more likely to be open to dating someone that makes them feel cared for and happy. You should be willing to compromise some of your less important restrictions (e.g. hair color or music preference) so that you can find someone who meets your most important needs. As you grow comfortable with your own identity, many of these things will matter very little to you anyway.For example, you might really like the idea of dating someone that is exactly 65, but if you find a great date who’s 68, it might be worth compromising.

Get out.",How to Avoid Being Pressured Into Sex," You are in control of how it is treated, and if you decide you don't want to have sex with someone, you have the full right to say no. Sex is a very intimate act, and if you decide not to go through with it, stand up for what you feel is right for your body.


Do not be afraid of rejection. It can be tempting to believe someone who is trying to get sex from you, that ""they will never love you again"" or ""they will never talk to you again."" This is manipulation and control, and no one should have to be subjected to it.
Someone who would treat you this way does not deserve to be close to you anyway. No one who truly cares about you should ever pressure you like this.
When you stand up for your right to say no, you are demanding to be respected. It is harder to take advantage of someone when they are demanding respect.;
, Rape can occur on the street and at parties, but it can also occur inside a relationship. The definition of rape is ""having sex with an individual without his or her consent."" Simply put, if you are forced to have sex when you don't want to, you have been raped.


Reflect on whether or not physical force was used. If physical force of any kind was used to get you to have sex, then it is considered rape.
Don’t disregard the possibility that you were raped because there was no physical violence. For example, you may have had sex with someone because you were fearful about what the person might have done if you said no. Or, you might have had sex while under the influence of a powerful drug and not even remember what happened. These situations are still considered rape.
Consider the ages of both parties. If an adult has sex with someone under the age of consent, then it is still rape because the person under the age of consent does not have the legal right to consent to sex. For example, if a 15 year old has sex with a 21 year old, then the 21 year old would be guilty of rape.

, Basic human rights include the right to equality, the right to life, and the right to freedom from torture and degrading treatment.Someone's treatment of you should at least include these basic rights.


Other basic human rights include a right to liberty and personal security. If someone is pressuring you to have sex when you don't want it, this threatens both.
Sexual coercion is also rape. If someone is coercing you, or pushing you to have sex by using force or threats, this violates your basic human rights.
You also have the right to not tolerate rape culture, which is when the severity of sexual violence is downplayed and even framed as acceptable. This can take many forms including sexually explicit jokes, glamorous depictions of violence against women, objectification of the female body, and blaming victims of rape for what happened to them., You need to be able to tell when someone is attempting to pressure you into sex so that you can act. Some tactics can appeal to your insecurities and make you feel bad about yourself, such as by putting you down or using guilt to coerce you into sex. Other tactics may include the use of physical pressure, such as by restraining you in some way, or by changing your state of mind with drugs or alcohol.Common phrases you might hear include:


""I can't help myself""
""You shouldn't have worn that outfit""
""This is the way I can show you my love""
""I won't love you anymore if you don't let me""
“Everyone is doing it!”
“We have had sex already, so you can’t say no now.”, You are not to blame if you get raped, even if you are drunk or high. However, some people may use alcohol and drugs to take advantage of you.To protect yourself from people who might try to take advantage of you, don’t alter your state of mind around people you don't know well or trust. If you go out with friends, you can increase your safety by:


Always going out with friends. Do not go to parties or bars by yourself.
Pouring your own drinks (or watching them being poured).
Never leaving your drink unattended.
Not accepting drinks from strangers.
Limiting yourself to only a few drinks.
Having a trusted friend take you home if you start to get too drunk. Do not allow someone you just met to walk you home, even if he or she seems like a nice person.

, Before you’re ever in a situation where you need to think about not having sex, you need to make up your mind that not having sex is definitely what you want to do. It is very easy to blur the line between “yes” and “no” in the heat of the moment.


Decide why you don’t want to have sex and keep that at the front of your mind. Is it because you want to wait until marriage? You don’t want to get pregnant? You don’t want to risk getting an STD? Having a specific goal in mind will keep you from giving into pressure.

, There are groups of people who make abstinence their goal, and they provide materials and items that can help you stay motivated. Being part of a larger organization can help you remember your goal when you are tempted to give in to pressure.Organizations like True Love Waits even have rings you can purchase as a daily visual reminder, also called a “purity ring.”, When you determine that you aren’t going to have sex, it is important to have people you can look to for support. These people can be your family, close friends, mentors, teachers, coaches, anyone who has influence over you and whom you feel comfortable sharing this decision with.


Support networks also have the benefit of helping you feel like you belong and feel secure, things that you need if you are going to maintain your decision to avoid pressure to have sex., Tell the person you are dating or might date before you get very close. This way you may avoid being pressured altogether. If you are ever pressured, you can back out of the situation without them feeling rejected.


If you decide while dating someone that you don’t want to have sex, you should tell them right away.

, Once you have decided not to have sex, you will need to set clear boundaries with anyone who might try to pressure you. Setting clear boundaries can demonstrate your assertiveness and help you to avoid situations where you might be pressured into sex. If you do end up in a situation where you are being pressured, then your boundaries can help you to resist the pressure. Some things you can do to set your boundaries include:Identifying your reasons for wanting to abstain from sex. Why do you want to set boundaries about sex? For example, do you want to wait until you fall in love? Do you have concerns about getting pregnant or getting an STD? Or, do you simply not feel comfortable about being sexually active?
Affirm your decision. You can increase your confidence in your decision by creating a self-affirmation and stating it out loud. For example, you might say something like, “It’s his decision if he is ready to be sexually active, but I have the right to decide what I do with my body. I do not want to have sex yet because of the risk of becoming pregnant or getting a disease. If that bothers him, then that is his problem, not mine.”
Keep in mind that you may feel some discomfort or other negative emotions about setting this boundary and that is normal. These feelings are only temporary and they will pass.

, One way to make sure you’re never alone with someone who might pressure you to have sex is to go out in groups of friends or on double dates. Pick some friends to hang out with on a regular basis so that you always have them available if someone wants to date you.


For example, if someone asks you out and you are not sure if you want to be alone with him yet, then you might say something like, “That sounds fun, but I have plans with Sara on Friday night. Do you want to ask Rick to go to and make this a double date?”

, If you don’t want to drag along all your friends on a date, in order to avoid being one on one you can bring just one person, called a chaperone. This person’s presence can keep your date from pressuring you to have sex.


This could be a parent, a respected adult, even just a good friend.

, You may have unexpectedly entered a situation where you are being pressured to have sex. Pay attention to your feel and keep in mind that you can always walk away if things seem to be moving too fast for you.


Look for signs like clothes coming off, dry humping, hands under clothes, and kissing other parts of the body besides the mouth.
You don’t have to offer any explanation. You can just say, “No,” and leave right away if you are uncomfortable. Pay attention to feelings of general discomfort or guilt to help you decide if you want to stop or not., Listen to what the other person is saying to determine if they are trying to charm you into sex. Phrases like, “I’ll only love you if you do it,” and “Nothing bad will happen,” or even, if you’re a girl, “You won’t get pregnant,” are red flags that you need to get out of there.

, Once you realize you are being pressured to have sex, don’t be afraid to speak up. Say “no” to the other person very clearly. Practice saying “no” out loud in the mirror so that you are ready to say “no” in a sexually compromising situation. Just saying “No” is fine, but you can also say:“No. I care about you and I want to get to know you better.”
“No, and if you really care about me then you should be willing to wait.”
“No. I am concerned about the risk of becoming pregnant or getting an infection.”

, When you sense that someone is trying to have sex with you by making physical motions, push them away. For example, if you’re kissing someone and they grab your private parts, gently push their chest away. They should understand this signal.


If they don’t take the hint, push harder until their body is not touching yours and clearly say “stop!” in a loud, clear tone.
Carry a rape whistle and pepper spray on your keychain in case the person you are pushing away does not respect your decision.

, Once you have pushed the other person away from your physical body, it is time to get out of the situation. This is especially important to do if the other person insists on disrespecting your wishes.

Ask to spend time together without having sex.,
Request that they spend the night.,
Let the person know what you want out of relationship.,
Express yourself when you feel hurt.,
Tell the person what behavior is not acceptable.,
Do not answer late night calls.,
Communicate what works for you.,
Make plans with the person.,
See if they're on the same page.,
Break things off if someone's stringing you along.,
Find someone whose wants match up with yours.",How to Avoid Becoming a Booty Call," This should make it clear that you want to be more than the booty call. If you've been having sex with someone, but you rarely see each other outside of that, raise the subject of spending time together without sex. Ask the person if they want to go get lunch or dinner, see a movie, or do something else that involves interacting without getting physical., If someone views you as just a booty call, they may leave after sex. If you want to show them you're interested in more, ask them to spend the night at your place.Invite them to stay over. If they ask to come over after work, say something like, ""That would be fun. Do you want to stay over this time? It would be nice to spend some more time together.""
There's always a chance the person will decline. This may be a sign to you that it's time to move on. If someone is unwilling to spend a night with you, they may be more interested in an occasional booty call than a real relationship.

, If someone does not know what you want, they may think you're okay with just being the booty call. After you've seen someone a few times, introduce the issue of what you personally want out of a relationship. If something casual is not your thing, let them know. If they call you up for what seems like a booty call, redirect this.For example, say you get a text late at night asking if you want to come over. Respond with something like, ""I'd rather do something another time. Are you free for lunch or dinner this week?"" This shows the person you're not interested in just being the booty call and would rather get to know them.
If the person does not respond to the text, they may not be interested in a real relationship. At this point, you've both made it clear what you want. While it can hurt to have someone disengage with you, at least you know you're free to look for someone interested in a real relationship.

, If you find being the booty call hurtful, or feel that you're being used, say so. You're well within your right to express yourself if you're feelings are hurt, especially if you're being led on. If someone continually assures you you're more than just a booty call, but does not treat you accordingly, speak up.For example, say you've made it clear you do not want to be the booty call. Despite this, the person keeps calling and texting late at night. While they promise they'll take you out on a real date, they keep blowing you off and changing plans. At this point, say something.
Say something like, ""I've made it really clear this isn't the kind of relationship I want and I feel like you keep violating my boundaries. This is really hurtful and it isn't okay.""

, If you don't want to be a booty call, make as much clear using your words. The second the person does something that makes you suspect you're the booty call, let them know you're not interested in that kind of relationship. In the moment, call the person out to make it clear that's not what you want.If someone texts you late at night, for example, they may just be hoping for sex. If you don't appreciate these kinds of texts, respond with something like, ""Hey, please don't text me this late. If you want to hang out, we can go out on a date at an earlier time.""
If you'd rather wait to get to know them know the first time the issue of sex comes up. If they, say, suggest you go back to their place after a date, say something like, ""I'd rather get to know you a little bit more before we get too physical.""

, If you want to avoid being the booty call, make your boundaries regarding contact clear. People are likely to text someone late at night with something like, ""Want to come over?"" if they're looking for a booty call. Do not respond to these texts or answer them with something like, ""No thanks. Feeling tired."" This makes it clear that you're not interested in that kind of relationship., If someone is violating your boundaries, or sending you unwanted communication, let them know what you'd prefer. After someone does something that crosses a line, tell them how to behave in the future.For example, if you're just the booty call, the person may prefer to stay in and hang out rather than take you out on dates. If the person texts you something like, ""Want to come over and hang out tonight?""
Respond by telling them what you'd prefer. For example, ""That sounds fun, but I'd rather go out tonight. Want to see a movie?""

, If you want to transition the relationship into something more than a booty call, try making concrete plans. Ask the person out for non-sexual situations. Ask if they want to see a movie, get coffee early in the day, or go out to lunch and dinner. This should give you a chance to see if the relationship can be more than something casual and whether you and the other person are compatible romantically.For example, send a text saying something like, ""Hey, are you free this Friday? I would love to get dinner with you around 5.""

, Relationships come with expectations. You may expect certain things. For example, maybe you don't want to see other people. Maybe you expect a certain amount of daily communication.Not everyone has the same expectations regarding relationships. It's important to see what the other person wants. After spending some one-on-one time with them, it's okay to ask what they want out of a relationship.


For example, say something like, ""We've been seeing each other quite a bit lately, so I thought I'd go ahead and ask. What are you looking for out of a relationship?""
It can be stressful to ask these kinds of questions, as there's always a chance the other person is not looking for the same thing. However, remember that it's better to know. You do not want to waste your time on someone who's not on your wavelength.

, Unfortunately, some people may string someone along with the promise of a relationship. They may assure you they want to get to know you better, but that never seems to happen. They may make dinner plans, but blow you off and text you late at night the following day. If you get the sense you're being used, it's best to walk away. You do not want to waste your time pursuing someone who's not interested in you the way you're interested in them.You can keep things simple when breaking things off. Say something like, ""I think we want different things, so it's clear we should see other people.""

, If you don't want to be a booty call, find someone who wants more than just casual sex. It's important to find someone with the same expectations you have regarding a romantic relationship. As you pursue new romances, try to find someone who wants to get to know you and is eager to go out to dinner or see a movie before having sex."

Learn when to walk away.,
Don’t e-stalk.,
Avoid clingy behavior.",How to Avoid Looking Desperate2," Once you’ve determined that someone isn’t interested in you, know when it is time to stop pursuing and time to walk away. Pursuing someone who is not interested may make that person resent you. Also, consider walking away from a relationship that you may be desperate to hold onto.If you consider the following, it might be time to walk away:


You can’t remember the last time you had a meaningful, heart-to-heart talk.
You cannot list what you have in common.
You don’t respect your partner or your partner does not respect you.
You or your partner cannot compromise.
You notice the bad times outweigh the good times.

, Do not stalk the object of your affections on social media or on the internet. Do not post on pictures, posts, or emails. Further, avoid over-analyzing posts made on social media. Other e-stalking behavior may include:


Researching other friends that have reached out to your partner/crush.
Reading his/her e-mail or other correspondence.
Looking through or reading through his/her old posts or pictures.
Reprimanding or “calling him or her out” for talking to other people online.

, You want your partner to feel comfortable in your presence. You do not want to scare him or her away with too much attention. Give him or her some space:


Do not text more than twice in a row or within 10 minutes of last texting him. Try and only text meaningful messages or text when you have a legitimate reason.
Do not get nervous or upset if s/he doesn’t contact you right away.
Do not follow your partner/crush around.
Do not be over accommodating. For example, do not be worried about making friends with your own friends in case your partner may want to hang out or go on a date.

"
"
Maintain personal standards.,
Do not rationalize bad treatment.,
Stop comparing yourself to others.,
Surround yourself with positive people.",How to Avoid Looking Desperate3," If you are lonely or have been single for a long time, it might be easy to settle or get desperate for anyone that shows interest. However, this could lead to a disastrous and unsatisfactory relationship. Maintain your personal standards by doing the following:


Look for a partner who will respect you and your interests. Being with someone who does not respect you shows desperation to be with anyone that shows interest. Look for someone you can talk to about your interests and who will not belittle you.
Find a partner who enjoys spending time with you. If you are in a relationship with someone who you only see when it is convenient for them, then you may just be desperate for any company rather than good company.
Look for a partner who shares the same values or goals as you. You do not want someone who will disrespect you and your core beliefs.

, Although it is easy to identify desperate actions when looking for a relationship, desperation can manifest in ongoing relationships. Do not desperately hold onto a relationship that is no longer working. Consider ending a relationship if:


Your significant other is emotionally or physically abusive. This is not only dangerous to your emotional and physical health, but also something you do not have to live with.
Your partner does not respect you, your friends, or your family. Do not be desperate to please others in your relationship; do not be desperate to get a guy that your mother would approve of. It is important to be in a relationship for reasons that work for you, not to desperately be in a relationship for the sake of not being single.
Your partner is a negative presence in your life. Do not desperately make excuses for your partner in hopes that s/he will change. Supporting your partner is one thing, but making continual excuses is another.

, This will cultivate a negative body image and negative thoughts. Instead, list what your strengths and what makes you unique.


Identify what aspects of your life you compare yourself with others. Is it your looks? Your intelligence? Once you pinpoint these feelings, it is easier to get rid of them.
Understand that you are in control of your actions and feelings. It easy to think that society should tell us how to look and feel; but, you are the only person who can make decisions for how you think and act.
Try and replace negative thoughts with positive ones. This will help create a good habit that will build self-confidence and happiness.

, It is easier to build a good habit when you have people cheering you on! Do not isolate yourself; instead, surround yourself with positive people who will help you make good decisions about your life.

Avoid trying to sabotage the relationship.,
Refrain from badmouthing your enemy.,
Ignore any teasing by your enemy.,
Be happy for your enemy.",How to Avoid Jealousy when Your Crush is Dating Your Enemy2," If you are thinking about trying to break up your crush and your enemy, you should get that thought out of your head. Interfering with the relationship, especially negatively, may cost you any chance of having a future relationship with your crush.Trying to sabotage the relationship makes you look petty and jealous, which is not something you want people - especially your enemy - to think about you.

, Because your enemy is dating your crush, you may want to talk bad about them, complain about how awful they are, or even spread lies. You should avoid this. Being negative about your enemy means that you are stooping to their level and not being a nice person. You should take the high road and be nice, or just ignore your enemy all together.Avoid the temptation to go up to your crush and say, ""You are dating the biggest jerk on the planet! You should date someone nice and sweet, like me."" Doing something like this will only make your crush mad at you.
Talking about your enemy to other people may get back around to them or your crush. Your crush might be mad if they find out you are badmouthing the person they are dating.

, Your enemy may know how you feel about your crush, and this may give them reason to tease you or rub their new relationship in your face. If your enemy is bullying you or being mean, just ignore it. Giving in to the teasing by reacting or getting upset just lets your enemy know you are jealous and upset.Don’t give in to the urge to tease or make fun of your enemy in retaliation. This makes you seem petty and jealous, and brings you down to your enemy’s level.

, Turn the negative jealous feelings into positive ones. Instead of being jealous that your enemy got your crush instead of them, be happy for them. Be nice to your enemy and your crush. Don’t let your enemy know you are bothered by the relationship at all. This will eliminate any reason for your enemy to be mad at you, badmouth you to your crush, or make fun of you.Every time you get angry or upset that your enemy has your crush, try to think, ""Good for them. I am happy they are dating someone."" It may not always work, but it will help you start to train your brain away from negative, jealous thoughts.
Another way to be happy for your enemy is to stop thinking about them as an enemy. Start calling them by name in your head. Refer to them ""my acquaintance"" or ""that person I know."" Changing the vocabulary in your head can help release negative thoughts and help you be happy for them.
If you send positive vibes out into the world, you will be happier. Being jealous and angry isn’t healthy. It’s much easier to move on and let go of jealousy if you think positively about the situation.

"
"
Focus on yourself.,
Spend time with other friends.,
Stay busy.,
Think about your good traits.",How to Avoid Jealousy when Your Crush is Dating Your Enemy3," One way to get over jealousy is to stop dwelling on what you don’t have. In this case, don’t dwell on the fact that you aren’t dating your crush. Instead, focus on yourself. Jealousy makes you feel bad about yourself because you feel like you’re not good enough or that you are lacking something. You should take this time to do things to make yourself healthier in mind and spirit.Meditate if you feel overcome with jealous feelings. Sit in a quiet room and breathe deeply as you focus inward, on yourself.
You may even think about your jealous feelings and then imagine that you are letting them go. Think about them swirling down the drain like water or floating away like wind.

, Your jealousy might make you angry and upset. You may feel like sitting in your room, listening to music, and being sad that your crush is dating your enemy. Don’t wallow in your jealousy. Instead, go out and spend time with your friends. Don’t allow your crush or your jealousy to control what you do or your happiness.Hanging out with your friends can help get your mind off of your crush and your enemy. You can forget about any jealousy you feel by doing other, fun things.
If you spend time with your friends, you probably won’t even have time for any jealous feelings.

, A good way to avoid jealous feelings is not to dwell on them. Find things to occupy your time and stay busy. You can get caught up on things you’ve been putting off or do an activity you haven’t done in a long time. Distract yourself from any jealousy by trying new things.For example, you may want to take up a new hobby, start playing a musical instrument, or take lessons.
You may want to catch up on your reading or movie watching, or beat that new video game you’ve been meaning to.
Doing things that make you happy will help decrease your jealousy and make you overall more content.

, Just because your crush is dating your enemy doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with you or that they are better than you. People are attracted to others for different reasons. Don’t feel jealous that your crush is dating your enemy and feel bad about yourself. Instead, remember that you are a good person with a lot of good traits.You may want to compare yourself to your enemy or think there is something wrong with you because your crush didn’t choose to date you. Don’t think that way. There is nothing wrong with you, even if your crush can’t see how great you are.
For example, you may want to write down a list of your good traits. You can keep this list around when you feel jealous.
You may write down that you have nice hair, nice eyes, or dress well. You may be a good musician, artist, or athlete. Maybe you’re funny, caring, or good at math. Whatever you think is good about yourself, write it down.

Go out.,
Find fulfilling experiences.,
Ask friends and neighbors.,
Get comfortable with the internet.,
Explore the senior center.",How to Date If You're Over 65 Years Old2," Your dream date(s) will not just show up on your doorstep knocking. If you want to meet people, you are going to have to go out and enjoy yourself. Go to art galleries, coffee shops, restaurants, or parks that you enjoy. Anywhere where people frequent will give you the chance to meet someone., You can often find people that you like by going to things that make you feel good. This could be a lecture or a religious service. You might even spend time with volunteer groups or travel groups where you can meet more people. The important thing is to pick things that you find fulfilling so that you are meeting people that share your interests.

, Your friends or neighbors are likely to know someone who is single and looking for a date. You can ask them to introduce you to any friends or family members that they think would be a good match.

Work through emotional ties to old relationships.,
Avoid comparing your current self to your past self.,
Realize that your needs may be different now.",How to Date If You're Over 65 Years Old3," If you’re over 65 years old, you have likely had some past relationships. One or more of those may have been very serious (e.g. a marriage that lasted decades). If you are going to start dating again, you will need to spend time acknowledging how you feel about those past relationships and allowing yourself to let go of them.You can do things like write in a journal or talk to a counselor or friend about your feelings.

, Society often portrays youth as the most desirable time in life. Don’t fall prey to this skewed image. Instead, realize that you have already lived through your youthful years, and you have learned a lot from them. Know that the person you are today is just as appealing as the person you were years ago., When you were young, you may have been looking for someone to raise a family with and support you in your career. If you’re over 65, starting a family or a career is not likely to be on your mind.

Someone that likes to socialize
Someone who is caring

Develop a strategic approach to dating.,
Save the details.,
Try online dating.,
Be open to dating different types of people.,
Exhibit self-compassion.,
Date the person who feels right to you.,
Spend time with your friends and loved ones.,
Build new friendships.,
Seek outside help if you need it.",How to Avoid Stressing Over Divorced Dating," The grieving process is so incredibly important because you want to make sure you have properly gotten over not only your previous partner, but the incredible loss and life transition you have experienced.Experience the emotions elicited by the ending of your relationship before diving back into the dating pool. Some ways to do this include writing a letter to your ex-partner expressing your perspective of the relationship, getting rid of material possessions that remind you of the relationship, joining a divorce support group, and reading books that resonate with your divorce experience.
Give yourself time. The amount of time that each person needs to overcome a divorce is different, but allow yourself to accept where you are in the grief process and not rush into dating.
Notice how much anger, resentment, and sadness you feel about the end of your relationship. If you find yourself consumed with negative emotions or an intense longing for your previous relationship, then you may need more time before dating someone else.;
, Getting your feelings out about your previous relationship can help you move through the grieving process. Reaching out to others can also help you gain perspective about your past relationship and get advice or feedback about starting new relationships.Let your friends and loved ones know you are stressed and may need extra support during this time. You could say: “I want to be honest with how I’m doing right now. I’m kind of anxious and stressed because I’m thinking about dating again, and I might reach out to you for advice or support because I haven’t done this whole dating thing in a really long time. ”
If you feel self-conscious about talking to others, or you do not have someone you trust to hold your feelings, consider journaling or blogging about your experience.

, This part may not apply to everyone, but if you have kids from your previous relationship, it is going to be pretty important to talk to them about this new phase of your life so that they feel included in this decision and feel supported in possible struggles they may face.Tell your kids that you have intentions to start dating and ask them about both their thoughts and feelings regarding the subject. Be willing to have open conversations about your kids’ struggles with this new phase of life. You may want to start this conversation by saying: “I know this might be shocking or surprising right now, but I’m thinking about starting to date other people. This doesn’t change how I feel about you or how important you are to me, and I’m not trying to replace your mother/father. I want to be here for you through this, and I also want you to know your opinion matters to me.”
Be selective in introducing your dates to your kids in order to spare them confusion or hurt feelings. It might even be appropriate to wait until you have found a significant relationship or future committed partner before getting your kids involved in your dating life.
Take time to make your kids feel like your top priority. This could mean setting aside one or two nights a week that you just spend quality time with them without a romantic partner present.

, If you are struggling with self-esteem or self-worth issues, it will probably be difficult to find yourself exhibiting confidence in dating another person. After making that list, remind yourself of these traits on a daily basis or before dates. Not every date will go perfectly, but try to remain positive and be patient with the process., The last time you were in the dating world might have been quite a long time ago, and this lack of experience might leave you feeling unsure of yourself and unsure of how to even go about getting back into flirtation and courting. Rather than shying away from adventure and challenge, lean into the discomfort and try to enjoy and learn from these new experiences.Fake it till you make it. Sometimes you have to approach the big bad world of dating by acting like you are comfortable and confident with getting to know someone new. After acting like this on a few dates, you’ll probably start to actually feel the confidence and enjoy being adventurous.
Focus on self-discovery. While new dating is certainly risky, look at it as an opportunity for self-discovery. Focus on learning about yourself and your needs in a relationship, rather than impressing the other person. This approach will make the experience more of an adventure, rather than a scare.

, It may be tempting to “play it safe” and tell your new date about all the dirty details of your divorce in an effort to come clean about all your baggage. However, hold on to these details for when you have a stronger connection with someone so you have room to enjoy yourself and let the other person see who you truly are, independent of your previous relationship.

, This may seem scary and a step in the direction of losing all natural human contact. However, where else are you going to find a huge pool of single individuals who are also looking to find new relationships and blatantly putting themselves out there for a first date? Nowadays, the stigma of online dating has all but disappeared.Be patient. It may take some time to sift through all your suitors, but there just might be a perfect needle for you in the haystack!
Ask for help. There are so many different dating websites and platforms, and you may want to give up due to the sheer daunting number of options. Find a friend who has gone through online dating and get some tips and tricks for exploring this world.

, You may be attracted to a certain look or particular characteristics that feel safe or familiar. However, dating again, particularly in the online world, lets you get exposure to people you might never encounter otherwise. Letting yourself experience various kinds of people can open your eyes to someone who you may have never considered previously., Dating after a divorce can be both an exhilarating and frustrating process. You may start to wonder if you made the right decision about leaving your partner if you cannot find a compatible new partner, so it’s important to take care of yourself both emotionally and physically.


Stay positive about your dating experiences. Some people feel like they failed because their previous relationship did not work out, and might start to get dejected if they cannot find a new relationship. Look at dating as practice for a new relationship rather than a quest to find your next soul mate. This perspective will minimize stress and worry through this journey.Practice self-care on a daily basis. The dating process, especially at the beginning, can be tiring and daunting. Spend some time each day doing something you enjoy or an activity you find relaxing, such as reading a book, practicing yoga, or going for a walk. Nurturing yourself will lead to a better dating experience because you’ll be more relaxed and able to be yourself., Trying to make a relationship work with a person who seems “good on paper” or who checks off all the boxes as the opposite of your ex-partner could lead to you feeling dejected and unsure about dating. Be kind to yourself by choosing a partner who is the best fit for you., You may find yourself going through a multitude of emotions during the dating process. Experiencing lack of fit in a relationship, rejection, or just plain bad dates might leave you feeling defeated or confused. Choose to spend some time with people who energize you and who understand you. These loved ones can provide a listening ear and get you back on your feet for another round in the dating game., Divorce can cause a disruption in your social network, especially if you have friends who don’t support your break-up, or if you and your ex-partner had a lot of mutual friends. It might be time to expand your social circle and get some additional support through this new stage in life.


Find single friends. You might find some of your current friends can’t understand your experience because they have not gone through a divorce themselves, so single friends can be a big source of support. Like-minded single friends will probably have more time to spend with you and are probably up for trying some new restaurants, bars, and activities around town!Try signing up for some new activities, clubs, or classes to immerse yourself in a different group of people. If you have always wanted to try yoga, sign up for a class, or if you love reading, find a book club through your local library or local online websites., Sometimes a divorce can cause feelings of depression or anxiety, or deep concerns about re-building your life and family. If the emotions from your break-up and the subsequent entrance into dating feel particularly overwhelming, it could be worth seeking out a mental health professional to assist in skill building and coping through this time of transition. Another idea is to find a divorce support group facilitated by a mental health professional."

Get to know her.,
Talk to her relatives.,
Don't rush!,
Take her on a date.,
Keep conversation appropriate.,
Hang out.,
Don't rush for the kiss!",How to Date a Younger Girl," Before you are sure you want to date this girl, you need to know basic facts about her. (eg. her birthday, favorite color, TV shows, music, etc.);
, Ask her brothers, sisters, parents, on their consent. If it's all right with them, you won't feel too worried to date this girl.

, Younger girls will feel afraid if you just burst out and ask them to date you (makes them feel as if you're some sort of creep who preys on young girls). Take some time and get to know her. Then when the time is right, ask her. Don't say ""I love you"" too soon, either. It scares her away.

, Nowhere too romantic. You don't want her to feel as if you're just trying to get something from her. This will probably result in her dumping you, or feeling afraid of you. A dinner and a movie would be great. Somewhere public.

, Talking about something like sex would place her in an awkward position. Talk about sports, TV, family. Something casual.

, Her house would be good. But not in a bedroom! Try the family room, kitchen, living room. Couches are not very appropriate at the start. Wait until you and her feel more comfortable with each other.

, Since she is younger, a kiss would feel weird and confusing as she probably hasn't much experience. If you do kiss her early on, don't do it every minute.

See if it’s meant to last.",How to Date an Older Woman," If you really want to date an older woman, then you have to be secure in who you are. If you have low self-esteem or feel like you can’t hold your own in a romantic relationship, then you will have a hard time dating an older woman. Older women who date younger men aren’t looking to have a new son or someone to babysit; they want a man who knows who he is, no matter his age. If you lack confidence, then it’s time to work on loving yourself for who you are while also addressing your flaws.


Avoid being too self-deprecating or saying negative things about yourself routinely. Focus on the things you do love about yourself.
Accept new challenges with excitement, instead of excuses for why you would fail at them.
Work on exuding confidence in your body language, too. Stand tall, make eye contact, smile, and avoid fidgeting or hunching over.
Of course, it can take a long time to truly develop confidence, but you can take baby steps to address the flaws you can address and accept the ones you can’t. Make a list of all of the things you do like about yourself and work on expanding that list as you move forward.
Another part of being confident lies in being friends with people who make you feel good about yourself; if your friends are always putting you down, then you’re less likely to feel good about yourself.;
, Older women don’t want little lapdogs who will follow them around everywhere they go; they want men who have their own friends, their own interests, and their own goals to pursue. Make sure that there’s a lot going on in your life other than the older woman, so that you can make time for her without wanting to see her 24/7. If the older woman feels like you have nothing going on except her, she’s likely to back away.


Plus, having your own interests, goals, and outside passions is a sign of maturity and character growth. If you don’t have much going on besides your video games, then the older woman is less likely to think that you’re a mature, dynamic person.
Continue spending time with your friends when you can. You shouldn’t drop everything to hang out with the older woman every time. Let her see that your friendships are important to you.
Don’t get jealous, either. If you often ask her where she’s been or how she’s been spending her time, she’ll feel like you’re not mature enough to trust her.

, Though you shouldn’t try to dominate the older woman, you don’t want to be completely passive and just to go along with anything she says just because you’re younger. Though she may have ideas about how you should spend your time together, make sure that you do some of the planning, too; you don’t want her to feel like it’s too much work to be with you. You should have ideas about where to dine, what movies to see, or what activities to do together, too.


Take turns deciding what to do on your dates. Just because she’s the older woman doesn’t mean she has to make all of the calls.
If you’re kissing or getting intimate, you can make the first move if you want to. You don’t want her to think you’re too timid.
Though taking control sometimes can show that you’re wise beyond your years, you should be okay with asking the older woman’s opinion when you genuinely don’t know what to do. Being able to admit when you don’t know something is actually a sign of maturity.

, Don’t look at your age as something that’s holding you back and keeping you from enjoying your relationship with an older woman. After all, there must be a reason why she likes dating a younger guy, right? What you may lack in experience or knowledge, you gain in enthusiasm, excitement, energy, and a positive outlook. Show the older woman that there are benefits to dating a younger man, too.


Impress her with your energy and your ability to try new things. Don’t be skeptical about trying something you’ve never even heard of before; instead, embrace new opportunities as they come.
Even if you haven’t done a lot, yet, you can talk about all of the things that you’re excited to try.
Don’t say, “I’m only eighteen, but…” You don’t want your age to look like a disadvantage.

, One thing you want to avoid if you want to have a successful relationship with an older woman is making a big deal about the fact that she is “the older woman.” Though some women are happy to talk about this, other women don’t want to be looked at as “older” and just want to enjoy their relationships on their own terms.

You don’t want to accidentally insult the woman you’re dating; unless she brings it up, try not to draw too much attention to her age.






Making a big deal about her age will make her feel like you’re not comfortable with dating someone with so much more experience than you. This will make you come off as a bit insecure.

, You may feel like you need a complete personality makeover to have a successful relationship with an older woman. However, if you change too much, then the woman will lose sight of the man she was attracted to, at first. Though you may work on gaining experience, becoming more mature, and holding your own in the relationship, you shouldn’t change yourself so completely that the older woman doesn’t even recognize the guy who asked her out.


At the end of the day, you want the older woman to like you for you, not for some polished, dressed up version of who you are. If you feel like you’re not being true to yourself anymore, then you need to stop.
If you really want to have a meaningful relationship with an older woman, then you shouldn’t hide important parts of yourself just to seem older. Let her know who you really are.

, If you want to successfully date an older woman, then you have to be a true gentleman. You don’t want her to think that you don’t have manners or that you don’t know how to treat a woman. Now, some women think that certain “gentlemanly” traits, such as holding doors or pushing out chairs, are antiquated, so try to get a read on her expectations. Still, it doesn’t hurt to be polite, to have good manners, and to avoid overly vulgar topics. If you want to be a true gentleman, the most important thing is that you’re respectful of your date.


Show up to your dates on time and sometimes even with a small gift.
Make sure to put an effort into your appearance before you go on a date. You want the older woman to see that she’s worth it.
Give her compliments to show how beautiful and amazing you think she is.
Treat everyone around you with respect as well. Being kind and polite to servers, friends, and strangers shows that you’re a respectful person and that you’re not just putting on an act for the woman.

, Sure, the older woman has probably had more life experience and has been with more people than you have. That doesn’t mean you have to talk about it all the time or worry that you don’t have enough to bring to the table. If she’s more experienced in the bedroom, then great—enjoy whatever it is that she’s going to teach you. Try not to focus on your past and think about enjoying the experience you’re gaining with the older woman in the present.


If you want to be a good boyfriend, then you really don’t have to bring up your lack of experience. For one thing, it may make the older woman feel self-conscious about the amount of experience she has. For another, it’ll make you look insecure.
When you’re getting intimate, try not to worry about it if you don’t have very much experience in that department. If you obsess over this, then it’ll keep you from enjoying yourself.

, Be a man who knows what he wants and isn’t afraid to ask for it. If you’re always second-guessing yourself, mumbling, or waiting to say what’s really on your mind, then your older woman may start looking for someone more assertive. Get comfortable telling her what you’d like to do on your dates, letting her know if she hurt your feelings, and asking for what you want.


Part of being assertive means having a firm, clear voice when the time comes to say something. If you talk too quietly or stumble over your words a lot, then you’ll have trouble being assertive.
While you shouldn’t interrupt the older woman when she’s talking, you should be comfortable with articulating what’s on your mind when it’s your time to talk.

, Though you may not be the most mature guy in the world, you can certainly make an effort to become more worldly. Avoid having temper tantrums, getting angry over stupid little things, or just generally looking like you have no idea what’s going on. Make an effort not to look clueless and to read up on something if you don’t have any idea how it works. Learn to be polite to others and to treat them with respect instead of just looking out for yourself. Your older woman will want a man who is mature enough for her.


Avoid whining or complaining about insignificant matters too much. This is a sign of a true lack of maturity.
Avoid childish habits such as biting your nails, making fun of people, or fighting with your siblings.
Try not to get overly angry or upset when things don’t go your way.

, The older woman you’re dating may have had her fair share of serious older men. You can show her that you’re different by keeping things upbeat, fun, and lighthearted, so that she enjoys your time together. Minimize the serious talks and conversations about “Where is this going?” if you know what’s good for you. Work on enjoying your relationship in the moment instead of worrying about what lies ahead.


Stick to fun, lighthearted topics and make her laugh. Show her how much fun you can be.
Of course, you can open up to her and share more serious things about yourself when you’re ready. But as a rule, you should keep things fun and easy.

, If you want the relationship to last, then you can’t go around talking about how much older than you she is all the time. You want her to see that you want her for her, instead of because you think it’s hot and exciting to date a woman who is older than you. If you keep bringing it up, then she’ll get the sense that your heart isn’t in the right place.


Fine, if she brings it up and wants to laugh about it, then you should join in. But if she doesn’t mention it, then neither should you.

, If you really want to have a successful and long-lasting relationship with an older woman, then you have to do more than just think of her as that sexy older woman you’ve been seeing. You have to make an effort to get to know the person who she really is and to remember that age is just a number. Let her see that you care about getting to know her and that you truly value the time you spend together. Here’s how:


Take the time to really listen to her when she talks to you. Put away your phone, make eye contact, and don’t interrupt her.
Ask her questions about her childhood, her work, her friends, her family, and the things that interest her. Show her that you really want to know everything about her.
Check in with her when you’re apart to show that you care about how her day is going and that you’re thinking of her.
Give her compliments that show her that she really stands out to you. Don’t just tell her she’s hot; compliment her sense of humor or other aspects of her personality that really matter.

, If you want to make your relationship last, then you can’t be clingy. You have to respect the fact that your older woman is her own person and that she has a life going on outside of being with you. This could mean her time at work, spending nights with her girlfriends, or all of the time she spends doing her own thing, whether it’s yoga, writing poetry, or cooking. Don’t be needy or ask her to hang out with you all the time, and appreciate the fact that she has a life outside of your relationship.


Show an interest in the things she does when you’re not together. Ask her about her friends, her job, and her hobbies to show that you care.
You can check in with her when you’re apart, but don’t call her three times when she’s hanging out with her girlfriends; you don’t want her to think that you have nothing else going on or that you’re jealous.

, If you want to make your relationship last, then you should be able to hold your own when it comes to having a conversation with your girlfriend. You don’t want her to feel like she’s doing all of the talking or like you don’t have any opinions of your own to contribute. You have to show her that you’re thoughtful, mature, and articulate if you want to keep her interested.


Read up on politics, world news, and other timely events. If she brings up a current event, you don’t want to look completely clueless.
Talk about your experiences, such as your childhood memories or any traveling you’ve done. Don’t think that your experiences aren’t valid just because you’re younger.
If something funny happened to you that day, then get comfortable sharing it. Don’t think that it has to be all serious just because you’re with a mature woman.
Avoid talking about topics that make you sound young. If you got in a silly fight with your roommate or have to beg your parents for money, then these topics may be best avoided.

, If you want your relationship to last, then you can’t keep doing the same old thing with your girlfriend every time you go out. Be on the lookout for new restaurants to try, new places to visit, and new activities to try together, from taking salsa lessons to cooking an Italian meal together. If you get too comfortable doing the same thing together day after day, then you may come off as complacent and the older woman, who has more experience, may be wanting something more.


Though it’s great to develop some traditions to do together, you don’t want to fall into the same old dull routine day after day. Make sure you do something new together at least once a week.
Write her a love letter telling her how much she means to you just because. Don’t think that the romance has to stop just because you’ve been together for a while.
Be spontaneous. Suggest a weekend trip the day before, or take her on a surprise date to do something she’s always wanted to try, such as rock climbing.

, After you’ve been with your older woman for a while, you can start to ask yourself if it’s meant to be. If you feel like you’ve forgotten all about your age difference and that you have a meaningful, fun, and fulfilling relationship, then hats off to you. However, if you find that the most exciting thing about your relationship is your age difference and that that has worn off, then it’s time to move on.


If you find that dating an older woman was just a novelty, then you may not be in the relationship for the right reasons.
Be honest with yourself. If the older woman wants more than you are comfortable giving her, then you may have to part ways.
However, if you’re having an amazing time dating an older woman, then continue to enjoy your amazing relationship for as long as you want.

Call an amnesty.",How to Date an Introvert," A shy person who doesn't tend to read social cues easily (as these two are not the same) is sometimes just as unable to receive advances as they are to make them, and their nerves will tell on them in one way or another.;
, One good conversation won't be enough to earn their trust. You may find that after having a great interaction, the person will seemingly avoid you. They might be testing your interest, or might not be sure of what to do. Unless you see a really persistent negative trend, just continue to make slow, respectful advances.

, Just be friendly and calm. Speak in a low tone, as if you only intend for them to hear the story. Giving them a little information about you might make them less nervous about sharing information about themselves - a ""you show me yours and I'll show you mine"" sort of deal.

, Avoid questions with ""yes"" or ""no"" answers; try to get the person to talk a little. The reaction will vary, depending on the person. Some introverted, shy, or otherwise distant people are animated with people that they know, while others are consistently aloof.

, This is possible with both introverts and extroverts.

, Even if it seems like a half-hearted or thoughtless statement, this is often just a shyness or uneasiness in attempting to express what they actually feel. It's selfish to see their awkwardness at revealing feelings as a barrier; you care about this person, so make the effort instead of placing up your own barrier by turning that person into a challenge.

, Introverts will not always say what they are thinking. You have to be especially observant in order to figure out what they are thinking. For example, a small, coy smile is a positive indicator. A small, forced smile could be a sign to back off a bit.

, It can take a lot of courage for an introvert to approach someone they like, and the opportunity might not come again for a while, or at all-- be there or be square!

, Realize when you are getting frustrated or projecting your own assumptions onto an introvert. Try to recognize your frustration as a reaction within yourself without judgement and convert that energy into compassion for the individual and their unique experience of this world.

, Realize we are all human with complex and unique communication styles. We can not communicate or understand each other perfectly 100% of the time. We all make mistakes and have misunderstandings. Leave room for people to be human and take risks in expressing themselves, leave room for forgiveness.

They’re most likely over the party scene so you won’t find them at the loud, crowded bars downtown. They are likely to prefer environments that are more low-key. Some great places where you can meet older men include:Nice bars and restaurants
Golf courses
Coffee shops
Poetry readings and book releases.
Gallery show openings.Your friends obligation event. Tag along to a good friend's company picnic, neighborhood holiday gathering, or the extended family wedding as a platonic date. You may meet older men, and you'll certainly save your friend from boredom.;
, Older guys are online just like everyone else.Join an online dating site and customize your age preferences. You'll find men you like, and they'll be able to find you as well. Consider popular sites like OkCupid, PlentyofFish, and Match.com.


You can also look for websites that cater to May to December romances, but check the website out first. Some of these are used more for financially involved relationships., Many people pay more attention to current events as they get older. Keep up with what’s going on in the world so you can make conversation. Watch the news on television or read newspapers like the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. Form an intelligent and informed opinion about everything you read, and look up references you don't recognize. Older men who are worth your while will want to be able to have interesting conversations with you.Don’t just read about the presidential elections. Research candidates in local elections and learn about general trends in politics.
Get acquainted with sports. It’s fun to bond over and watch a game without having to explain everything.
Read about economics. Keep an eye on the stock market and learn what factors affect the economy.
Attend political fundraisers, protests, and volunteer for causes you care about., Older guys like a partner who is confident enough to be natural. Let them see who you are and don’t try to act like someone else. Good older men want to get to know the real you. They’ll likely have enough prior relationship experience to tell if you’re being less than sincere with them.Be honest about your interests even if they’re things that you don’t think a mature man will like. You’ll be surprised by how many older guys still like things like cartoons and comic books.

, Invest in your work: seek promotions, awards, and responsibility. If you are a student, get good grades and apply for further education. The great news is, a quality older guy is not going to be intimidated by your success the way a younger guy might be. He's already gone through your life stage, so he's less likely to be threatened when things go well for you.If you're on track with your career or your studies, people are less likely to assume you are only into him for security.
Invest in your own life because you don't want the pressure of financial support to ruin your relationship. You'll be happiest if you're with him because you like him, not because you don't have any other options.

, Older men don’t like to play relationship games.Let your actions truly reflect your feelings, and don’t feel like you need to ‘play hard to get. Older guys usually have a lot of things going on in their life. They may have a steady career or even kids.


Be honest about your feelings and don’t keep them guessing.
Call them when you say you will. Don’t wait for them to call you.
Don’t be afraid to ask them out. Older men appreciate the forwardness that younger guys can find intimidating.

, Find out what both of you need from a relationship. Things may not work out if you want children but he already has kids and doesn’t plan on having any more.The two of you may even have a different understanding of how serious your relationship is. If he’s been divorced in the past, he may just want to have a casual fling while you’re looking for someone to marry.


After a date or two, initiate a conversation about where you see the relationship going long-term.
Consciously consider whether or not your needs are compatible with his.

, Remember that a little space can be healthy for a relationship. You don’t want to lose your independence. Make sure you spend some time away from your relationship and encourage him to do the same. You might start to resent each other if you try to be together all the time.He may not have anything in common with your friends and vice versa. Both of you might need a little time to be around people your own age.
You may not like doing all of the same things. Keep doing the things that you enjoy.

, Realize that an older man may have responsibilities that don’t allow him to relocate. He might not be able to go with you if you have to move to follow your dreams, so if that's something you might want from a partner, talk to him about it! Understand that he may be already settled into his environment and might not want to change it the way a younger guy might.He may want to stay close to his kids.
He might already a good career that he doesn’t want to leave.
He may simply enjoy living where he does.

, An older man may have his finances in order. While it can be nice to be with someone who has financial stability, it can be awkward when you are younger and possibly broke.


Be clear on what you're comfortable with. If you aren't excited at being treated to dinner all the time, let him know you'll need to choose some cheaper dates.

, It might take a while before he feels comfortable fully bringing you into his personal life. Don’t try to impose yourself on it too quickly. He’ll need to make sure that he can depend on you to stick around before introducing you to his family and friends. If he has a reputation to uphold, he won’t want to be seen as the person who casually dates younger people.Tell him when you're ready to meet his family, but let him know that it's up to him when it happens.
If he has kids, understand that he might not want you to meet them right away. It's unhealthy for kids to frequently get attached to new people they might lose. Even if you think your relationship is on track, you may need to wait for a year or longer before you get to share time with his children.
It may take him a while to admit that he has strong feelings for you. Hopefully your older man doesn't react to his fleeting emotions. Rather, he may take time to be sure how he feels before he tells you.

, Everyone’s scared of getting older. For men, the thought of losing their physical virility can be terrifying.Even if he doesn’t show it, he’s somewhat worried that you’ll stop being attracted to him because of his age. Reassure him that he’s still got it going on and don’t remind him of how old he is. Every so often, compliment him on his looks, strength or any attribute that makes him feel young and useful. Say things like:


Your arms are so strong. I feel really safe when you wrap them around me.
You look so handsome today. I really like your style.
You can tease him about his age if he likes that, but be sure to check. Some guys might feel lighthearted about a few May-December jokes, but unhappy about being called ""old man.""

, Some people find the idea of an older man dating a younger person unsettling. They may worry about you being taken advantage of, or getting pressured into committing to someone who is in a different life stage. Assure them that you genuinely have a connection with him and that you wouldn’t be with someone who objectified you.Calmly break the news about your relationship to your parents. Give them some time to get used to it. They only want to protect you. They’ll come around when they see that your partnership is loving and equal.
If you have a sibling or a trusted family friend who can act as a go-between, make sure they also meet your boyfriend and let your parents know that they like him.

, Make sure that both of you have an equal role in your relationship. Just because he’s older than you doesn’t mean that he should get the final word on every decision. He’s your partner, not your father. If the relationship gets serious, make sure that you discuss every issue that comes up together before deciding what to do.


You should be comfortable expressing your opinions to him even if they’re not the same as his.
Know your worth. Absolutely refuse to be in a relationship with anyone who wants to control you.

, Some guys want a younger partner because younger partners can be easier to manipulate and control.Ditch older men who are jealous, controlling, who push you into quick involvement, who put unrealistic expectations on you, discourage you from interacting with friends and family. Dump an older guy who blames you for his problems, feelings, and other things that you could only control if you were a wizard. Run, don't walk, from men who threaten you, who put you down, who ignore your good news and accomplishments, or who physically harm you.Many acts that seem like signs of devotion are actually warning signs of abuse. A guy who drops in at your work to check in on you, who tries to protect you from everything, or who claims to be unable to live or function without you is manipulating you.If your partner is physically aggressive, call 911 or a domestic abuse hotline: 1-800-522-3304

Learn your partner's expectations.,
Listen to your partner.,
Respect your partner's needs regarding privacy.,
Do not push your partner out of his or her comfort zone.",How to Date a Virgin1," If you're going into a relationship with someone who's never had sex, you'll want to learn your partner's expectations. Everyone has different feelings about sex and sexuality. You should understand your partner's expectations for a romantic relationship, including expectations regarding physical contact.


Your partner may be a virgin because he or she practices abstinence. Abstinence means refraining from sexual activity. Your partner may be abstinent because of religious reasons. He or she may also be abstinent because he or she does not feel ready to have sex yet.If your partner is practicing abstinence, understand his or her expectations. People define abstinence in different ways. Some people define abstinence as refraining from genital-to-genital contact and may be open to other forms of sexual activity. However, others define abstinence more strictly. Ask your partner what he or she expects in terms of physical contact regarding the relationship.Your partner may also be asexual. Asexuality means your partner does not experience sexual attraction or desire. Unlike people who practice abstinence, asexuality is not a choice. It is part of someone's inherent identity and sexual orientation. People who are asexual may experience feelings of attraction without feeling the need to act on those feelings. Many people who are asexual engage in romantic relationships as they have an emotional need for intimacy. However, an asexual person may not want sexual activity to be part of a romantic relationship. If your partner is asexual, he or she may have specific expectations regarding sex in your relationship. Make sure you have a discussion about those expectations going into the relationship.;
, When discussing sex, virginity, and relationship expectations, make sure to listen your partner. You want to make sure you understand what your partner needs and wants out of your relationship. Therefore, practice active listening when discussing expectations with your partner.


Active listening is a manner of listening designed to promote mutual understanding. When listening actively, give your partner your full attention. Use non-verbal cues, like nodding on occasion, to show you are listening. Focus on what your partner is saying rather than formulating your next response in your mind.Repeat your partner's words back when he or she finishes talking. You want to make sure you are completely understanding of what is being said. If you misinterpreted something, your partner can help clarify for you.If you are not a virgin and your partner is, it's important to listen. Your partner may feel intimidated by your sexual history as things may feel unbalanced to him or her.You want to make it clear you respect the fact your partner is a virgin and want him or her to feel as comfortable as possible in the relationship.

, Talking about sexual history can be complicated. While you may feel curious about certain aspects of your partner's past, he or she may not want to share everything with you. Boundaries in a relationship are personal and subjective.


Your partner may not want to answer certain questions regarding his or her virginity. Conversely, if you have a sexual history, your partner may be uncomfortable hearing about it. While communication is important, if your partner is not comfortable with certain topics, be respectful.
Do not push your partner to have a particular discussion prematurely. Allow the relationship to progress at a pace that's comfortable for both of you., If your partner is a virgin, physical intimacy may come slowly. It's vital that you respect your partner's wants and needs. Even if you're eager to get physically intimate, make sure you do not push your partner to engage in any form of physical contact before he or she is ready. Always ask your partner if something is okay before engaging in a new form of physical intimacy. Be respectful of the answer your partner gives. If the answer is no, stop.

Be open about expectations regarding physical contact.,
Write lists.,
Take things slow.,
Communicate throughout the course of the relationship.",How to Date a Virgin2," It can be awkward to discuss physical contact and sexual needs. However, it's better to have a discussion early on rather than inadvertently doing or saying something that makes your partner uncomfortable. At the beginning of the relationship, take efforts to be upfront.Try to be open about expectations regarding sex and physical contact.


Know when and if your partner would be open to having sex. Your partner may not feel ready for a physical relationship at this stage in his or her life. He or she may also want to wait until marriage to engage in sex. If you're dating a virgin, sex may not be a part of your relationship in the immediate future. Understand this going into the relationship.
Understand what kind of physical contact your partner would enjoy. People who abstain from sex may enjoy kissing, hand holding, cuddling, and other light forms of physical contact. Your partner may also be open to more intimate forms of sex play, like mutual masturbation or oral sex.You should also be very clear on what your partner does not enjoy. It can be awkward to pause in the moment to discuss boundaries. If there is a form of physical contact that is off the table, ask your partner to be upfront about this right away. Say something like, ""I understand you're a virgin. I want to know where the line is. What forms of physical contact are you not okay with?"" You want to make sure you do not inadvertently make your partner uncomfortable during a moment of intimacy., This may sound overly formal, but many people find lists helpful in terms of establishing healthy boundaries. You can find checklists online which detail a variety of sexual activity or sex play. You and your partner can check off what on the list is okay. You can also simply ask your partner to make a list of what types of physical contact and activity he or she would be comfortable with and what types of activities are unacceptable. This can be an effective way to know concrete boundaries and avoid any confusion in terms of physical contact., If your partner is a virgin, he or she may need to ease into physical contact with you. Be willing to go at your partner's pace. Physical intimacy does not need to happen quickly for you to feel happy and fulfilled in a romantic relationship. If your partner is less sexually experienced than you, it might be better to let him or her decide when to move things forward physically., When a relationship progresses, physical boundaries and expectations may change. Your partner may feel comfortable becoming more intimate at a certain point in the relationship. Conversely, there may be certain forms of physical contact you or your partner enjoy less as time goes on. Therefore, keep communication open throughout the relationship.


Periodically reconsider boundaries. Return to the checklists you made earlier in the relationship and see if you're both still comfortable with the activities you checked.You should talk to your partner during moments of physical intimacy. Throughout physical contact, ask questions like, ""Is this okay?"" and ""Does this feel good?"" You want to make sure your partner feels safe and comfortable with you.Talk to your partner about the need for communication. On occasion, say something to your partner like, ""If you ever want to do something different physically, I want you to feel comfortable letting me know."" As stated, some people simply do not feel ready to have sex. It's possible that, at some point in the future, your partner may be open to a sexual relationship. He or she will feel more comfortable engaging in sex for the first time if he or she knows the two of you can discuss things like safe sex, STI status, and birth control beforehand.

Explore alternative means of physical intimacy.,
Talk to your partner about porn and erotica.,
Establish emotional intimacy.",How to Date a Virgin3," Physical intimacy is important to a romantic relationship. If your partner is a virgin, you may struggle to feel close to him or her. You also want to make sure sexual desires in a relationship are mutually fulfilled. Talk to your partner about alternatives to penetrative sex.


Kissing can be a very sexually stimulating, especially if you kiss your partner on sensitive areas like the neck and the ears. If your partner is not ready to have sex, you can both gain some sexual pleasure from simple kissing.You can also touch your partner in sexually sensitive areas. The breasts, the penis, and the clitoris are all very sensitive body parts. If your partner is open to it, you may enjoy sexual touching instead of actual intercourse. Oral sex can also be a pleasurable activity for you and your partner. However, keep in mind if your partner is abstinent due to moral or religious, reasons he or she may consider oral sex a form of sex.Mutual masturbation is another alternative to sex. This is where you and your partner masturbate together. This can be an arousing form of sex play that does not involve physical contact with your partner.There are a variety of forms of sexual contact and sex play you can engage in without having penetrative sex.

Reflect on your motives.,
Enjoy his riches, but reciprocate however you can.,
Don't be awkward about his wealth.,
Try to fit in to his lifestyle.,
Money talks; learn to talk back to it.,
Whether he's rich or poor, you still have to give it your all to make your relationship work.",How to Date a Rich Man," Ask yourself if you're in love with a man who happens to be rich, or if you're dating a man only because he's rich. If the diamond earrings he gives you are more meaningful than his tender kisses, then chances are, you're in the relationship for the wrong reasons, and it won't last. Here are a few questions to ask yourself to help understand your true intentions:


Would he still be a great catch without the fancy house and ride? If you're not sure if you would still love your current interest if he lived in a studio apartment and drove a car that was older than you, then you may be in love with what he owns, not who he is.
Are you twenty years old while he's approaching retirement age? Though age may be just a number, ""Sugar Daddy"" is more than just a word.
Is ""he's rich"" the first thing that comes to mind when someone asks what you love about him? If you're this obsessed with his wealth, then it's likely you don't respect his other good qualities--or that they don't exist.
Do you have a history of only dating rich men? If he's the tenth rich man you've dated, then this quality could be the only thing you care about, and it may be time to reflect on what you're really looking for in a relationship.;
, Sure, the champagne and oysters are a treat, but if you start asking for them every night without offering anything in return, your man may suspect that you're falling in love with his bank account, not his intelligence or sense of humor. Find a balance between expensive activities and those that anyone can afford.


Pick up the tab once in a while. Even if you're short on funds, it's important to show that you care, even if it's only by paying for the movie after he pays for dinner, or picking up drinks at a bar. You can also look out for special deals at normally-expensive restaurants, or see which local bar is having a free live music night, so you can still afford the delicious food and fun ambiance.
Treat him to an inexpensive meal. You can invite him over and cook a delicious, but inexpensive meal over a reasonably-priced bottle of wine, or prepare a tasty picnic, which will show that you put time and effort into planning your dates.
Invite him to join you for an inexpensive activity. Ask him to do outdoor activities, such as taking walks, hiking, or just sunbathing at the beach. If it's too cold to spend much time outside, invite him to explore a new museum or bookstore in your neighborhood. This will show that his presence is more important than his presents.

, If he's the right guy, he wouldn't want to repeatedly hear you mention how rich he is or how much you love dating a rich person. This may make him lose confidence in himself--and your relationship.


When you introduce him to your new friends, make sure to tell them to be discreet. If one of them says, ""Oh, so you're the rich guy I've heard so much about,"" it may sound as if this is the only quality on your mind.
If he wants to pay for something fancy, let him pay. If he's determined to take you to the opera or a fancy vacation, you don't want to ruin his kind gesture by repeatedly saying, ""This must cost a fortune..."" This will ruin the romantic mood, and will keep you from enjoying his gesture.

, While you don't have to mirror his every move, especially if you don't have the funds, it's nice to have shared interests, and to have a better understanding of the world he comes from. And the more you have in common, the more likely your love is to grow.


Look the part. Dress to impress as much as you can, even if it means buying discount clothing that makes you look rich. You can easily substitute cubic zirconia for diamonds, buy knock-off purses that look like the real thing, or wait for expensive clothing to go on super-sale before you choose the perfect item. You can also splurge on the occasional ""real"" fancy item--it's quality, not quantity, that matters, so if you own just a few key fancy items, the rest of your outfit will fall together.
Learn ""rich"" hobbies. Try your hand at sports that cater to the wealthy, such as yachting, polo, or tennis. You'll learn a new skill, make new friends, and have fun in the process!

, If you're serious about your rich hunk, then chances are, you'll be meeting his family and wealthy friends. You should make a good impression and show how much you love your new beau--not his new yacht.


If you're nervous about meeting his friends, you can keep a low profile when you first meet them to get a sense of their group dynamics, and then jump into a friendly conversation that shows you're not intimidated by their wealth.
If you're meeting his family for the first time, try not to talk about his money, or all of the extravagant things you've done together. Chances are, he has dated a gold-digger before, and his family may already be on the lookout for any hints that your intentions aren't pure.
Be yourself. Even if you have to adjust your approach at first, remember to always be yourself. If your man loves the real you, then his friends and family are sure to follow.

, In the end, remember that rich people aren't so different from the rest of us--they just have more money. Treat this relationship like any other.


Have open and honest communication. It's important to tell him what's on your mind, and if his wealth has made you uncomfortable.
Tell him one new thing you love about him every day. This will ensure that he knows you love what's in his heart, not his wallet.
If you love your relationship, don't feel guilty about enjoying the perks of dating a rich man. And if you end up taking a trip to Venice in the process, then all the better!

Learn the language.,
Have all of your sailor's email addresses.,
Be flexible.,
Be patient.,
Be understanding.,
Write often, if your sailor is deployed or in a different part of the country or world than you are.,
With all this in mind, proceed how you would normally date someone.

",How to Date a US Navy Sailor," The military has its very own version of the English language, and the Navy is no exception. Your sailor will throw around somewhat incomprehensible jargon because he or she is used to everybody understanding what they are talking about. This is simple to fix - if you don't know or aren't sure what your sailor is talking about, ask.;
, Most sailors have two email addresses - a navy one and a civilian one. The navy email address is typically used for work, but many commands do not allow personnel to check their civilian email accounts on government computers for security reasons. And oftentimes, your sailor may not be reachable by phone for a variety of reasons (i.e. no reception, cell phones not allowed in certain buildings, etc) and it is oftentimes easier to reach him or her by email. This is especially true of ships. Cell phone reception inside a ship is almost non-existent. When these ships get underway, the sailors on-board are completely unreachable by cell phone and have no access to civilian email accounts.

, Your sailor's work schedule will change at random, and often at short notice. On this note, try not to plan any surprise vacations. His or her command probably has a radius of several miles (i.e 300 miles) that they aren't allowed to go outside of without an approved leave chit. It would be a shame to spend time and money planning a trip only to find out that your other person can't go. Another thing your sailor will have to do is stand duty every so many days. This varies from command to command, and sea duty to shore duty. Usually, ship duty sections stand duty for 24 hours, and aren't allowed to leave the ship. Standing duty at a shore command is more relaxed. If you don't know what your sailor is talking about, just ask.

, There's a saying in the Navy, ""Hurry up and wait."" What that means is it often takes a long time to get anything done, much to the chagrin of your sailor. With schedules described in the above step, sailors often like to take leave, the military version of vacation days. Sailors get 30 leave days a year and emergency leave is deducted from that total if it is used (there is no ""sick leave,"" ill sailors are either hospitalized, put in bed rest or re-assigned to a duty they are able to perform.) Sailors are, however, allowed to go ""in the hole,"" and have a negative leave balance in some situations and they will earn their leave back. The sailors also have to route a special chit requesting how many to use and when, and get it approved. In fewer words, they have to get permission first. This takes as little as four business days, but up to a couple of weeks or more. Another thing you will have to be patient with, is mail. Sending mail to their command, especially if it's a ship, usually takes much longer than mail sent to a 'normal' address. Send something to a ship deployed overseas, and it will likely reach its destination in a few months, or more. A Christmas card showing up in March is not uncommon. Keep that in mind when sending off a care package to your said sailor.

, Your sailor may not be able to talk about everything, or anything, pertaining to his or her job, or even schedule, for security reasons.

, Or if you feel like. You may not hear back from your sailor everyday, or even every week, but emails from home are always welcomed.

Offer the benefit of the doubt.,
Know what you're getting into.,
Find a club where you feel comfortable.,
Show up early.,
Start a conversation.,
Tip her on stage, but don't get a lap dance from anyone.,
Leave when the club gets too busy and all the girls start giving lap dances to their customers.,
Ask her out.,
Be accepting of her job.",How to Date a Stripper," Before you even step into a club, make a conscious effort to be open-minded. Don't assume that because they are strippers, they must be promiscuous and unable to make money in any other way. Some dancers are very intelligent and might be doing what they do to pay their own way through college or nursing school. Other dancers might have had very unfortunate circumstances that you couldn't even imagine, and might be working at a club to feed their family or send their child to a good school. It's very easy to judge a book by its cover, but you'll never get very far with a stripper worth dating if you go that route.;
, Strippers get lots of attention, in the club and oftentimes out of it. If you can't handle your partner receiving plenty of admiration, dating a stripper is probably not for you. Don't go into a relationship with a stripper thinking you can 'change' her or expect her to get another job. Either accept that she strips or find someone who doesn't.

, Usually the type of club you go to will determine the type of women that work there. Some clubs are characterized by very young inexperienced girls, jaded veterans, gold diggers or all of the above. It's a good idea to avoid women who are usually attracted by the gangster type male who can give them some sense of protection and follow their party life rhythm--you might get lucky with them but they're not good dating material. Go for the gentlemen club type places where you can usually find more educated dancers, sometimes college students or even college graduates. These girls are usually far more interesting and open to socializing within the confines of their workplace.

, Go to the club right after they open, usually in the first hour or hour and a half after they open, the place is dead and the strippers are just chilling, hanging around, practicing pole-tricks and talking to each other. This is the best moment to try to approach them without feeling under pressure because they are still not in their crazy money-making mode.

, Be sweet and non-judgmental. Lots of these girls are used to getting the worst treatment from men who regard them as a disposable pieces of meat. Listen to them, give them a chance to open up and tell you their stories (which are usually interesting), and show genuine interest in their activities outside the strip-club. Don't focus your attention on their bodies. Everybody likes compliments but they get them all the time. Use eye contact, not leg or bust gawking. Instead of complimenting their body parts, tell them they look good in their new outfit (compliment the color scheme) or they are really improving a lot on the pole-tricks, stuff like that. Ask them about books, movies, school, family, life and they will find you a lot more interesting to talk to than most of their customers.

, If you pay for a lap dance from her, she will consider you a ""regular"" but do pay her for her time if your talking her up for awhile(she is at work after all).She will never date you once that business relationship with her is established. And if you're not getting lap dances from her, it's definitely NOT a good idea to get dances from any of the other women. When you're tipping on stage, however, you should tip all the dancers, just tip her a little extra. If you only tip her, that could foster a bit of additional jealousy and strife among the dancers that will make her association with you a little more difficult.

, Let her know that you don't want to interfere in her money making, wish her good luck and tell her you'll come to see her some other day. With several visits, she'll hopefully smile when you visit and make a beeline towards you as soon as she gets the chance. If she doesn't, it may be that she strictly doesn't date any customers of the club, or she may be dating someone already.

, If she isn't willing to meet you outside the club to hang out, she's playing you. Yes, she might be reluctant and cautious, but if she keeps turning you down, there's no need to pursue her anymore. If she does agree to go on a date, do something sweet and romantic. She is a stripper and she is used to guys showing interest to her through money and flashy presents. Try to do something that's related to a common interest that you've discovered in your conversations with her. Whatever you do, don't ever assume that because she is a stripper she will go to bed with you right away. On the contrary, some of these girls usually take a long time to get to know you; they don't generally trust men because they deal with the worst sides of men for several hours a day, so be patient and show her that you are different., If one thing leads to another and you end up dating a stripper, she will appreciate that you understand that she is working and making more money than many family practice physicians. In fact, she just may have plans to become one someday as many dancers become used to earning a much higher income than the majority of white collar workers! Understand that many women choose this field because it allows them the freedom to have time to pursue other interests or priorities, so plan dates on her schedule, and please, don't call her before 11 AM.

Ask yourself what you want out of this.,
Get his interest.,
Mentally prepare.,
Players are mostly in it for the thrill of the chase and the sex.,
Play it cool.,
NEVER ask him out.,
Prepare for the breakup.,
Come out of it all and be satisfied.",How to Date a Player," Chances are he won't stick around long enough for a real relationship, so if you have a fantasy of you two getting married and having some kids, wake up. Be prepared to accept that he is a player! If you know that you can handle him, move on to the next step.;
, What type of girl does he like? The good girl, the virgin, the bookworm, the popular girl, the bimbo, or the wild rebellious girl? Find out and do it. Yes, you may have to change who you are if you want to date a player. If you don't want to change yourself, go back to dating regular guys.


If you don't know what kind of girl he likes, here's a suggestion: players (like normal guys) prefer girls who are not trashy. Dress like a lady, be feminine, be sexy, look like you have a busy social life, and ALWAYS respect yourself. When it's appropriate (such as at a dance or nightclub) show some skin.

, Players are players because they act like girls are replaceable. Get ready--he will most likely treat you in the same way. Be ready to walk away from the relationship, and/or be used and dumped by him.

, If you want to keep a player around, it's going to depend on several things:


Can you two actually be friends--are you compatible?
Can you put up with his cheating?
Players are generally insensitive to a woman's needs--are you willing to sacrifice your self-esteem to be with him?
Are your prepared to have sex/lose your virginity with him?

, Do not be like every other dispensable girl in the room. Waste no time flattering his ego, because it's already big enough.

, Wait for him to ask you out. If he is not totally out of your reach (eg, he's the hottest guy around, you're chubby and he's into skinny girls), at some point when he sees you hanging around him enough he might ask you out. In general guys like girls that are more familiar.

, Once you bore a player, he'll either cheat on you or dump you (as long as you don't dump him first). So brace yourself for the time that he dumps you. Don't take it personally; he's a player.

, In the worst case scenario, you got to date the bad boy--the kind of guy that other guys only wished they could be. Even though he dumped you (or maybe you dumped him), carve a notch on your bedpost and call it even.

Make sure you are 16.,
Think about what you want in a relationship.,
Be a good influence.,
Keep the relationship casual.,
Look for girls in your singles ward.,
Date in groups.,
Don’t date while on mission.",How to Date a Mormon Girl1," According to the teachings of the Church, Mormon youth should not date before the age of 16. This is more of a custom than a hard rule, but it is a good standard to follow, as you will probably not be mature enough to effectively handle that kind of personal relationship before then. Even after that, the Church discourages youth from entering serious relationships before they are considering marriage., While the Church allows dating at 16, it discourages serious relationships until you both are older and considering marriage. Before that, you are encouraged to date, but not exclusively. This isn’t a hard rule, but it will influence the way both of you approach the relationship.Having similar expectations about the relationship’s possibilities will make your time together more meaningful and fun.


The right age for getting married varies depends for men and women. For men, this will likely come after completing your mission trip, so in your early 20s at the earliest. For girls, being the right age for marriage usually means graduating high school, if not later.
You should certainly still date even if you are not looking for a marriage partner. Dating in your teenage years will help you learn the kinds of things you value in another person. This can also be the basis for forming important friendships, and learning proper skills for social interaction., The Church encourages you to use dating as an opportunity to show your respect not just for others, but for yourself. Dress nicely, as the girl will appreciate the effort put into looking good for her, and encourage her to do the same., If you are not old enough to consider marriage, you should be careful about having a serious, exclusive relationship. Even if you are looking towards marriage, it can be better to hold off on more serious activities until a couple of dates to make sure you both feel the relationship is moving in the right direction.Avoid lots of physical contact early on. This means holding hands while walking around, or even kissing. Brief hugging is considered okay, but lingering contact, or forcing another person to hug you who doesn’t want to, is not appropriate. You don’t want to give one another, or other people, the idea that you are an exclusive couple.
This is especially true when you are around others. Public displays of affection (PDA) show a lack of self-control. It is also considered disrespectful to others, as they may be uncomfortable because of your open displays.
You should also be willing to date other people. The goal of dating at that age is to broaden your social circle and learn more about yourself. You should not be trying to be exclusive with one person, so go on dates with as many people as you can.

, In areas with lots of single Mormons of dating and marriageable age, the Church has established singles wards. You will be surrounded by single women, many of whom are probably interested in dating and marrying a Mormon, so take advantage.Currently, there is a shortage of men in LDS circles. Many men have begun leaving the Church in their early twenties as the mission has become more important. This means there will be plenty of girls in the singles ward looking for a date, and you can be pretty choosy if you’d like., While dating is a good time to get to know someone, if you are young it is better to go on group dates. This can keep the relationship from getting too exclusive, and spending time with more people can give you a wider variety of things to do.Even for more serious relationships, group dates can be a good way for you and your girlfriend to watch each other interact with different people. This can be a good way to learn more about your personalities.A group date is anything that you as a couple do with other couples. Make sure everyone involved is a couple, or at least is paired with someone. Otherwise you risk having an awkward mix between dating and hanging out, which can be uncomfortable for those involved.

, While you will be of the right age to date, the Church discourages you from trying to date someone while on your mission trip. Trying to maintain a long-distance relationship with someone at home or attempting to date someone you meet while on mission are both distractions. Your focus should be on promoting the Church and performing good works, and you won’t have time for a relationship."

Find out whether there is someone he likes already.,
If he is actually dating the other girl right now, consider backing right off.,

If you're convinced he isn't serious about the ""other girl"" and that you have a real chance, make your move.,
Keep your hints and suggestions innocent.,
Don't be too pushy, or make suggestions and hints too often, as this will cause him to put his guard up.,
Be a good friend, regardless of whether he asks you out or not.,
Deal with your own feelings honestly.",How to Date a Guy That Likes Another Girl," Make sure this isn't just in your imagination. How can you tell? Here are some indicators:

He talks about the other girl a lot.
He seems to spend a lot of time trying to be near the other girl.
He has told friends he likes her, and this has reached you through similar friends or friends of friends.
She knows he likes her and has told you or has told everyone she can.
He makes an effort to sit near her in class, at lunch, etc. and to carry her books or do other things that can get him close to her.;
, It's one thing to know he fancies another girl, it's quite something else to aim to be the girl that busts up an existing relationship. That is fraught with danger, dislike, jealousy and mistrust. And do you really want to be with a guy who will easily drop one girl for you? You could suffer the same fate down the track. Be certain that it's just a friendship with this other girl, and not an actual dating relationship, before setting your target on him.


If you really think their relationship is doomed, be patient and let time do its thing. When they break up, you can be there to catch the pieces.
Do you really want to compete for him? If so, consider how serious the relationship is, and how happy they seem together before throwing in your bid to cause trouble between them. If he is truly happy in this relationship, you may risk his happiness.
If it turns out they are just good friends, the door may be open to date him without any worries.

, If he is interested in someone else, you guys will need to know each other better. At least give him the chance to decide he likes you instead, by being an active part of his life.


Get closer. Find excuses to talk to him and hang around him.
If you are in school and in the same class, try to find an opportunity to do a project or study together.
Find out what he likes to do outside school, his hobbies and interests.
See if you have anything in common. If you don't, you might decide this relationship isn't even worth the effort of chasing!

, If he is in to art, show him your drawings, or look for art shows in your community and ask him to come along with you and some other friends. If he likes football, learn enough about the game to carry on a conversation with him about it.

, If he is serious about the other girl and makes it clear to her that he is pursuing dating her, consider the problems trying to date him may cause. He might be disappointed that you are trying to turn a friendship into something more intimate, especially when it's obvious to all that his heart lies elsewhere. This is a good time to give up your efforts before anyone gets hurt or hard feelings occur. It is also a good time to decide whether it's worth destroying your blossoming friendship, which may still bear fruit if he and the other girl don't work out. Sometimes it is best to play the long game and simply be there as a friend, until much later.

, Depending on how his relationship is going with the girl he is actually dating, it may be only a matter of time before a breakup. You will want to be in a good position to step in.

, Hint around about someplace you would like to go, that you think he would be interested in.

, Don't drop a line on him about going to the local ""lovers' hangout"" or something blatantly romantic.

, Occasionally mention casually there is some evening activity you think he would enjoy, and that you would like to go with him. This may be a movie, sporting event, or community event that you can present as a mutual interest.

, This means avoiding insulting or misleading him about his present girlfriend, or being dishonest about your likes simply to impress him.


Don't read to much into the things he says or does. Girls can sometimes over think things; if he smiles or laughs with you, don't assume he wants to elope, he's just being friendly

, This means that you need to admit to yourself your reasons for wanting to go out with him. If it is only based on jealousy of his girlfriend, or it's just a passing attraction, your efforts won't be in good character. Moreover, if your intentions are spiteful, you may be so enmeshed in jealousy that you miss a guy who is really worth your efforts. Be absolutely certain that this is the guy you want to wait for.


Don't spend all your time obsessing over him. You have a life to live and obsession isn't healthy and can lead to heartbreak. Don't be a stalker.
Don't hate the girl he likes or at least do your best not to. This is hard because you probably see her as competition, but it's pointless obsessing over her and shows immaturity on your behalf.
Don't turn yourself into a copy of his girlfriend. That will only end badly; if he does break up, he won't want another her and he won't be impressed that you're aping her at any stage of your friendship.

Go on dates on days other than Sunday.,
Dress nicely.,
Know her limits on substances.,
Don’t ask her to have sex.,
Learn more about the LDS Church.,
Consider converting.",How to Date a Mormon Girl2," Mormons observe the Sabbath closely, so Sundays are for attending church meetings and focusing on their spirituality.You’ll probably have to skip Sunday brunch, but there are six other days in the week to use for dating.

, The Church encourages people to be a good influence on one another, and she will probably expect you to dress well for her.You don’t need to wear a tie, but she will probably find it attractive if you take the time to put on something nicer than jeans and an old t-shirt for her.

, Due to their religious teachings, Mormons do not smoke, drink alcohol or caffeinated ""hot drinks"" (coffee or tea), or do drugs. This does not mean that you cannot do those things, but remember that she will not be able to do them with you. This can make it harder for you two to do things together.The Church has recently clarified its position on caffeine. ""Hot drinks,"" which refers to coffee or tea are not okay, but sodas are perfectly fine., Mormons are very strict about avoiding sex outside of marriage. If you are in a relationship with the expectation of sex, it isn’t going to work out. The extent of other physical activity depends on what you both want from the relationship, though in general the Mormon Church frowns on sexual contact even beyond intercourse., If she identifies as a Mormon, then she probably takes her faith seriously, and it means a lot to her. You’ll want to show interest in things she cares about, so take this time to learn more about Mormonism. You can ask her directly, or through sources like other Mormons or reading their books. You certainly don’t have to accept any of it, or convert, but it may help you understand her faith and choices.

, If your relationship has gotten very serious, your girlfriend will probably try to find agreement in your faiths. Being married and raising a family can be very difficult if the two of you disagree about important issues like religion. In each case, you should also consider how this will affect your families. There are two ways to go about this.



You join the LDS Church. This is obviously a big step for you, so be sure you have learned about the Church’s beliefs and teachings.
She converts to your religion. As you have been learning about Mormonism, hopefully you have also helped her learn about your religious beliefs (even if you don’t have any). If she expresses interest in converting, be prepared to talk about your beliefs, and help her find ways to learn about and follow them. Mormon women are more likely to date outside of the religion than men, but also very unlikely to convert to a different religion.Of course, neither of you needs to convert. There are plenty of marriages between Mormons and non-Mormons. If you both comfortable having different faiths, your relationship can still be rewarding and fulfilling.That being said, interfaith marriages are pretty unusual for Mormons, especially compared to other faiths, so without conversion it could be very difficult for your relationship to last."
"
Make sure she is 16.,
Ask her on dates.,
Try a variety of dates.,
Pay for the first few dates.",How to Date a Mormon Girl3," According to the teachings of the Church, Mormon youth should not date before the age of 16. If she isn’t 16 yet, she almost certainly won’t go out with you. Even after that, the Church discourages them from entering serious relationships before they are considering marriage. If all you are looking for is some non-serious dates to have a good time, you should be fine., Even though there aren’t strict rules about who should be doing the asking, it is always easier for her to say yes when presented with the opportunity. Be specific when you ask. This means first being clear that you want to go on a date. You don’t want any confusion between you two about what you are trying to do. This also means giving her something specific to do. Don’t ask vague questions like “Do you want to go out sometime?” Instead, give her the option of a specific event and time, maybe “Do you want to see a movie on Friday?” She may not be able to go at that time, but you’ve given a solid suggestion, and she may be willing to work with you to find a good time to go out.

, You should want to keep things new and interesting, as you would in any relationship, while still allowing your date to maintain the standards of her faith. If you need alcohol or coffee to have a good time, you just aren’t being creative enough. Consider a mix of activities that are inexpensive, and allow you to talk and learn about one another.Some good ideas include going on a walk or a hike, going to a museum, or having a picnic outside. You can always expand these into group dates by inviting other couples along, which may make her more comfortable in the early stages of your relationship.
Because service is important in the Mormon faith, she may be interested in doing something that will help others, like helping someone clean their yard. The important thing is doing it together.
It’s always a good idea to plan for the date in advance. This way, if you run into unforeseen problems, like the movie is sold out or you can’t get a seat at the restaurant, you have some backup plan. Make sure she knows the plan, so you both can dress appropriately. You don’t want her in jeans if you are going to a fancy restaurant., If you were the one who did the asking, it is simply chivalrous and gentlemanly for you to pay for dinner, the movie, or whatever else you do. Teenagers and college students don’t usually have the money for regular movies and dinners, so don’t be afraid to look for things to do that don’t cost any money. Going for a walk, playing a game, or watching TV at each other’s homes are good activities that don’t cost you anything. The important thing is that you are getting to know one another, not that you are always doing fancy things.
Later on, you shouldn’t always be paying. If your relationship is moving forward, or she suggests doing something more expensive, it is not inappropriate for her to help pay as well.

Make eye contact.,
Smile.,
Start talking.,
Initiate a conversation.,
Keep it light.,
Use body language to communicate your intentions.,
Break the touch barrier.,
Compliment the other person early in the conversation.,
Keep your interactions short and sweet.,
Close the deal.",How to Flirt1," Eye contact is the best and easiest thing you can do to start flirting. You can look deeply into the person's eyes while also taking the time to break eye contact to keep things from getting too intense. Consider using it in these ways:


Get caught looking. Don't stare, but do throw small glances at someone. Keep doing it until he or she catches you. Hold the gaze for a second, smile, and look away.
Look into his or her eyes when you talk, particularly at meaningful points in the conversation (for example, while you're paying a compliment).
Wink or raise your eyebrows at your crush. It's cheesy, but it works if used sparingly. Do it when you're looking at someone from across a room, or if you're talking in a group and say something really meant for him or her.
Girls can try looking at a guy, lowering your gaze, and looking up at the guy again through lowered lashes.;
, You'll probably smile automatically if you're talking to someone you like, but you can use your pearly whites to your advantage before the conversation even starts. You can even smile at the person when you pass him or her by in the halls, or just from across the room. You don't have to grin from ear to ear, either; just a simple, subtle smile will do the trick. Try these variations:


Smile slowly. If you're looking at someone but not talking to them, try letting a slow smile spread over your face instead of breaking into an insta-grin. Slow, languid smiles are generally considered sexy.
Smile when you make eye contact. If you're suddenly looking into someone's eyes, toss in a smile for extra appeal. (If it's a genuine smile, the other person will see it without even looking at your mouth — it will crinkle your eyes, and is known as a Duchenne smile.)
Try smiling with your eyes, not just your mouth. Make your whole face light up when you smile.

, Introduce yourself — or maintain the mystery (optional). If you don't already know the person you're flirting with, an introduction (or lack of one) can be a great thing to build flirting around. Avoid the urge to have a cheesy pick-up line. Saying ""Hi"" followed by an introduction or a simple question is much more effective and less forced.


If your crush doesn't know your name and you're a naturally gregarious person, try introducing yourself at some point. It can be as simple as, ""Hi, I'm . And you are...?"" Make sure you get the other person's name. To help yourself remember it, try repeating it after he or she says it to you. (Such as ""Lily. I love that name."")
Or, if you want to make yourself seem like a bit of a challenge, work to keep your identity a mystery for a little while. If the other person really wants to know, he or she will ask around or keep pursuing you.

, Whether you already know the other person or not, a conversation is the best way to move the flirtation forward. The person you're flirting with will be impressed by your boldness and confidence. Here are a few guidelines:


Talk to someone you don't already know. Perhaps the best way to strike up a conversation is to start with an observation which ends with a question: ""I can't believe how much it's rained this week"" or ""This place sure is packed, eh?"" What you say isn't important — you are simply inviting the person to talk with you.
Find common ground with someone you do know. If you've already met the other person, strike up a conversation based on a shared experience or interest. For instance, you might talk about a class you're taking together, or the train you both take to work. Again, the topic itself doesn't matter — what matters is that you're inviting him or her to interact with you.
Gauge the response. If the person responds pleasantly, continue the conversation. If the person doesn't respond or seems preoccupied or disinterested, he or she probably isn't interested in flirting with you.

, Don't bring up anything too personal when you're talking. Talk about the environment around you, the show you just saw, etc. Keep personal information (such as religion, money, relationships, education, and so on) out of it, unless the person enjoys intellectual debates without becoming over-emotional. Generally, it's best to avoid debating topics personally relevant to either of you (such as either yours or their religion) and to rather discuss topics you both don't have a personal stake in.


It's easier to flirt when you're talking about more fun and lighthearted topics, such as your pets, reality television, or your favorite vacation spots. This doesn't mean you have to dumb yourself down to flirt, but it does mean you have to relax and avoid the deep talk for a while.
Be playful. Being playful means not taking yourself too seriously, being a bit silly, playfully hitting your crush, or talking about something slightly offbeat or unexpected. It also means not putting too much pressure on yourself over the course of the conversation.

, Non-verbal cues can say a lot more about how you feel than what's actually coming out of your mouth, so make sure you're communicating how you feel. Try the following:


Keep your stance ""open."" Don't cross your arms or legs, as these are generally signs that you wish to isolate yourself from the other person.
Turn your body toward the other person. Stand or sit so that you're facing the person you're flirting up. Angle your torso toward him or her, or point your feet in that direction.
Break the ""touch barrier"". Casually initiate physical contact by touching him or her on the forearm as you talk, or by ""accidentally"" walking too close and brushing up against the other person.
Play with your hair (girls). Playing with your hair is usually a sign of nervousness, which is a good thing if you like the other person — you almost want him or her to know you're nervous because it means you're interested. To consciously communicate this, slowly twirl a strand of hair around your finger as you talk.

, The first few times you touch your crush, be careful not to ""trap"" him or her. Depending on the area, the contact should be long enough to be more than accidental, but no more. Avoid grasping a hand or arm, and instead try gestures such as brushing an imaginary speck of dirt off of their arm, or ""accidentally"" touching feet or knees without pulling away.


All of these touches can be rejected without humiliation or offense, so if your crush is not ready for that kind of contact, you will not be forcing them to reject you entirely.

, It might seem too forward, but letting him or her know you're interested in dating before a solid friendship begins is the easiest way to detour around the friend-zone. Get confident, and don't let the opportunity slip by — you never know when you'll get another one. Here are some techniques to try:



Maintain eye contact while you're complimenting. Looking away might accidentally make you seem insincere.

Lower the tone and volume of your voice slightly. Paying a compliment in a slightly lower register than your usual speaking voice makes it seem intimate and sexy. Plus, it might also coax the other person to come closer to hear you.

Use your crush's other interests to your advantage. If you know this person is dating (or interested in) someone else, you can use this to your advantage in a compliment.

Try weaving the compliment into the conversation. For instance, if the girl you like is talking about how she had a terrible day, you could say something like ""I hate seeing someone as beautiful as you feel so unhappy. What can I do to help?""

Be careful about complimenting looks. A girl might like it if you notice her eyes, but she might label you as creepy if you say she has a nice figure too soon. Play it safe and stick to these physical features:

Eyes
Smile
Lips
Hair
Hands



, Remember that the key to creating demand is making supply scarce, so try to limit your interactions with the object of your flirtations. Don't talk to him or her every single day. Make it a special event and save it for a few times a week.


Don't let conversations drag on for more than 5 or 10 minutes. The longer they go on, the higher your odds of running into an awkward silence.
Let the other person come to you. After you've put in the work of starting up the interaction and sparking an interest, pull back a bit and see if he or she seeks you out for an interaction. This can be a good way to gauge interest, as well as build tension.

, If your flirting has been successful so far, and you want to get to know the other person better, it's time to see if you can turn it into a date. Here are a few approaches:


Ask if the other person has plans at a later date. For instance, you might say, ""So, what are you up to on Saturday night?"" Try to keep this an open question, instead of one that requires a yes or no answer — you'll get more information that way. Don't ask someone what he or she is doing tonight, or even tomorrow. Try to schedule the date a few days out so that you don't come off as overly desperate.
Suggest a specific event and ask if he or she would like to come along. This is the best approach if you're trying to arrange a group date. You could say something like, ""So a bunch of us were going to see a movie on Friday, and I'd really like it if you came with us.""
Be straightforward. If you're feeling extra confident, go in for the kill without any pretense. For instance, you could say something like, ""I'd really love to take you on a date. When are you free?""

"
"
Keep your approach casual.,
Don't talk about yourself too much.,
Know when to press for more information.,
Compliment your crush early in the conversation.,
Be bold.,
Don't come on too strong.,
Convince your crush to pursue you instead of having to do the work yourself.,
Tease gently.,
Always leave your crush wanting more.,
Don't take it too seriously.",How to Flirt2," Don't let yourself get so nervous that you forget basic conversational skills. Instead, try to stay calm and open the conversation in a low-pressure way. If you've never chatted with the person online before, you may even find an excuse for talking to him, like asking a question about homework or talking about a sports team you both like. If you're texting a person for the first time, make sure he or she knows who you are and that they don't feel creeped out. Here are some ways to start a conversation through text or chatting:


""Hey, how's it going?""
""Did you see/hear ?""
""How's your week going?""

, The majority of people are most comfortable talking about themselves because it's a topic they know well. Instead of taking the easy way out and discussing you endlessly, encourage the other person to talk about him or herself. However, you can and should occasionally throw some personal facts in the person's direction to help them to ask questions about you in turn. The key is to leave it up to them to pursue an interest in things relevant to yourself.


This tactic actually serves two purposes: Not only does it keep the conversation going, but it allows you to find out more about your crush.
You don't have to possess prior information about the other person to do this step. If you don't know him or her very well yet, you can ask:

""How did your day go?""
""So, what do you do with your free time?""


If you do know the other person a bit, focus on a hobby or interest you're already aware of. For instance, maybe he's really into basketball, or you know she loves to read. ""Did you see the game last night?"" or ""Have you read any good books lately?"" would be great starts.

, You can keep the discussion lively and interesting without probing too deeply on personal topics. For instance, asking your crush what exactly he or she likes about running cross-country would be a great idea; asking him or her for more details on family relationships or close friendships would be too much, too soon. You can do it in a joking, flirtatious bantering way that doesn't feel too serious, or like you're interviewing the person. Here are some ways to ask for more information flirtatiously:


""So are you planning on spending all night online or do you have more exciting plans for this evening?""
""Are you going to kick some butt in tonight's game?""
""I've noticed the cute kitty in your profile picture. Is that who you spend most of your time with?""

, Don't chicken out and skip this step — it might seem difficult, but it's incredibly important. A compliment communicates that you're potentially interested in dating, and steers you away from the dreaded friend-zone. If you skip paying your crush a compliment and simply keep the conversation on a friendly level, it might be too late next time. Here are some basic compliments you could use:


If you don't know your crush very well yet, but you're working on it, use a compliment oriented in this direction. Say something like, ""It's so easy to talk to you,"" or ""I kind of can't believe I'm getting to know someone as interesting as you.""
Try weaving the compliment into the conversation. For instance, if the girl you like is talking about how she had a terrible day, you could say something like ""I hate seeing someone as beautiful as you feel so unhappy. What can I do to help?""

, If none of the suggestions above appeal to you, go for broke and pay your crush a bold compliment. Try these possibilities, using the adjective that fits your crush best or substituting your own:


""I hope you know you're gorgeous/beautiful/amazing/my favorite person to talk to/etc.""
""Sorry if this is too forward, but I have to say that you're incredible/an amazing person/so beautiful/etc.""

, Avoid loading compliments with feelings too early. Leaving a person slightly uncertain of the extent of your feelings for them can increase your attractiveness, giving you a bit of a mysterious edge. The point is not to make the person question whether you like them at all, but to make them wonder how much you like them. If you just openly say, ""I have a big crush on you"" or ""I've always thought you were so hot,"" then you're taking the mystery out of the exchange.


Instead, you can send a text or a message that says something like, ""You looked cute in your new sweater today"" or another comment that is nice and flirtatious without giving it all away.

, Though flirting should let the person know that you like him or her, you shouldn't make it seem like you're doing all of the work. Instead, you should be just flattering enough so that the person knows you're interested, but leave him or her to wonder just how much you care. To achieve this, try phrasing compliments objectively rather than subjectively. Here are examples of objective vs subjective compliments:



""I really like your eyes, they're so pretty."" On the surface, this compliment may seem fine, and it probably would be appreciated. However, a common flaw in phrasing a romantic compliment is to constantly use the words ""I like/love *insert trait here*"". They tell the person that they've succeeded in winning your heart. This is great if you've already built up a solid relationship, but early on it can make you seem ""too easy"".

""You have great eyes, they're very pretty"". Although technically both sentences are you conveying that you like the person's eyes, this one makes it more of an observation than a personal opinion. It implies that you find the person attractive but does not confirm it outright. As such, the receiver will feel both flattered and drawn to figure out how much attractive you find them.

, Because you can't use body language to communicate over text or chat, you'll have to rely on your words to keep the mood light and fun. Rely on inside jokes (based on events you were both present for), sarcasm (""Yeah, I'm SURE you look like an ogre in the morning ;)""), and exaggeration (""You're probably a million times better at this than I am"") in the beginning.


Make it clear that you're kidding. The drawback of using text to communicate is that you can't always read the emotion behind the words. If you're going to flirt with someone by teasing them, make extra sure that you're implying it's a joke. You can use winking smiley faces, all caps, or exclamation points to communicate this. Just don't overdo it with the emoticons or it'll begin to feel corny for the other person.

If you've already sent something that could be interpreted the wrong way, make your meaning crystal clear. Say something like ""(joke)"" or ""jk"" to make a quick save.



, As much as you might want to text this person forever, it's best to bow out before the conversation goes stale (as all conversations are bound to do at some point). The best way to avoid an awkward pause is to leave before one happens. Ending the conversation on a good note will lead your conversational partner to look forward to the next time you can chat.


Set up your next interaction before you go. Throw out something like ""Hey, so I'll see you around tomorrow?"" or ""I'll talk to you soon.""
If you're chatting online, note that you enjoyed the conversation just before you leave. It doesn't have to be complicated — a simple ""This was awesome"" or ""I had a good time talking to you"" is enough. If you're texting, you can be a bit more casual about it.
Be careful not to over-compliment your crush. Your compliments will have a lot less meaning if you bestow them for every single positive trait the person has. Instead, reserve them for meaningful things that are important to the person, such as complimenting a skill they take pride in.

, Keep in mind that flirting is supposed to be fun and try not to be crushed if your efforts aren't successful — not every interaction will be a perfect 10. Stay positive, and try again with someone else. As with anything else, flirting improves with practice. Flirting also doesn't have to have an endgame; not every flirtation ends in a date. Sometimes, you may just want to flirt for the fun of it, instead of hoping it will go somewhere.


Flirting can help you meet new people, feel more comfortable, and learn to mingle. You don't need to put any pressure on yourself to make it mean something or to be perfect.

If you sit and stare at him all day, he'll think you're a little obsessive. When you do talk to him, though, be confident enough to look him right in the eye instead of staring at the ground, and he'll be impressed by how you handle yourself.;
, Change for a dollar. Or ask what time it is, like if you might be late to a class or whatnot. Ask if he knows any of the people running for student office. Something simple, no big deal.


If you're talking to him, it's okay to avert your gaze every once in a while. Staring into his eyes during the entire conversation may be a little intense.

, This does not mean you should ruthlessly flirt with his friends until they can't help but notice you. It does mean that you should act cool and fun around his friends, and try to get to know them a bit. Flirting a little bit with other guys is okay and will keep your crush on his toes, but if you go overboard, the guys may get the wrong impression of you. Instead, be kind and interested, ask his friends about their favorite sports teams or weekend plans, and just try to act cool without making it obvious that you really like their friend.


If his friends notice you and like you, then they may talk about you in front of the guy, which will make him notice you more.
If you become friends with his friends, they may even invite you out to parties, which will make it more likely for you to hang out with the guy.
Resist the urge to send friends to ask if he likes you. He will think that you're trying to force a relationship. This will get right back to him and he will not think it's cool. Even asking the friends about how he's doing or what he's up to will basically reveal that you have a crush on the guy.

, If the guy is in your orbit but not talking to you, don't spend your time looking sad or bored and waiting for him to come up to you. Instead, enjoy the people you're hanging out with, laugh, tell funny stories, be engaged instead of looking around you, and just be a person who other people want to hang out with. Make him want to come up to you and make conversation because other people enjoy your presence.


If you look like you're in high demand and surrounded by people, he won't be scared off; instead, he'll just want to get to know you even more.
Guys love girls who are fun to be around. Let him see you cracking up instead of listlessly searching for something fun to do on your phone.

, If you are talking to the guy, as corny as it sounds, the best thing you can do is be yourself. After all, you want him to like you, don't you, instead of some vision of what you think the perfect person should be? You don't have to let him know everything about you at once, but you should generally act the way you do around your friends, just a bit less familiar. You may be feeling shy, at first, but the more you talk to the guy, the more comfortable you'll be being yourself.


You may think that guys like dumb girly girls who just giggle and toss their hair back, or girls that just fawn all over them, but that's not the case. Guys are much more attracted to independent women who can be themselves and are comfortable enough with who they are that they don't have to fake it.

, You may think that gossiping or saying horrible things about the people you both know will make the guy think you're an interesting person to be around, but really, while he may be temporarily interested by any gossip you may hear, he'll think you're a person who is petty and who can't be trusted. No guy wants to be around a girl who is always talking trash, because that will make her look like she's in the center of the drama, and no guy wants to be within a ten-mile radius of drama, especially girl drama.


Keep things positive instead. You want the guy to have a fun and pleasant experience whenever he talks to you, instead of feeling your negative energy.

, This is the worst thing you can do as a girl if you want to catch a guy's eye. If you see him hanging out with other girls, don't ask him if he likes them or talk about how those girls are stupid or ugly or fat. This will just make you look ridiculously insecure and extremely jealous. If you seem like a jealous person before you even start dating the guy, then he'll already begin to imagine that you would be an incredibly jealous girlfriend.


If a girl that you both know comes up, wow the guy by complimenting the girl instead. He'll see that you're so cool with yourself that you don't feel the need to compete with other women.

, Let's face it: guys love to talk about themselves. Who doesn't, really? If you want the guy to enjoy hanging out with you, then you have to make him see that you care about him without fawning all over him or awkwardly squeezing his biceps. Instead, ask him about his favorite sports teams, or about the sports he plays if he's on a school team. Talk about his favorite bands, his favorite TV shows, or even his favorite type of Mexican food. You can share stuff about yourself too, of course; don't make him feel like he's being interrogated, just like you want to get to know him.


Some guys are shy and actually don't like talking about themselves so much. If you get this vibe, then switch the subject to something you can both generally talk about, like your plans for the weekend.

, It is very simple, but very effective. Be nice to him and to other people too. He will see what a pleasant person you are. If you are harsh and mean to others, but nice to him, that won't really get you far either. Going back and forth between very nice and cold/arrogant will make you seem fake. Playing mind games gives you an air of being moody and high maintenance.


If he's thinking about dating you, he'll see that it would be easy because you get along with everyone. No guy wants to date a girl who has a reputation of fighting with everyone or just being mean to people for no reason.

, For some, flirting comes naturally. If so, flaunt it. If not, then just show him that you're interested in him by making eye contact, smiling, and making a little bit of conversation. You can turn your body towards him instead of away to send the message that you like him and even touch him lightly if your conversation is going well. You can also tease him a bit, if you're starting to get to know him and know he'll respond well.


Another way to flirt is to be a bit playful. You don't have to act like you take yourself so seriously all the time.

, Genuine, simple compliments are great. If you find something simple that you can compliment about him, go for it. Pick a pretty harmless aspect of his appearance or a quality about him that deserves to be complimented. You can say something like, ""I like your new haircut"" or ""It's really cool how you can be so good at baseball and have time to do well in school."" That's about as personal as it should get; there's no need to make him uncomfortable by saying something like, ""You look so hot in that shirt."" Save the juicy compliments for when you're dating each other.


Don't compliment him more than once per every conversation or two. If you keep piling on the compliments, he may feel overwhelmed or like you're fawning all over him.

, If he's teasing you, then give him a gentle shove or a playful tap on the knee. Just make sure the action is reciprocated. If you're the one who is always touching him, then either he's not that into it or he's shy about being touched. If you're sitting or standing next to him, try to be natural about having your knees touch or about brushing elbows. See how he responds to a simple touch. He might want more.

, People like to hear their names, so use his when you speak to him. You don't have to use it more than once or twice during your conversation; this will be enough to make him feel special.

, Tell him funny stories from what you did over the weekend. Talk about something ridiculous you heard on the news. Discuss your love for dancing or playing the piano. Keep the conversation moving back and forth, and don't be afraid to show your goofy side and make him laugh at your corny jokes. Just be a fun, dynamic person to talk to, and he'll want to come back for more.


It's okay if the conversation stalls and you can't think of anything to say. Smile, and then bring up something, even if it's kind of random. Don't get uncomfortable with a little bit of silence; if you and the guy are comfortable with each other, then pretty soon, you'll be comfortable sharing silence too.

, Try to stay calm as much as you can, even if you feel butterflies in your stomach. You can still be upbeat and fun without getting nervous or talking too much or too loudly just because you're around the guy. If you find yourself getting too excited, take a deep breath and calm down. Look away from his face if you have to. You don't have to be completely chill if that's not really your personality, but try not to look too eager or excited around him or he may get a little overwhelmed.


There's a difference between keeping your cool and acting like you don't care. He should still be able to tell that you favor him a little bit, without thinking you have a shrine devoted to him in your closet.

, Once you've got his attention, the thing you want to do is to keep him coming back for more. You want to catch his interest and make him see that you're a unique girl who he wants to get to know better. You can do this by being a bit mysterious and not putting all of your cards on the table right away; make him want to know more about you. When you talk to him, say you have to go while you're still having a great conversation instead of waiting until things start to die down before saying goodbye; this will make him want to see more of you so you can continue your great conversation.


If the guy is intrigued by you, then he'll want to spend more time with you, maybe even one on one. Don't get too excited if he asks you out, but do let him know you're happy about it.

Ask yourself what you want.Being with a man with children is never an easy thing and it isn't for the faint of heart.,
Recognize the need for sharing.,
Know that he likely has a connection to his ex.,
Ask about his custody arrangement.,
Get acquainted with his parenting style.,
Talk to your man.,
Be flexible.,
Take things slow.,
Be mature.,
Have a cordial relationship with the child's mother.You don't need to become best friends, but don't be cold (the children might feel you are a threat to their mother and act out against you).,
Decide when to meet his children.,
Have an honest conversation with his children.,
Realize that his children may dislike you initially.",How to Date a Man with Kids," Don't feel bad if you can't deal with the division of attention. Consider it self-preservation. Take some time alone to make sure this is what you want. Ask yourself the following questions:


Can you handle sharing his attention and time with his children?
Will you be jealous of the time he spends with his children?
Are you willing to act as a good role model for his children?
Do you want a relationship with his children?;
, If you decide that you want to pursue this relationship, you will need to share your significant other.You need to be aware that his children will always be his top priority. There will be times when you need to share him with his children and depending on the situation, if there is an emergency or if the mother of his children is undependable, this sharing may become quite one-sided.

, Whether they are amicable or fight like cats and dogs, your man probably has regular interactions with the mother of his children.While this is for the well-being of his children, it can place a strain on his relationship with you if you are jealous of his ex, if you and his ex don’t get along, or if his ex decides to interfere with your relationship in any way.Ask yourself if this is something you could handle.

, You’ll want to know how often he spends time with his children and if he is their primary caregiver. This will allow you to set up realistic expectations of the amount of time that you will be able to spend with him. You’ll also want to know if he has a co-parenting plan with his ex that requires him to spend holidays, vacations, and other parts of the year with his ex and his children as a whole family unit., It is possible that he will have a parenting style with which you disagree. If this is the case, know that you have no right to argue with his parenting style since these are his children and not yours.If you cannot abide by his parenting style, you should walk away. Know that if you stay and ask him to change his parenting style, he will likely leave if you push him too hard. Compromising the wellbeing of his children to make you happy is not on the table for him., Sometimes discussing how you are feeling will not only make you feel better, but it will let him know how you are feeling.Granted, you can't complain about every little thing, but repression is unhealthy. Let him know if you feel apprehensive or have reservations about continuing the relationship and talk through those issues in a mature fashion.


You might say something like this: “I’ve never dated someone with children before and I’m a little nervous about it. I was wondering if we could talk about that.”

, When you’re dating a man with children, his schedule might change quickly to accommodate the needs of his children.This means that your dinner date might go out the window when your man’s son ends up in the ER for stitches after falling off his bike.

, Don’t rush getting to know your man in the hopes that you’ll meet his children sooner.Sure, maybe you want to meet his children, but before you do that you should know with certainty that you are in a healthy committed relationship with your significant other., Don’t play manipulative mind games with your man.Don’t put him in a position where he needs to choose between you or his children.A good father will eliminate a potential love interest if he feels like she is acting jealous, playing games, or competing against his children for his attention.

, Don't be afraid to ask your man about his relationship with her.What they did, but more so, why they broke up? Sometimes figuring out her quirks will help you communicate better with her.


Try coordinating transportation to school during the week — maybe she can't pick them up on Thursdays, so you can offer to do it — or offering to help plan a birthday party with her. If you're helping plan an event like a birthday party, keep in mind that you are not running the show — just be there to offer your assistance. Ask if you can pick up the cake, get balloons, assist with decorating, or if there are any specific things she'd like you to do to help. Don't turn it into a power struggle.

, Make a point not to meet his children until you've been dating for a while and have a very strong agreement that you will have a future together. Meet in a neutral location and take the time to really get to know his children well.Don't forget that every relationship is different and his children may appreciate knowing the person that their parent is dating.


You might decide to meet his children in a place where you can undertake a group activity, such as an arcade, a bowling alley, or a trampoline gym. This depends upon the ages of his children and their interests. Try to find a group activity that everyone can participate in to diffuse tension and ease discomfort.

, Tell his kids that you are really nervous about meeting them because you love their father. Let them know that you don't ever want to give them the impression that you are there to replace their mother.Finish the conversation by telling them that you're looking forward to getting to know them better and be open to their questions.


You might lead in with something like, “Hi, my name is _____. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you because I enjoy spending time with your dad and he always has so many nice things to say about you. Just the other day, he told me how proud he was of you for getting an A on your spelling test.”
You might also say, “I want us to be friends if that’s okay with you. I know that you already have a mom and aunts and uncles and other family members who love you, so I thought that perhaps, we could be friends.”
Finally, you might say, “I’m really looking forward to spending more time with you so that we can get to know each other better. How does that sound to you?”

, Don't be upset about this or take this to heart. You are a stranger to them. Children have thoughts and feelings all their own and at times they may act impulsively. Be sure that you think before you act, offer to get to know them in their own time, and take things in stride.Manage rejection gracefully and talk to the child with respect.

Don't ask for a date immediately.,
Say something positive.,
Keep the conversation going.,
Make a good first impression.,
Use the right body language.,
Wear the right colors.,
Make the date a suggestion.,
Frame the date as their own idea.,
Explain the benefits.,
Ask directly.",How to Get a Date," Asking outright for a date can dramatically lower the chances of the other person agreeing. Instead of simply approaching someone and asking if they would like to go on a date with you, start by asking a simple question or favor first. You can also use this question to start a longer conversation and learn more about the person before asking them out.Try asking for a simple favor. Asking for directions or for any good restaurants nearby are some examples you can use to get the conversation started.
After you ask your favor, you can ask if the other person might want to meet up with you later.
Asking a favor first results in about a 15% chance of the person agreeing to a date.
Asking directly for a date has only a 3% chance that the person will say yes.;
, If you are approaching someone in a public space, it can be difficult to think of something to open your conversation with. When you open up this conversation you will want to focus on something positive about the area you find yourself in.Do not use “pick up lines”. These are off putting and are perceived as disingenuous.
For example, if you are in a supermarket, you might comment about how tasty something looks and ask if they have tried it.
Small talk can indicate interest and can help avoid the other person from feeling threatened.

, After you start a conversation, you will need to keep it going. The key is to listen and pay attention to what they are saying, both verbally and with body-language. Start the conversation off slowly and look for details that they offer which you can use to keep the conversation going.Slowly work to uncover more details about the other person that you can talk about.
Match the length of their response. Talking more than the other person can make you seem self-absorbed.
Keep your responses no longer than a minute in length.
Towards the end of this short conversation, ask for a date.

, First impressions are formed almost automatically when two people meet for the first time. These judgments are made quickly, based on behavior, dress, appearance, and anything that is said during the meeting. By making a good impression, you can help increase your chances of getting a date when you ask.First impressions can be hard to change.
Looking good and dressing clean can help leave a good impression.
Greet people with confidence and make eye contact to show self-assurance.
Your first few words are important. Try to say something that demonstrates your character and shows intelligence.

, There are many non-verbal methods that you can use to convey your interest in the person you are speaking with. By using these in conjunction with your verbal conversation, you can help express your confidence and let the other person know that you find them interestingKeep your shoulders back and stand up straight.
Occasionally, you can tip your head to the side or nod to show interest.
Smile. As you are talking with the other person wear an easy smile. However, smiling too much or too little can be off putting.
Stand closer than you normally would to someone you aren't interested in.
Make eye contact. Avoid staring, but make enough eye contact to show self-confidence and demonstrate you are paying attention.
Speak slowly and relaxed. Don't be in a hurry when talking and leave a bit of a pause when the other person is done speaking.

, If you plan on going out to look for a date or are expecting to meet a new group of people, you should consider what colors you are going to wear. Color can have an effect on people and leave a certain impression, depending on which hue you are wearing. Make sure the colors you have on when looking for a potential date are sending the right messages.Men who wear blue are often perceived by women as being stable and loyal.
Women who wear red can appear as being passionate and powerful by men.
Grey can leave the impression of neutrality and quietness, which might not be ideal when looking for a date.

, When you are asking someone what their plans are and if they want to go on a date with you, asking indirectly can be the best way to do so. Using indirect phrasing can make the other person feel less pressure and allow them to answer honestly. When asking for a date, always phrase the question to be an indirect one.Ask them what their plans are. If they don't have any, present your own plans and ask them if they'd like to join you.

, As you ask someone out on a date, you can try to phrase your request in a way that will make the other person feel as if it was their own idea. People are often more comfortable with their own thoughts and ideas and are more likely to agree to your plan for the date.For example, ask about any good restaurants nearby. When they suggest one, respond by saying that the restaurant sounds great and since they like it maybe you should both go sometime.

, One way of asking for a date involves phrasing your request in a way that highlights the benefits of going. By presenting a reason why it would be a good idea to go with you on this date, the other person will be more likely to agree to the date.Explain why a certain place is worth visiting. If they like the idea, let them know that you want to visit this place as well and suggest you go together.

, Some people won't like indirect questioning and it may come off as manipulative. If you think the person you are going to ask on a date would prefer the direct approach, you should ask them in that manner. This method avoids any potentially lost or misunderstood meaning and gets directly to the point.Simply ask if the other person would like to go on a date you have in mind.

, Figure out the kind of guy you're looking for (future doctor, successful businessman, outdoorsy adventurer, artsy hipster, etc.) and go to the neighborhoods where such men are concentrated to have your lunch or get your morning coffee. Of course, this means you'll have to be willing to talk to guys you don't know!

, Local clubs and classes can be a great place to meet guys. Pick a class or club in a subject that interests you but know that you'll have a much easier time if you choose something that will have a higher concentration of men. Classes on business, investment, and other work skills often attract more men. As for clubs, check your local university or community center for sports clubs, gaming clubs, or other male-centered activities.

, It's not just for creepy loners anymore: more and more people are meeting their future spouse online. There are free services (like Plenty of Fish) as well as online communities where you can meet someone that meshes well with you or you can pay a small fee to join top-notch services like Match.com.

, Whether you're going to the local comics convention or a business conference, you're likely to find plenty of single guys. Do your research before you go, though, so you have something to talk about. You may think you don't want a geeky guy, but you're wrong. Geeks love hard and loyally, and tend to be very stable. Give them a chance!

, The best way to find a good guy is to simply ask your friends to set you up. Don't feel ashamed or like you failed: most couples meet through friends and good friends will want to see people they like be happy! They won't mind...in fact, they'll probably enjoy the feeling they get from helping people find happiness. Just tell your friends that you're tired of dating duds and ask if they know of anyone that fits the Mr. Right bill. This method can lead you to finding some great guys that you would have otherwise missed or passed over.


If your friends aren't leading you to good men, you need new friends. Good people associate with good people, and your friends clearly have some character flaws or just don't value your friendship all that much if they're giving you total losers to date.

, Did you know that more than 20% of married couples meet each other at work? If you haven't had a look around the office, give it a go. Meeting someone at work can help you answer some very important questions about a possible partner: someone who is hard working and kind to their coworkers is often great dating material.

, You want Mr. Right to have his priorities in the right order. He should prioritize your happiness over how his friends, coworkers, or family think of him. If he's worried because you make him seem less manly or cool, he's not Mr. Right. He should also share your priorities regarding things like work, finances, lifelong education, better himself, etc.


Life priorities are different for everyone, so it's hard to say which ones he should and shouldn't have. What's important is that his priorities are the same as yours.
Just remember: you should not expect any more from him than you expect from yourself.

, When he introduces you to people, does he try to avoid calling you his girlfriend? Is he reluctant to introduce you to his parents, even though you've been dating for quite a while? These are bad signs. You should also watch out for how he talks to you. Is he insulting or does he make you feel bad? Mr. Right does not say hurtful things to you on purpose.


Sometimes your guy may try to point out some flaws that you have. This can be good or it can be bad, depending on how he does it. If he really is worried about you and he wants to help you better yourself, he'll never pressure you or create an ultimatum. Instead, he'll consider your feelings on the topic and if you want to change then he'll help you find good ways to do it.

, Much like life priorities can differ depending on the person, maturity levels can also be different. Just find what works for you and insist on it. If you like someone that's playful and carefree, then that's fine. But if you need someone that can be a grown-up with you, then you deserve to have that. Don't write it off as boys-will-be-boys. If you feel like you have to take care of him all the time then your relationship will not work in the long run.

, When you're with Mr. Right you should feel free. You should feel like it's okay to try new things and explore the world around you. The world should feel full of possibilities. He should encourage you, not hold you back. If he makes you feel fearful or tells you what is and isn't ok, he's not Mr. Right.

, Trust is one of the most important things in a relationship, regardless of what kind of people you are. Accordingly, he should always be honest with you and with other people in his life. He should live honestly so that you never have to have doubts about your life together.

, Once someone cheats on you, trust can never again be regained. There will always be the possibility that he's cheating on you again. This is not something that you want. It makes truly happy relationships almost impossible. Once a guy cheats on you, that's a clear sign to you that you deserve better and you need to leave that relationship.


If he really loved and respected you, he would have tried to talk to you if he felt he was struggling in the relationship. Don't take his excuses if he says something like, ""We were having problems but now I want to fix them.""

, When you're trying to woo Mr. Right, you want to show him that you're Ms.-soon-to-be-Mrs. Right. One of the best ways to do this is to show that you are a good person. Show him respect but also, importantly, show respect to others as well. We can tell a lot about a person by how they treat others and if you're kind to the people you don't have to be kind to, that's a good sign.

, Mr. Right wants someone who thinks they're worth loving and respecting, so show him you think you're worthwhile by respecting yourself. Don't speak poorly of yourself, speak up for yourself in interpersonal situations, wear clothing that isn't demeaning (too big, too small, to revealing, etc), and practice good hygiene, a healthy diet, and reasonable exercise regimen.

, Mr. Right isn't really Mr. Right if he doesn't fall for who you are as a person. No matter what, being yourself is the most important thing. If a guy doesn't like you the way you are, he isn't worth the time of day. Let your true passions show through, celebrate your positives and embrace your faults as a person. You should never try to be someone that you're not, since this in unhealthy for you and your relationships.

, A passionate, enthusiastic person is very attractive to just about everyone so engage yourself in pursuing your passions. Do the things that you want to do and get out there to try new things you've always wanted to pick up. Mr. Right will think that this passion is sexy.

, Guys find clear communication to be one of the most important skills in a relationship, so show him that you're the safe bet by communicating clearly and often. This is also important because it lets you solve problems in your relationship before they become too big to fix, making your relationship more stable and enjoyable for both of you.

, You know the game: you tease him, make him think you're interested, and then act cold or oblivious right after. You carefully meter out when you call him and how much time he can spend with you to make him want more. This is very manipulative behavior and it won't get you the kind of guy you're looking for. Be honest with him and let him know you care. He'll do the same if he's really a good guy.

, Don't be afraid to take initiative in finding Mr. Right and dating Mr. Right. Ask him out. Choose where you go on dates every now and again. Don't be afraid to tell him how you feel. He'll be able to see that you think your relationship is more important than how shy you feel.

, Once you fall for him, you're going to want to be sure he loves you just as much, right? It's not as hard as it seems.

, Sometimes it feels like you attract the jerks like flies, while the good guys don't seem to pay any attention. This might be related to how you act! Make some changes and you'll attract the right guys before you know it.

, Right to notice you. Sometimes catching his attention is the real trick. You can take yourself out of the shadows and get up on the pedestal if you try a few simple tricks and work at it.

, If you want to earn that permanent place in his heart, you're going to have to work pretty hard. It isn't impossible though. Sometimes, you just have to have the perfect show of affection to make him realize you really are The One.

Introduce yourself with confidence.,
Use what you have in common.,
Take it slow.,
Get her contact information.,
Leave first.",How to Get a Beautiful Girl and Still Be Yourself1,"

First impressions are everything, so make sure yours is a good one. The way you begin the conversation can set the tone for the whole exchange. Approach the beautiful girl with confidence, assured that you have the qualities to attract her.Don’t take it too far and act cocky or arrogant. Just be yourself and believe that being yourself is enough to the girl's attention.
For example, make eye contact, walk over to her and say, “Hi, I’m Tony. How are you?” She will most likely respond back positively.
If you are already a bit nervous, you may want to wait until she is alone to approach her. This way you won’t be worrying about what her friends are thinking.
Don’t wait too long to introduce yourself because you might lose your confidence. Also, girls think it’s creepy if you keep staring at them without saying anything.;
, Beautiful girls aren’t just beautiful; they have interests, hobbies, and opinions. Finding something that you both have in common gives you something to talk to her about. You don’t have to stalk her, just look around to see what you have in common that you can use to initiate a conversation.


Make a statement about the commonality and then ask her a question so that conversation continues.
Comment on your setting.For example, if you are at the park, you might say, “The pond looks really peaceful today. Have you ever fed the ducks?”
Talk about something she said or did. For example, if she made a comment during a discussion, try saying, “Your comment was really thought-provoking. How did you learn so much about the topic?”
If she’s reading a book or has the latest phone, then comment on it.For example, “That book looks intriguing. What's it about?”

,

Don’t ask her out the first time you meet a beautiful girl. Doing this can make her feel pressured and nervous; she’ll be more likely to turn you down.It can also make you feel super nervous to just be meeting her for the first time and ask her out all out once. Instead, take it slow. Just focus on introducing yourself and talking with her briefly to give her a sense of you and get comfortable with you., Don’t ask for her phone number; girls are more likely to say yes if you just ask, “Is it alright if I contact you sometime?” She can decide whether she wants to give you her phone number, email address, or other contact information. Remember your goal isn’t to get her phone number, but to get to know her. However she wants you to contact her is fine.

, When you first meet a beautiful girl, this helps you in a lot of ways. The first meeting is often a little awkward and you might be nervous and say something that makes her reject you. Leaving first cuts down on the chances of this and can help the girl feel less pressured.It also keeps you from appearing desperate and makes you seem a little mysterious.


After you have her contact information, you might say, “Well, it’s been a pleasure talking to you, but I’ve got to go get back to work. I’ll contact you soon.”
Or try saying, “Well, I’ve taken up enough of your time right now. I’ll let you get back to what you were doing. I’ll call/email/text you soon.”

"
Be honest about your interest.,
Speak with confidence.,
Don’t expect to win them all.,
Don't move too quickly.,
Compliment her.,
Express real interest in her interests.,
Be more sensitive.,
Listen intently.,
Find an opening to ask about a future plan.,
Send out feelers quickly.,
Don’t take too long to respond.While being too eager in creating the plan could be seen as overbearing, the opposing method will be far more detrimental to your budding relationship.,
Be flexible with the plan.If you have strict preconceptions on how your date will go, then you may end up being disappointed.,
Remember that she said yes.",How to Get a Girl," There are many fish in the sea, as they say, which means that there are many potential mates for any person. You'll want to prove, from that get-go, why you’re interested in spending time with this person in particular. It's often best not to think so much about ""the date"" in the initial stages. You don't want to get ahead of yourself, as all relationships should be founded on proper communication and a friendly interest in the other person.


If you often see the girl in public, whether at school or in the neighborhood, always greet her.Small talk can be helpful in finding common interests. It's also a nice way to connect on a person-to-person basis before jumping into the ""dating talk."" This all shouldn’t be as daunting as you think it is; just be yourself and prove that you're interested in speaking with her.;
, If you think you’re going to fail, you probably will. Try not to be too frantic or speak in a high voice; your tone will suggest that you're uncertain about your offer. If you have faith in yourself, you'll speak directly without any stuttering or hesitation. This brand of conviction is attractive, and it will also make your interest very apparent. Even if she doesn't say yes, you'll feel more confident the next time that you ask a girl out.


If you enter the conversation with any sort of unnecessary arrogance, however, your chances will become slim. There's a difference between being confident and assuming that she's going to say yes. Don't put on any extra swagger; the honesty of your directness will be more than enough to bolster your chances.

, There are many reasons why a girl may not accept your offer to go on a date with her. You shouldn't take it too personally if she's not interested. Odds are that you haven't done anything wrong. Maybe she’s just not interested in dating right now, or maybe she’s already seeing another person.

, If you're starting to grow close with this person, there's no need to ask her out just yet. You enjoy her company, so deepening your friendship through casual hanging out should still be rewarding.It'll also be easier, if things don't work out, to remain friendly. You should, after all, be comfortable remaining friends if she doesn't want to date.


If you have mutual friends with her already, make sure that you don't allow their opinions to inform your ideas about the relationship. There's no way that they can understand exactly what you're going through. Even if their opinions are valid, you and her will know best if things are starting to work.

, Don’t be subtle about it. Tell her that you like her necklace, or her new haircut, or that you dig her sense of humor. But whatever you do, make sure you really mean it; no one wants to receive a false compliment. If the compliment seems too forced, it might appear that you're pandering to her.Remember that the simplest ones are often the best.


While physical compliments can certainly work, it might benefit you to compliment some positive behavior that you've seen her perform. If you've noticed her compassion toward others, try telling her that. It's very difficult to fall flat if you're speaking honestly to someone about their character or moral compass.

, When she speaks about things that she’s passionate about, you should be excited and want to hear more. Keep asking questions and digging deeper. She’ll know that you’re interested and want to speak more about herself.


Not sure what she likes? Try asking about some of these topicsto make some headway in those discoveries. It's important to ask plenty of questions about what she enjoys. You want to get to know this person quickly, and it's tough to do that if you don't do some proper investigation.
If you’re not actually interested in what she’s speaking about, that’s a definite sign that you two aren’t compatible. You may find her attractive or have the desire to date another person, but if you have no common interests, your further contact will most likely be painful and awkward.

, Because a relationship requires a great deal of intimacy, it'll be to your benefit to start those more vulnerable conversations sooner rather than later.Don't be afraid to ask her about her family or insecurities, especially if she brings it up first. You shouldn't be completely responsible for taking care of her, as your relationship is still developing. But if you want things to move to the next level, it's good to show that you're capable of listening to her sensitively.


It's good to be aware, from the beginning, if this girl seems independent enough to have a stable and steady relationship with you.If it feels like she needs someone to talk to at all times, there's a fear that she'll become overly attached and unable to operate independently. Make sure that you both feel comfortable in yourself to be alone. If you're both comfortable being alone, but just enjoy being with each other, you are setting yourself up for a more successful and healthy bond.
The same things apply to your initial interest in a potential partner. Make sure that you are interested in them exclusively, not just interested in having a person in your life to support you or be kind to you. Your potential relationship will be much more authentic if you make sure it is founded within the other person, not some idea about them.

, Not actively listening is one of the primary reasons why initial attempts at relationships fall flat.Nobody wants to feel that they’re unheard, and it’s definitely not to your benefit to commit halfheartedly to your first few conversations, or speak only about yourself. Make sure that you're practicing some of the key fundamentals of active listening:Make ample eye contact and smile.
Use mild conversation fillers and sounds to dictate that you’re interested. “Mhmm” and “right” can be far more helpful then you might think.
Ask open-ended questions to keep conversation flowing, This will prove that you’re not only listening, but that you’d like to hear more about whatever they’re currently speaking about.
Don't fidget with your hands or play with your clothes. These little distractions will make her think that you're uninterested or unable to hold a steady conversation.

, This is where it can get tough, and where it may very on a case-to-case basis. The hope is that at some point during your conversation, you’ve spoken about some shared interest that you can weave into a swapping of contact information. Some examples might include:


A song that you’ve spoken about. Say you’ll share it with her on Facebook.
A bar or restaurant that one of you, or both, enjoy. Suggest that you go together, and use that open-ended plan to get her phone number.
A great YouTube video that you’ve told her about. Everyone loves a good laugh, and you can send it to her and continue the conversation.
Your shared love of a particular sports team or television show. Suggest that you go to a game together or watch the show together.
Any of these options, and more, would work well, but if you don’t have any smooth transition, you can be totally transparent and simply ask for her number, saying that you’d love to meet up for coffee or dinner. She'll probably really appreciate your directness.

, Nobody wants to be kept waiting for too long. If you have time to send a text and you'd like to set up the date, you can be honest with yourself and send at that pace.If she’s given you her contact information, then there’s no point in letting it settle for too long; reach out to her later that day, or perhaps later that morning, to figure out your next plan.If you think you need a bit of time to prepare, or you don't have a spare moment to reach out properly, you can also slow the process down.

, It’s not easy for anyone to set up future plans, but it’s even tougher when the other person involved isn’t being totally responsive.


It's not helpful to spend too much time in the limbo between casual texting and setting the date up.Because you've already made a move toward a real, in-person date, don't waste too much time and energy being clever on text. Be simple and direct. That way, you can get some quality face-to-face time.
There are situations when you want to leave some space. If the girl isn’t positive about her weekend plans, and she tells you that she needs to figure out her schedule, don’t be too pushy. People have busy lives and need to plan around busy schedules.
Try not to think about too hard about the science of texting or Facebook messaging. Just because she hasn’t responded in two hours doesn’t mean she’s uninterested.She might even, like you, be a bit nervous about the date itself. Her anxiety may be keeping her from properly responding to the text, as she also doesn't know exactly what to say.

, She may not have time for dinner and a movie, so dinner should be more than enough for now. You should also be accommodating to her suggestions, as this proves that you’re more interested in spending time than the logistics of the plan itself.

, By giving you her contact information, she’s already agreed to have further contact. Therefore, don't be frustrated by the little troubles of planning the date itself. She’s interested in seeing you, so when you both work out the details, you’ll both be happy to be spending quality time together.

Believe in yourself.,
Always look your best.,
Rehearse.",How to Get a Beautiful Girl and Still Be Yourself2,"

You’re probably not going to approach a girl if you believe she’s going to turn you down. And if you do approach her, your lack of confidence will show. Having confidence in yourself gives you the courage you need to approach beautiful girls, and girls find it attractive.Think about all your positive qualities. Take a moment to list at least 10 reasons a beautiful girl would want to go out with you.
For example, think about how you can make her laugh, your great smile, how dependable you are, and your sense of adventure.

,

You never know when a beautiful girl is going to cross your path, so try to always look as good as possible.You don’t have to change your style or buy a new wardrobe or even dress up, but you do want to make sure you practice good hygiene and present yourself well.

Make sure your hair is combed, breath fresh, face clean.
Sometimes you might not look your best (maybe you just came from playing soccer) but you can still present yourself well by your attitude.

,

Practicing how you will approach a beautiful girl makes it easier to do once the time presents itself.Think about what you will say and how you will say it. Rehearse the exchange in your mind and out-loud until you are comfortable.

Practice in the mirror or with a close friend.
Video tape yourself to hear your voice tone and pace.
Try different variations of what you want to say.
For example, you might practice, “Can I contact you sometime?”; “Is it okay if I contact you?”; “How can I contact you?”; “Is it alright if I contact you?” and figure out which one feels most comfortable for you to say.

Try the gym.,
Volunteer somewhere.,
Go shopping.,
Hang out with friends and family.,
Chat online.",How to Get a Beautiful Girl and Still Be Yourself3," A lot of beautiful girls like to take care of their bodies and go the gym regularly. Visiting a gym near you is a great way to meet a beautiful girl (and get fit).You don’t have to hit the free weights if it’s not something you normally do, but you can walk around the track at the gym every once in a while.

, Beautiful girls are often beautiful inside as well as out and spend time volunteering and participating in community activities. Getting involved in charity and community events is a great way for you to meet beautiful girls and a way to support the community and raise awareness for a good cause.Participate in a breast cancer awareness marathon or mentor at-risk little kids.
Organize a food drive or other charity event.

, You are bound to see beautiful girls at the mall, boutiques, and even grocery store.Instead of ordering the things you need online, actually go to a store and shop. Not only will you stock up on the things you need, but you might meet the perfect girl for you in the checkout line.


If a beautiful girl is in line before or after you and she only has one or two items (and you can afford it) pay for her purchase.
You don’t have to necessarily buy anything, even browsing and window-shopping gives you the opportunity to meet beautiful girls.

, You never know where you might meet a beautiful girl so take advantage of every opportunity to get out and socialize. If your friends or family members are participating in something, then go and support them. If they invite you to an event, then attend. The bonus is that you will already have someone you know there with you.

, You can find tons of beautiful women on social networking sites and apps, forums, and chat rooms. Meeting them this way reduces some of the pressure of getting to know them face-to-face.


Be careful when you are meeting an online friend for the first time in-person. Make sure you let someone know where you are going, who you are going to be with, what time you should be home, etc.
Represent yourself honestly on your social network profile. Make sure all your pictures are actually of you and that things you post about yourself are true.

Treat her like a person.,
Don’t act jealous.,
Have fun together.,
Give each other space.",How to Get a Beautiful Girl and Still Be Yourself4," Don’t treat her like a trophy or a prize. Beautiful girls don’t like it when you treat them like that’s all they are — remember that she's a person with a personality and not an object for you to win or show off.

Show her that you know that she is more than just beautiful. Get to know her just like you would any other person.

Learn about her hobbies and talents.
Recognize that she has a mind and an opinion. Talk to her about what she thinks; you might learn something.

, Other people are going to think she’s beautiful, too, and some may even tell her. You can’t let this bother you or get mad unless they are rude about it.Acting jealous will make her feel like you don’t trust her. It may also cause unnecessary problems with other people. Be confident and remember that she chose to be with you.


Don’t feel like you have to say something every time someone looks at her.
If someone is disrespectful then you can stand up for her.

, Beautiful girls don’t just want you sitting there gazing at them. They want to spend time with you, get to know you, and enjoy the world with you. Talk about your common interests and do things together that you both enjoy.Plan a date exploring your neighborhood or city.
Take her to eat somewhere neither of you have been.
Play games together. You could play tag, kickball, or even a board or video game.

, You might want to spend all of your time with her, but don’t be clingy or smother her. Spending time apart gives you time to miss each other. It also gives you time to develop your own interests and have something to talk about when you are together.


Spend time with your friends and family so that those relationships stay strong.
Plan an un-date. A time where each of you plan to do something on your own.
Keep doing the things you were doing before you met her.

Have confidence.,
Be witty.,
Accentuate your best features.,
Compliment him.,
Find some common ground.,
Listen to him.,
Play the damsel in distress.,
Be yourself.",How to Get a Guy That Likes You to Ask You Out1," If you already know this guy likes you, it's just a matter of getting him to ask you out! Don't be too clingy.... Let this knowledge give you confidence. Embrace the strong, beautiful woman that you are and show this guy why he would be a fool to pass up the chance to ask you out!


Walk right up to him and start a conversation. Stand up straight, make eye contact. Voice your opinions. Guys love confident girls.
Overconfidence, on the other hand, is not an attractive quality. Be careful not to overdo it.;
, Displaying good wit demonstrates that you are intelligent and that you have a sense of humor, two things that many guys look for in a girl. If he finds you funny, he'll enjoy talking to you more and look forward to spending time with you. So if you can make him laugh, you're on to a winner.


Be able to laugh at yourself. This shows that you're easy-going and that you don't take yourself too seriously.
Go easy on the sarcasm and don't make jokes at the expense of other people.

, There's no point in denying it, physical attraction is a huge factor in any potential romance. With this in mind, take care to accentuate your best features. Don't be too modest. Everybody has something they like about themselves. Play it up!


Great smile? Flash those pearly whites! Bangin' curves? Use a belt to accentuate your waist. Beautiful eyes? The right eyeshadow can make the color pop! Find your best feature and work it, girl.
Don't go overboard. A full face of make-up, uncomfortably tight clothes or vertigo-inducing heels may have the opposite of the desired effect, especially if that's not your normal look. Stick to what works for you and gives you confidence.

, Newsflash! Guys like to be complimented just as much as girls do. Flattering him with a genuine compliment will achieve two things: it will not-so-subtly let him know that you're interested, while also giving him the warm and fuzzies, which will make him like you even more.


Not sure what to say? Tell him he has a cute smile or a great haircut. If he plays an instrument, compliment him on his musical abilities. If he's on a sports team, tell him you watched a game and were impressed by how well he played.
Keep the compliment simple and sincere and he'll really appreciate it, and take the hint.

, One of the major things that discourages a guy from asking you out in the first place is the fear that the two of you will have nothing in common and nothing to talk about. Show him that this couldn't be further than the truth. Ask him about his interests and hobbies, his family, his plans for the future - anything you could potentially bond over.


Don't fake an interest in something just to keep him happy. Pretending that you're an excellent bass player or that you love horror movies has the potential to backfire horribly once he invites you to jam with his band or accompany him to the latest Saw movie.
Even if you don't know anything about sailing or you're a terrible mini-golfer, all you need to do is show some interest and let him know that you're eager to learn. It might even give him an idea for your first date!

, Everybody likes a good listener, including your guy. Show him that you're interested in what he has to say. He'll be flattered by your attention and you'll also get to know him a little better. Let him talk and don't interrupt or talk too much and ask a lot of questions.


Many girls make the mistake of telling the guys they like about every tiny detail of their lives. Avoid doing this at all costs, you'll either overwhelm him, bore him, or scare him away. Maintain an air of mystery and listen more than you talk.
Stay engaged in the conversation, even if he's doing most of the talking. Ask thoughtful and stimulating questions. Maintain eye contact, smile, nod your head and use appropriate hand gestures to indicate interest and agreement.

, If you're feeling mischievous, try playing the damsel in distress. Guys can't resist helping a girl in need. Ask for help reaching something on a high shelf, or for advice on where to service your car. Then thank them and flash your most winsome smile. Works like a charm.


Don't play this card too often. Ask for too many favors and his patience will soon wear thin, along with his affections.
Don't play dumb. It's fine to ask for help when you need it, but don't intentionally act dumb just to have an excuse to ask. Remember: guys like smart girls, or at least the ones worth dating do.

, You've heard this little nugget of advice many times before, but that doesn't make it any less true. If you're to have any chance of a future together, this guy needs to like you for you - the real you, that is. Don't pretend to be someone you're not. Hang out with the people you usually do, dress the way you normally would, stay true to your opinions and beliefs. Let your winning personality speak for itself. If you are acting when you are around him, then your whole relationship will be fake, and you will eventually get tired of acting. Be you! Chances are, he will love your personality!

Let him know you're available.,
Send clear signals.,
Invite him to join you.,
Get friends involved.,
Stalk him (just a little).,
Drop hints.,
Ask him out.",How to Get a Guy That Likes You to Ask You Out2," Subtly let him know that you're not seeing anybody at the moment, but that you're open to the possibility. The one thing stronger than a guy's desire to ask a girl out is his fear of rejection. If you can relieve that fear then there will be nothing standing in his way. So make it clear that you'd say yes to him if he asked.

, Everyone knows that guys can be a little slow at reading the signs. So even if you feel like you've been sending out all the right signals, it might be time to up the ante a little. Smile at him, laugh at his jokes, touch his arm when you talk to him, sit close to him when possible - he should soon realize that he's the only one receiving such special attention.


Don't underestimate the power of body language! When you're around him, keep your body language open. Crossing your arms makes you seem unapproachable and closed off. If you don't know what to do with your hands, order a drink, or rest them on your lap. Try not to fidget.
Make lots of eye contact. If you're looking anywhere but at him while he's talking to you, you'll seem disinterested. Looking him straight in the eye and you'll appear confident and open.

, If you have plans to hang out with friends or to go to a party over the weekend, invite him to come along. With any luck, the two of you will spend the whole time together. It's not exactly a date, but it'll give you the opportunity to get to know one another a little better in a no-pressure environment.

, A trustworthy friend can be used to your advantage here. She can do some undercover digging and make comments or ask questions that you would feel uncomfortable with.


Ask her to talk to his friends and playfully inquire about when he's going to ask you on a date.
Get her to comment on what a good couple the two of you would make, in front of a group of people. It might be a little embarrassing at the time, but it will plant the idea in his brain.
Just make sure that you can count on her to be discreet. Otherwise, using a friend to do your dirty work can seem immature.

, Find out where he likes to hang out in the evenings, what his favorite coffee place is or where he goes to the gym. Then, if you happen to ""accidentally"" bump in to one another, you can strike up a conversation.


Remember, this tactic is to be used only once or twice. If you do it more often than that, he'll figure out that you're stalking him and you'll look like a creep.

, If he still hasn't worked up the courage to ask you out on a date, it might be time to take the initiative and give him a ready-made opportunity. Mention that there's a new bar in town that you'd be interested in checking out, or a new sci-fi film that you're dying to see. Hopefully he'll see his chance and offer to go with you. It's not the most romantic of proposals, but you'll still get your date!

, If you're tired of waiting around for this guy to summon up the nerve to ask you out, take matters into your own hands. This is the 21st Century after all. He'll be impressed by your confidence and won't be able to resist saying yes!

Don't get friend-zoned.,
Don't be obsessive.,
Don't be fake.,
Be patient.,
Don't be afraid of rejection.",How to Get a Guy That Likes You to Ask You Out3," Nothing spells death for a potential romance like getting put in the friend-zone. Sure, you want to be the cool girl who he can talk to and have a laugh with, but you don't want to become like ""one of the guys."" Show off your feminine side a little and make it clear, through words and body language, that you want to be more than friends.

, Letting him know that you're interested is perfectly fine, but don't take it to an extreme level. Showing up wherever he goes, hanging on his every word and bombarding him with calls and text messages is not the way to go. Maintain an air of mystery and always leave him wanting more.

, Never try to be someone you're not, just to get a guy's attention. You won't be able to keep it up, and if the girl he goes on his third date with is completely different from the girl he asked out, he'll be more than a little confused. If he doesn't like the real you, then he's not worth your attention anyway.

, Some guys are just as afraid of being rejected or getting their feelings hurt as girls are. Give the guy some time to build up his courage. Let him get to know you and see what a great person you are, he'll soon find his way.

, Maybe you're afraid that you misread the signs or that he'll change his mind once he gets to know you better. Try not to think this way. If you get the feeling that he likes you, then chances are you're right. Be positive - this could be the start of something beautiful!

Build a positive body image.,
Take care with your appearance.,
Exercise to boost your mood.",How to Get a Boyfriend If You Are Overweight1," It can be frustrating trying to meet the right guy. It might make you anxious, or even sad. That's normal, but those types of thoughts won't help you to find a boyfriend. Shift your mindset so that you focus on thinking positive thoughts.Release negativity. If you find yourself thinking, ""You'll never meet someone"", let that thought go. Replace it with a thought like, ""I'm proud of myself for putting in effort.""
Try a gratitude journal. Spend 5-10 minutes a day writing down things you are thankful for. This will help you reflect on the positive aspects of your life.
You could write things such as, ""I'm grateful that my best friend and I both got cast in the school play"" or ""I'm glad my parents trust and respect me."";
, Try to spend some time each day reflecting on what you most like about yourself. You can choose any attributes you like! You can give yourself compliments out loud, or you can try writing them down.For example, you might look at yourself in the mirror and say to yourself, ""You have a great smile!""
You might leave yourself a note on your laptop that says, ""You are an excellent writer!""
Try hanging a note in your locker that says something like, ""You're an awesome singer!""

, Conquering your goals is a great way to build your confidence. First, set specific goals. Remember to include both long term and short term goals. Then, make a plan to achieve each one.A short term goal could be, ""Avoid going out to eat for 1 week."" You can accomplish this goal by meal planning and packing lunches to take to work.
A long term goal might be, ""Get promoted in 1 year."" Write down specific ways to accomplish this, such as taking on more responsibility at work.
You could try, ""Make the honor roll this semester"" or ""Join a new after school club"".
Checking each goal off of your list will be a serious confidence boost!

, In today's society, it is easy to feel like you might be overweight. It can be hard to feel good about yourself when constantly faced with photos of super thin celebrities. Try to remember, these images are often airbrushed. And the ones that aren't are often not realistic for most people.Remember that everyone's body is different. People are different heights, builds, and everyone has a different metabolism.
Think about what you like about your body. For instance, ""I'm glad my legs are strong enough to let me go on these long hikes that I love.""
Tune out negativity. Don't listen to negative comments or any type of body shaming.
Find a female role model who looks real and healthy. This could be anyone from your mom to Amy Schumer.

, Sometimes you can boost your confidence by focusing on feeling great about the way you look. Spend some time each day carefully grooming and putting yourself together. You'll find it to be an instant mood booster!Wear clothes that make you feel confident. Do you feel you look best in jewel tones? Find a great ruby red sweater to wear to work.
Try a new hairstyle. Have you always wanted to try shorter hair? Go for it! Experimenting with new looks can be a lot of fun and help you feel great.
Polish your smile. A great smile is everyone's best accessory. Try using some whitening strips to brighten yours.
Don't worry about being trendy. Maybe the latest trend at school is high waisted jeans. Those just don't look good on everyone, and that's ok. Dress for your body type.
Ask a friend for advice. You can say, ""Do you think this tight sweater is the best look for me?"" Be open to feedback.

, You might dread going to the gym if you don't feel confident about your body. But exercise can actually elevate your mood. Working up a sweat is a great way to feel good about yourself and increase your energy.Meet with a trainer. Many gyms offer a complimentary introductory session with a pro. Get tips on the workouts that are right for you.

Use technology.,
Be outgoing.,
Be ready to meet someone.",How to Get a Boyfriend If You Are Overweight2," One of the most important parts of getting a boyfriend is to meet someone that you'd like to date. Before you head out looking for guys, take a few minutes to think about what you want. List the priorities that you're looking for in a potential boyfriend.Maybe common interests is your top priority. For instance, do you love to ride your bike? Make it a priority to find someone who also enjoys that activity.
You can also list important personality traits: honesty, compassion, and a great sense of humor are all good examples.

, Your friends and family can be a great resource in your hunt for someone to date. In fact, most people report that they met their partners through friends and family. Let your network of friends know that you are open to meeting new people.You can say, ""Hey, Stacy. I'm interested in meeting someone. Do you know any eligible guys that I might be interested in?""
You might try, ""Ellen, that guy that sits next to you in English seems nice. Can you mention my name to him and see if he sounds interested?""
Accept invitations to gatherings. You never know who will be at Aunt Maureen's BBQ!
If you are working on building a positive body image, it might feel more comfortable to meet people through your circle. After all, it's unlikely that your best friend would set you up with a jerk who makes negative comments about your appearance.

, These days, a large percentage of relationships begin online. Forget about the old stigmas! Use technology to your advantage and put yourself out there to meet the man of your dreams. Or even just someone fun to hang out with!Online dating might be a great way to go if you are feeling insecure about your appearance. You will usually have to post a picture. This is helpful, because anyone who approaches you already knows (and accepts) what you look like.
Always be honest in your profile. For example, don't post a picture of yourself from 10 years ago.
Use caution when meeting someone online. Don't give out personal information, such as your home address or where you work.
Reputable dating sites likely won't allow teens to use them. That's ok. You can still use technology to your advantage.
Come up with a clever Instagram post and tag your crush. You could also make a cute Snapchat and sent it to a group of friends--including the guy you like. You're sure to get his attention!

, When you meet someone, try to focus on the conversation. This will help you put aside any nagging concerns you might have about your weight. Instead, work on your people skills and make an effort to chat up that cute guy you see at the party.Be upbeat. Try not to discuss any depressing or controversial topics when you first meet someone.
Don't be afraid to make the first move. Casually walk up to someone at a party and say, ""I don't think we've met. Are you a friend of Katie's?""

, It's great to have a plan and work your network, but you really can meet a guy anywhere. Keeping your eyes open in everyday situations can allow you to see new possibilities everywhere you go. Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation at any of the following places:The grocery store. ""I love hummus. Is that kind good?""
In an airport lounge. ""Are you traveling for business or pleasure?""
At your local coffee shop. ""I haven't seen you here before. You must not have quite the caffeine addiction that I do.""

I don't feel like splitting desert. I'm trying to eat healthy.""
Remember to be yourself. And remember that your date is there because he is interested in you.

, As you get to know each other, spend time learning about the things you have in common. Don't be afraid to share your likes and dislikes. For example, you could say, ""I'm really into horror movies. Do you want to have a movie marathon with me next Friday?""Do things together. Activities are a great way to build a connection. Try something new together, like dance lessons or a cooking class. Learning is a great way to boost your confidence, too.

, When you're in the early stages of dating, try not to take things too seriously. Having fun is a key component to any healthy relationship. If you're not having fun with the guy, or if he makes you feel bad about yourself, it might be time to reconsider.Laugh together. Go to a comedy club or watch funny videos on YouTube.
Be playful. If you pass a playground, don't be afraid to take a turn on the swings.

, Communication is key in any relationship. To build your relationship, make sure that you effectively express yourself. Don't be afraid to share your feelings.For example, you could say, ""I'd really rather not spend the day at the pool. I'm not feeling very confident these days. But I'm working on that. Can we find another way to spend the afternoon together?""

After Class.,
Friend Me?",How to Get the Guy You Like in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Class to Notice You," Depending on the BJJ facility you train at, some pair you up around the same height/weight/belt color (margin of error) when you start to spar. It will help if your crush is around the same belt color/height/weight/probably age, so your coaches can pair you up with him/her more often, and then you are given more opportunities to talk to him/her :) If you aren't around the same color belt, height, etc, don't fret! You may be given some opportunities to spar with him/her. If for some reason, you aren't able to to spar with your crush, if both of you come early to class, and if you are allowed the mat, ask you crush if she/he would like to spar with you (make sure a coach is around to supervise).;
, If you are given the chance to talk to your crush, take it! Lets say both of you are sparring. You can ask your crush how to do a certain move (for example: how to do a proper triangle, omaplata, delihiba, etc). It will help a lot to ask your crush IF she/he is a higher belt color and/or is more advanced than you. If you are the one more experienced/higher belt color and you are asking how to do this move or that, it will make you seem somewhat ""stupid"" or ignorant. You may also look like you're trying to look stupid so your crush can ""feel smart"". I know it's weird, but your crush may take offense and may start to dislike you. But even if you are a lower ranking, don't ask too much or it will seem like you don't really know a lot. If there is an upcoming tournament/competition coming up, you can ask your crush on whether he/she is going. Other topics include what school he/she goes to (be careful when asking this question. You may come off as a stalker), what grade they're in, what activities does he/she do, etc.

, Everyone likes someone with a sense of humor. Try to crack a few jokes here and there. Not like those corny ""why did the chicken cross the road?"" jokes, but tell a funny story that happened to you, or something similar. Remember; nobody likes a stick in the mud.

, After doing all of what you could do, see how your crush reacts to your presence. Does he/she smile when he sees you? Does she blush? Or does she wrinkle her nose and try to avoid your gaze? Watch how your crush reacts to you and that'll most likely tell you whether they like you or not. Either that or he/she is a VERY good at acting. Try to look into more wikiHows and search ""How to know if a guy likes me"" or vice versa for you boys.

, Many of you may know the clock test. The clock test tests whether a person stares at you (most likely because they like you). It works like this: first, keep looking at a certain area of the room. When you're sure at a certain time that your crush or someone else is staring at you, quickly look at the clock for a second, then quickly look at the person. If he/she is looking at the clock too, then most likely he/she may have been staring at you.

, By any chance, if you think he/she is interested in you and all the signs say yes, then go for the next level: Ask him/she on a date. Or in anyone's case, it may not seem like a date at all. After BJJ class, if he/she has been waiting around for a bit, ask him/her if she or he has a ride. If she/he does, ask if she/he would like to go out for coffee or smoothies while she/he waits for their ride (see first what restaurants or cafes are around first). If you get a no for an answer, don't think of it as a complete rejection. She/he probably would love to come with you, but maybe his/her parents will pick him/her up soon.

, If you have a facebook, instagram, twitter, Myspace, etc., why not ask him/her if she has one of those social networks? If s/he says s/he has one, then follow/friend them. If not, then just shrug it off. But if you don't have the guts to ask, then search them up. So it won't be obvious that you like him/her, friend/follow other people at your bjj place so it'll look like you just want to be friendly and friend/follow them If your crush says s/he doesn't have a facebook, etc, or doesn't believe in it, or isn't allowed to have it for any reason one, please DO NOT persuade him/her to get one or tell him/her to just secretly make one so his/her parents won't find out. Even if s/he does make one after your persuasions, don't think so highly of yourself. S/he probably just made it to shut you up, and will think of you as someone who's immature, annoying, and irresponsible.

Strong, loving relationships are built on trust, honesty, and communication. You must be willing to meet these expectations if you are looking for someone to call ""the love of your life."";
, Online dating allows you to meet people that specifically fit your guidelines. About 15% of Americans have used a dating website, which gives you a large pool for potential partners. There are many websites and apps to choose from, including ones that are specific to your interests, religion, or occupation. Successful profiles have playful usernames, short but humorous summaries, and a recent photograph. , If you want to meet people in your area, seek out large local events where you might find someone with a common interest. One survey found that a high percentage of people reported meeting their significant other at sporting events, music festivals, and charity events. , The best way to meet people with common interests is through an organization or class. You can find a knitting circle, start ballroom dancing classes, or join a board game club. If you are passionate about a cause, volunteer at a charity. Check your local newspaper or a meet-up website to find social organizations in your area.

, Speed dating is a great way to meet many single matches in a short period of time. Awkward conversation is cut short as you are limited to a few minutes with each potential beau. If you both like each other, you can trade numbers, but if there no chemistry, you don’t have to flounder on an awkward first date.

, The beginning of a new relationship can be exciting, but first dates can be awkward, especially if you don’t know your date very well yet. Meeting up for coffee or drinks is an easy way to maintain a relaxed atmosphere while getting to know the other person. The first few dates you go on can be an important foundation for the rest of your relationship, and making sure the other person is comfortable will increase the odds that they will want to go on more dates.

, Movies, plays, and other performances may be fun, but they prevent you from getting to know your date. For first dates, try dinner, coffee dates, drinks, or activities like bowling, visiting a museum, or going to a local fair. These allow you to talk and get to know each other, an important basis for a long-lasting relationship.

, While you should not initiate physical contact that your date is uncomfortable with, light touching around the arms and shoulders can signal interest and enhance attraction. Try sitting next to your date instead of across from them. Gently touch their shoulders as you are talking to them or brush against them if you are walking together. If the other person draws away or does not return the contact, it is a sign they are uncomfortable with the touch. Do not continue physical contact. Furthermore, this may be a sign of disinterest.

, While you might be shy around a new date, making eye contact not only boosts attraction but it can make you more memorable to your date. Extended eye contact can even make you feel like you’re in love with someone. Keep their gaze for several seconds, and remember to blink!

, If you are looking to call someone the ""love of your life,"" an emotional bond is key. Rushing the physical side of a relationship does not necessarily prevent an emotional bond, but it can make the emotional landscape more difficult to navigate. Couples that have strong friendships with one another also have higher sexual satisfaction and romance in their relationships , In the early stages of a relationship, you can express your interest in a date by laughing at their jokes, complimenting their positive qualities, and asking thoughtful questions about their interests. , Avoid touchy topics like religion or politics. Certain subjects like hobbies, travel, jobs, and activities are great conversation starters and can reveal much about your date. Good questions include:


What is your favorite book/movie/TV show? Have you seen the latest ____?
Do you have pets? Are you a dog person or a cat person?
Do you play sports? Do you like to compete in any local leagues?
What do you do for a living? Do you enjoy your job? How did you get into that field?
What is your dream vacation? Do you like to travel? Where is the most exciting place you’ve ever been?

, Especially as your relationship develops, listening to your partner will strengthen your bond. Make eye contact and don’t interrupt. Rephrase what they said by using “I” statements, e.g. “I understand that you don’t like this because…” or “What I hear is that you are struggling with…” , If your partner is closing themselves off physically, it could be a sign that something is wrong. Watch to see if they are frequently crossing their arms, avoiding eye contact, or facing their body away from you. Their voice may also be louder and more confrontational. These might be signs for you to open up dialogue.

, Open with a line about how much you love them before gently bringing up what is bothering you. Avoid blaming them, and don’t use phrases like “you must” or “you should.” Allow your partner to respond to start a strong dialogue.


For example: “Can we talk? I love you very much, but I have been struggling lately with _____. This makes me feel _____.”
Emphasize to your partner that you want to work on the relationship using “we” phrases. “How can we work on this?” “Is there a way for us to solve this?”

, If your love is really for life, you will need to maintain it so that the passion does not fade. Even when you are married with children, find time to be alone with each other. Go on interesting dates. Try new activities together. These will increase bonding throughout your life. , Lack of communication is a major source of tension in relationships. Disagreements and arguments are a part of every relationship, but communicating with your partner when you are unhappy can smooth over the bumpy aspects of your love. Don’t bottle up your feelings inside. Be honest with your partner, and be accepting when they are honest with you. , Just because you are together forever does not mean that you have become the same person. Boundaries are an important way to keep a healthy space for yourself while forming a framework that encourages communication and support. You can maintain your own social life and hobbies, and you don’t have to share your passwords or social media accounts with your significant other. Just as your significant other should respect your boundaries, remember to respect theirs. If they have a passion or hobby that you don’t share, let them pursue it.

, If you are making major decisions together, make sure that both voices are being heard in the relationship. There should be an equal power dynamic between both partners, and this means that sometimes you will have to compromise or even concede to the other partner. At the same time, your partner should be doing the same for you. , Identify your needs and take care of them. Practicing healthy habits in other aspects of your life can promote a healthy relationship. Exercise, eat healthy foods, meditate, get plenty of sleep, socialize, and work towards success in your job. By taking care of yourself, you can better take care of others. "

Be patient.,
Let yourself be vulnerable.,
Focus on the best parts.,
Fake it until you make it.",How to Make Yourself Love Someone1," Remember that love doesn't always happen at first sight. Give yourself the chance to feel comfortable with this person. Notice the stirrings of affection as they bloom within you, slowly, like the coming of spring. Separate love from lust, and try to truly appreciate a person.

, You may find it hard to truly love someone if you don't allow yourself to be honest and authentic around them. Open yourself up. Share your dreams, your fears, your doubts, and your joys with this person. Create a genuine and powerful human connection.

It can be terrifying to open yourself up in this way. Be brave. Show the person your scars, your tears, your deepest thoughts – though perhaps not all at once.

, People are complicated, and you be simultaneously attracted to and repelled by the various aspects of someone's personality. It will be much easier to love them if you fix your attention on the positive things rather than the negative things. If the negatives are relatively minor, then this might be a good decision. If the negatives are honest-to-goodness deal-breakers, however, then it may be unwise to ignore them.

, Some research suggests that the act of pretending to be in love with someone can actually trigger true feelings of intimacy and connection. If you feel comfortable doing so, try to act as though you are in love with this person. Use your imagination and see where it takes you.

Be careful with this one. Make sure you do not pretend for so long that you lose your way. Do your best to live authentically.
This method may be more effective if the other person is doing the same thing. It can be hard to foster love unless both parties are fully engaged.

Gaze into each other's eyes.",How to Make Yourself Love Someone2," Arthur and Elaine Aron are a social psychologists who have spent nearly 50 years studying how and why people fall in love. Through their research, the couple developed a list of three dozen questions that can purportedly foster deep intimacy between two people in a lab setting. These questions may not solve your problem – but the method has also been shown to rekindle romance in long-term couples and spark connection between relative strangers., Explain the experiment to your partner or the person with whom you want to fall in love. Agree that you will commit to sitting down together until you've answered all 36 questions. The whole process should take a few hours.Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?

If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?

, Once you have each answered all of the first 12 questions, reevaluate the experiment. If you're still feeling comfortable with this person, continue to the next 12 questions. Be aware that the questions are designed to gradually prompt deeper and more personal answers.If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?

If you're still feeling positively about the experiment, move on to the third set of questions and settle in for an even deeper emotional experience.


Make three true “we” statements each. For instance, “We are both in this room feeling ... “

Share a personal problem and ask your partner’s advice on how he or she might handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen.

, Research has shown that deep, sustained eye contact can go a long way toward establishing intimate feelings between two people.Eye contact alone may not make you fall in love with someone, but it is certainly a piece of the puzzle. If you want to grow closer with someone, suggest that you try to look into each other's eyes for four minutes straight.


If you don't feel comfortable stating your intention, try to make meaningful eye contact whenever you can – ideally during conversation or during an intimate moment."

Be honest with yourself.,
Understand the complexity of love.,
Make sure that you want this.",How to Make Yourself Love Someone3," Consider why you want to be in love with this person, and make sure that you want to do so for healthy reasons. Remember that you do not need to love someone just because he or she loves you. Do not try to force love for the sake of convenience, or social propriety,

, Love comes about through a series of variably conscious and subconscious choices. The intense feelings of attraction and attachment are the product of subtle hormones and pheromones – chemicals that act behind the scenes and make us more or less likely to fall for someone.On some level, you may be able to set up the right conditions for love. On the other hand, the actual feelings may be beyond your control. Try to keep perspective.
Study love. Understand why people in love feel the way they do: how attraction and intimacy fire up the dopamine and serotonin receptors in our brains and make us emote so intensely. If you know the science of love, you might have a better idea of how it comes about.

, Perhaps you have fallen out of love with a long-term partner, and you want to rekindle the romance. Are you doing this because it is what you want, or are you doing it for the sake of stability: children, friends, or a mortgage? Perhaps you have been set up with an arranged marriage, or you have fallen into a serious relationship with someone that you aren't sure about. Social consequences aside, remember that you do not need to make yourself love anyone! Give yourself permission to honestly and organically discover the love that you deserve.

Call him by his name.",How to Get an Older Guy to Like You," The age of consent varies from state to state, so know what the legal age is where you live. If you are under the age of consent, do not try to date someone who is over the age, as that can create difficulties in setting boundaries and could potentially have criminal implications.;
, Older guys will have more experiences and freedoms than younger girls. They might drive a car, have less parental supervision, or have already had sexual relationships. Know ahead of time what you’re comfortable with and stay true to that instead of worrying about what he wants.


Be confident about telling him what you are and aren’t okay with. It’s better to know that your expectations are different are early on rather than staying quiet and finding yourself in a compromising situation. Speaking your mind and establishing boundaries are signs of maturity that will make him respect you more.
You don’t have to wear skimpy clothing to get his attention. If you’re comfortable, wear clothes that flatter your figure and make you feel confident, but aren’t overly sexy or revealing. You want the guy to be interested in who you are, not just your body. Leave room for mystery., While some guys may like girls who seem younger, others prefer girls who act more mature for their age. Being mature doesn’t mean being dry, serious, or boring— you don’t have to pretend to be someone you’re not. Typically, behaving maturely means being confident, comfortable, and cool. Girls mature faster than boys, so you may already be on the same maturity level as the guy you have your eye on.


Avoid being clingy and following him around everywhere. Doing this might make you seem like more of a little sister than a romantic interest.
Do not act needy, as this is a sign of low self-esteem. Neediness is unattractive because it demands constant attention, reassurance, and affirmation from another person which can be annoying. Wanting to be with somebody is very different from needing to be with somebody.Don’t brag about how “experienced” you are. Trying to seem mature in this way actually has the opposite effect.
Being confident in who you are is mature and extremely attractive.

, Go right up to him and introduce yourself if he doesn’t know who you are yet. Say: “Hi, I’m (your name),” then “And you are?” or “Who are you?” if you want to be a bit more playful and brazen. Repeat his name to help you remember it and let him know you are attentive: “Hey, Ryan, it’s really nice to meet you,” or “Oh, Sergio, I love that name!” You go to the same school so you have plenty in common to keep it from being awkward. You can break the ice by referencing how you’ve noticed him: “I see you walk past my gym class every day and I wanted to put a name to the face!” Start talking to him on Facebook or other social media., If you have the same lunch period, talk to him in line or, if you already know each other, sit at his table. If you have a class together, sit near him so you can talk easily or ask him a question about the subject. Get to know his friends so there might be an opportunity to hang out outside of school.

, Ask him questions and listen. If you don’t know each other very well yet, keep it simple with questions like “How was your day?” or “What do you like to do on the weekends?” Find out if he plays a sport, what kind of music he likes, what he likes to do in his free time. You don’t have to interview him or blast him with questions, but make sure you’re not just talking about yourself, which is easy to do. Find ways to show him that you remember what he’s told you. Wish him luck on his game or ask him if he’s listened to his favorite band’s new album. Don’t pry into personal details like his religion or family dynamic too soon, keep it light and playful. Find out what you have in common and let the conversation develop naturally.


If you’re struggling to start a conversation, try making a comment that ends in a question. “I saw the basketball team got new uniforms, do you like them?” or “It looks like it’s gonna rain, doesn’t it?”

, Keep your flirting playful and fun, not forceful and you’ll make him feel comfortable and want to be around you.

, If he’s across the room, make eye contact with him. Don’t stare, but glance up occasionally and catch his eye. For an extra sexy gaze, look up, down, then up again through your lashes. Make eye contact when you’re talking to him, but not so much that it feels like you’re staring him down.

, You don’t need to grin ear-to-ear; giving a warm, genuine smile will make you seem approachable and friendly. Smile with your eyes so that your whole face lights up.

, We all love a bit of flattery, but make sure that it’s objective so that you don’t seem too eager or obsessive. An objective compliment is one that states the facts rather than your opinion, which is subjective.


Subjective: “I really love your dimples.” “I think you have the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen.” Complimenting in this fashion gives away the fact that he’s already won you over and doesn’t have to work for your attention.
Objective: “You played great in the game last night” (if he actually did play well). “ You have great eyes.” This type of compliment is based on observation and lets your crush know that you notice them, but will make him wonder how interested you are. Not coming on too strong will keep him wanting more.

, If you already know each other call him by a name that’s cute yet masculine and will be personal between the two of you., You want to boost his confidence, but not come off as fake by laughing at a joke that’s obviously lame., Touching a person is a way to indicate that you’re comfortable with him. If you’re laughing at one of his jokes, briefly put your hand on his arm. Make your contact casual and seem almost accidental. Walk next to him a little too closely. Give him a gentle, playful nudge when you pass him in the hall. A light smack on the arm can be silly and fun, but don’t push or punch him, even if you’re just joking around. Hurting him is not flirtatious. The point is to be attentive, not aggressive.

, It’s said that the sweetest sound is the sound of one’s own name. Using his name when you talk to him creates intimacy. “I like your new shoes, Adam.”

Make a move during a movie.,
Make a move when you say goodbye.,
Make a move on a walk.",How to Make a Move on a Girl1," Whether you're in a theater or at home on a couch, a movie can be a great moment to instigate physical contact. Take her hand lightly. If she likes you, she'll hold your hand back, or give your hand a squeeze. If she doesn't, she'll move her hand away.


If she holds your hand or moves closer to you, you can put an arm around her and see how she reacts to that. Ask if it's okay if you can't tell what she wants.;
, Saying goodbye is a great moment to make a move, because there is a quick exit strategy for both of you. This is probably the best move to make on a first date. Make sure it's clear that you're leaving, so she doesn't feel pressured. If you're driving, drop her off and walk her to her door. Make it clear you don't expect to be invited in.


Go for a hug and a kiss on the cheek first. If she moves away, squeezes you quickly and lets go, or seems otherwise uninterested, thank her for the nice evening and leave. If she holds on, moves closer, or offers you her lips, kiss her.

, If you're on a date and you're taking a walk together, or going from one place to another, you can initiate some low-stakes public intimacy. Try holding hands, putting an arm around her shoulders or waist, or just touching her arm. She'll probably move away if she's uncomfortable, but ask to make sure.

"
"
Talk to her.,
Ask her to dance.,
Ask her if she'd like a drink or a snack.,
Play it cool.",How to Make a Move on a Girl2," If volume allows, strike up conversation. If it's absolutely too loud to talk, trying can at least be humorous. If you're getting along, ask her if she wants to step outside or find a quieter spot. What you talk about isn't too important. Make sure you ask lots of questions, so that she gets talking. If you're talking most of the time, she'll probably think you like yourself more than you like her., If you like dancing, or don't mind dancing, you can ask while the music is fast. Dance casually, separately at first. You can offer to twirl her or otherwise dance while touching in a friendly way after a song. When the music gets slow, hold your arms out or ask if she'd like to dance.


If you can't dance, or have been talking and feel ready, ask her to join you for a slow song.
You can hold her close during a slow song, as long as she seems comfortable. Don't squeeze her or force her against you, however. Ask if she's good when you're in position.
If the dance is going well, you can try moving your face close to hers and wait for her reaction.
Don't grab her on a whim. Even if she's into you, she might not be into blatant public groping.
Ask first. Don't just start dancing against someone you don't know.

, Parties can be difficult to navigate. Skillfully obtaining something for her that she wants will make you look competent and thoughtful. Unless you have actually figured out what she wants, make sure you ask first. Handing someone a drink they don't want can make them feel pressured or misunderstood.

, You don't need to make a physical move immediately. Make conversation and leave a good impression. Get her number or give her yours. If you're nervous, chat with your friends or remind yourself you are not obligated to score. Don't drink to combat nerves, or you'll just get nervously drunk.

Look for signs of romantic interest.,
When in doubt, ask.,
Don't worry about the ""friend zone."",
Make a move that feels natural.",How to Make a Move on a Girl3," While there's no definite way of knowing how she feels about you without explicitly asking, you can get a better idea of how she feels by paying attention to how she behaves around you.


Notice how she dresses on a regular basis compared to how she dresses when the two of you spend time alone. If she dresses up when she is with you, then she might be attracted to you.
Pay attention to whether she leans in to you when she is speaking and whether she touches your arm or leg while she is talking to you. These are possible signs that she is flirting.
If she always chooses to sit on the opposite side of the couch or pulls away from you when you try to hug her or dance with her, then she's probably not interested.
Notice how she looks at you. Does she smile at you? Do you catch her looking at you when you're in a group?
Does she laugh at your jokes when other people don't? She may be laughing because she likes you and your goofy moods cheer her up.
Check to see that she wants to be alone with you. If she wants you to make a move on her, then she will suggest doing activities that allow the two of you to be alone.
If she only wants to spend time with you when others are around, then she might prefer your friendship as it is.

, With a friend, you really don't want to mess up by coming on too strongly. As your friend, she cares about you, and she might be scared of hurting your feelings. If you can't tell whether or not she likes you from checking the signs, you should ask before you make a move.


Asking can be just as fun and sexy as going for it. Enjoy the awkwardness. Ask in person, or write a note.
You can say any of the following: ""I think about you a lot. I like you. I've been trying to figure out if you like me back, or if you're just a really great friend. It's cool either way, but—if you like me, let's go out sometime.""
Add some compliments. Go for romantic rather than sexual, as you don't want to make her uncomfortable if she just wants to be friends. Say she has beautiful eyes, a great sense of humor, and a special way about her you just can't put into words.
Be prepared for a yes! Have a date plan. Ask her somewhere beautiful, where you can be alone without the rest of your friends showing up or tagging along.

, The ""Friend Zone"" is an idea that was made up by guys to scare other guys. It has nothing to do with how girls actually feel. You don't have to rush it: once you know you like a girl, you can make either make a move or tell her how you feel.

, Once you have established that your friend is attracted to you, your move might happen naturally. If you feel the need to plan, though, try extending one of your normal friendly interactions. Sometimes friends who are mutually attracted get into weird physical habits, like always hugging more than necessary, or giving each other massages, or wrestling. If you're doing something like that, try stopping the action and making eye contact.


If you always hug, make your move by holding on. If she freezes or moves away, let her go. If she gets closer or holds on to you tighter, you can try for a kiss.
Check in after. If you make a physical move, make sure she is enthusiastically consenting.

"
"
Establish that she is capable of consent.,
Establish enthusiasm.,
Ask for each step.,
Check in after you've made your move.,
Back off if she says ""no"" or doesn't seem excited.",How to Make a Move on a Girl4," Consent means that she can legally agree to sexual activity.Sexual activity includes anal, vaginal, and oral sex, as well as touching, watching porn, kissing, or showing parts of the body. She can only give consent if she is sober, awake, and mentally able. Someone who is drunk, high, passed out, or mentally incapacitated cannot give consent.


Consent must be freely given. Someone who is being pressured cannot give consent. If she is scared of you, or someone else is pressuring her, or if you are older, or if you have any power over her, she cannot give consent.
If you are more than two years older or younger than her, it may be illegal for you to make a move on her, or for her to make a move on you.Check the laws of age of consent in your state before you make a move on someone who isn't your age.

, Once she has given verbal consent (from ""yes!"" to ""absolutely! yes! totally! that's what I want!""), check for physical signs and listen to her tone of voice. She should initiate sexual activity, respond to your touch, and seem relaxed and excited. If she does not respond, she might not actually be into it. If she turns away or moves away from you in any way, she might be telling you ""no.""Stop immediately if she gives any signs of withdrawing consent.
If she seems hesitant, but says she is ready, try going slowly.
Make a game of it. Take turns initiating touch, or have her tell you what to do.

, Before you kiss, touch, or otherwise make a move on someone, ask if they would like you to do it. This can be awkward, but it can also be fun, and it can save you both from a really bad experience. Once you know she likes you, you can ask in a sexy way.


For instance, say ""May I kiss you?"" ""Can I hold you?"" ""I'd like to touch you there. Would you like that?""
Remember, consent can be withdrawn any time. If she said ""yes"" to one thing, it doesn't mean ""yes every time"" or ""yes to everything else."" Keep checking in.

, Once you have done something new, ask how it feels. Say ""does that feel good?"" or ""do you like that"" or ""should I keep going?"" Even when you're doing something you've done before, it's good to check in. Something that feels good one day might not feel good the next., Take no for an answer. If she says no, back off. If she says something like ""not now"" or ""maybe later,"" that also means no. Back off if she doesn't say yes.Once you've made your move, and she doesn't encourage you, back off. She'll tell you if she changes her mind.

If you have an artistic talent, invite him to see you play music or see your art in a gallery. He will see how others are impressed with you and feel like being with you makes him special.
If you have a great sense of fashion, make plans to attend an event where you can dress up. He will see how you stand out ahead of the rest, and feel proud to be arm-in-arm.

, This is different than ""playing hard to get."" Let him know that you have very discerning taste. You have a lot of interest from others and people available to you, but you don't like just anyone. You have chosen him.

Repeat what he has said back to him using phrases like, ""What I hear you saying, is...""

, In a relationship, men fear being laughed at as much as women fear rape and murder.While you certainly can laugh at his amazing sense of humor, this should make him feel smart and funny. Never tear him down or belittle him, but show support and respect.

, Allow him to spend time following his passions and dreams. Celebrate his successes and help him through the hard times. If you prove you are there for him, you will be the one he turns to in these extreme times, and the one he wants to share these life events with.

, Understand that he may want to spend time with friends and that this does not discount your relationship. Beware of projecting a problem onto the other person. This happens when, instead of dealing with our own internal anxiety or paranoia, we externalize that problem and blame the other person.Ask yourself if these thoughts and feelings are justified.
Find the root of where the problem is coming from.
Reassure yourself that this is your own problem, and that means you can control it.

, Everything is not always going to be perfect. Relationships get hard and life is even harder. When he is going through a hard time, handle it with calm comfort. When the two of you run into trouble, address it calmly and head on.

, Being with you should make him want to be a better person. Keep doing all of the impressive things you are good at, which make you an incredible human being. Set goals and go for them. Watching you achieve your goals will be an inspiration as you encourage him to achieve his own.

Do you want to have children?
What are your religious beliefs?

, Once the initial romance begins to fade and become comfortable, so couple disengage from each other.Don't become too comfortable in the relationship that you forget to show affection and have fun together.

, Don’t hold a grudge or keep track of shortcomings. You will need to actually forgive him if he makes a mistake. Punishing him will only drive him away., Society sets all kinds of standards for what a relationship should like like and how we should behave. Your relationship is your own.

Flirt smoothly.,
Make your move.",How to Make a Hot Girl Like You," Wearing the right clothes will make you appeal to your object of affection. Don't change your personal style too much. Massive changes in fashion will seem put on. You do, however, want to ""dress to impress"" more often than not.You'll want to keep color and cut in mind when you're getting dressed. Pick colors that show off the aspects your personality that you want her to see. It's no secret that red is the color of love and passion.Throwing on a red article of clothing could be the perfect way to catch her attention.
The cut of your clothing is also crucial. You definitely don't want your clothes to be overly baggy, as that won't show off your form. Wearing clothes that are too tight, however, may bunch up awkwardly on your body.
Dress pants should be straight fit and not too tight. Jeans look better when on the slim side.;
, You always want to keep your hair in control. No strand should be out of place.Use the proper styling product to nail that ""freshly-cut"" look. Remember that each hairstyle requires a different style of product.


For shorter styles, try a pomade or wax. While pomade will keep your hair nicely in place, a wax will add a bit of additional shine and control.
If you want to go for a more disheveled look, try using a mud or fiber. This will give you the illusion of a ragged appearance without your hair actually being unobtainable.
Creams work well in longer hair, making your potentially ragged appearance more conservative.
While pomades, waxes, muds, and fibers should be used in dry hair, a cream must be applied in wet hair. It's very easy to apply these styling products. Take a small amount of product, rub it in your hands, and comb it through your hair. Style to fit your preference.

, You always want to keep clean, but when you're impressing a girl, cleanliness is crucial. Good personal hygiene shouldn't be much of a chore, but you want to make sure that you have all your bases covered. You'll smell better while preventing yourself from getting sick.Take regular baths and showers. Some people don't need to shower every day. This is fine, but you should always use deodorant. Bad body odor is a huge turn-off, so don't make that mistake. Girls don't like a guy who can't clean himself.
Brush and floss at least twice a day. It'd be ideal to take care of your dental health after every meal, especially if you're about to talk to a girl. This is often tough, however, so don't sweat it. You definitely want to brush at the beginning and end of each day.

, Finding the right cologne can transform you. It will make you feel more confident and greatly enhance your viability to women.Cologne definitely has to be applied in moderation. You don't want to drown yourself in any musk.


People should only be able to smell you within your ""scent circle,"" which refers to the space within an arm's length from your body. That way, your smell isn't being picked up from a distance. An aggressive scent can be very unsettling.
Apply all colognes from a six-inch distance from your body. You don't want the fragrance to form a puddle on your skin.
Above all, remember that cologne cannot replace proper hygiene. It's an additional touch that should be used sparingly and under the right circumstances. If you're avoiding showers and masking your bad scent with cologne, you'll never impress a girl.

, The best way to impress those around you begins from within. You must gain confidence with others by learning to love yourself. When you're practicing self-love, you'll be more social and more willing to share yourself with people.Not practicing self-love will lead to a more solitary, reclusive existence.


When you have compassion for yourself, you'll always keep your best interests at heart. Being supportive to yourself is crucial in romantic endeavors. If things don't work out in your attempts to get a girl, you won't be crushed by defeat.
It's key, when feeling down, to take action. Keep note of your goals and aspects of yourself that you're working to improve When you've figured out your goals, make small substeps to these goals and accomplish them. Working on a smaller scale will help your dreams seems more attainable.
Even if you fail in the process, you'll likely become stronger. Accepting failure is key to strong self-love.

, It's been proven that regular exercise will make you look healthier. It will also improve your confidence. Know that self-confidence can be learned, so your attempts to better yourself will not be wasted.If you haven't spent much time working out, it may be difficult to start. Incorporate trips to the gym into your weekly schedule. If you force it into your routine, it will be much easier to get yourself there. Like all habits, you need repetition before it becomes natural.
Even if you can't lift much when you first start exercising, don't get discouraged. While looking good will help you attract a girl, you can start by working on your confidence. If you feel accomplished after a long day at the gym, you'll notice your self-worth improving.

, You'll be more likely to succeed if you enter a conversation boldly. If you're feeling nervous about starting off your conversation with a girl, it's good to think about some potential openings.These should still feel natural coming from your voice.


Starting with a broad question helps. These open-ended conversation starters open up many different avenues for a conversation to follow. Ask her about herself in a creative way, rather than the obvious, ""Where are you from?""
It's good to not only ask her about herself, but also let her speak about something she's passionate about. Ask about a project that she's been working on, or what she does for her job.
Ask about a highlight of her day or week. Speaking positively about the past ensures that you get the conversation started in a successful way.
Thinking about potential conversation topics is useful in gaining confidence, but don't fall back on these prompts when speaking to her. You need to listen and remain receptive to changes in the conversation.

, Before you ask her out, you'll have to start a conversation. Approach her with a positive, confident energy. It's good to start by making brief eye contact.After you've made this connection, flash her a quick smile.


Once you've made this initial connection, think about your body language. Make sure that you are open and receptive to her, rather than hunched over and closed off. Your openness will prove your interest in.
Make sure that you're listening well. Empathic listening doesn't imply that you agree completely with the other person.It does, however, imply that you try to fully understand a person emotionally, behaviorally, physically, and intellectually.

, You want to get to know her quickly. When you're trying to ask a girl out, you have to be more active than you would starting a friendship. Think less about yourself and more about her.


Lead off with a thought-provoking question.These intriguing questions will get her to open up. The more weird, specific facts that you know about her, the better. You'll have more topics to discuss.

, Without being cheesy, throw some nice compliments her way. A good compliment must be honest and genuine. Studies show that a personality-centric compliment works much better than a compliment relating to looks or skills.If you think she has a great sense of humor, tell her. She might be very caring, and your acknowledgement of this attribute will certainly endear you to her.
While compliments work well, don't be desperate with them. If you keep throwing out praise, your positive words will lose their impact. Tell her earnest compliments without being overbearing.
Whatever you do, don't be too intimate with compliments during your first conversation. This has the chance to backfire and make you look creepy.

, Learning how to flirt is crucial in impressing a potential romantic partner. When you flirt, you're suggesting the potential for romance between you and the other party.The flirting game must have suspense and ambiguities built into it. You want to keep her guessing without leading her astray. Flirting should be playful, however, so don't overthink it.
Keep your eyes out for flirtatious non-verbal cues. Women are more likely to begin the initial flirtation, but they often wait for men to make the official ""first move."" If she's teasing you with a look, you don't want to miss it.
Some non-verbal flirtations might include giggling, smiling, or laughing and nodding. If she's responding positively to you and you recognize these cues, she's probably flirting.

, If you're hitting it off, then you'll want to ask her out. While chatting and flirting will give you a chance to get to know her, you want to establish your interest by setting a time to see her in the future.Think of some activities for your date. Movies and dinner can work, but they aren't always the most creative options. If you've gauged her interests by asking her about herself, then ask her to do something that fits what she likes.
If you've acquired her number, don't get in a trap of texting. Texting can be great in setting up a date, but you need to meet in person. This will prove that she's worth your time.

She won't be into kissing you if all she sees are dirty gym socks and empty soda cans. So, set up some candles, some flowers, and some wine (if you're into drinking wine, that is). Don't go over the top or you'll look like you're trying too hard--just do enough to get the girl in the mood to kiss you.;
, This means don't look like a slob or smell like a yeti. It doesn't really matter what you wear -- jeans and a T-shirt are fine -- but make sure you look decent. The girl should see that you've put some effort into your appearance. If you haven't put any effort into your look, then why should she put effort into kissing you?


Make sure to shower and to generally smell clean before you start kissing.
Take it easy on the cologne. Too much cologne = trying too hard.

, Good places to start include on a couch, in a car, or even under the stars at a picnic table. One thing to keep in mind is the awkwardness of people walking in on you, so make sure your parents/siblings/friends aren't in the next room. The more privacy you have, the more comfortable the girl will be.


The bed may not be the best spot to make out as some girls may feel awkward or nervous if you begin there, since she may think you want more than just kissing.
Control your temperature. Keep it a little cold so she wants your touch, but not so cold that she's shivering and uncomfortable. If it's too hot, though, that's even worse--she won't want to turn up the temperature any more, if you get the drift.

, Music is optional, but sparks fly a lot more when there is some good background music playing softly or music that you and your girl like. If you want to play some music, you should make sure you know what type of music your girl likes (ex: screamo, heavy metal, and alternative rock are probably not the best types of music to set the mood, unless you know your girl likes it).


If you plan on playing some music, you should have it queued up an ready to go, so you don't waste time scrambling to find something romantic.

, You can't just go from discussing your math homework to French kissing; there needs to be some lead up first. Moving in the direction of kissing can be a little awkward if you don't know what you're doing, but worry not. Flirting is easy; the goal of flirting is to make a girl have fun. This can be accomplished by joking around, wrestling, teasing, or dancing, but remember too much can be too much, so tread lightly.


You can pretend to dance with the girl to make her laugh, or just gently touch her elbow.
You should make some kind of physical contact before you kiss, however small. You can't just lean in and kiss the girl without touching her at all.

, During the process of flirting, you will find yourself physically closer to her and/or looking into her eyes. Stop what you're doing and gaze into the girl's eyes, smiling a little to let her know that you want to kiss her. You don't have to make creepy especially long eye contact; just look into her eyes long enough that she knows you want something more. If you're feeling extra suave, you can even reach out and move a strand of her away from her face.

, Lean your body closer to hers and gently pull her chin towards yours. Don't pucker up your lips like you're kissing your Aunt Sally, but keep your mouth in a natural position. Now bring your lips closer to hers until they are almost touching. Don't hesitate or pull back.

, Let your lips touch, and keep them there for a passionate second or two. Don't kiss her head on, but try to tilt your head slightly to one side so that your noses don't bump and so you don't get in each other's ways. The more passionately you kiss, the more dramatically your heads may tilt. You can take it slow and soft and build your way up to kissing her in more intimate ways. First, just get the lay of the land. Does she seem to like it? Is she responding well? Is she pulling you closer to her? If so, then deepen the kiss.


While you're kissing her, make sure to keep your hands on her body instead of awkwardly hanging them at your sides. They don't have to roam too much, but she should feel like you're really embracing her while you're kissing.

, Mix it up to keep things interesting. You might want to add variety to your kisses, like the French Kiss or any others you know. Keep it slow; many people like to go slow and makes it more passionate. If you and your girl feel comfortable go on the next step, experiment with yourself, touch her, let her touch you.


If you're French kissing, slowly slip your tongue into her mouth and make sure that she does the same. You can either touch the tips of your tongues or put your tongue above or below hers as you explore each other's mouths.

, Don't be afraid to talk to her a little bit; as long as you keep it romantic, it'll put her at ease. (That means don't stop to ask her what she thought of Mr. Frambowsky's chemistry test). In a passionate moment, take a little break to look her in the eyes and tell her ""You look beautiful"" or something nice, but only if you mean it.


You should only give really nice compliments to girls you've known for a while; telling a girl you met that night that she looks beautiful might scare her off.

, This is a very sensitive area for most girls, and if you kiss the side of the girl's neck, it'll make her go wild. Whether you're holding her from behind, lying down, or just facing the girl, leaning in to give her a few gentle, tender kisses up and down the side of her neck will get her in the mood for kissing you.

, While you're kissing, run your hands through the girl's hair. The scalp is actually a very sensitive part of a girl's body, and she will feel a sexy sensation while you comb her locks. Just do it gently at first, and see how she responds. Either run your fingers over the top of her hair or place your hand underneath her hair and gently feel her neck.

, This is another great move if you want to get even more intimate while you're kissing. Pull away for a second and run your hand over the girl's chin, or even cup her face in the middle of a passionate kiss. This will make the girl feel even more special. Don't keep your hand on her face the whole time; just run your hand over her cheek or chin from time to time.


You can also brush her hair off her forehead while you're kissing, but this is a delicate move.

, If you're sitting down, slowly move into this sexy position. Put your hands around the girl's waist so she can climb into your lap if she feels comfortable. She'll most likely sit with her legs to the side and her arms around your neck. If she's very forward, she may straddle you, but don't count on it.

, The ear is another sensitive zone for girls, and if you whisper something sexy in her ear, she'll be even more excited. Don't, you know, whisper that she smells like macaroni and cheese; tell her that she's so sexy, that she has soft lips, or that you love stroking her hair. Just the feel of your hot breath on her ear will work wonders on her body.

, If whispering in her ear went over well, then take it a step further and gently nibble on her ear. First, move toward her ear and kiss the lobe; if she responds well, take very gentle nibbles on her ear lobe and see how she reacts. Either she'll go wild or she'll push you away--prepare for either.

, Kiss her for a second, two seconds, a minute or more, and just when things are really getting hot and heavy, pull back and look into her eyes as you caress her face or hair. This is guaranteed to drive her wild as you pull away just when she wants you more than ever. This isn't meant to be cruel and you shouldn't try it all the time; you should just do it enough to be playful.

, You don't have to be French kissing, or even kissing at all, during the entire make out session. Though you don't need to pause to text your mom or start a conversation about what you're going to wear to prom, it's acceptable to take a breather, grab a glass of water, or just to look into each other's eyes for a little while. Making out is an art, and all artists take breaks in order to truly perfect their craft.

, Massage your girl's shoulders firmly but not too roughly. Move the massage closer to the neck, then around the collar bone, then change to the upper arm. Slowly work down the arm as you do it. You can do this in between make outs or even earlier, to get her in the mood.


Before you massage the girl, though, make sure she's really into kissing you. Otherwise, it'll look like a cheap trick.

, If you're both sitting down, this is another intimate move that may lead to a make out. Wrap your arms around the girl, and maybe even kiss the top of her head, and wait for her to lean into you. Breathe on her neck a little bit to make her feel more excited. Gently stroke her shoulders and move until you're facing each other and are ready to kiss.

, Get to the waist, and work your way back up to the shoulders but this time use your finger tips in a circular motion, still being firm, but be gentle too. Starting to touch her like this can make her want to kiss you more than ever.

, Start with her feet and then massage your way up her legs slowly. When you get to the thigh, massage the outer thigh then work your way towards her inner thigh down to her knees and back up again.

Pay attention to him.",How to Make a Guy Crazy About You," It sounds simple, but making and holding eye contact with a guy can give him just enough encouragement to take an interest in you.


When you're talking to him, make sure that you maintain eye contact. Try not to let your eyes wander, especially in the direction of another guy.
You can even use eye contact to drive him crazy when you're standing on opposite sides of the room. Make eye contact with him, and after holding it for a few moments, drop your gaze. Slowly drag your eyes back up to meet his again, keeping a coy or flirty smile on your face as you do.;
, When you're trying to make a guy crazy early on, wear clothes, makeup, and accessories that highlight your best features.


This does not mean that you should wear especially revealing or tight-fitting clothes. Revealing clothes will catch a guy's interest temporarily, but they probably won't drive him crazy for very long.
A dress that shows a little leg or a blouse that hugs your body in all the right places can work wonders, but your appearance should scream “attractive” more than “sexy.”
The idea is to make your body and your face look its best. If the clothes are something you objectively look amazing in even when you're not trying to capture a guy's heart, they will probably work for this goal, as well.

, This tells him that he has successfully broken through the barricade and wedged his way into your life.


The clothes you wear should still be clean, of course. A relaxed pair of jeans and a t-shirt make a nice casual look, but a shirt that's three sizes too big with a giant mustard stain on it may not be the best choice.
After you've established a habit of dressing down, you should still dress up occasionally to reignite a few of the sparks he initially felt the first time he saw you.

, Spray a little perfume behind your ears or apply a scented lotion after a shower. When you smell alluring, it can make a guy want to move in even closer to you.


Moderation is key here. The scent should be just strong enough to waft gently in the air. If your perfume is too strong, it can easily overpower his sense of smell and make him want to put some distance between you.

, Plenty of guys go crazy for a girl who feels comfortable enough in her own skin to break into the occasional random dance.


You can do this at a party or a club, but it's even more effective if you randomly start dancing to the radio when you're in your kitchen or in your car.
Try inviting him to dance along with you, as well. Watching you can be enjoyable, but being invited to join the fun can also drive him wild.

, When you know he's watching, twirl your hair between your fingers as you speak or casually flip it over your shoulder as you're working on something. Make the action look as natural as possible, though.


If your hair is short or pulled back, you might consider brushing your hands against the nape of your neck or your bare shoulders, instead. This motion can be just as sensual.

,


If the guy in your life will be busy on the weekend, don't plead with him to make a little time for you. Instead, accept it, and come up with plans of your own to talk about.
Don't be too aloof, though. If he has you in his arms, that's not the time to start checking your texts or talking about your other friends.

, Let him see the side of you that is certain about who she is and where she's at. Even if you don't have your life completely worked out right now, there is usually some aspect of it that you can be proud and confident about.


Maybe you're self-conscious about the fact that you're not as far in your career as you'd like, or about the fact that you're relatively inexperienced with romance and love. On the other hand, you might be very confident about your intelligence, the relationships you've built with your friends and family, or any other number of accomplishments.
If you lack confidence in one area of your life, highlight the areas of your life you do feel confident in rather than fixating on the things you perceive to be flaws.

, Respect your body, your free will, and your life. Treating yourself poorly sends the signal that you don't deserve anybody else's serious attention, even when it is not true.

, The surprise will make him realize that there's far more to you than meets the eye, making you seem more mysterious.


If you're usually the stern, serious type, let him see you laughing uncontrollably at your favorite comedy film or unwinding after a hard day of work.
Conversely, if you're usually the carefree type, get serious with him one day and tell him a little of your dreams and fears.

, You will inevitably make a mistake in front of him. Instead of getting upset about it, brush it off and poke fun at yourself.

, A ditzy girl might make a guy interested for a night, but a clever girl will challenge his mind and keep him going crazy for a much longer period of time.


You don't need to pretend to be knowledgeable about things you've never heard of. Respecting your intelligent side simply means letting your natural cleverness show. Don't try to make yourself seem like an airhead.

, Most guys prefer to be the one doing the wooing, rather than the one being wooed. He needs to know that you're interested, but you shouldn't let him think that you're desperate to hold onto him.


Make him work to get closer to you. “Close” here means both physical and emotional intimacy. Let your guard down him emotionally by only revealing your inner thoughts and feelings little by little. Instead of taking him back to your apartment the first night, leave him with nothing more than a kiss—if even that—and make him have to prove himself before things go any further than that.

, Even if you never want to leave his side, it can actually hold his attention more if you leave long enough and often enough for him to miss your presence.


Be unavailable from time to time. Instead of jumping at every invitation, pass one up, especially if he extends it with short notice. Make sure that you follow your refusal with a line about how much you'd love to do something next time.
Make him a little jealous, but do so with caution. Hang out with a few of your female friends and talk a lot about the fun you plan on having. Avoid doing this with guy friends, though, since it might give him reason to doubt your sincerity toward him.

, Don't ask him to change for you. No one is perfect, and if you're in a relationship with a guy, there will be things that both of you need to fix and compromise on. None of these things should include a dramatic change to his personality or beliefs, though.

, Be friendly with his friends and ask about his family. By showing an interest in the people he cares about, you demonstrate that you are serious about being a part of his life.


You don't need to be best friends with his friends, but it helps if you can tolerate them well enough to spend time around them when necessary. Try not to get too close to any of them, though, since you might spark some unwanted jealous and suspicion.
If he's not on good terms with his family and doesn't have much interest in talking about them, don't push the matter too much. Bring it up every now and then, but wait until he's ready to start talking before talking in any depth.

,


If he invites you to try his hobby, give it a shot, even if you know nothing about it. You may choose not to continue with it after that first try, but at least you'll know enough about it afterward to understand him when he starts talking about it later.

, Offer a positive, flirty remark on how great he is when he least expects it. Flattery can be a powerful tool. Make sure that your compliment is genuine, though, and not sarcastic.


Compliments on his appearance can be just as effective as compliments on his personality or abilities.
Mix things up a little. When you meet him after work, you might lean over and whisper that you couldn't stop thinking about his dreamy eyes all day. The next week, you might casually remark that you don't know anyone else who can tell as great a joke or story as he can.

, When the two of you are together, let him be the man. This doesn't mean that you have to be completely submissive, but it does mean letting him take the lead and showcase a few traits associated with his traditional gender role.


If he holds the door open for you or offers you his jacket on a chilly night, for example, you should accept the gesture.

, Be a safe place for him to fall. When things go wrong, let him know that you will be there to support him emotionally and without judgment.


Conversely, you also need to give him space. You may find that he needs more personal space than you do. If he needs time to be independent or time to deal with his issues alone, let him have it without making a big fuss over the matter.

, A guy is more likely to go crazy for a girl when she lets him see that she's crazy for him, too. Pay attention to the things he says and does, then regurgitate this information later on to prove that you were listening.


For instance, if he tells you about the pet dog he had when he was 12, you might bring it up in conversation later on.
A simple way to demonstrate that you pay attention to him is to remember some basic facts: his birthday, the names of his siblings, and so on.

Be as calm as you can, and try to be yourself.,
Review the laws in your area and make sure you aren't breaking any.

,
Read the escort's ad, website and any additional information she has provided.,
Make sure you know her phone number and her name.,
Check her hours before calling.,
Consider your reasons for calling an escort.,
Take a deep breath, smile, think of something nice about yourself, and dial.,
When she answers, say calmly and confidently, ""Hi, my name is (whatever).,

",How to Make a Date With an Escort over the Phone," Most escorts are professionals, and aren't going to judge you for having normal human emotions like anxiety. Remember, she's human, too.;
,, It's there for a reason, and reading it can save you from uncomfortable rejections if you and the escort are not on the same page.

, Calling her and asking, ""Which one are you again?"" will not impress her.

, A daytime escort will not be happy to speak to you at 4am.

, Do you want a romantic relationship? Do you expect to be allowed to hurt her or treat her like a blowup doll? Do you just want to talk dirty on the phone? Are you trying to get caught and make your wife jealous? She will not tolerate any of this behaviour.

, Remember that most escorts won't answer a blocked number.

, Is this (whoever)?"" If it's an agency, you will end up speaking to a booking agent, so you may have to adapt this advice accordingly. If it's the escort, keep smiling.

, Do not ask her, ""What's up?"" Talk to her as you would other professional service providers.

, Don't make her repeat every bit of information on it. She has limited time and expects you to be able to read.

, Be smart enough to read between the lines of her ad, especially if you're trying this in the US. Unless you're in an area where this is completely legal or decriminalized, a smart escort will not answer questions about specific acts or anything explicit and will probably refuse to speak to you again if you try. Always remember, an escort is offering her time, not specific acts. Don't try to argue about her answer, or bribe her to change her mind.

, Don't make her choose when -- she has no idea what your schedule is like. If she can accommodate you, she will. If not, she will suggest the closest time that works for her.

, She will want to verify them to make sure it is not a prank call and that she can let someone know where she is. If you're meeting at her place, don't be pushy for her exact address. Remember that she doesn't know you yet and doesn't want to end up in the uncomfortable situation of you showing up early, or stopping by in the middle of the night. She wants to earn an income, so she isn't likely to leave you hanging. Just be patient.

, You will probably have to call one more time to let her know you are close and ready to come see her. Or, if you're meeting at your place, she will call you.

, If your appointment is still several hours away, and you change your mind, call and cancel. Explain your reason politely, and apologise. If you are at her door or just minutes away, tell her politely that you've changed your mind, and pay for the first half hour or her driver's fee, plus some money for her time. Don't hurt her feelings or stiff her, unless you'd like being treated that way at your job.

Compliment her, but don't overdo it.,
Respect her.,
Take it slow.,Find out what she's interested in (but seriously, not like a stalker)

,
People like it when someone is sincerely interested in what they think and say.,
If you really like a woman and you think she likes you as well, go ahead and ask her out but remember, if she says no it's not the end of the world!

,
If she says yes try to think of something unique and creative to do, but try to make it something that's in public, preferably during the day or on a weekend.,
Really, just be yourself.

,
Don't brag, girls hate that.,
It's good to agree with her on things, but if every time she asks your opinion on something you just nod or say ""sure"", she will either not think you're listening or that you don't care, which you might not, but you don't want to give her that impression.",How to Make a Good Impression on Girls," Think of something positive you can say...and actually mean it! Don't tell her 'I really like your shoes' if she's wearing beat up sneakers! Complimenting her clothes or looks is not a bad idea, but it runs the risk of being predictable. Try to be original, and, if it comes naturally to you, humorous. Don't force it though if you're not a naturally funny guy!;
, Girls hate it when you don't and it's a MAJOR turn off. Give her space, don't put her down and keep your hand to your self. If you don't give the girl her needed space she may get angry at you and start an argument which may lead to a break-up.

, Don't automatically flirt, get suggestive, or change the tone of the conversation the minute she thanks you for a compliment or laughs at your jokes. Lots of people can be a bit shy, so if she seems this way don't try to force things. Shy people don't usually dislike other people, they just need a little bit more time and space to get to know you. Watch closely for signs that you may have stepped too far into her 'comfort zone'!

,, But if you're not interested don't try to fake it. Listening and encouraging a woman to talk about things that interest her will not only help you to keep the conversation going two ways but will help you figure out if she shares any of your interests in the first place, and might even help you think of an enjoyable activity you could share if you decide to ask her out.

,, We live in a world full of weirdos and she doesn't have any reason to think you're not one of them! Besides, late night dinners carry with them a lot of baggage and unwanted expectations for a lot of people, so it's best to wait until further down the road for that!

,, You don't want to make her think you're a self-centered jerk.

, Don't just tell her you agree, tell her why you agree, she will most likely appreciate your response and will know you're listening to her.

Reflect and determine where you are hurt.,

Emphasize your hurt feelings.,
Try to get her to step into your shoes.,
Be prepared for her response.,
Take responsibility for your part.,
Be optimistic.,
Forgive her.,
Help her make amends and reconcile.",How to Make a Girl Feel Guilty," If you were dating or if she was your friend, decide if you still want her in your life. Either way, you might still be able to make her feel guilty, but it's best to figure out whether you still want her or not.


Decide what she did wrong. Admit to any part you may have had in the conflict and focus on the specifics of what she did to offend you. Is she mean to everyone or is she only mean to you?;
, Give yourself time to recover from the way she treated you. Stop talking to her. Avoid her at school, work, or wherever you normally see her. If you happen to run into her, walk past her and pretend she isn't even there., Focus on healing yourself without relying on time to do it for you.


Surround yourself with friends that support you. Talk to your friends about how she hurt you. Give yourself a support group so you don't have to face her alone before you are ready., Before you confront her, make sure you have a clear idea of what you are going to say. If your thoughts toward her are very chaotic, take time to write down the specific things that are hurting you.

, Keep a cool head and a level tone. Avoid turning the conversation into a fight where she might get defensive and retaliate.


Avoid victimizing or feeling sorry for yourself. The goal is to gain her understanding, not her pity.
Keep an open posture. Stand straight with your arms at your sides. Don't cross your arms over your chest as this is commonly interpreted as a defensive stance., Focus on ""I"" statements to describe the situation. Look at her directly and say things like:


""I think you need to know how hurtful it is when you do ""X."" I feel hurt because ""Y,"" and I'd like you to stop doing it.""
The situation isn't just about what she has done. It is about how you have become involved. Be prepared to forgive her and reconcile.

, Our minds have a tendency to blow things out of proportion when we feel upset. Before starting sentences with ""You always"" or ""You never,"" ask yourself whether or not this is actually true. Address the specific instances that made you upset.Offer accurate examples. Avoid statements like ""I hate how you lie all the time."" Frame your statement like ""I felt upset when you lied to me about being too busy to talk yesterday. You lied about that last week too.""

, Open up about how much her actions hurt you and try to let her feel your emotions. Take care not to let yourself get angry or aggressive.


Speak slowly and deliberately.
If you find yourself starting to cry, take a moment to gather yourself. If you break down completely and find it impossible to talk, you may need to take more time to compose yourself before continuing.

, You may be able to reach to her conscience by asking her to see the situation from your position.


Ask her how she might have felt if your positions were reversed. Be compassionate when attempting to guide her into seeing the situation from your perspective.

, She may cry. Girls are often more sensitive than men and confronting her directly might cause her to break down or get aggressive.


She may become so emotionally unstable that you are unable to continue the conversation. She may flee the conflict. If this happens, keep an open mind and give her a chance to reflect on what was said.

, It takes two people to fight. She may accuse you of things you have done to hurt her. Apologize for your mistakes and give her an opportunity to do the same. Say things like:


""You're right, I made a mistake too. I should have done things differently.""
""I think I could have handled the situation better also, I'm sorry that I hurt you.""

, No matter the outcome, you confronted her and apologized for your own wrongdoings. This experience will help you both grow, even if you cannot reconcile. She may need more time to understand her mistake and you won't be able to force her.

, Even if she is unable to apologize, you can still forgive her. Forgiving doesn't mean you are excusing what she did to you. First and foremost, forgiveness is about you.


Forgiving her might not come instantly. Depending on how badly she hurt you, you might need time to truly forgive her.
Let go of negative feelings. Holding a grudge may cause you emotional stress. Realize that everyone makes mistakes and move on.

, If she is receptive to your feelings and offers an apology, accept it. Express to her how good her apology made you feel and how you respect her for taking responsibility for her actions. Encourage her to reach out to others she may have hurt.

Determine if your feelings towards this guy are genuine or a means of distraction. Ask yourself hard questions and provide yourself with honest answersDo you find yourself daydreaming about him?
Have you engineered ways to “accidentally” bump into him in public or at school?
Are all of your friends in relationships and you feel left out?
Did your crush develop at a convenient time, like just before a dance or a month before Valentine’s Day?;
, While you determine whether or not you like a guy, keep a daily journal. Write about your interactions with him. Describe how you feel when you see him. Note if those feelings carry you through the rest of your day or dissipate shortly after you part ways. Jot down any daydreams; keep track of any hopes you have for a future with him. At the end of each week, re-read your journal entries to evaluate your feelings., Turn to your best friend—the person who knows you the best—for advice. Discuss your feelings with your best friend. Disclose why you are unsure if you like this guy. After you have talked, listen. Allow your best friend to provide you with feedback. Your best friend’s response may upset you, challenge you, or confirm how you truly feel. Take time to process their feedback., When the guy you like is always on your mind, his name tends to enter into every conversation. If you can not stop talking about him, it might be a sign that you can’t get him off your mind and you like him more than you think you do!Have your friends or family members called you out on talking about him constantly?
Do you find yourself making the most obscure connections between his life and every topic you discuss?

, Have you recently developed new interests, interests that just so happen to be shared with the guy you may like? If you have started participating in new activities or developed a sudden interest in an obscure topic as a way to impress him, you might have a crush on him!Did you join a club just to spend more time with him?
Have you started reading his favorite books just so you have something to talk to him about?
Did you binge-watch his favorite show so you could reference it in conversations with him?

, When you like a guy, you may feel extremely self-conscious about your appearance and actions—you strive to present the most attractive, confident, fun, and flirty version of yourself to him. You may spend more time picking out the perfect outfit or styling your hair. You might replay your conversation with him over and over in your head in order to analyze what you could have said differently. If you have become extremely concerned about impressing him with your looks and actions, you might have a major crush on this guy!, Your reactions to his presence, touch, and voice are telling! If you are genuinely excited to see him, have a strong reaction to his physical presence, and could chat with him for hours on end, chances are you like him. If your feelings and reactions are indifferent, you likely just aren’t that into him.When you run into your crush, do you get flutters of excitement in your stomach or a sinking feeling? Do you blush when he speaks to you?Do you feel tingly and flushed when his body brushes against yours?
If he calls, texts, or messages you, do you smile and answer immediately or do you ignore his attempts to contact you? When you talk to him, do you dread the end of the conversation or welcome its conclusion?, The amount of time you spend with your crush is a great barometer of how you truly feel about him. If you are intentionally creating time in your schedule to see him, engineering ways to “bump” into him, or obsessing about the next time you will see him, you may be interested in him. If, however, you make very little effort to spend time with him, the relationship may not be a priority to you., When you are crushing on a guy, it is often difficult to see him flirt or talk to other people. When jealousy rears its ugly head, it is a sign that you have developed romantic feelings towards him. If you begin to feel territorial towards him—you have to know where he is, who he is with, and what he is doing at all times—you may be interested in being more than friends with him. If you aren’t upset when he flirts with others, perhaps you aren’t the jealous type or maybe you aren’t interested in being exclusive with him., When you like a guy, you often get to know the most minute, arbitrary details about him. You may know how he likes his coffee or what he gets on a sandwich. You might be aware of his favorite band or movie. Perhaps, you are aware of his odd phobia.When you learn and retain the little details about someone’s life, you are invested in getting to know that person on an intimate level."

Watch her actions closely.,
She talks to you for strange reasons, looking for an excuse for communication.,
She laughs at your super lame jokes.,
She may look at you with a seductive stare or become shy and look around hoping you will be the one to stare at her.,
She may pay a lot of attention to the things you do.,
She will smile in your presence, or show off her best aspects.",How to Know if a Girl Digs You," If she keeps fidgeting and doing small things with her hands (Playing with a cell phone, checking her nail polish), or more physical touching (twirling her hair, scratching her nose, rubbing her leg, licking her lips) that means she wants to gain your attention or she may be nervous. However, it may be unconscious preening too.;
, For an example, if she asks you, ""Can I use your pencil sharpener?"" and she's using a pen, it's obvious; she adores you.

, For example, if she laughs hysterically or gives you a warm, welcoming smile after you say a rather awkward or not-at-this-time joke, like 0 telling 8 it has a belt.

, If you catch her staring at you and she glances away quickly on more than one occasion, this is a sure sign she likes you. If you're looking at her and she's still looking at you, smile or wink. You don't want to turn this into a staring contest!

, If she knows a lot about you, she may seem to ask you about things not many others know about. You may see her around a lot more than other girls and/or she might talk to your friends to get your attention.

, This includes laughing, also, check for changes in her voice... it may be softer or happier when she is talking to you.

Remember that dating is meant to be fun!",How to Know if You Should Ask a Girl Out," If she comes over to speak to you or seems to be staring at you a lot, this is a sign she is interested. For example; If you are on the other side of the room to her, she may gravitate towards you and show an effort in making conversation.;
, Does she always look happy to see you? If she smiles when you speak to her and seems happy to be around you then this could also mean that she likes you. For example; If you ask her for a pencil, she may smile and find you one immediately.

, If she hugs you or seems to be touching you a lot, then this means that she is really into you. For example; When you sit next to her she leans into you, or she lightly brushes your arm/ back when speaking to you.

, Has she asked you if you would date her? If she drops hints that she is into you or asks you questions about herself, then she definitely wants you to ask her out. For example; She might ask you ""What would you say if I asked you out?""

, For example; You could ask her ""If I asked you out, what would you say?"" If she says yes then you could ask her out a week later. However if she says no, this is not the end of the world. At least you have left her with the thought that you two could become an item.

, For example; You could come up behind her and hug her from the back, your head leaning on her shoulder, as a greeting. If she doesn't push you away and seems to enjoy the hug, then you are on the right track. If she hugs you back, this is a big sign that she is into you and this would be the perfect time to ask her out. Although if she pushes you off, just smile and lean your elbow on her shoulder as this will make it look like the hug was only a joke. It would be best not to ask her out at this stage because it means that she feels uncomfortable around you.

, For example; You could say ""You have really nice eyes"" or ""I think you're really pretty"". Girls love this. If she seems to appreciate the compliment and thanks you, then you are ready to ask her out. However if she gives you a disapproving stare or seems to be uncomfortable after your compliment, then it would be best not to ask her out.

, Start off by complimenting her. For example; You could say ""I think you're really hot/ pretty,"" or get more specific, like, ""I've never seen eyes that blue!"" If she seems to like being complimented, then you can move onto the next stage. If she looks uncomfortable, just finish it off with something like ""Because your hair really suits you"" or ""That shirt really works for you"". This will repair the damage for you and then you can just walk away.

, For example; If you are both walking home together and you are alone. Do not ask her in front of her friends as this could influence her decision. Picking the right place and time is crucial. Make sure that she is in a good mood too, or she may be more inclined to reject you.

, For example; You could say ""I wish you were my girlfriend"" or ""I want to go out with you."" This will brace her for what you are about to ask, otherwise she may think it's a joke and not take you seriously.

, Say ""Will you go out with me?"" or ""Will you be my girlfriend"" and smile while you wait for a response. If she seems to be taking ages to decide, then you could suggest that she meets you somewhere the next day once she has decided.

, If she says yes, then just casually be positive; don't overdo it, but show that you're happy to be going out with her. Then you could say something like ""See you later"" and walk away to prevent a feeling of awkwardness. Although if she says no, don't get embarrassed or show weakness. Nobody can blame you for asking and if she is mean to you, then you deserve better anyway. Just smile, look calm and  say ""Alright, you can't blame a guy for trying!"" and walk away.

, No doesn't necessarily mean no forever, but you don't want to overwhelm her. Once the idea of going out with you is in her head, she may begin to like you. Most girls are more attracted to the one who is attracted to them, it's in their nature! So don't give up. or you may decide you like another girl who seems to be more interested. However don't be annoying or harass her.

, Don't feel embarrassed, this girl is likely to admire you for building up the courage to ask her out. Good luck!

Ask him out yourself.",How to Know if a Man Is Interested in You," Is he paying way more attention to you than other girls (or even his own friends)? Is he nicer or does he try to touch you more? These may be signs that he's interested in you.;
, Notice how, when, and how often he touches you. A touch to the cheek or neck is a dead giveaway, but a touch to the hand, arm, or lower back can also be a sign that he wants to get closer. You should also pay attention for the thumb rub. If he rubs his thumb softly against your skin while he touches you, that is a very good sign.

, Does he ask about your hobbies? Follow up on things you told him you were going to do? Does he make an effort to get to know your friends? Does he try to learn about your family or where you grew up? These are signs that he's interested in you.

, If a guy is giving you little gifts, especially ones he made himself, that is a clear sign that he's interested. If the gift is very tailored to you or to something you did together, that's the real clue.

, When in doubt, the best idea is to remove the ambiguity and test the waters a bit. Ask him to be your date to a thing you have to go to or just invite him to spend some alone time together doing something date-like. If he says no, it doesn't bode well. If he really likes you he'll just about bend Heaven and Earth to spend time together.

, If he doesn't call when he said he would or he doesn't call within a few days of a date, he's not interested. There are two options here: either a) he's not interested enough and so he's not calling or b) he's playing emotional games and wants you to be the first to call. Either option does not work in his favor. Even a shy guy, once he's gotten a date with you or your number, will call or text after a few days of hoping you'll be the one to break the ice because this in lets him know he at least has a shot.

, When he talks to you, does he respect you or does he make little comments that put you down? Not just teasing but hurtful comments, even if he passes them off as jokes. A man who doesn't respect you is probably not all that interested in you and even if he thinks he's interested in you, he certainly doesn't deserve you. Look for a guy that talks to you like an equal, that would never say anything hurtful if he could help it, and is more interested in building you up rather than pulling you down.

, You should also pay attention to how he talks about you. How does he describe you when he introduces you to other people. Introducing you at all is a good sign, since if he really doesn't care about you it probably won't even occur to him. However, if you're dating you should be worried if he is reluctant to call you his girlfriend. If you're friends, look for the tone of voice he uses when he says that you're his friend. Is the word emphasized? That's not a very good sign either.


A guy who's really interested and really cares will rush to introduce you using the most familiar term that he thinks he can get away with because he's proud and excited that you like him enough to be around him.

, Think about how much time he spends with you. Does he only do it when he has nothing better to do? Or does he find reasons to hang out with you pretty much as often as he can? If he's inviting you to all sorts of things and generally trying to hang out a lot, this is a pretty good sign that he's interested.

, Another indicator is whether or not he makes sacrifices for you. If he blows off his friends to hang out with you, that's a good sign. If he skips out on a night of CoD to help you study for a test, that's a good sign. We usually only make sacrifices for people that we really care about, so if he's sacrificing for you, he probably likes you.

, If you're dating or getting into that border region and he talks more about his ex than he does about you, that's not a good sign. She'll be the furthest thing from his mind if he really has feelings for you. However, if he's comparing something you do to something she used to do or something similar, he's probably just using you to make himself feel better. Be careful, it might not last.

, Things moving at about the speed of evolution tells you that he's not interested. However, things moving at the speed of light can be a bad sign too. If he's really smitten, he'll want to get things just perfect and so taking things a bit slow might be par for the course. Don't panic if he isn't instantly ripping your clothes off but also don't let yourself be taken advantage of.

, Another clear sign that a guy is smitten is if he makes changes to his personality or habits in order to please or impress you. If he starts working out, going back to school, dressing better, cleaning more, being nicer, quitting smoking, or anything like that: he likes you. He wants to be the man he thinks you deserve. It's cute.

, A guy that's really into you will want to share his life with you. He'll be itching to introduce you to his friends and eventually even his family. He'll want to show you the things he likes and the places where he goes for fun. However, a guy that's not interested or one who's taking advantage of you will hide things from you. If he doesn't want you to see his phone: watch out. If he makes excuses for why he doesn't think you should meet his friends, even though you've been dating for 6 months: run for the hills. If he refuses to tell you where he goes on Thursday nights: check yourself. These are all signs that he doesn't trust you.

, If he's drunk every time he calls you or insists on alcohol being present when the two of you are hanging out, that's a bad sign. If you know him better drunk than sober, that's a bad sign. Not because it shows a character flaw (although it might), but because it shows that he only likes you when his brain functions about as well as a crowded public toilet.

, Has he asked you out? This is the most important question when determining if a guy is interested in you. A guy that is seriously interested, as we said above, will move Heaven and Earth to be with you. Super shy guys might have trouble popping the question, so look for false-starts (they say they want to talk to you alone but get really bashful and then talk about something dumb instead), but otherwise if a guy is really serious about you he will find a way to be with you.

, Right. If you're getting nowhere with this guy or if you want to find out if he's really worth the trouble, consider giving some real thought to if he really is Mr. Right. You deserve Mr. Right. Settle for no less.

, If he turns out to be a total loser, you might want to take a hard look at the kind of guy you're attracting and pursuing. It's easy to send out the wrong kind of message that only ends in your heartbreak, but it's just as easy to avoid.

, Just make sure, when you're evaluating relationships, that you know what real love looks like. It's easy to talk ourselves into accepting bad behavior from someone that we like a lot, but you shouldn't let yourself become a victim. Your happiness is important.

, If this guy is passing all the Good Guy tests and he seems like he really does like you, a little goading can push him over the edge and finally ask you out. Sometimes, especially with shy guys, they might need a little coaxing.

, If he really isn't budging but you think his feelings are genuine, you can take the initiative and ask him out yourself. There's nothing wrong with this. Just realize that you might end up with an answer you don't like. Then again, you could end up blissfully happy!

Take a hot shower, style your hair, trim your beard or shave (if necessary), and put on cologne. Try not to throw on too much cologne, as the overwhelming smell may turn off potential dates at the bar.;
, You may want to be strategic when selecting a bar to meet single women, as not all bars are created equal in terms of having a high number of single women. The atmosphere of a bar over a club or a lounge is often more conducive to meeting single people, with its casual environment and cheaper drink prices. There are three primary types of bars:Neighborhood bars: This is your local pub or sports bar, with a gang of regulars and familiar faces. While these bars may be fun to go to with close friends every weekend, they may not be the ideal spot to pick up girls. If you go to your neighborhood bar often, you will likely know everyone who frequents the bar and are not as likely to meet new single women in this type of venue.
Popular bars: These bars are known hang out spots in the downtown area of your town or city, or franchise pubs that are often packed on the weekends. While these bars are often crowded with people, new and familiar, it may be more difficult to get a girl’s attention in this environment, especially in a large crowd.
Dive bars: These bars are considered a little seedy or dank, with cheap drink specials and a casual atmosphere. You may find that dive bars are one of the best settings to meet single women, as the people in the bar are likely less image conscious and are accustomed to the bar scene.

, You can also reach out to friends who are single and often go out to pick up girls or friends who are in the know. Ask them which bars they prefer and if any particular nights are popular, such as Ladies’ Night or Single’s Night at a certain night spot.


You can also try searching online reviews of certain bars or pubs to determine if they are good spots to meet single women. Read the reviews of a bar before you go, as it may tip you off as to if you are walking into a prime hook up spot.

, You should dress according to the setting. Choose a more relaxed outfit, like a clean t-shirt and jeans, if you are going to a dive bar or a neighborhood bar. You may decide to get a bit more dressed up if you are going to a popular bar, such as a collared shirt and slacks.

, Reach out to one or two friends who are willing to act as wingmen for you at the bar. Choose friends who are confident and have had success with girls in the past, or a few single friends who are also interested in meeting single women.


Try not to go out with a big group of friends or a pack of other guys, as this can overwhelm potential dates and make it difficult to focus on the single girls in the room.

, Once you notice a girl you are attracted to or interested in, you should make fleeting eye contact with her. Avoid staring or leering at her. Instead, glance at her periodically and smile at her. If she returns your glances and smiles, she may also be interested in you.You should also display open body language to show her you are engaged in her. Keep your hands relaxed at your sides or casually holding a drink, with your body facing towards her and your head facing her direction.

, Really get her attention by sending over a few drinks to her table or offering to pay for her drink at the bar. Look at what she is already drinking before you order something and ask the bartender what she is drinking. You should then order her the same thing or something similar.Offering her friends drinks as well will show her that you can be considerate of her company and are not trying to impress just her. Buying her friends a drink, as well as her, will also appear non threatening and friendly.
Remember that a girl does not owe you any of her attention just because you bought a drink. Buy her a drink as a friendly way to notify her of your presence, but not as an excuse to aggressively pursue her or push yourself on her.

, If she accepts your drink, you can take this as a sign that she is open to engaging with you. Take a deep breath and gather up the courage to walk over and say “hi” to her. Tell her your name and ask her about herself. Be relaxed and casual in your introduction, using open and non-threatening body language.Maintain eye contact when you speak to her and do not shy away from talking to her friends, as well. Show her that you can handle talking to her friends and be personable as you speak to them. But keep your primary focus on her, using small talk like “What do you do?” or “I love this song, do you like this band?”
Early compliments about her physical appearance are risky, unless she's obviously into you. Get in her good graces first by showing enthusiasm for her hobbies, interests or other topics that come up in conversation.

, Suggest that you do a fun activity together, like play pool or throw darts. If the bar has arcade games, challenge her to a game. Doing a fun activity together can help to break the ice and allow you both to relax and enjoy each other’s company.She may prefer to sit and talk with you over a few more drinks, rather than play a game or do an activity. You may suggest a fun drinking game you can play, your friends, and her friends together. This can be a fun way to get to know each other and have fun in a comfortable, casual way.

, As the night goes on, you should focus on talking to the girl you are interested in. This may mean staying close to her and making jokes to keep the mood light or maintaining fun, light banter while you both play a game or have more drinks.In the opening conversation, follow up on her statements with open ended questions, such as ""Oh, you're a football fan. What's your favorite team?"" or ""What are you studying at college?"" If she stick around and continues to pay attention to you, keep the banter light and quick instead. ""Enjoying your night?"" leads to more flirtation than an interview about her travel history.

, By this point you probably already know whether she's interested, but asking whether she's single is an obvious signal that you want to take things further. If she says no or seems uncomfortable, the two of you aren't on the same page.


You can also try to read her body language throughout the night to get a sense of her intentions. Notice if she maintains eye contact with you, laughs at your jokes, and displays open body language, with her body relaxed and turned towards you.

, Once you feel confident that she is single and possibly interested, you may make a move. The type of move you make will depend on your intentions. If you are looking for a casual hook up, you may mention that your place is close by or that you both could have a drink at your place to cap off the night. This is a clear hint that you are making a move.If you're looking for a date — or you suspect she won't be into the one night stand — hand her your phone and say ""Why don't you put your number in there?""


You can become more physically intimate with her by placing your hand on her waist or touching her hair or face. Only do this if she seems interested in you and she displays open body language, where she appears into touching and becoming more intimate in public.
If she says no or appears uncomfortable by your hook up suggestion, back off and apologize. Tell her that you misread her intentions and respect her decision. Never try to force yourself on a girl or convince her to come home with you unless she is clearly interested.

, If you are successful and you hook up with her, you should always use protection. Put on a condom before you have sex and ask her if she is on birth control. Make sure you are safe with any type of sexual contact, as you want to ensure you both have fun and do not have any regrets the next morning.

"
Gauge the situation.,
Catch her eye.,
Go talk to her.,
Be genuine.,
Introduce yourself.,
Keep talking.,
Don't be afraid of silence.,
Leave her alone if she isn't interested.,
Make plans to see her again.",How to Introduce Yourself to a Girl," Is she alone, or in a group? Is she relaxed, or is she deeply absorbed in her work? Try to approach her at a point when she'll be open to meeting someone new. You want to make a good first impression.If she's alone, consider what she's doing. If she's in the library, with her headphones in, obviously working, then you shouldn't bother her. If you disrupt her work, her first impression of you will be negative. If she's doing something less absorptive--wandering an art gallery, texting, having a coffee--then she'll be more open to your introduction.
If she's hanging out in a group, consider the group dynamic. If a friend of yours is in the group with her, use him or her as a way in: approach the group, say hello to your friend, and use the social momentum to introduce yourself to anyone else in the group that you don't know--including the girl. Casually make yourself a part of the group. If you don't know anyone in the group, you will need to find a way to join in: try jumping into the conversation when you overhear something interesting, or try approaching the group and asking a question about the event you're at.;
, Casually glance in her direction from time to time. When she meets your gaze, smile--then look away. If she smiles back, it's a good indication that she's open to being approached. You don't need to catch a girl's eye to introduce yourself to her, but it's a good way to test the waters as to whether she's interested. Avoid looking at her too often; be flirtatious, but don't creep her out.

, Don't build it up in your head--just seize the moment and get it over with. Walk over to her and casually start a conversation about what she's doing. You can try to be engaging and witty, or you can ask her a simple, earnest question.It helps to have an opening line, to break the ice, but it doesn't need to be a rehearsed ""pick-up line"". You will make a better first impression if you're comfortable, so approach her in a way that you would want to be approached.


If you see her in a bookstore, perusing the shelves, walk up next to her and comment on the book she's holding. Say, ""The Old Man and the Sea is fantastic. Have you read it before?"" If she says no, then tell her why you recommend the book, and try to spark a more in-depth conversation.
If she's standing on the deck of a cruise ship, staring out at the ocean, walk up next to her and say, ""Beautiful, isn't it?"" If she agrees, ask, ""How are you liking the cruise?"" Ask her questions about her experience, and be genuinely interested. Listen to her. Before long, she may begin to ask you questions--and then you've got a conversation.
If you're eating lunch or sipping a coffee--whether it's in a cafeteria, on a grassy lawn, or in a cafe--and you see her sitting alone, approach her and ask if you can sit with her: ""Do you mind if I sit here?"" Don't approach her if she has headphones in, or if she seems especially busy with something. Ask her about what she's reading, or comment on the weather, or ask her, ""Do you come here often?""
If you're at a party or a big social event, it may be even easier to approach her, especially if you've had a drink or two. Walk up to her, say hello, and spark a conversation about the event. Say, ""What do you think of the party?"" or ""Wasn't the solo on that song amazing?"" What you say is not so important as the actual act of breaking the ice.

, Be confident, but down-to-earth. Don't objectify her and treat her as some prize that you need to win; treat her as a person, a real person, with dreams and interests and insecurities--a person who can choose whether or not to be attracted to you. Don't come in with any ulterior motives, and don't try to rehearse a script. Come as you are, as one person who wants to get to know another person, and your heart will shine through.

, You can choose to introduce yourself as an opening line, or you can introduce yourself once you've approached the girl and gotten a conversation underway. Just say it: ""Hey, I'm Mike."" You don't need to feel self-conscious about introducing yourself, because an introduction doesn't necessarily indicate that you're romantically interested in a girl; it's just a polite way to acknowledge someone's presence and set the stage for further conversation.If it's the first day of class and you sit down at the desk next to her, try to catch her eye as you get settled, and casually introduce yourself. ""Hey, I'm Mike."" In most cases, she'll respond in kind: ""Hi! I'm Julie."" Feel free to ask another question from there: say, ""Are you new at this school? I don't think I've seen you around before,"" or ""Were you in Sociology 101? I think I recognize you from my discussion section last semester.""
If you've already approached her and begun a conversation, whether it's in a bookstore or on the deck of a cruise ship, you just need to slip your name into the conversation as an aside. Wait for a natural break in the talk, and say, ""I'm Mike, by the way."" If she doesn't immediately smile and say, ""I'm Julie,"" you can ask, ""What's your name?""
Consider reaching out to shake her hand when you introduce yourself. This is a common introduction ritual in the western world, whether you're introducing yourself to a guy or a girl. It establishes an immediate physical connection, and it signals that the two of you are equals. Grasp her hand firmly but gently--not too tight, and not too loose.

, Let the conversation flow naturally. Ask her questions, listen carefully, and be genuinely interested in what she has to say.


When she mentions something that she's excited about, and her eyes light up, ask her more about it. Feed the conversation with questions. If she's interested, she will ask you questions about yourself; answer them honestly.If you're interacting with a girl in a group setting, ask her lots of questions, and continue making eye contact to make her feel like you're talking to her specifically. Make sure to include the other members of her group in the conversation so they won't be left out: most girls appreciate it when guys are nice to their friends. Eventually, the group might leave you two alone to talk, and it'll be much easier to carry on a one-on-one conversation in private.

, If you've approached a girl at some sort of event, like a concert or a festival, you don't need to fill every moment with words. If you're sitting next to a girl in class, you can let the conversation drop and then pick it up the thread again when you have a free moment. Sit with her, listen with her, wander with her, and make witty comments as they pop into your brain. The important thing is that she enjoys your company.

, You should be able to tell if she doesn't want to take your conversation any further: she'll give you one-word answers, she won't look you in the eyes, and she won't ask questions back. If she is interested in talking with you, she'll be engaged in the conversation, and you won't have to force it too much. Bear in mind that holding back from the conversation doesn't necessarily mean that she isn't interested--she might just be shy--and being engaged in the conversation doesn't necessarily mean that she's attracted to you: she might just be up for a conversation.


If she doesn't seem interested, politely excuse yourself. Don't let the situation grow too awkward. Say, ""Well, it was nice talking you. Enjoy your book!"" Return to whatever you were doing before you approached her.
If you've approached a girl in a group, it can be hard enough to get her undivided attention, let alone tell if she's interested. Sometimes, the best tactic is to chat for a while and then move elsewhere. Keep making eye contact with the girl you were trying to talk to. This can be a great way of seeing if she's interested in talking more with you. If she leaves the group and goes to find you, it's a good sign.

, Even if your conversation goes well, one of you will eventually have to leave. Be bold and take a chance here--this might be the best opportunity that you get. What do you have to lose? Tell her that you really enjoyed talking to her, and that you'd love to meet her for coffee or a drink sometime. If she agrees, ask her for her phone number.


If you have a date in mind, feel free to propose it now. If you've had a solid conversation with her, say, ""I really enjoyed talking to you. Would you like to meet up for a drink tomorrow night?""
If you introduced yourself, but you didn't get much time to talk, ask her out for coffee. Say, ""I'd like to talk to you more. Would you want to meet up for coffee this weekend?""
If you introduced yourself to her in a group setting, but didn't wind up getting much one-on-one time, wait until her group is leaving. Pull her aside, briefly, and tell her what a great time you've had; say, ""It was really great meeting you. I'd love to get to know you better. Want to meet up for coffee sometime?""

, No relationship is perfect, and there are likely things she’d change about her boyfriend if she could.


Casually ask her about her relationship. As she grows to trust you, she’ll share more information with you. If she tells you that her boyfriend never takes the time to hear about her day, don’t tell her that you’d always make time to listen to her if you were in his shoes. Store this information. Another day, make sure you ask her how her day is going and actively listen.If you are hanging out with her friends while she’s not around, pay attention if they are gossiping. They may say something about her relationship that you can use to play up your strengths in contrast to her boyfriend’s weaknesses.

, You’ve set the stage so that she sees you in good light. You can decide if your move will be verbal or physical. Will you tell her you’re attracted to her or just lean in for the kiss? Wait for a time when the two of you are alone and the mood is light.

, Though you've been contemplating this for a while, it could be totally out of the blue for her.


If she tells you she’s attracted to you, too, give her some time to decide if she wants to act on that. Don’t pressure her. That will make her withdraw from your friendship and undo the work that you’ve done to show yourself off.

Consider her current relationship. If she’s in a strong relationship, she is not likely to leave it, even if she likes you, too.

If she is happy in her relationship, she will not thank you for critiquing her boyfriend or finding ways to get their relationship on rocky ground. Even if she is unhappy in the relationship, if she realizes your motive she will see it as manipulative.

This means that you should be flexible in what you do together and try activities that you may otherwise not be interested in at least once.This shows your guy that you care about his feelings and are genuinely interested in him.

, Everyone loves a person who is positive and fun to be around, and this is especially true of guys who are interested in you. He doesn’t want a reminder of how bad the world or life is.Keep things light and happy as much as possible. Everyone has the occasional bad day and it’s ok to talk about this with him, but don’t dwell on it or he might lose interest.

, After you and your guy have had a chance to get to know each other better, let him know how you feel about it. You don’t have to be entirely blatant about it, but it’s a good idea to let a man know how you’re feeling if you want more than a friendship.


There are different ways to make him realize he’s special to you. For example, in groups, pay special attention to him or maintain steady eye contact. You can also ask him flirtatious questions such as “what qualities do you like in a woman.”Men often aren’t very perceptive about a woman’s feelings for him, so clearly tell him how you feel.Don’t go over the top when you tell him or you might scare him away. Conversely, if you’re too subtle, he likely won’t get the hint., A gentle touch of the shoulder or grazing past his arm ignites a chemical reaction and it will immediately make your guy feel closer and more focused on you.Just remember to keep the touch light and appropriate.


It’s important to keep your touch gentle and on appropriate parts of his body. Touch his hand, shoulder or leg. Likewise, lightly grazing past him and not rubbing your body up against his is appropriate.

, Meeting a guy’s friends is one of the best ways to help seal the deal with him. If his friend are impressed with you, then he will be even more impressed with you.Just as it’s important to be yourself around your guy, it’s also vital to be yourself around his friends. If they get a bad impression of you or think you’re a phony, it will likely harm the progress of your potential relationship.

, If your guy is celebrating his birthday or has an important project due at his job or school, for example, make sure to contact him to either wish a Happy Birthday or good luck with his work. He’ll find the fact that you remembered his special day a sign that you really care about him.This doesn’t have to be an elaborate gesture. You can send a text message or give him a quick call to wish him the best.

, As you get to know one another better and enjoy being together, spend more time with one another. If he sees you often, he’ll think about you more and likely want to pursue something more with you.

Let a friend know your plan.,
Use protection.,
Avoid his place.,
Stay sober.",How to Have a Successful One Night Stand (for Women)1," If you are considering having a one-night stand, you should make safety a priority. It might be exciting to feel lost in the moment. However, in today's world it is always best to take the proper precautions to stay safe.Text a friend the vital details. If you decide to go home with a man you don't know, let someone know where you will be and who you will be with.
You can send a text that says something like, ""Spending the night with Bob Smith. Met at The Bar. Please check in with me if you don't hear from me by 8 a.m.""
Arrange this system ahead of time. If you think there is a possibility you will meet someone, give your friends a heads up. Ask if she will be willing to be your contact person.;
, When you have a one-night stand, you don't want to have any unpleasant reminders of the experience. That means that you certainly don't want to be left with an STD or unwanted pregnancy. Make sure to always have protected sex unless you are in a monogamous relationship. Use a condom. Ask your partner to wear a condom. Bring your own, so that you know there is one available.
If he objects to wearing a condom, do not agree to have sex. This should be a deal-breaker.
You can also use other forms of protection, such as the female condom. To protect from pregnancy, consider a diaphragm, IUD, or birth control pills.

, Many people who choose to have a one-night stand choose to have sex with someone they recently met. If this is the case, it is a good idea to have the encounter at your own home. It is generally safer to avoid going home with someone you don't know.Remember that safety should be a priority. By going to your place, you will be going where your friends and family will know where to look for you, if necessary.
You will likely feel more comfortable in your own territory. This will allow you to more fully enjoy the experience.

, If you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it's probably not the right time for a one-night stand. When you are intimate with someone you don't really know, it's important to remain in control of your faculties. If you anticipate having a one-night stand, limit yourself to one or two cocktails.Drugs and alcohol can lower your inhibitions. This means that you might not make responsible choices.
The point is to enjoy your one night stand. You'll be better able to do that if you don't wake up hungover and wondering what happened.

"
"
Keep your expectations reasonable.,
Be confident.,
Keep a positive attitude.,
Express your needs.",How to Have a Successful One Night Stand (for Women)2," Think about your goals. Are you looking for just sex? That's perfectly fine. Just make sure to maintain the same priority throughout the experience.Do not expect a relationship to develop. Sometimes people get hurt after a one-night stand. It's usually because their expectations shifted.
Accept that a one-night stand is actually a one-night occurrence. If something else develops, great. But don't expect it to.

, Once you have decided that you want to have a one night stand, it's time to take control of the situation. If you want to have a sexual encounter, approach a potential partner with confidence. If you feel good about yourself, you will project an air of confidence.

When you see someone attractive, strike up a conversation. If you are at a party, try saying, ""Great music. Do you go to many concerts?""
Keep your tone relaxed, but convey your interest. For example, maintain eye contact with the person you are interested in.
You can also make some experimental physical contact. Try resting your hand on the other person's shoulder while you are telling a funny story.

, Even if you are looking for a one night stand, you might feel some emotional repercussions the morning after. It is perfectly normal for women to experience regret, or even shame. It's important to remember that you are in charge of your own actions and you can choose how to feel about them.To avoid having regrets, think carefully about whether you want a one night stand. Do you feel like you can handle having sex with no emotional attachment?
If so, remind yourself that you made a proactive choice to have a one-night stand. As long as you were safe, there's no need to feel regret.
Maintain high spirits. Celebrate the fact that you just had enjoyable sex.

, The key to a successful one night stand is that both parties are on the same page. Avoid having a sexual encounter with someone you would like to pursue romantically. Likewise, do not have a one night stand with someone you know is interested in having a relationship with you.Make your expectations clear. Let the other person know that you are only interested in a casual encounter.
Try saying something like, ""I'd love to ask you to come home with me. But I need you to know that I'm not interested in dating or having a relationship.""
Being honest upfront may save you an awkward conversation later.
Take the lead. Feel free to be the one to instigate sex. If you are interested in being intimate, make that clear.You do not have to wait for the other person to make the first move. Be confident and upfront. You can even say something like, ""I'm really attracted to you.""

Choose the right partner.,
Experiment.,
Cuddle.,
Plan your exit strategy.",How to Have a Successful One Night Stand (for Women)3," Since a one night stand is all about the sex, physical attraction is very important. Look for someone that appeals to you physically. For example, if a killer smile turns you on look for someone with a great grin.Pay attention to chemistry. The ""spark"" that you feel when talking to someone is important.
If you feel immediate attraction and a connection, that's a good sign. Your body may exhibit physical signs of attraction, such as flushing and an accelerated heart rate.
Choose someone that won't compliment your life. For instance, it's probably not a great idea to have a one night stand with a coworker. That could make things awkward in staff meetings.
You don't have to choose a complete stranger, though. Is there a good looking groomsman at your cousin's wedding? Go for it.

, Since you might not ever see this person again, a one night stand is a great time to fulfill some of your sexual fantasies. If you aren't expecting to build a life with the other person, it's likely you'll feel less inhibited. Feel free to experiment.

Maybe you've always been hesitant to be vocal during sex. Use this as an opportunity to make your desires known.
Try saying, ""I would love it if you would do XYZ to me.""
You can also experiment by having sex outside of the bedroom. Have you always wanted to do it on the dining room table? This is your moment.

, Just because it is not a relationship doesn't mean that it can't be intimate. Don't be afraid to ask your partner to spend the night, if that's what you want. If you enjoy cuddling after sex, make that clear.You can say something like, ""I always get a good night sleep with someone's arms around me. Do you mind?""
If cuddling doesn't seem right, don't worry about it. This is your experience to enjoy.

, Hopefully, you have spent the night at your house. Or maybe you are at a hotel, if you are on vacation. Wherever you are, it's useful to have a plan for leaving in the morning.

You can make it clear from the outset that you have plans in the morning. For example, you could say, ""I'd love for you to come back to my place. I hope you don't mind I have an early spin class booked.""
In the morning, be polite, but firm. Say, ""I really enjoyed spending time with you. I've got to head out soon, though.""
Having an exit strategy can save a lot of morning after awkwardness.

Know when you’re not welcome.",How to Pick up Girls," One of the most important parts of picking up a girl is knowing when to make a move. If the girl is giving you signals, like making eye contact, looking at you and smiling and then looking away, or standing with a group of friends looking out into the crowd, then it’s pretty safe to assume you’d be welcome when you say hello. Though you can’t wait around forever for the most perfect situation, you should choose your timing carefully to improve your chances. Here are some things to consider before you approach:


Read her body language. Is she turned toward the crowd and looking around her instead of deeply involved with her friends? If so, then this is a sign that she’d welcome an approach.
See if she looks bored with her company. If she checks her phone a lot, plays with her hair, or rifles through her purse a lot, then this may be a sign that she’d be open to meeting new people.
Make sure the girl isn’t having a deep, serious-seeming conversation with her friends. If they are leaning in towards each other, talking intensely, and if one of them even looks like she’s on the brink of tears, then tonight’s not your night. You don’t want to interrupt an important girl catch-up session.;
, Women are drawn to confident men, and if you want to pick up a girl, then you have to let her see that you’re comfortable with who you are. While it can take time to truly build your confidence, there’s no harm in faking it when you approach a girl so you’ll be closer to feeling that inner peace from projecting outward confidence. Here are some ways to get the girl with your confidence right away:


Let her see that you’re not afraid. Make eye contact as you approach her and smile at her. Don’t be bashful and look at the floor.
Show confidence in your body language. Turn your body toward her, stand tall, and avoid slouching or looking down.
Don’t put yourself down immediately. If you make comments like, “You probably don’t want to talk to a guy like me…” then you’ll be discouraging her from wanting to talk to you.
Part of confidence is looking the part. Wear well-fitting clothes that are clean, crisp, and appropriate for the occasion. Most importantly, wear clothing that looks nice while making you feel comfortable, so you don’t look visibly uncomfortable.

, If you want the girl to take you seriously and even to consider going on a date with you, then you need to choose your words carefully. Some people say that girls make a decision about whether or not they like you in the first fifteen minutes, so you can’t waste too much time making small talk instead of charming her with your words and manner. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Avoid cheesy pick-up lines. No matter what you read online or what you hear from your friends, they rarely work. What’s more, they’ll make the girl think you only see her as a conquest, not as a person you want to get to know.
Introduce yourself and ask the girl her name. Nothing fancy. Just say, “Hey, I’m Chris—what’s your name?” Keep it short and simple.
Be forward. Don’t be timid when you come up to her. Make it clear that you want to talk to her, and don’t act like you think you might be inconveniencing or bothering her. If that’s the case, then you’ll know soon enough, anyway.

, Once you start talking to the girl, it’s time to get your flirt on as soon as you can without laying it on too thick. Make eye contact, lean your body toward her, and show her that you’re interested in her. You can even tease her a little bit, as long as you don’t end up offending her by taking it too far. Just keep up a light, jokey, playful banter, and make sure she’s responding well. Flirting is important if you want to get her attention.


Say something like, “Do you always wear pink because it looks so good on you?” Make a comment about her clothes or something she’s wearing to show you’re interested without being too serious about it.
Give her a small compliment. Tell her you like the way she styles her hair, or something else that’s harmless to show you’re paying attention.
Don’t avoid saying something nice to her because you think she’s heard it all before. Just because you’re sure every other guy she knows has mentioned her gorgeous eyes doesn’t mean you have to ignore them.

, Though you may think that you raise your chances of picking up a girl if you flirt your way into a crowd of girls and see who bites, you’re actually far better off focusing your energy on just one girl at a time. If you make it seem like you’d just be as happy hitting on her friends as you are with talking to the girl, then she’ll see you as a player and will quickly lose interest. Instead, you need to make it clear that she’s the one for you.No girl wants to feel like a piece of meat. She wants to feel like you think she’s special, not like she’s just one of a number of girls you want to hit on.
Plus, if you start hitting on her friends as well as her, then they’ll discourage the girl from liking you because they’ll see that you’re a player, too.

, If you want to raise your chances of picking up a girl, then you have to think outside the box a bit. Sure, a lot of guys like to pick up girls at bars and nightclubs, but you may actually be able to pick up a girl more easily at a coffee shop, farmer’s market, mall, or even the gym, because she’ll be less likely to expect it and her guard may be down. Don’t think that you can only look for girls in the most obvious places and always be on the lookout for cute girls who spark your interest.If you’re at a coffee shop, see if you can strike up a conversation with a girl about a book she’s reading. She’ll be impressed that you’re suave and smart.
If you’re at the farmer’s market or even a grocery store, don’t be afraid to strike up a silly conversation about produce or by asking the girl what she plans to do with that bunch of kale.
If you’re at the gym, make eye contact with a girl when you’re working out and come up to her later, when she’s wrapping up her workout, so you don’t catch her off guard too much.

, If you want the girl to be into you, then you have to show that you actually want to get to know her. You don’t need to give her the first degree, but you should at least ask her a few questions about her interests and who she is so she feels like you’re making an effort. Make sure you open up about yourself, too, so you create a fair balance. When it comes to picking up a girl, it’s much more important to be interested in her, than to be interesting yourself. Here are some things you can ask her about:


Her hobbies
Her pets
Her friends
The town where she grew up
Her favorite bands, movies, or actors

, You don’t have to have everything in common with the girl you’re trying to pick up, but finding something you can bond over certainly won’t hurt. This can be your love for the Warriors, your obsession with the show Community, or even the fact that you happened to go to the same college three years apart. You can even find something much more silly to have in common, such as your dislike of the bartender, or your love for the color black. Once you find your thing, make a real human connection with the girl over it.


If you find that you don’t have any sports teams, shows, or musical interests in common, then you can tease her about her taste a bit, but only if she teases you, too.

, Let her know that she really stands out to you. Compliment her eyes or her clothes, tell her why you think she’s unique, and let her see that you’re not just smooth talking her. Make her get the feeling that you genuinely care and that you’re not just there to get any girl to go home with you. Lean closer to her, tell her she has the greatest laugh you’ve ever heard, and just make an effort to show that she really does stand out to you.


No girl wants to be looked at as a piece of meat. Make her see that you see her for her, and that she’s not just any other girl.
If she’s really different in some way — in a good way — then let her know. Tell her something like, “I’ve never met anyone who knows so much about indie rock.”

, While you want her to see that you’re pursuing her, you don’t want to creep her out, either. Let her know you like her without telling her you want to get married, and ask her questions without talking about how many people she’s kissed in her life. Make her see that you’re a fun, cool, and casual guy and that you’re not putting too much pressure on yourself over this. The harder you try, the more put off she’ll be.Don’t be jealous about other guys. If you see other guys checking her out or saw her talking to another guy in her circle, don’t start asking a million questions about who they are or how she knows them. Just play it cool instead of coming off as insecure.
Try to avoid questioning her feelings about you, or making it look like you’re too desperate to please her.

, Remember to keep things light and fun. There’s no need to be nervous or to worry about what she’s thinking of you every two seconds. Just think of it as having a fun conversation that can lead to something more. If you’re too worried about how she’s responding to you, then she’ll be able to tell and it may lead to some awkwardness down the line. Instead, just be casual, stick to light topics, and don’t be too intense about the whole thing.


Remember that the girl is out to have a good time, too. If you put too much pressure on yourself to have this amazing connection right away, that will actually make it less likely that it will happen.

, You may think that a girl at a bar will want to hear all about how much money you have, but you should actually avoid this topic of conversation if you want to get anywhere. Girls want to be impressed by who you are, not what’s in your bank account, and if you make too much of a big deal about paying for things or talking about your sports car, then they’ll be turned off before you know it.Even worse than flaunting your wealth is lying about your wealth. If you want to get anywhere with a girl, then don’t bother with this.

, Once you and the girl start hitting it off, don’t be afraid of a little casual flirting and touching. Just lean closer to her and place a hand on her arm or her shoulder and see how she reacts. If she flinches or moves away, then you should probably back off. But if she moves closer to you or even touches you back, then this is a sign that she wants you to break the touch barrier.


You can also give her a playful tap on the arm when you’re teasing each other, so it looks like you’re just kidding around.
You can be bold and compliment her earring or bracelet while reaching out to touch it as an excuse to get closer to her.
If you’re sitting down, move a bit closer so that your knees, thighs or feet are touching.

, You should ask the girl out when things are at their peak. When you’re laughing, having an amazing time, and when she’s clearly enjoying the conversation, you should say something like, “I’d love to keep having this conversation about Radiohead, but I’ve gotta get going. Can we pick it up again over dinner or drinks soon?” Make it sound casual, so she doesn’t get caught off guard. If things are going well, then she will be more likely to say yes.


If you wait too long to ask her out and the conversation has gotten boring, then she’ll be less likely to talk to you. If you’re already running out of things to talk about, then why would she want more of that another day?

, Just casually ask for her phone number. Simply say, “Hey, can I call you some time?” Or, “I’d love to meet up again. Can I have your number?” Don’t make a big deal of it or tell her that you think she’s the perfect girl for you. Just ask for her number, plain and simple, and let her see that you weren’t too worked up over asking. Remind yourself that the worst thing that can happen is that she will say no, which really isn’t such a big deal, in the scheme of things.


Don’t ask if you can contact her on social media as a first resort. Though you may think its more low pressure to say, “Hey, can I Facebook you some time?” this actually comes off as not being as serious. If you really want to pick up the girl, then get her number., If you want to see if the girl will go home with you that night, then you really want to be suave about it. You can go for the, “Hey, let’s get out of here,” approach, or you can be a bit more gentlemanly and ask her if you can go to the wine bar across the street or another public place to talk at first. You can even say, “I just like talking to you so much, but I want to go somewhere more private. What do you say?” Let her see that you really want to spend more time with her, and that you’re interested in more than just getting laid.


Hey, if you really are just wanting to have a roll in the hay, there’s nothing wrong with that, but you shouldn’t make the girl think that you want something more if that’s the case.

, Learn to read the signs that tell you to abandon ship. If the girl is looking away, staring at the floor, repeatedly checking her phone, or waiting for her friends to save her, then things are probably not going well. If she barely responds to you and keeps stepping away subtly, then you shouldn’t try to pick her up. Maybe she has a boyfriend or she’s just not feeling it. Whatever the reason, it’s best to back away while you’re ahead.


Read her body language to see if she’s into you. If she keeps turning her body away from you, crossing her arms over her chest, or moving back slightly if you touch her, then she’s probably not feeling it.It’s okay to admit when you’re not wanted. Maybe the girl just wanted some time with her friends. Don’t let it get to you and focus your energy on the next girl who strikes your fancy.

Look at her, hold her gaze for a second, and then just walk right up to her. Sound easy? It's not -- not at first, anyway. But the sooner you get into the habit of acting like it's no big deal to talk to a girl you see, the sooner it'll become a habit. Sure, you may strike out sometimes, but she'll be impressed that you can see her and just walk right up to her instead of playing eye contact tag all night.


Take a deep breath, maintain good posture, and hold her gaze as you walk up to her. It's all about mastering the confidence. If she sees that you're confident about approaching, she'll be more likely to want to get to know you.
Think about it: what's the worst that can happen? The woman could reject you or she might have a boyfriend. Does that sound like the end of the world?;
, A lot of guys are afraid of approaching women because they just can't think of what to say first. How about, ""Hi, I'm Mark -- what's your name?""

Treat it like any other conversation -- except that this one has romantic possibilities.


Look her in the eye, tell her who you are, and ask her name. If she's with friends, talk to them too, and don't make them feel left out.

, Once you and the girl start talking, you should try to touch her within the first half hour of the conversation, if things are going well. The sooner you can get yourself out of the Friend Zone and establish that you have a romantic connection, the better. If things are going well, lightly tap the girl's knee, touch her arm, or give her a playful touch on the shoulder. Keep it light and fun, or she may get turned off if you're moving too fast.


Try moving a bit closer to her and see how she responds. If she doesn't pull back, then it's likely she's into you.

, Save all the serious talk for later. If you want to really woo a woman, then you have to keep things fun and light. To be playful, just don't take yourself or your conversation too seriously. Crack jokes. Tease her. Make everything feel lighthearted and stick to fun and easy topics, like your pets, a concert you went to, a ridiculous celebrity scandal in the news, or just anything fun and breezy.


This doesn't mean you have to stop being yourself to act like a ""chill"" guy, but it does mean you should avoid the serious stuff off the bat.

, Though girls like to be asked questions because it shows an interest in them (more on that later), don't immediately start asking the girl a million questions or she'll feel like she has all the pressure to keep the conversation going. You're supposed to be wooing her, not the other way around. Your rule of thumb should be not to ask more than two questions in a row. You're supposed to be wowing her with your conversational abilities, not making her pick up all the slack.


Many people like to ask a ton of questions to immediately search for common ground, panicking that they will have nothing to talk about. Well, don't worry so much about having things in common -- work on getting the attraction going first. After that, your common interests will come up naturally.

, If you want the girl to be interested in you, then you can't tell her the 50 most interesting things about yourself in the first 5 minutes of the conversation. Make her work for it. Don't be an open book, or she'll think that it's easy for anyone at all to find out everything about you. If you wait to dole out the important things about yourself, she'll feel more special and privileged when you do.


Sure, you can talk a bit about your friends and family, but don't tell her all about your biggest regret, your dreams for the future, or your most traumatic childhood moment. If you keep things a little mysterious, she'll only want to see you more.

, If you want the girl to feel wooed and to stay interested, then, well, you have to let her know how you feel about her -- at least, a little bit. When the moment is right, give her a sincere compliment that makes her see that you're really paying attention. Make it specific, and don't just focus on her appearance. She'll be really impressed by your ability to find what's special about her, whether you're complimenting her personality or something else that makes her special. Here are some things you can say:


""You're so easy to talk to. I feel like I can say anything to you.""
""You're really good at making people feel comfortable right away. How do you do that?""
""You have the most amazing laugh I've ever heard. Wow.""

, Once you've gotten to know each other a bit and the girl is starting to feel properly wooed, you can start to dig deeper to find things you have in common. Let it arise naturally in the conversation. If she mentions where she's from, you can ask if she likes the baseball team from her city; don't force it. Once you find some things you have in common, the woman will feel more connected with you. Here are some places where you can find common ground:


Sports teams
Travel experiences
Hobbies
Passions
Family
Pets

, If you want the girl to feel wooed, then she can't feel like you take yourself too seriously. Make a joke at your own expense and show that you're aware that you're not the world's most perfect man. She'll really appreciate that you're lighthearted enough to have a good time instead of worrying about impressing her every five seconds. It'll take the pressure off, and she'll be even more charmed by you.


This doesn't mean you should make a million self-deprecating comments. You don't want her to feel like you have low confidence.

, Once you're comfortable with each other, you can begin to tease the girl a bit. Make her feel like you're just having a good time and not trying too hard to impress her. This doesn't mean you shouldn't still be nice to her, but you can poke fun at her, too, if you don't offend her and go about it the right way. Just be playful and light. Tease her for wearing pink. Make fun of her funky boots while making it clear you actually like them. Laugh at her obsession over her two cats.


As long as you're both teasing each other, this will help you win the woman over. Don't let it get too one-sided.

, To woo a woman, you have to know how to flirt with her. This goes along with teasing her and being playful. Look her in the eyes, smile at her, and look away occasionally. Give her a playful tap on the arm. Tease each other. Look into her eyes as you laugh. Joke around with her and don't be too obvious about how much you like her -- while letting her see that you have fun with her.


Don't be nervous about trying to flirt. The more you try it, the more natural it will feel.

, If you want to keep the girl interested, then you have to let her know she's special. Once you're talking for a bit, open up to her just enough so that she feels like you think she's different from other girls. Tell her about how much you love your little brother. Reveal a silly childhood memory if it comes up. Don't say anything too deep, of course, but just give her something you wouldn't tell somebody who you just met.


This will make the girl feel like you realize that she's special. You can even say something like, ""I've never told that to anyone before"" or ""I haven't thought about that in a long time…""

, To really woo a woman, you have to be able to show her a good time. Take her out in style, not just to the bowling alley. Pick her up, be on time, and plan something fun and exciting for you to do together. Go for a run together. Check out the new farmer's market and then cook a meal from the food you got at home. Go see a 3-D movie and then hit up a hookah lounge. Find something fun and unique that makes the girl feel special and like you actually put some effort into the date.


Pick a place where you'll need to make some reservations. She'll see that you actually put some thought into this one.

, If you really want to woo a woman, then you have to put on your gentleman hat. Hold doors open for her. Let her walk in front of you when you walk into a building. Avoid being overly vulgar. Have stellar manners. Do what you can to make her feel like a true lady without acting too old-fashioned. If you're walking down the street, walk on the side nearest the street. Don't show up late. It's not about acting like a false version of yourself -- it's about making her feel like you've put time and care into your time together.


Part of this means that you should mind your appearance, too. Put in an effort to how you look, if you want the girl to feel like you care.

, If you want to woo a woman, then you have to be able to charm her. Being charming means being able to show a real interest in people while making them laugh, feel lighthearted, and feel swept off their feet. If you want to charm the woman, then you have to work hard to make her happy, keep things interesting, and to show that you really care about what she's thinking. Start dancing with her in the street. Bring her a hand-picked bouquet of flowers. Find a cute nickname for her. Do whatever you can to make her feel charmed and special.

, If you want to woo a woman, then you've got to give her a healthy dose of affection. This means you should put your arm around her, give her kisses from time to time (if you're at that point), and hold or squeeze her hand when the time is right. This does not mean that you should be all over her every time that you're together, but it does mean that you should find key moments to let her know that you care.


If you're at that level, you can even do some cuddling or snuggling!

, If you really want to woo a woman, then you have to take the time to listen to what she has to say. Don't just zone out whenever she talks, waiting for your moment to say something. Make sure you really hear what she's saying, that you make eye contact and pay attention when she talks to you, and that you respond appropriately when the time calls for it. Most guys could use some improvement in the listening department, and she'll be impressed by your ability to really care about what she has to say.


Don't try to solve her problems. She may just want someone to listen, not for someone to think he knows what's best for her.
Remember what she tells you so you can bring it up later in the conversation -- or even the next day. She will be very impressed.

, If you want to woo a woman, then you have to make her feel like she's the only woman in the world. Show her that you recognize what makes her unique and that you care about her as a person, not just as arm candy. Here are some ways to really make her feel special:


Write her a loving letter just because you feel like it.
Tell her why she's not like other girls.
Give her a little gift even if there's no special occasion.
Do her a favor when she's having a busy week.
Ask her opinion about something you want to do.
Show an interest in her life and ask her lost of questions about it.
Take her dancing, or do something else with her that she's always wanted to do.

"
"
Observe her behavior.,
Talk to her friends.,
Listen to her.",How to Wow a Girl2," It is easier to wow a girl if you know her personality. Watch how she interacts with other people and how she interacts with you. Pay attention to her personal style, the things that make her laugh, and what her interests are.


You can do something special for her based in what you know about her.
You can also gauge her interest in you to see if she treats you any differently than she treats her friends. If she is more touchy feely, laughs at all of your jokes, or smiles more when you are around, she probably likes you.

, Get to know her friends and learn their names. Her friends are important to her. If her friends like you, she is more likely to be into you. She will also be impressed that you took the time to get to know them.They can also give you clues about her personality and things that she likes.
You do not necessarily have to spend time with her friends. Just be friendly and kind to them.
Also watch your behavior when her friends are around.

, Do not dominate the conversation by talking about yourself. You will come across as self-centered. Ask her questions about her life. Find out what she likes and dislikes.Make eye contact and give her your full attention when she is talking.
Ask her open ended questions and follow up questions during the conversation. For example, ask her “How was your day?” instead of “Did you have a good day?”

"
"
Be assertive.,
Give her a gift.,
Plan a date.,
Compliment her.,
Take interest in similar topics.",How to Wow a Girl3," Girls like someone that is direct and forward. Show her that you can take charge. This does not mean that you should be pushy or disrespectful. Just be clear about your intentions and your interest in her. This applies to all stages of the relationship.Ask her for her phone number or ask her out on a date. Take action and do not wait for her to make the first move.Start a conversation with her on social media first. Like some of her photos and posts.
When you take initiative, you are showing her that you are confident.

, A gift shows that you are generous and thoughtful. It is even better if you give the gift for no reason at all. Do not wait for a birthday or a holiday. Try to give her something that you know she will like or that you have heard her mention. It does not have to be something big.


If she mentioned a certain flower she likes or her favorite type of dessert, get it for her.
Thoughtful gifts from the heart are often more impressive than grand gestures. If she had a bad day, give her a card and some candy to cheer her up.Write her a poem or bake her some cookies.

, If you ask her out, plan a date that you know she will love instead of asking her what she would like to do. If you have done your homework, you can plan something that you know she will like. This will make her feel special and shows that you are attentive and want to make her happy.


You might say, “I know you love Mexican food. Let’s go to that new restaurant on Friday and then go see that new movie you have been talking about. I will pick you up at 7:00.”
Invite her to the school dance or to go the football game with you.
Ask her if she wants to go the movies with you and your friends.
If you are not allowed to date, ask her to sit with you at a pep rally or school assembly or eat lunch with you.

, Give her genuine compliments that are specific to her. Do not compliment her just for the sake of doing it. She will be able to tell if you are being genuine.You may say, “I like what you did to your hair today” or “That shirt looks great. It really brings out the color of your eyes.”
If she did well on a test or an assignment, tell her congratulations or that she did a great job.

, You do not have to change yourself completely to impress her, but be willing to indulge some of her interests. If she loves a certain TV show or music artist, check them out. If she loves a certain author, read a summary of some of the books so you have something to talk about.Also be open to doing things just because she likes them. Go shopping with her or go see a movie that you normally wouldn’t see.
Do not tell her that you watched a movie or read a book just to impress her. Let her think that you are really interested. Just casually say, “Hey, have you heard One Direction’s new song? It’s really good.”

Always let her know you love her.",How to Win a Girl's Heart," Let the relationship develop at its own pace. Coming on too strong early will almost certainly creep her out. Gradually get stronger feelings for her as you go on with the relationship together.;
, Most girls like people with confidence, not an ego. Just walk up to her and start a simple conversation. She'll get the hint that you are interested in her. Start with a simple conversation starter:


""That's a really nice dress. Where is it from?""
""I'm sorry, I'm new here. Can you tell me where the library is?""
""Hi, my name is . You look like you're interesting to talk to. Do you mind if I steal a couple minutes of your time?""

, This is not the same thing as flirting with other girls, which is probably not a good move. Being around other girls tells the girl that you're really interested in that other girls find you safe, reliable, and easy to be around. If you get other girls to indirectly vouch for you like this, you've made a big step.


Make friends with her friends if it's not too big of a step. We know that it can be overwhelming, but just try. If her friends like you, you'll have a better chance of winning her over. After all, girls often turn to their friends for advice and for a second opinion. Make sure they have a high opinion of you.

, Women take pride in smelling clean and looking kempt! That means if a man has good hygiene, it works really well on her. The opposite, bad hygiene, is usually an immediate deal-breaker. Believe it or not, fresh, clean-smelling hair is a really good thing. And, a fresh-smelling body is a must-have. Here are three things that you can do right now to improve your hygiene:


Rain or shine, sweat or not, shower daily. If you can afford it, it's better to be too-clean than not clean enough. Take pride in how clean you are and in smelling nice. Especially if you play sports, this step is a must.






Shave or groom your facial hair daily. Most women like men who don't carry facial hair: it's prickly and unlikely to look good unless you're an adult. So shave that stubble away every day.






Use deodorant, not cologne. A lot of guys think they can ""mask"" the scent of their natural body odor with cologne. Instead, the BO and cologne just mixes together to create a very bad odor. Girls would rather not smell you at all than smell this cologne-creation. If you must spray on cologne, spray it on very lightly.







, But don't take advantage of this. Let her be your best friend first, then ease into things. A girl needs to know that she can trust you, and that you're not going to break her heart because you really do care about her. Girls love to laugh and will laugh at anything you say, even if its not funny.

, Compliments, flirting, teasing, carefulness -- none of it matters unless you truly do care. When you do decide to compliment her, take time to reflect on what you like about her, summon up the courage to tell her, and be sincere.


It's okay to disagree with her, as long as you don't threaten her, you respect her opinion, and you offer good reasons about why you believe differently. Who knows? She might even respect you more for speaking your mind, because it shows how much of an individual you are.

, Show that you're not simply crushing or lusting for her. Ask her about herself, talk to her. Don't just move in for the kiss. Listen to her and look her in the eye.

, Complimenting a girl is tough: every person wants to feel good about themselves, but the right compliment is really hard to come by. Not only that, a little complimenting goes a long way. Pay attention to these guidelines when you're ready to start showing you like her more than just a friend:


Reinforce how she views herself. If she thinks of herself as an athlete, reinforce her competitive spirit or athletic skills. If she thinks of herself as a thinker, praise her smarts. Whatever she thinks of herself as, compliment that aspect of her the most.
Stick with safe compliments about her personality. Don't compliment her feminine areas, or too much about her looks; while girls want to feel pretty, they also want to feel like you respect them just as much for their smarts and personality. If you do want to compliment a girl on her looks, stick to these areas:

Smile
Hair
Eyes
Lips
Clothes
Style


Try out some compliments like these. They're a rough sketch, so try to think of your own that are more appropriate for the occasion and the girl.

""I'm sorry this is pretty awkward, but I get really nervous around pretty girls.""
""Maybe you get this a lot, but I love the way your mind works.""
""I like how the color of your eyes matches your dress. Does one of your parents also have blue eyes?""



, Do this by looking at them as much as you can when you're talking with her. It wouldn't be a bad idea to do this for every woman you meet.

, You've probably started flirting with her a little bit by complimenting her and talking with her. Now it's time to step it up a notch and really show her what your game is about.


Whatever you do, visualize success and be confident. You can't flirt if you're not confident in your abilities to win her over. So do whatever gets you pumped up, or wait until you've scored the winning touchdown or won the science fair, and start flirting.
Break the touch barrier. Gently start touching her in safe, non-threatening areas. Touch her hand lightly when you make a point or tell the kicker to a joke; rub her back quickly when you're reassuring her about something; touch the top of her shoulder when you want to get her attention.






Playfully tease her. Preferably, tease her about something that she's confident about or good at, so that she knows that you're teasing her instead of insulting her. If she's great at school, for example, say something like ""I wouldn't want to be on a science project with you, because that means I'd be pulling all the slack.""

, It's a waste of time and gets a relationship headed in the wrong direction. If you try to start a relationship on something false (like you say you've had a multi-year relationship yet you've never even had a girlfriend), that is most likely where you will end up. If you think the girl is only in the relationship for one thing, and you're in it for another, don't just play along to keep her with you. Tell her what you're looking for and try to make her see what really counts.


Don't play hard to get unless you're sure it'll work. Believe it or not, some guys try to play hard to get. And most of the time, it fails because the girl misinterprets his distance for coldness.

, Most girls want to have someone they can trust and turn to when something goes wrong. And even when she is having a good day, let her know you're interested in how she's doing. If you know that she has plans after work or school, ask her how it went. If you let on that you like her, she'll eventually pick up on the hints. You don't even have to come out and say it.


If you say you're going to do something, do it. If you talk the talk, be prepared to walk the walk. Girls (and guys, for that matter) hate it when people say they'll do something but never follow through. Don't be that guy.
Polish your reputation. Don't have the reputation of someone that she might not want to date. That means:

Treating other girls nicely and not harassing them.
Having good friends who are likely and willing to vouch for you when you need it.
Being somebody who is generally well-liked, respected, and admired.



, It makes an even bigger impression if you take it off of your back and give it to her to wear, but make sure it's clean and smells decent. In doing this, you show a girl that you care about her. She will feel safe and cared for.

, Ask her about her day. It's a simple way to show her that you are interested in what she does, and that you do care. When she starts to talk, you must give her your full attention. Look her in the eye. Most importantly, don't interrupt. Ask her questions to show her that you were listening, and offer your opinion if you have one.

, If she gets a perfect score on her math test, be cheerful about it! If she is having a bad day, let her know that you feel her pain and that you want her to feel better. Ask her if there is any way that you can make her feel better.


If you know of a surefire way to cheer her up, use it when she's down. Maybe she likes a special kind of fro-yo that's only available two towns south. Maybe she's excited about teddy-bears that they make her laugh. Whatever it is, go the extra mile to help show her what she means to you.







, Everyone has something they don't like about the person they love, but if you have too many big things on that list, that's trouble. You need to love her for the things that make her special, for her uniqueness. Tell her so.


If she's insecure about something, for example, you'd have a golden opportunity to make her feel better. Say something like: ""I love your freckles. They really highlight your beauty."" A simple thing like that could boost her spirits and show her that you like her for the right reasons.
Be especially careful about her insecurities. Most girls (and guys, too) are insecure about some aspect of their personality and/or looks. As you get to know her, you'll probably come to know and understand that insecurity more. Don't call attention to it, be forgiving of it, and encourage her to look at all the other traits that make her wonderful.

, You can actually directly say that. Girls love to be complimented and to know that they are beautiful, but don't overdo it, particularly in a new friendship. Just saying something like, ""You look really nice today"" will make her happy. As long as you're sincere and mean it. If you are not, they will not trust your opinion on other things.

, Share interesting things that you're thinking, or stories about people you've come across. You've probably asked a lot of questions about her, but maybe she doesn't know all that much about you. Share the parts of yourself that you're comfortable sharing, and maybe even the parts of yourself you're still scared to reveal.


If she's shown parts of herself that are vulnerable, don't be afraid to show her little bits of pieces of yourself that you're vulnerable about, too.
Put yourself in her shoes. What does she like talking about? How does she respond to criticism? What makes her different than other girls? What does she pride herself on? Answer these questions from her perspective and plan accordingly.

, Getting to the date stage is the hardest part. Once you've gone on a few dates, you'll find out pretty quickly whether she's still the stuff of your dreams. But getting there can be difficult. Luckily, you're confident, calm, and you have a plan:


You don't have to say it's a date to ask her out. Things can get awkward if you call it a date. Instead, say something like: ""Hey, so I got two tickets to that new movie on Saturday, and my friend bailed. Would you want to go?""
Increases your chances of success on a date by doing something exciting, something that raises her heart rate. Maybe a haunted house, or a theme park with roller coasters, or a horror movie. Dates that are exciting have a better chance of promoting a bond between you two because you feel like you've been through something together.
Be a gentleman. Open doors for her, be on time, pay for the date, and don't expect a kiss on the first date. Move at her pace and make her feel comfortable. If you make her feel comfortable at every step, she should melt into your arms.

, Love who she is, inside and out. And show it. This is the most important step. If she knows you love her she will be more keen on the relationship.

Take time and consider her. Do you like her solely based on looks? Chances are, you won't make it far in a relationship. If you like her based on her personality, you'll have a much better chance.;
, I know it sounds like rushing, but if you go into a relationship knowing that you're going to break up two weeks later, what's the point of setting yourself up for heartbreak? If you think that you could end married to this girl, ask her out. If not, you're only breaking your own heart, and hers.

, Find out what her interests are. Does she like soccer? Reading? Is she a girly girl, or more tomboyish? Is she a Christian? Is she shy? What music does she like? Find out more about her and see what kind of interests/views you have in common.

, Before you ask her out, you have to realize that girls like guys that have confidence, but they understand shyness. So, be yourself. If you act like something you're not, she's going to find out sooner or later, so just be yourself. If she doesn't like you for who you are, then so be it. She may just not be right for you, and there's plenty of other women out there. And be aware that some shy girls may be kind of scared by someone too confident, so find a balance.

, This makes it alot easier to know her interests and talk casually to her. Make sure that she knows you are affectionate to her if she is upset. Girls love guys with emotion, so by becoming friends with her, you can show that you have alot of emotion and you are kind.

, No matter what other people say, no girl wants to go out with a guy that doesn't have enough guts to ask her out in person. True, it might be easier for you because you don't have to deal with the pressure of her being there, but it's so much worse for her, because she doesn't know what to say after that. It's much more natural in person.Plus, there is more of a chance to get that ""no"" when she doesn't feel that you really mean it.

, If you cannot ask her out in person, then call her up. At least you're really talking, not using childish abbreviations and emoticons on Facebook. Tell her how you feel about her. Let her know that you'll always be there for her. Don't tell her you love her right away, because depending on how long you've known her, that's a little creepy. Be honest with her, and be yourself, and it will come naturally. Also, when asking a girl out and you don't have a lot of self confidence you just have to be a man and say ""Hey I like/love you and I really would like to get to know you better"" and if she says no, then just be like she couldn't handle all this awesomeness, because you are awesome and you should know it.

, (EX:a guy who hates doing whatever the girl is passionate about.)

, she will probably say no, but if you lay it gently like,""Hey (insert name here), I know we're just friends but will you go out with me?"" She may say no to even this, but don't be so discouraged, keep on trying, not too often though.

He may be perfectly happy with how your friendship is going, and not have any inclination towards changing your relationship at all. On the other hand, he may very well feel exactly the same as you, and be wondering about your feelings toward him.


Start noticing how he acts around you. If he seems suddenly fidgety or self-conscious around you, this could be a sign that his feelings toward you are evolving into something more.
Notice his body language: does he open the door for you, touch the small of your back, or look at you more often? If so, your feelings for him might be reciprocated.Does he talk to you about other girls, or does he treat you like one of the guys? If so, his feelings for you might be more platonic.;
, Your other friends may be able to provide a little insight into whether or not they think your crush may return your feelings. It can be difficult to gauge someone’s interest when you are already close to them as friends. Your friends may be able to give offer some perspective on the situation, and help you decide whether to continue pursuing the relationship or to remain friends.


It is possible that your best friend has newfound feelings for you too, and this new development has become obvious to everyone else but the two of you. If your friends are already asking about the two of you, this is a good sign!Talking to your friends (the ones you can trust to not break your confidence) can help you sort through your own feelings too, and help you to clarify what you want to have happen with your relationship with your best friend.

, Before you tell your best friend that you want more out of the relationship and potentially lose a great friendship, make sure that your own feelings are genuine and not a passing fancy. Even if your friend does feel the same as you, make sure that you’re willing to risk losing your friendship to pursue the romantic relationship.

If you usually wear your hair pulled up, start letting it down.
If you wear perfume, less is more. You want to smell good, but not overpower him with a cloying scent.
Making small changes to your appearance will make your friend notice that there is something different about you. He may not be able to put his finger on it right away, which will make him start to wonder about you and to think about you differently., It’s always best to be honest at the beginning of any relationship. If your best friend feels that he can trust you, he will be more willing to let you in to his heart.


Make your actions match your words, and always be sincere with your reactions., Start acting a little differently around him, such as looking at him often or blushing around him. He will eventually pick up on the difference, and he may catch on that you like him.


If you usually spend a lot of time together, pick up a new hobby, or start spending more time with your girlfriends. He may miss you and wonder about you more. After all, absence makes the heart grow fonder, as the saying goes.By trying new things and being interesting, not only will you be more intriguing to your crush, you will have fun!

, After all, you want to take your already genuine and healthy friendship to the next level, so don’t try to act like someone that you’re not. Try to remain the same around him as you did before you realized you liked him. Try to talk to him normally, even if you do feel that your feelings for him must be so obvious that they’re written all over your face.


Keep your life full of the things that make you feel happy and fulfilled. A relationship should add to your already full and whole life. Be careful that you don’t expect your potential new relationship with your best friend to “complete” you., Avoid allowing your feelings towards him to hamper your friendship. Remember friendship is the key, and that most good relationships start with and are based on a strong friendship first and foremost.


Always be there for him, listen to him, and be loyal to him. Forgive him if he hurts your feelings, and offer support to him when he needs it., Act playfully when you’re around your crush, and joke with him. When you are interested in someone, you can feel awkward and uncertain, so be careful that you don’t start acting strangely around him.Continue to be the same funny, good-humored girl that he has always known you to be, but be just a little more sexy and flirtatious.
Increase physical contact with him, such as giving him longer hugs than usual, and touch his arm while you’re talking.
Tilt your head flirtatiously when you talk to him, and play with your hair.

, If you get invited to a party or dance, ask him to join you as your date. Take care to make it clear that you’re not asking him to accompany you as a favor from a friend.


Do your best to look amazing, like he’s never seen you dress before. He’s more likely to see you in a different light if you make a drastic change to your appearance for this one special occasion.

, Make eye contact with him while he’s talking and listen attentively. A directed gaze such as this communicates to the other person that you find them interesting and appealing. Laugh, smile often, and sit close to him when you’re together.Use his whole face as a focal point while you are listening to him, and if you feel like you are staring, look away for a moment as if in deep thought, or move your gaze to another part of his face., Set aside a time to talk to him, in a place where you are both comfortable. It will be scary telling him how you feel, since you are putting yourself out there without being sure of his feelings for you. That being said, do your best to take the drama out of it, or you will only make him uncomfortable, especially if he has no idea what’s coming.Make sure that you tell him how you feel at an appropriate time, when neither of you is stressed out or in a hurry.
Share a story with him, either about yourself or a favorite memory of the two of you. Sharing a memory with him will naturally help you open up to him, and will give him a sense of belonging with you.
Keep it short and sweet. You can say “Hey, I like hanging out with you” or “you mean a lot to me. Do you want to take our friendship to the next level?”

, If he says no, remember to accept and understand his response, whatever it may be. Your ability to understand and respect each other is most likely one of the reasons why you both became friends in the first place. Also, give yourself some credit, because telling your best friend you have feelings for him is a brave thing to do!


If he says no, but you both still want to remain friends, give yourself and him a few days to get past any lingering awkwardness.
Even if his response is what you were hoping for, your interactions with each other are likely to be awkward for a little while as each of you figures out how to act as you move from friends into a relationship.

Don't go for a shy girl, as this method will have no impact.,
Have the proper amount of cologne on—not too much or too little.

,
Get a tan and make sure you look your best.

,
Smile, look at her and—when she looks at you—look away,; she will think you like her.

,
Walk up and say the best word of all time to her: “Hi!”

,
Get to know her first: name, age, and (if you're on vacation) where she is staying.

,
Talk to her a while before asking her how her love life is, if she is single, say oh me to.,
Now start using your best pickup line, for example: “Hey, I just realized this, but you look a lot like my next girlfriend!” This is a stupid one, but might be effective.

,
Now that she is getting to like you, it might be time to ask for her phone number; say you would like to see her again and ask her if she wants to go to get together soon—be specific.

,Now that she's on a date with you, find something to talk about for the next hour and a half; if you're not a great small-talker, consult a guide on how to talk to girls

Make sure to use your words in person.,
Set the mood.,
Ask her a good question.,
Keep complimenting her, when appropriate.,
Start describing the not-too-scandalous things you want to do to her.,
Make her feel special.,
Say that you want her.,
Say something nice about her body.,
Say what you want to do to her.,
Say what you want her to do to you.,
Describe how she makes your body feel.,
Reveal your fantasies.,
Consider sending her a message later to keep her feeling sexy.",How to Turn a Girl on With Words," When you are getting a girl turned on using words it's important that she can hear your voice; don't try to get a girl hot and steamy over MSN, IM, or through texting. It can be done, but your words will have a much better effect if the girl you are talking to can hear the sexy tones in your voice.


Try to use your deepest-sounding voice when you talk to your girl. Studies show that men with deep voices have more sexual partners and that females are more attracted to men with deep voices.Now, that doesn't mean you should lower your voice if it sounds unnatural, because that won't turn your girl on. But if you're always in the higher pitched level of your voice, try to go down to the lower level when you're talking with your girl.;
, When you start talking to her, it's important to set the mood for the entire conversation by saying things like ""I can't stop thinking about you,"" or ""I've been wanting to hear your voice all day."" This will help establish closeness, and let her know that you're feeling intimate. Make sure you’re alone and in a comfortable, sexy environment; you may not want to turn her on in public.


Other things to say are: ""I never knew it until I spent time away from you, but I missed you today,"" or ""You look stunning, as usual."" Keep it short and sweet; a very elaborate compliment might come off wrong or be misinterpreted by her.
Don't compare her to other women. Even if what you're saying is that she's smarter, or prettier, or more fun to be around, avoid the comparison. She doesn't even want you to compare her to other women, because she doesn't want you to think about other women. She wants you to think about only her. If she thinks you may be thinking about other women, it's a turn-off for her.

, Ask her something that will give her a chance to give a long answer, like ""So tell me about what you did today,"" or ""What exciting things do you have planned for the weekend?"" This will get her talking and will show her that you care.


Asking her a good question will show her that you're interested in what she has to say. Girls want to be sexy and interesting; for her, a good conversation is a way to set the tone.
If she answers with a short answer, pepper her with more questions, showing her you care and really want to know. You want to get her on a roll, talking about things she's interested about, all while you're doing a good job listening.
Be funny and playful, if you can. Girls love guys with a sense of humor, along with guys who know how to have fun. If you're making her laugh and keeping her on the tips of her toes, it'll be easier to turn her on. Look up and practice some jokes you think she might like, or start developing your own inside jokes with her that you can lean on when you know you need a laugh.

, If she asks you how your day was, let her know that you were thinking about her. Add a slight twist by complimenting her features. Don't make it too smutty though. Something like ""I couldn't stop thinking about you and your sexy smile"" does the job.


Keep the conversation going by asking questions about her and showing interest in her answers. The way that you start turning her on is by dropping plenty of little compliments. Make sure you think of little things to say just about her to make her feel special.
Girls like it when you notice something about them that they also like. So if you know she likes the color of her eyes, compliment the color of her eyes (""I love the way your eyes shine when you smile""). If she likes her hair, say something like ""Your hair looks so smooth and comfortable, do you know how pretty it makes you look?""
Start making the compliments slightly more sexy. If she is saying things like ""Stop!"" or ""You don't mean that"" while giggling, keep giving her the sexy compliments. You're definitely on the right path.

, Make sure that the things you are saying are sexy and romantic, not dirty and gross. You don’t want to come on too strong when you just start talking about what you want to do; you need to build up anticipation first.


You will need to come up with your own suggestions, but an example might be: ""If we were together, I'd run my fingers slowly through your hair while we kissed. I'd massage your back while I kissed your neck. I would lie next to you and trace my fingers over the soft curves of your beautiful body."" etc. Be creative. Using lots of imagery and imaginative words can also help.
Here are some other compliments that you can use: ""I thought about you when I woke up today. Just like I thought about you when I went to sleep last night. You know what I was thinking about? I was thinking about us, together, curled up in bed. That makes me happy.""
Something else you might say: ""You give me goosebumps. Every time you touch me I go crazy inside, because I know it's only you who can do that to me. No one else does that. Even a smile from you is like a punch in the gut, but in a good way.""

, In your own way, make her feel like the sexiest woman alive. Get her thinking sexy thoughts about you and it's guaranteed that she won’t stop thinking about you when the conversation is over. This is the most important thing when it comes to turning your girl on; you don’t want her to feel like a piece of meat.


While you try to turn her on with your words, make sure you let her see that you wouldn’t talk to just any girl this way. Let her see how lucky you feel to be with her.

, One of the most basic things you can say when you want to turn up the heat are these simple words: “I want you.” You can add other variations, but saying this makes the girl see how much you want to be physically close with her and may be enough to turn her on. Look her in the eyes and show that you’re not shy about saying what you want and need. Here are some other things you can say:


“I want you so bad right now.”
“I’ve been wanting you all day long.”
“I’ve never wanted you so badly in my life.”
“That dress you’re wearing makes me want you more than ever.”

, As you move forward, you can compliment your girl’s body in a less-PG way. As long as you’re sure she’s playing along and that she would welcome compliments about parts of her body other than her face, you can start to take it up a notch by complimenting the parts of her body that turn you on. Just make sure you’re not offending her and that your comments are welcome. Here are some things you can say:


“Your chest looks amazing in that dress.”
“Your legs are incredible.”
“I love the way your hips are moving.”

, Now that you’ve described what you want to do to your girl’s body, you can go a step further and tell her what you’d like to do to her body. You can be a bit more graphic if you want, but in general, just say enough to have her imagine you having your hands all over her body, which should be more than enough to turn her on. Here are some things you can say:


“I want to run my hand down your thighs.”
“I can’t wait to kiss the nape of your neck.”
“I want to caress and kiss every part of your body.”

, Now, as you continue to turn your girl on with your words, you can tell her what you wish she would do to you. This would paint a sexy image in her mind and will have her turned on in no time at all. Of course, make sure she has done many of these things before so you don’t surprise her or come off sounding too graphic or explicit. Here are some things you can say to her:


“I want you to take my shirt off.”
“I want you to kiss my chest and shoulders.”
“I want you to get on top of me and start kissing my neck.”

, If you want to turn your girl on, then you should have no shame about telling her how turned on you are just by the sight of her. She’ll be turned on just by the idea that being around her is making you turned on. Here are some ways you can tell her how she makes you feel:


“I am so turned on just by being around you.”
“You make me so excited.”
“My whole body is tingling just from looking at you. You have no idea how good you make me feel.”

, Another way to turn your girl on is to tell her some fantasies you have about being with her. They can be related to role-playing, can be about explicit things you’d like to do to her or would like her to do to you, or can be about a place where you’ve always wanted to hook up. Don’t be afraid to tell her what you’ve always dreamed about and see if you can make it come true together.


Let her reveal her fantasies, too. This can turn both of you on even more.

, Though turning your girl on with words is best done in person, you can leave her feeling sexy even after you’ve said your goodbyes by sending her a sexy text message later on in the day that shows her that you’re still thinking of her and her body. Keep it sweet and simple but also make sure there’s enough subtext to get her turned on and ready for your next encounter. Here are some things you can say:


“I can’t stop thinking about what happened last night. I can’t wait to see you again.”
“When I close my eyes, all I see is your gorgeous body.”
“I had such an amazing time with you last night. I can’t wait to have you in my arms again.”

Make sure you and he are very close friends.,

Choose the sympathy method if you are afraid he'll freak out and if you are very worried about it.

When your guy friend asks what is wrong, cover your face or start crying (if you can).,
Tell him things like: ""I have a been keeping a secret from you.,
Tell him.,
Give it some time.,

Make it as obvious as possible.,
Make sure he doesn't like anyone else first.,
Send him secret little notes telling him that someone he knows likes him.,
Own up.,
Be generous.",How to Tell Your Guy Friend You Like Him More Than As a Friend," You should be able to joke around with each other, have fun, and at times have serious conversations without judging the other. If this foundation isn't there, it's not worth the effort of making a move on him.

,;
, If his friends are around, guys typically don't have natural reactions to things of this sort.

, Not your love for him but just love. You can talk about it in any way that you want.

, Try not to act shy, even if you feel it inside which you probably will. Act casually, just a simple ""I like you more than a friend."" Will be okay and maybe you could even act distressed and explain you've wanted to get it out there for a while now. He'll probably take it better that way. The stressed out behavior is best for if you want to go a step further and enter a relationship with him.

, In the moment, you'll want to, but don't! This can lead to failed relationships! You have to give him time, a few weeks or maybe even a month for it to sink in and for him to be more comfortable with the fact you love him. Then you can ask him.


On the other hand, if you don't want to date him, but you just want to get it out there, then you can continue normally with him, be happy knowing that he knows the secret you've kept from him.

,, You can do this easily by looking worried and talking to him less than normal.

, Then you can tell him: ""We have to talk"".

, I just have to let you know, I can't keep this to myself any longer"". Make him think it's worse than it actually is.

, By this point, he could be thinking that you are dying or something, so it is safe to confess your love. He might even laugh or sigh in relief because your crush was probably nothing compared to what he thought!

, If you want to be something more, maybe a few weeks later you could ask him out. Make sure not to freak him out; drop subtle hints a few days before, so when you ask him, he's prepared.

,, Most definitely don't go over the top. Gradually (and by gradually, this means over several weeks), lead into more intense flirting.

, So by this point, you and your guy friend have been flirting on a regular basis. And this does mean weeks. Now drop compliments if you haven't already. Then stare at him (let him catch you) and when he looks, turn away quickly and blush if you can.

, Then break it to him that you have a crush on him. By this stage, you don't have to wait any more weeks for it to have sunk in. Just wait about a day or two and ask him if he wants to be more than just friends.

, You can find this out by saying I've been single for a while. He might be single, or open to a relationship (but avoid cheating - see warnings below). A conversation might start up about your ex- boyfriend, etc. Be sure to let him know you're single if he doesn't already know. You don't want him thinking you're already taken.

, That way, if he's your friend, he'll likely tell you how he feels about the notes. Or, he will keep it to himself, in which case, you'll need to work it out from his behavior. For example, try watching him opening the note and see his reaction to it. Reasonable reactions to the note include looking around before he opens it, then reading it for what seems like a longer time than needed then looking to see if he can find who sent it.

, If he tells you he wants to know who it is, tell him that you are the one who sent the notes.


If he told you about the notes and tells you that he thinks whoever is sending him the notes is a freak, he may just be saying it because he doesn't want to admit that he's hopeful that it might be someone he liked. Decide whether you want to tell him. Or be bold and refer to yourself as ""that freak"" and have it sorted there and then. He may be shocked enough to admit he likes you and will apologize. If not, be a good sport and you will still be good friends and maybe something will happen in the future.

, Once you tell him that it was you, also tell him that he doesn't have to like you back and that you hope that this will not ruin your friendship.


If he doesn't feel the same way, just say that you hope that the moment hadn't ruined the friendship.
Don't worry about it if he's not willing to take things deeper. There are so many more guys in this big world. If it doesn't work out that, you can still stay friends.

Keep an eye out for eye contact.Eye contact is one of the most powerful things in all of body language.,
See if your crush smiles at you.,
Notice any affectionate touching.,
Watch if he tries to make himself look good around you.Body language is the main unconscious way we show attraction for other people.,
Ask yourself if he goes out of his way to be near you.A natural urge when you fancy someone is the desire to be around them as much as you can.",How to Tell if Someone Fancies You1," Someone can use their eyes to communicate a lot of things. If someone's making eyes at you, it means he's interested in you in some way. If you see a longer pattern of eye contact, there's a chance he fancies you.


You might try catching him looking at you.It's natural for someone to look in the direction of his crush, especially when he thinks no one is watching. In you're in the same room and you're not talking yet, look over occasionally to see if he's making eyes at you. If he's shy, he'll probably avert his gaze. If he's confident, he'll usually try to hold eye contact with you.;
, Like eye contact, smiling can say a ton without someone needing to speak a word. Where eye contact usually just means interest, a smile is usually given to show warmth and affection. Keep an eye out if he smiles at you when the two of you are around each other.


If you want to test it, try making eye contact with him. If he smiles back at you, it's a good sign he's interested.
Some people are very shy and will feel too embarrassed to smile at someone, especially if it's someone they're attracted to.

, Light touching is often a clear form of flirting. This includes a light touch of the arm or waist, or even an extended hug. While friends may already touch often, there's an added coyness when the touching is meant as flirting.


Better still, you can try to touch your crush lightly and see how he reacts. If he seems to like it or feel embarrassed, it's a potential sign he's into you.

, Whether they mean to or not, people will shift their body language to show how they feel. If you run into your crush suddenly, try to see if he changes anything quickly about his body language. This might show that he's specifically interested in you.


Men and women use different types of body language to show attraction. In the case of men, they often try to make themselves look as big and confident as possible. This includes pumping out the chest and putting one's hands on his waist.Women show attraction in more sensual ways. Smiling, hair twirling and coyness might suddenly start up if you end up running into your crush.

, Whether you go to work or school together, or have met in a more casual setting, someone who is attracted to you will often make very obvious attempts to be around you, even if he thinks he's being sneaky about it.

Open up the possibility to talk about personal subjects.,
Flirt.If you're interested in someone who isn't giving off the right signals, you should try flirting with him.,
Tell jokes and gauge how he reacts.Laughter and humour is one of the more casual ways a person can express interest in someone.,
Time how quickly he replies to your messages.,
Ask your crush directly.",How to Tell if Someone Fancies You2," If you're on a regular speaking basis with the person you're wondering about, a conversation will offer lots of opportunities to figure out what he feels towards you. One thing that people who are interested in one another do is often make the conversations more intense, at least moreso than you would find in a casual talk. Personal information, secret fears and painful experiences could come up in a conversation where people are interested in one another. Bring the conversation to more of these intimate subjects and see how he responds. If he seem interested in making the conversation intimate, it's a sign that he's interested in you.

, Flirting includes a wide range of behaviour that is meant to show you are attracted to someone. If you are interested, chances are you're already showing some of the signs without knowing it. Smiling in his direction, holding (or averting) eye contact, laughing, compliments and gentle teasing all count as flirting.


If your crush responds to the flirting with flirtation of her own, it is a probable sign that he is interested.
Of course, if your crush is already flirting towards you, this is an even clearer sign of attraction. Keep your ear out for gentle teasing and compliments towards you, especially when those compliments are geared towards things that someone would normally be attracted to, such as your looks or charm.

, If you are the sort of person who likes to be funny, try to gauge how the person you're curious about reacts to your jokes. Someone who fancies you will laugh a lot more at your humour than if he wasn't interested at all. As a bonus, humour is an attractive quality, and even if someone isn't interested in you yet, knowing how to make you laugh will attract potential partners fast.


On the other hand, a total lack of laughter can suggest the person is not interested in you at all.Beware of those who don't laugh.

, In the age of online communication, the way someone acts towards you online can say a ton about the way he feels towards you. If you two are talking via social media or talking over text, you should notice how quickly he gets back to you in a conversation. If it's relatively fast, it may be good sign that he fancies you in a more-than-friendly way. Keep in mind that some people may be very busy on the computer and won't get back to you as fast as you think. Depending on how fast your crush is making other posts online, you should be able to figure out how busy he is at the moment.

, At last, when all other routes are exhausted, there is always the option of asking someone directly how he feels about you. In many cases, a guy or girl will make their feelings known in other ways, making a direct question unnecessary. However, if you're tired of waiting and need confirmation, it's a straightforward and simple solution.


It doesn't need to be elaborate. Just ask something as simple as: ""I get the feeling you're attracted to me. Am I right in thinking that?""
If someone is easily embarrassed or shy, you might not get a straight answer out of them at first. This is why it's better to ask it in the middle of a conversation rather than going straight up to the person and asking abruptly about it.

"
"
Make sure he's not interested in someone else.,
Get a friend's opinion.,
Ask his friends if they have heard anything.If someone fancies someone, there's a chance that it will come up in a casual conversation between friends.,
Find out what his friends think of you.Groups of friends tend to have a herd mentality in some cases.,
Pay attention to the way he treats you around his friends.",How to Tell if Someone Fancies You3," Although single people may find themselves attracted to multiple prospects at once, finding out whether someone has a crush already can be a big indicator as to his availability. Find out through friends, or keep an eye out for the way he behaves towards people of the opposite sex.

, Everyone is always observing other people's behaviour, whether they mean to or not. If any of your friends know your crush, you should ask them what they think about any potential attraction your crush may have towards you. Even if you are very observant, another person will see things from a different perspective, and may have something to add.


A mutual friend is a great help if you're not sure about the person in question. A friend can offer her opinion on whether she thinks the two of you would be a good match or not.

, If you want a more definite answer but aren't ready to ask your crush directly yet, you should ask his friends what he thinks of you. Sometimes, they may tell you word-for-word what he's said about you. Other times, they might simply give a theory. In either case, it may give you a better idea if a particular someone fancies you or not.


Be warned that some friends may tell your crush that you asked in the first place. If you're trying to keep your curiosity a secret for the time being, this may be a risk.
Generally speaking, girls tend to talk more about their attractions and love lives than guys. However, the same advice can apply to both genders.

, In other words, what your crush's friends think of you will influence what he thinks of you. If his circle of friends is really into you, it's easier to imagine him liking you as well. On the other hand, a circle of friends that doesn't seem to care about you might suggest he feels the same way they do.


It is not recommended to ask anyone directly what they think of you. Many people would rather lie and be polite than risk an uncomfortable interaction. Instead, you should try to ascertain how they feel by observing their reactions to you. Are they making any effort to include you in the conversation? Are they actively listening to the things you're saying, or asking you sincere questions about yourself? It can be difficult to know what someone is really thinking if you have just met them, but you can usually get a general idea by looking at the behaviour of a few friends.

, Even if there are often friendships between genders, someone will undoubtedly treat their crush differently around his friends than he would with a regular friend. If he seems really interested to introduce you to friends, it's may be a sign that he's testing the limits for a potential relationship.


If he seems to ignore you around his friends, it is not a good sign. Although some people will feel nervous about showing affection around their platonic friends, there should always be a basic level of respect at work.
If he's trying to include you in the conversation or activity and has no problem showing affection in front of his friends, it may be a sign that he has a potential interest in you for a relationship.

Break-ups take a while to sink in. If you just got dumped yesterday, you'll obviously still have feelings for him. But it's not time to let him know that right now. Wait a while, process what's happened, and then get back in touch in the future if you still feel the same way. There's always a chance.There's no set time to wait until you get back in touch with an ex, but you need at least enough time to process the break-up. You have to feel like your relationship is actually over. Give it a few weeks at least, and a few months for longer relationships.
Try seeing other people for a while. Explore different relationships to learn more about yourself. If it doesn't work out, at least you'll know.;
, If, after you've waited, you still have feelings for your ex, you need to do some soul-searching. Why did you break up in the first place? What problems were there in the relationship? If you've only been focusing on what you miss about your ex, you may be forgetting about all the problems you had. Now is the time to focus on those problems.


Are the same problems likely to come back up? Were the problems your fault, or his? Have you changed in such a way as to accept his problems, or fixed the problems that you caused? If the same things will happen again, it's not a good idea to get back together.
If your relationship faced big problems, like infidelity or other serious issues, it may be very difficult to get back together at all. Are you willing to forgive him for the major things that he did wrong? Will he be able to forgive you? How can you earn trust back?, You want to give your ex the impression that you're a happy, healthy, sexy, attractive person that he should want to get back with. To do this, start fixing little things about yourself that you'd like to change, now, so you can win him back.


If you had jealousy issues, or partied too much, try to get those things under control. Seek out counseling if necessary, so you can prove to him that you're serious when you say you'll change.
""Because I'm sad"" or ""Because I miss you so much"" are not good reasons to get back together with someone. That's not why you got together in the first place. You want to present yourself in the best possible light., Design your ideal partner. Does your ex fit the bill? Sometimes, we can get stuck in the past a little too much and it can be hard to see what we actually want. Make sure you're not jumping backward and getting into something that's best left dead.


Do you actually want to get back together? If you still have feelings, but don't think it'll work out, it's probably just going to complicate the break-up to tell him. Keep it to yourself.

, If your ex is single, then it's perfectly fine to get in touch and let him know that you still have feelings for him and might want to get back together, as long as that's what you want. If he's seeing someone, you need to wait. It's unfair to his new relationship to interfere and get in the way. Try seeing other people and wait until he's single to talk to him again, if you need to.


In some cases, you may feel you have to let him know that you're still in love with him, even if he's seeing someone. If so, just try to think about how you'd feel if someone pulled that with your boyfriend. You've been warned.

, If you want to talk to him, send him a little message via text, or e-mail to let him know that you're still having thoughts and want to talk to him in person. Just shoot him a short message that says, ""Hey, I've been thinking about you a lot lately. Can we talk sometime soon?""


In some cases, it can be really helpful to try to write out your feelings in a letter. If this is the case, do it, but think twice before you mail it. It might be better to have the talk in person, so you can remember what he's like to be around actually.
Don't try to get back together online. This isn't an appropriate conversation to have via Facebook messenger. Have it in person, or on the phone at least.

, When you arrange to meet, it's important to meet somewhere neutral. If you used to live together, don't try to meet back at your old place, where you'll have lots of old memories. It's important to think about the future objectively, so you don't make a bad decision based on your feelings.


Try a public park, somewhere you can be quiet and have a private conversation, but not somewhere that you'll have a lot of history.

, If you want to get this guy back, it's definitely important to look like someone he'll want to be with. Go the extra mile to look your best that day. Wear clothes that flatter your figure and make you feel good, and do yourself up as if you were going on a date with your boyfriend. Which you might be soon.

, There's no big secret to being honest. If you're still having feelings for him, let him know how you feel. Tell him that you've reflected on your relationship and you think it can work out better, if you get back together, if that's the way you feel. Talk specifically about the challenges you faced in the past and figure out whether or not you'll be able to get past them together.


Just cut to the chase. You don't need to spend a lot of time catching up or trying to make him think you're doing really great. Just tell him the truth. You're missing him, you think you can make it work, and you're a better person now.

, If your relationship ended mutually, you probably don't need to apologize for anything. But if you cheated on your ex, or you did something else that resulted in him ending the relationship, it's important to apologize clearly and definitively.


Be specific when you say you're sorry. Don't just say, ""I'm so sorry."" Try to prove to him that you understand why he would be upset and you're able to see the results of your actions.
Even if you think he did some things wrong that he should apologize for, it's important to keep your ego out of it. Just come right out and apologize. Worry about sorting out the issues later. You want to get your apology out of the way now.

, He might feel the same way, and will let you know. He might feel very differently than you do, and start to unload on you. It's important to listen to what he has to say and try to understand. Even if you don't like what you hear, try to understand where he's coming from. If you just get angry and start another fight, it's unlikely this will go anywhere.


If he says he's still got feelings for you too, talk about what went wrong in your relationship. Try to focus on the problems you had and sort out whether or not you'll be able to make it work again in the future.If he says he's totally over you and doesn't feel the same way, just say, ""I was hoping you'd feel differently, but I'm glad I let you know. I needed you to know. Get in touch if you feel differently.""

, He might need some time to think about what you've told him, and that's a good thing. Don't end by saying, ""So, what do you think?"" or try to demand an answer from him. Just let him know, and then say, ""Please, don't say anything right now. Just take some time to think about it, and then let's get back in touch in a little while. Ok?""


If he is seeing someone, he might need some time to think things over and decide what he wants to do. Give him that time.

, After you let him know how you feel, leave him alone for a while and let him get back in touch. If you've told him and let him know that you want an answer at some point, just leave him alone and let him think until he comes to an answer. There's nothing else you can say at this point that will change his mind. Just lay off.

, After some time has passed, it may be good to meet back at the same spot and have another conversation. Find out if you're still feeling the same way. Find out if he is still feeling the same way. Find out whether or not he thinks it can work again. If so, get back together and start working on your issues.

, Even if you're still having feelings for this guy, it's not good to wait around for him to make a decision. Live your life. Go out with your friends, meet new people, and try to have fun. If you have the opportunity to go on a date, go on one. Don't just wait around for phone calls that may never come. If it does, deal with it then.

, Depending on how long you were together the first time, it can be exciting to rekindle a relationship. But try to start things slow, as if you were starting with a new boyfriend. Don't just jump right back into living together and seeing each other 24/7, unless you're both really comfortable and want to. If you're still a little nervous about the problems you used to have, take it slow.


Just start with easy dates. Go out for coffee, or see a movie together. No big plans and elaborate stuff. Don't make it ""Facebook official"" yet, until you've spend plenty of time together and worked out your stuff.
You might even consider not telling your friends until you've given it a while to make it work. It can be embarrassing to think that you've worked it out, only to break up a week later because of old problems.

, It's essential that you anticipate the problems your relationship use to face and try to head them off before they get in your way. If you notice your boyfriend doing something that used to be a problem when you were together before, talk about it right then and there. Don't wait and let it fester until it becomes a problem.


Expect him to do the same. If you're doing something that drives him nuts, talk about it right there and then. Be open and communicate if you want to save your relationship.

This doesn't mean that you should tell her how hot you think she is the second you've met, but it does mean that she has to see that you're into what she's bringing to the table. Don't be too rude, look around the room, or make her question your motives. Once she knows you're into her, it's up to you to win her over with your words.


Don't worry if you're normally shy about talking to girls. If you act confident when you approach her and are sweet to her right off the bat, she'll respond in a positive way and will make you more relaxed about talking to her.;
, Don't make it too obvious that you're sweet talking her. Don't say, ""Hey, baby, what's up?"" Or, ""What are you up to, hot stuff?"" Or she will want to pull away. Just come right up to her and say, ""Hey, what are you up to?"" Or, ""Hey, I'm _____, what's your name?"" You don't need a smooth pick-up line or to make a big deal about the fact that you're talking to a cute girl you like. Make it feel natural, like you're already friends, and take it from there.


If you act too nervous, formal, or excited about talking to her, you may make her feel a bit nervous, too. The more relaxed and easygoing you are, the better she'll feel.

, Sweet talking a girl can have its limits. If you want to sweet talk her, then you have to stay respectful about not overstepping any boundaries or making her feel uncomfortable. If you don't know her that well, or even if you do, you should avoid saying anything overly sexual or vulgar because she will instantly want to pull away. Instead, respect her boundaries both by not crowding her or sitting too close to her and by not making any comments that are just too raunchy and that can be interpreted the wrong way.


Don't compliment her breasts, butt, or any parts of her body that are off-limits.
If she starts talking raunchy, you can up the ante a bit, but don't just start off this way.

, An important part of sweet talking a girl is making her feel like the only person in the room. Make eye contact, and only break it occasionally so you don't come off as too intense. Turn your body toward her. Stop checking your phone or looking around for your buddies. Make her feel like all you care about is hanging out with her and hearing what she has to say. That will make whatever you say sound much, much, sweeter.


If someone calls you or texts you and you really have to answer it, apologize or excuse yourself. Let her see that you really are focused on her. Nothing will make her lose interest faster than seeing you text your best buddy back and forth.

, Girls love being complimented, just as you do. Notice the things about her that make her special to you and be sure to let her know that you've noticed. Don't just give her a generic compliment like, ""You look pretty tonight,"" but make it as specific as you can. Tell her, ""Your eyes look so pretty with your sweater,"" or something that lets her see that you're really paying attention. Don't limit your compliments to mentioning her physical appearance, though. Compliment something you love about the ways she acts or her personality. Here are some other great compliments you can give:


""I love your laugh. I've never heard anything like it before.""
""You're so good at making people feel good about themselves.""
""You're so easy to talk to. I feel like I can say anything to you.""

, If you know each other pretty well, then you can consider giving her a cute nickname that makes her feel special and lets her know how you really feel about her. This can have to do with an inside joke you have, or can be related to an aspect of her personality or appearance. Just make sure you're familiar enough with her to give her a nickname so she doesn't feel like you're taking it too far.

, This doesn't mean you should embarrass her and say something like, ""Mandy here is the most incredible girl I've ever met,"" but it does mean that you can find a way to sneak in a compliment about her when you're out with other people. Say something like, ""Have you seen her play basketball? Nobody can shoot like her,"" or, ""Lisa here always knows what to do when you're having friend drama."" Just casually mention something she's good at and see how great it makes her feel.


Give her subtle eye contact when you give the compliment, so she knows you're really just trying to sweet talk her.
Bonus points if you can compliment something about her in front of other people that you've never mentioned to her when you're alone.

, Girls love hearing this -- not the first time you meet them, of course. But if you're talking to the girl long enough and the moment feels right, you can say something like, ""You should come out with me and my buddies. I know they would love you,"" or ""You're the kind of girl who my mom would really like. I can tell."" The girl will be really flattered and will start to think that you're really serious about her, since mentioning the idea of introducing her to your friends and family is a big step.


That being said, don't say this unless you mean it! You don't want the girl to think you're serious about her if you're just out for a good time.

, Flirting is a big part of sweet talking. To flirt with the girl, you have to be playful with her, to tease her a bit, and to let her know you think she's cute without saying so. It can take some practice to master the perfect flirtation style, so err on the side of caution, starting off slowly and then getting more playful as she responds to you. You can even give her a light touch to let her know you like her, putting a hand on her knee or arm for a second.


Say something like, ""Do you always wear so much pink or is it a special occasion?"" You don't have to be super serious to be a great flirt.

, Women hate feeling like you just see them as eye candy or only view them as pretty faces with nothing going on upstairs. Complimenting a girl's mind, these days, can be more flattering than just complimenting her looks or her clothes. Saying something like, ""You're really smart. I really like the way you think,"" or ""I've never heard anyone put it like that before. You're an original thinker,"" can really make her feel special. Obviously, only do this if it's true!


Don't try too hard to force this into the conversation. Wait until the right opportunity presents itself. If you tell her she's smart while you're both laughing about her pet dog, Bobo, then she may look at you funny.

, Say something like, ""It's always so fun to talk to you,"" or ""I always have the best time talking to you."" Though she may get the vibe that you really like spending time with her, it may be better to just come right out and say it. Don't be afraid of telling her how you really feel. She'll really appreciate it and she'll be charmed by your smooth moves.


Of course, make sure you actually are having a great time before you tell her that you always have a great time when you hang out with her!

, Develop some code words between each other. Use them around other people and laugh secretly as if you're having a private joke. This is a great way to make the girl feel like you're sweet on her. If you didn't like her, then you wouldn't share a private language, would you? Don't be too obvious about it, but if you can find a way to make the girl laugh or smile when you're alone or around others, that's definitely a way of sweet talking her.

, If you're at the ""I love you"" stage in your relationship, then make sure you let her know how you really feel. Don't just say it once every blue moon; if you love her, tell her every day, multiple times a day, without overwhelming her. And if you're dating or hanging out a lot, always remind her that you really like her. You can do this without smothering her and let her know that you really do care for her.


Find a way to naturally slip it into the conversation. Don't just say ""I really like you"" or ""I love you"" when you need her to do something for you or to forgive you. Make it feel spontaneous.

, Making a girl laugh is key to sweet talking her. You don't have to be the world's greatest comedian to bring a genuine smile to her face. Don't be afraid to be a little bit corny or silly or just to say something a little bit random. As long as she doesn't feel like you're trying too hard, she'll appreciate the effort. You can tease her a bit, or even make fun of yourself a bit, as long as you're not being too self-deprecating. Remember that when you're sweet talking a girl, you want to keep things light, not talk about how your life has lost all meaning since your grandfather died. Make her feel light and airy and laugh as much as possible -- you can do the serious stuff later.


If you tried a joke and fell flat, just saying something like, ""You can't win them all,"" or just laugh at yourself a bit. There's no need to look crushed or to make things awkward. In fact, soon enough, you can both be laughing at your failed attempt.

, Take a minute to acknowledge something nice the girl has done for you. You can say, ""Thanks for our conversation. It's definitely made my day,"" or ""Thank so much for helping out last week. I couldn't have passed that test without you."" Let her know that you appreciate what she does for you and that you're aware of how much she means to you. This will make her feel like she's an important part of your life and that you really care for her.


You don't have to overdo it. If it's just something small, just say, ""Hey, thanks for getting me this coffee. I really need it."" You don't have to act like she did something life-changing while acknowledging her actions in a positive way.

, If you really want to sweet talk a girl, then you have to let her know that she's not like any other girl you know. Make her feel unique, and mean it. Find something about her that isn't true about any other girl and tell her how you feel. If she knows that she stands out to you, she'll really be flattered and will be touched by your effort. Here are some ways to make her really feel unique:


""I've never met a girl who is as comfortable with herself as you are.""
""You're so good at listening to people. It's an amazing skill.""
""You really know how to make people feel good about themselves. I don't know anyone else who can do that as well as you.""
""You're not like any other girl I've ever met.""

, Another way to sweet talk a girl is to actually ask her how she feels about something. If you're doing all the smooth talking, going on and on about how much you like her or filling her with flattery, then she can get bored pretty fast. Instead, take the time to actually ask her what she thinks about certain subjects. This will let her know that you see her as more than just an object and that the things she says really matter to you. Here are some things you can ask her about:


A mutual friend
A band coming to town
A new TV show
Current events (as long as you don't get into a controversial conversation too early)
What she thinks you should do in a certain situation

, Another way to sweet talk a girl is to actually show an interest in who she is. Let her see that she's more than just a cute girl and that you see her as an individual with her own dreams and desires. You don't have to pry too much to let her know you're really interested in who she is. Avoid the extra personal topics and stick to things she'll be comfortable talking about. Here are some things you can ask about:

]

Her hobbies and interests
Her passions
Her friends
Her family
Her pets
Her plans for the weekend

, This is completely simple, and completely effective. Sometimes all a girl (or anyone, really) wants to hear is, ""How was your day?"" Nothing can sound sweeter to someone who had a bad, or just an interesting day, and who wants to talk about it. She'll be touched that you actually care about how her day went, and if you sound like you really mean it, she'll say more than just ""Good"" or ""Not too bad,"" and will begin to open up to you.


To truly sweet talk a girl, you have to find a balance between flattering her and actually making her feel like you care.

, Listening can be just as important as talking, when it comes to making a girl feel special. All the flattery in the world won't work if you don't take the time to slow down, shut up, and really listen to what she has to say. Make eye contact, nod occasionally as you follow along, and don't interrupt her when she's trying to tell you something. Don't tell her you know exactly how she feels and don't say, ""That was just how I felt this one time when…"" Let her see that you care about what she has to say, not what it has to do with you.


Face it: a lot of guys are notoriously bad listeners. Make yourself stand out as someone who is just as interested in listening to a girl as he is in trying to impress her. And if you're a good listener, she will be impressed.
It's important to remember what she tells you so you can bring it up later in the conversation. She'll feel really special if you can bring up some offhand comment she made two hours or two days ago.

However, many shy girls are very self-confident and enjoy doing exciting things.Keep this in mind before you approach her and throughout the beginning of the relationship. Treat her as an individual, not a stereotype.;
, Shy people usually don’t like being the center of attention.If you walk up to her with your friends, she might feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Make the first introduction a one-on-one event.

, Shy people usually don’t like attention from too many people at once. At the same time, they usually like to be able to reach out for help if they feel unsafe. Approach her when fewer people will be around. Some possible times and places are:At the end of the day, as you’re walking to the bus stop.
After class at the local café.

, Maybe you know her name, but you’re not sure if she knows yours. Start with something like, ""Hi! You're Emma, right? I'm Joe. Nice to meet you!"" On the other hand, if you don’t know her name, you could try, “We pass each other everyday, but we’re always rushing in opposite directions. Now that we have a few minutes, can we talk? I’m Joe, by the way. And you are…?”

, Frowning might turn her off because it can make you look unfriendly. She’ll likely react more positively to you if you smile.Even if you’re feeling a bit down, a simple smile can brighten the mood and keep her engaged in the conversation.

, Acknowledge that shy people usually don’t think of their shyness as a problem. In the beginning, she probably won’t want to say too much, or she might speak with a soft voice. Show consideration for her preferences. Don’t ask her to “speak up” or make puns about her personality., Aim for short conversations at first, say 5 to 10 minutes. Don’t expect to talk to her too often in the beginning. Weekly conversations are perfectly okay. As time passes, gradually increase how long and how often you talk. There are no set rules in how and when to take these steps. Let the relationship develop naturally., When you're acting natural, it’s easier to keep the conversation flowing. Take deep breaths and speak at your normal pace. Speak loud enough for her to hear but not so loud that she’ll feel uncomfortable. Use relaxed, slightly animated, body language., In all likelihood, you’ll likely have to start the conversation.Ask her about her hobbies, favorite books, or sports. Just avoid making the conversation all about her, or she might feel overwhelmed. You could say:


“I really like that guitar pin on your backpack. Do you play?” From here, you could segue into favorite musicians or your shared appreciation of music in general.
(After looking at the cover of the book she’s reading): “Oh, you have a copy of 1984. I feel like I’m the only one who’s never read it. I’d like to hear your opinion.” This way, the spotlight will be on the novel, as opposed to her.

, After you’ve broken the ice, she might become quiet. Don’t use this as an excuse to dominate the conversation. Create pauses where she can make a comment or just an affirmation like ""Yeah,"" or “Okay.” Eventually she'll make lengthier contributions to the conversation., It’s up to you how personal you want the topic to be. She’ll make a comment about what you said or reply to a question you threw in. She might even say something about herself., Talk about something that happened in a class you’re both in. If you work at the same place, mention something that happened on the job. You could also bring up a new addition to the menu at a restaurant you both frequent. This will give her an opportunity to chime in., If you’ve been talking about that hot new TV show on Netflix, don’t try to prevent silence by switching to your desire to upgrade your phone. Gracefully end the conversation if you can't think of something. You could say something like, ""Well, I have to get going, but let’s meet up for lunch!"", This might help you get a better understanding of how she feels around you. Try to make short periods of eye contact with her when you stumble upon a common interest or even dislike. As you get to know each other better, try to hold her gaze longer.Don’t worry if she doesn’t want to keep eye contact at first. She might prefer to glance at you, rather than locking eyes for the entire conversation.

, If you're not seeking a romantic relationship, make that very clear in the beginning. You don’t want her to remember you as the phony jerk who only pretended to like her. Avoid flirtatious behavior, such as putting your arm around her.Be friendly, but also make it clear you're interested in other people. This way, she'll at least know that you're not romantically interested in her without hurting her feelings.

, As a shy person, she might not trust you immediately. Over time, you’ll have to prove yourself. Keep all promises you make to her. If she makes a social faux pas, don’t blab it to your friends.You could also tell her something you’ve only shared with one or two other people.You’ll know you’re making progress when she starts sharing what’s important to her., Tell her yourself, as opposed to having a friend tell her for you. Stay calm and relaxed. Profess your feelings naturally and casually. When there’s a lull in the conversation, say something like, “I really enjoy talking to you and being with you. Would you be interested in taking our friendship to the next level?”


Don’t hide behind a phone or computer screen. Tell her in person.
Break the news to her when you’re alone to prevent her from feeling embarrassed.
Avoid complimenting her appearance in the beginning. She might think you're being sarcastic.

, Get to know her before you ask her out.When you do ask her out, work it into the conversation. Start talking about a new movie you want to see, an event happening over the weekend, or a local place you’ve been wanting to visit. Try questions like:


“Speaking of that new Mediterranean restaurant, I’ve been meaning to go but never got the chance. How about going with me Friday night?”
“That guy’s a riot! You know, I have an extra ticket to his stand-up act this weekend, if you’d like to come along.”

, Start with slight actions. For example, you could touch her hand when she borrows your pencil. If she reacts positively, continue. If she doesn't, back off, at least for the time being. The worst thing you can do is try to pressure a shy person into something that makes them feel uncomfortable."

While there are so many feelings blooming inside of you, he can't handle all of them at once. Push away the unnecessary details, and focus on getting your story across.

, Throw some out and/or add one or two more until you feel satisfied with them. However, remember that less is more. You don't want to scare him off, but you don't want to send him a stiff, short email that doesn't express much.

, Once you have an idea of what you're going to say, form your ideas into words. As you write, weave a confident air into your phrases, sounding as if you know what you're talking about. This will potentially impress him, and you will appear as though you will still love yourself no matter what.


Avoid coming off as hesitant or uncertain about your feelings. He'll refuse to attach himself to you if he believes that you'll change your mind about him later.
Near the end of the email, let your crush know that you understand if he doesn't feel the same way. Request that you still be friends, if he is comfortable for that.

, Sometimes, minor adjustments and a little rearranging of words will do wonders and help your sentences flow. Also, keep an eye out for grammatical and spelling errors. While a typo here and there is acceptable, a nearly incomprehensible email will only cause annoyance to prick at him, and he may not take the time to be a translator.

, While you don't want a million tiny paragraphs, you want to avoid hauling a huge chunk of words over to your crush. If you feel that your email is too long, shorten your story and adjust your sentences so that you still get your point across.


Avoid being too wordy, and find different words to express your feelings.
Use simple words that won't send your crush scrambling for a dictionary, but don't limit your vocabulary too much. While sounding intelligent, avoid coming off as a know-it-all.

, If you feel uncomfortable about revealing who you like, erase any names from the email before allowing someone to read it. This way, they realize what you're doing, but they still don't know who your crush is.

, Don't worry about his response; you gained enough courage to complete a brave feat, and you don't need anyone's opinion to tell you who you are. Note that you may not receive an immediate response. Sometimes, it could take up to days for your crush to write out a reply, especially if he isn't sure how to react.


Before you send your email, check to make sure that you've got the right address. Otherwise, you may find yourself entangled in an awkward situation, and you may have to explain yourself.

Become friends.,
Make sure they like you.,
Look nice, guys want you to be easy to look at, and they also hate it when girls look like they're trying to hard, so wear clothes that show your personality, because that's the most beautiful thing to most guys.,
I know most of you girls like it when the guys does all the talking, but guys will love to actually have a real conversation not just.. something like this: Guy:Hey, how's it going-I just realized my favorite color is actually orange!,
guys will hate it, they'd want you to say: Oh well Blue is nice but, I guess you're right there really is just something about Orange that is nice, i agree with you!,
Once you are completely sure of them liking you, flirt your brains out, flirt like there's no tomorrow!!!,
Once you guys are finally dating; instead of planning a hangout time or anything like that, sneak up on them and just say a simple greeting.",How to Start a Relationship With a Guy," Guys will definitely want to get to know your personality first, guys like a girl for 80% personality 10% common things and 10% looks. So get their friendship by having a few laughs and showing that you're happy to see them.;
, If you see them at the corner of your eye looking at you, it's a sign that they may like you. If they stare into your eyes for only a little while and then look somewhere else on you it means that they are checking you out, remember do not walk away, they want to scan you down so they can remember what you look like with ease.Never EVER talk about boys unless they bring it up, guys want to feel like they're the only guy you know! If they blush, stutter, or say stupid things it means they're falling for you. CAUTION: REMEMBER, ONLY ASK THEM OUT IF YOU ""KNOW"" THEY LIKE YOU, NOT JUST IF YOU ""THINK"" THEY LIKE YOU.

, Or, wear clothes that suit their personality! if you're planning on wearing makeup, don't use anything but mascara, eyeliner may be too emo and other makeups are just plain gross. NO LIPSTICK, guys sometimes wonder what it would be like to kiss you, and if they see them kissing you with gross slimy wet lipstick smeared on each others faces, they'll lose their interest.

, Green just got boring and purples looking annoying now, what are your thoughts on the colors these days huh? Girl: I dunno

, Yes, that's how it works. When they ask something like: ""What's your favorite kind of food?"" don't say texting: ""I dunno they're all good...hotdawgz?"" say: ""GREEK FOOD!!! i love Greek food! It's so darn yummy! XD"" or in real life: ""Ummmm... probably Greek food, it's pretty good...""

, When you're planning on making a move, go on Facebook or txt, guys hate awkwardness. And ask to play truth with them, they will 99% of the time say ""sure!"" now play with idle questions like: ""How many girlfriends have you had?"" or ""Do you like the color pink secretly?"" And then finally: ""Who do you like?"" If they say a different girl, sorry no luck. BUT, if they say you, say, well, i like you too.. so you wanna go out sometime? But if they say oh i like my mom my dad and my cat and my teacher and my friends and Homer Simpson, because they pretend to take the question literally, it either means they're hiding the truth, or they're too shy to admit their feelings for you.

, They don't want any walking towards each other awkwardly.

Flatter your body.,
Don’t overdo it.,
Be comfortable.,
Ask questions.,
Show interest.,
Be engaging.,
Speak with class.,
Stick to your values.,
Use eye contact.,
Be confident.",How to Talk to a Boy You Like," Every girl has a couple outfits that make her feel better than anything else in her wardrobe; there’s outfits that make her smile bigger and walk taller than any others. Pick one of these to wear when you’re going to talk to the boy you like. If he can’t take his eyes off of you, chances are he’s interested., If your number one choice of outfit is your prom dress—go with number two. Keep your outfit appropriate for the occasion. He’ll likely be distracted if you’re wearing an outlandish outfit.

, If you’ve outgrown your favorite outfit, that’s ok. Go out and buy a new one, or pick something else from your closet. You want to be as comfortable as possible, while still looking good. This way, you aren’t fidgeting with your clothes while you talk to him; you’ll come off as nervous and make him uncomfortable.

, Ask open ended questions to get him engaged in the conversation. Talk about absolutely anything that you’re comfortable with. This will get him talking to you and can show off some of your interests as well. Have a few in mind before you strike up a conversation in case there is any extended silence.


""What did you think about the game last week?""
""What are your plans for the weekend?""
""What did you think about the end of that new movie?""

, Pay attention to what they’re saying. Show interest in who they are and what they’re all about. If you bring up something that he likes, it’s likely that he’ll want to talk about it—to you—more. Don’t act as though you like something that you don’t. If you fake it, he’ll likely pick up on it and no guy wants to be faked out.


Don’t be afraid to disagree, but stay open-minded to their opinions too.

, Don’t be a reporter and rattle off question after question. Joke with him and laugh at his jokes. Laughing at his jokes, even if they aren’t hilarious, will get his attention. When you’re happy and laughing, it will be hard for him not to catch on.

, Don’t swear or speak poorly of people. If he’s talking about something he really likes and cares about, swearing or speaking down on it would be an automatic flag telling him that he shouldn’t be interested in you.

, Don’t be so focused on impressing him that you begin lying about yourself. Don’t fake interests or opinions. Not only does this show him bad ethics, but it will come back to haunt you later. Share the truth about yourself. If your family, friends, or personal interests are constantly on your mind, talk about them. Don’t be afraid to talk about what you do best., This is a non-verbal tool that is just as important as the things you’re saying. It communicates confidence, sincerity, and respect. Eye contact connects you with him.You can even flirt with your eyes. Do this by holding eye contact for two or three seconds and then looking away during the beginning of the conversation. It will keep him looking for your eye contact again, practice it on and off throughout the time that you’re speaking.You should know what color his eyes are after the first conversation.

, If you’re noticeably nervous, he will feel uncomfortable. Be comfortable and proud of your unique and amazing personality. Show yourself off by having good posture, and speaking clearly.Slouching and mumbling aren’t attractive.

Mention you're single and looking to date.,
Draw comparisons between the girl you like and your ideal.,
Point out the romantic strengths of your friendship.,
Use body language.,
Show her how you feel with small gestures.,
Prioritize her.",How to Tell a Girl You Like Them Without Saying It1," Try to be casual when you say this, as being direct might be interpreted as too strong; however, it's possible that the girl you're interested in hasn't realized that you're interesting in dating. You might say something like:""Oh man, I've been single way too long. I have the worst luck in romance. How about you?""
""I've been trying to find a date for the dance next week and I'm having the worst luck. I don't want to go alone."";
, It's very common to start talking about your ideal partner, even with girls you are interested in. If you get this opportunity, try to vaguely describe the girl you like as your ""ideal"" to hint to her you're interested. You might say something along the lines of:


""My last date and I had nothing in common. I want a girl who likes books, electronic music, and video games. She's got to be out there!""
""I just want a girl who is laid back, likes to read, play board games, and poi. Is that too much to ask for? I don't think so!""

, In some cases, the girl you like may have only thought about you as a friend and not a romantic partner. To get her thinking about you as a potential romantic partner, point out the parts of a good romantic relationship that you see in your friendship already. For example, you might say to her:


""We always have so much fun together. I laugh more with you than anyone else, and we never run out of things to talk about.""
""I can't find a single girl to date who shares the same interests that we do. You and I have such a strong relationship. I just want a girlfriend that I can share that with, you know?""

, Most people get caught up in worrying what to say to show someone how they feel and overlook the very important signals we send with our bodies. This is an effective way to literally tell a girl you like her without speaking a word!Make eye contact. Holding a person's gaze can be really intense, and in most normal social encounters, people rarely make eye contact for longer than one second. Send her a clear signal that you are interested by catching her gaze and holding it for a little longer than one second. Don't overdo it with the eye contact, though, as this can come off as hostile or make the other person uncomfortable.
Turn your entire body (even your feet) toward the girl when you are talking, not just your head, to show your interest.
Try ""echoing"" her body posture. If the girl leans in, try leaning in, too. If she takes a sip of her drink, do the same. Don't copy her immediately after each action — that will start to look weird. Let a few seconds pass before you echo her movements. This not only sends the signal that you like her — it can actually predispose her to like you more, too.

, Try doing something that is a little special or out of the ordinary, but not totally obvious. Something like opening her car door, offering to help out with homework/rides/projects at home, bringing back a small gift from a vacation, bringing her favorite candy to lunch for her, etc. This works best if you know her tastes and interests somewhat, as this can allow you to do something meaningful that you know she will appreciate.

, By giving the girl you like priority over others, you'll not only make her feel special, but you'll also show her you're more interested in her than others. You should be careful when doing this, however. In some cases, your attention may be taken advantage of, or you could hurt the feelings of others by making them feel unimportant.You don't have to ignore others to give her priority. Even giving her your full attention when she's speaking can make her feel special."
"
Spend time together alone.,
Do physical activities together.,
Invite her to go with you to couples' events.,
Learn a new skill together.",How to Tell a Girl You Like Them Without Saying It2," When other people are part of the mix, it can distract you and the girl you like from paying full attention to each other. By spending time alone and doing fun activities, you can show her that you're good dating material. Some alone together activities you might consider include:Going out to get coffee together. The relaxed, cozy atmosphere of most coffee shops can be a great way of calming nerves while spending time together.
Watching a movie together. You might go to a theatre or watch one at home, but in either case, you'll both be able to enjoy sharing this experience together.
Doing light hiking together. This way you'll be able to enjoy the beauty of nature while getting to know the girl you like.

, You don't have to take daily runs, although exercising together can help you and the girl you like grow closer. Something as simple as throwing a frisbee around a park can help you and the girl you like make this physical connection. Other options you might try include:Playing her favorite sport, like volleyball, soccer, or baseball. You might do this with just the two of you, or invite friends to join.
Team up together to play a two-person game, like the bean bag toss game which is sometimes also called the cornhole game.

, Some events are generally looked at as being things that couples do together, like watching fireworks or going out to eat. To make this seem less like a date while still indicating you like her, you might invite her by saying:""I heard this new great restaurant opened up downtown. It looks delicious and I was planning on going there but I didn't want to go alone. Would you like to come with me?""
""It's been forever since I watched the Independence Day fireworks. I have a really great spot to see the view. Would you like to come with me?""

, Learning a new skill with the girl you like will give you a shared experience through which your relationship can grow. Beyond that, after you learn, you'll both have a sense of accomplishment together which will only improve your bond. Some skills you might consider:Taking a painting class together after school, at a community center, or at a community college. Even if you're no Picasso by the end of your class, you'll both have enjoyed time together learning something new.
Learning the basics of baking or cooking. Many cooking classes are available after school, or you could learn recipes alone with her at your home.
Taking a dance class together. Physical contact releases a hormone that encourages trust and closeness, so learning to dance with her could spark romance."
"
Rely on trusted individuals to gather and transmit information.,
Have a trusted individual talk you up around her.,
Get the seal of approval from her friends.",How to Tell a Girl You Like Them Without Saying It3," This is the trickiest part of signaling the girl you like with a third party. Even your close friends may have different ideas of what is ""helpful,"" and in some cases they may say too much when trying to help you. If you plan on trusting someone else to help play matchmaker between you and the girl you like, it's best to be honest and clear with your helper. You might tell that person:


""There's this girl I really like, but I'm super shy telling her how I feel and I need some help. I was wondering if you could ask her if she's interested in anyone or if she is seeing someone?""
""Please don't tell anyone about this, but I really like this girl. I'm having the hardest time telling her how I feel. Could you help me figure out if she likes me?""

, The more often she hears good things about you, the more likely she is to associate you with those positive traits. You might have a close friend that you trust bring up your talents, skills, and accomplishments around her.


You should be careful when selecting the person who will brag about you to her. Some people may go over the top, which could be a more obvious signal that you like her than you want.Choose a few of your best characteristics and instruct your friend to talk about them. For example, you might ask your friend, ""Could you mention the soccer game that I won for our team last night to the girl I like?""

, If her friends like you, it's much more likely that she'll like you as well. Additionally, if her friends like you, they'll say good things about you to her when you're not around. In some cases, girls may be worried that you won't fit in well with her life or friend group.Gain her friends' approval by helping out. You could offer help on homework in a subject you know well, if you're handy you could offer to fix something you notice is broken, you could treat her friends to a snack, and so on.
In some cases, this might cause jealousy between the girl you like and her friends. This might make her think of you in a more romantic light, but it might also backfire and cause her to get angry at you.
To prevent jealousy, whenever you do something nice for her friends, you might also say something like, ""Of course I'll help you out. You're one of Sarah's best friends, and she's the best. Any friend of hers is a friend of mine.""

During your free time in class, try writing a note.,
Slip it in his locker after class.,
If he doesn't figure out who the note was from by the next day, give him some hints.,
If yet another day passes and he hasn't figured it out yet, walk up to him after class and ask him if he has figured out who the note was from.",How to Tell a Boy That You Like Him when You're Scared1," Make sure it's during your free time in class or at lunch. You don't want your teacher to see you writing a note during a lesson, or he/she might read it in front of the class!


You can write something like ""I Like you"" and write the first letter of your name or your initials. It may save you from embarrassment if he doesn't know who it is right away, therefor he might not tell many people. You might also want to write not to tell anyone about the note.;
, Make sure he doesn't see you put it in there. You should rush to his locker right after class.

, You can smile at him in class if you want.

,


If he listened to what you said in the note, he wouldn't have told anybody, and he may ask you how you knew about the note, and if he doesn't figure it out right away, tell him that you wrote it.

"
Make the effort to look presentable.,
Be on time for your date.,
Bring gum or mints and use when necessary.,
When a woman looks good on a date, she's looking good for you.",How to Survive a First Date," Take a shower, wear a nice outfit that's not dirty or wrinkled, and shave when applicable. The way you present yourself to your date is a reflection to her of how would potentially treat her down the road.;
, No one likes to be kept waiting. If you're going to be more than 10 minutes late, call her cell to let her know (and make sure you both have each others' cell numbers prior to the date).

, Nothing turns off a date faster than bad breath. It might also be a good idea carry a tiny package of dental floss to remove food between your teeth during trips to the restroom.


When you finally see your date, smile and give her direct eye contact. Watch her body language closely to see if she wants a hug or a handshake. If it's a hug, give her a firm hug, but not too hard. If it's a handshake, give her a firm shake (but again not too tight).
Keep focused on your date. Don't let your eyes wander when another girl walks in. It's considered rude and trust us, your date will notice.
Do not hijack the date by only talking about yourself. Women are turned off by men who just talk about themselves. Make sure there's a good balance of talking and listening. Also, do not ""brag"" about your accomplishments and/or material possessions. Women view this as insecurity. Just act naturally, and your worth will speak for itself.
When you converse with your date, listen to what she is saying, and validate her feelings when applicable. This is by far one of the most important things to remember. If a woman sees that you're a good listener and can talk to you about almost anything, you are halfway there.
Don't take calls on your cell during a date unless you think it's an emergency. Leave your cell on silent or vibrate during the date.

, And women like to hear that you noticed.


Be Creative. Women often get flowers on dates - and at the very beginning. Be different and surprise her in a different way by giving her flowers or a rose during the date or at the very end. Or, combine flowers with another favorite among women: a chocolate rose.
When you're conversing, bring up interesting topics - world events, celebrity news, global warming, the elections, travel, men's and women's issues etc. Ask general questions about jobs and family sparingly. Remember, it's a date, not a job interview.
Remember the three Cs: Confidence, Charm, and Creativity. Have the Confidence to know that you have a lot to offer, the Charm to tell women what they want to hear, and the Creativity to be a one-of-a-kind.
Don't butter up your date just to get on her good side: use compliments sparingly. Women also like guys who are independent thinkers. You don't have to agree with everything she says (unless you really do agree). It's okay to have differences and express other viewpoints, as long as you're not deliberately trying to be argumentative.
Be flirtatious. If the conversation's going well, gaze into your date's eyes and see how she reacts. If she gazes back or coyly looks away, that's a good sign. You can also do things like grab her arm or hand when making a point. If she's into you, it should send tingles up her spine. Also to keep the sexual tension going, throw in a good innuendo here and there, but only if the mood's right.
When to kiss: if you're getting signals that your date wants to kiss, do not wait until the very end of the date - that brings on added pressure. Do it when you guys are walking, even if you both are in mid-conversation (even better, it makes the kiss appear to be spontaneous). The best way to approach this is stop her from walking, pull her in towards you with both of your arms, look into her eyes, put your hand gently on her cheek and then slowly go in for a kiss. The first kiss should be soft, tender, and without major tongue unless she initiates it first. Women are not like men: they often do not want major tongue during the first kiss. They want the first kiss to be soft and sensual. Follow up the kiss with a nice firm hug, and maybe even a few soft kisses on the cheek and neck.
Take charge with future plans. Don't wait for her to suggest a second date. #*Be Confident and tell her you look forward to getting together again. Or if it feels right, make tentative plans right then and there. And why not? Life's too short to play games.
If you don't make immediate plans, follow up the date with a call a day or two later. Take charge and say ""let's make plans again.""
If things are going bad and you don't see any potential with your date, be polite and sit through the rest of the date! Just don't make any more plans. Nothing is ruder than when you walk out on a date.

Keep in mind that, if you have a diary, you probably would have written about the guy you like.",How to Tell a Boy That You Like Him when You're Scared3," Bring your diary to school, and have it open and hold it while you're talking (Make sure there aren't many people around.


You don't want someone else to read your diary. Like when you're doing an assignment where you have to have a partner). Don't make it look like your reading or writing in it, because he might think you're not interested in what he has to say. Then, say you have to go to the bathroom, and leave your diary open in front of him (Make sure it's on a page that's about you liking him)

”Bump” into them outside of class.,
Make a move at the end of the semester.",How to Seduce Your Professor," Check out their ring finger on their left hand. Is there a wedding ring? If so, you’ll need to decide if that is an obstacle that will deter you from pursuing them. If there is no ring, try to determine if they have a significant other. Some professors may casually mention their boyfriend, girlfriend, or fiancé in class. Listen up, and see if they throw out any hints. You can also ask current or former students if they’ve heard anything about their relationship status. If you can locate them on Facebook, that’s a great way to figure out if they’re available or taken.


If you can’t determine their relationship status from afar, be bold. After class, walk up to your professor and say something like, “Hi, Professor! I think I saw you and your at a restaurant last weekend. Was that you?” Hopefully, bluffing will get you some information. If you’re lucky, they’ll give away some valuable clues in their answer.
Don’t make assumptions about their sexual orientation. If you’ve determined they are single, try to ask around to make sure they’re even interested in your gender! However, even if your teacher is believed to be straight, remember they can also be bisexual, or their sexual orientation may not be known on campus.;
, Some universities ban them completely, while others only strongly discourage them. This information may not make a difference to you, but it can help you determine how difficult it might be to convince your professor. Your relationship may be technically permissible, and therefore it may not take much convincing at all. If it’s forbidden, the challenge (and the scandal) may simply make the relationship more exciting., If you signed up for a random class solely in hopes of seducing the professor, you may not have much to lose. However, if your professor is also head of the department for your major, you should probably consider outcomes before diving in headfirst.When it comes to matters of the heart, though, sometimes you have to throw logic out the window.


If the professor rejects you, will you be OK? If you know you have to take three more courses with them to get your major, tread carefully. Classes can be even more difficult if you have a strained relationship with your professor.
If you successfully seduce them, could a relationship negatively affect your academic future?

, Pay attention in class and act interested in the material being taught. Participate in class discussions, answer questions, and take good notes. Stay off your cell phone and avoid daydreaming. Look truly interested in every word your professor is saying. While being a good student won’t seduce them, it will lay the groundwork. Remember, they are doing their job, and your interest in the subject will please them.Even if you are unable to seduce them, at least you may get an A by paying attention and working hard.

, While you may think that professors are much too intellectual to care about appearance, they’re still human. If you look like a slob, you probably won’t catch their eye. Keep your outfits school-appropriate, but wear things that flatter you. Looking neat and polished will also show them that you respect their class. Try to look more elegant and mature than your peers: a vest instead of a hoodie or a nice knee-length skirt for girls will make you look more professional and equal to your professor.


Putting a little extra effort into your appearance can also raise your confidence. If you look poised and self-assured, you’ll look more like an equal., Smile at your professor in class, and try to hold their eye contact whenever you can.Nod slightly whenever you think they make a great point, just to show them that you’re listening and agreeing. Be a little shameless– if you know you have a great physical feature, find a way to discreetly show it off. Bend over to grab a pen, adjust your clothing to give a little peek, or simply take your time walking to your seat before class begins. The goal is to get their eyes on you.

Don't stare while making eye contact. If they catch you looking, simply hold their gaze for a little longer than it's socially comfortable, and smile. If they smile back at you, it's a good sign!







, Many professors are required to hold office hours and a lot of students do not take advantage of them. Check your professor’s office hours, which they typically provide at the beginning of the semester. Go to their office hours regularly to get help with an assignment, talk about exam prep, or ask for help with a paper. Not only will they be impressed with your work ethic, but you’ll stick out. You won’t just be a face in the crowd of students, and you’ll form a bond.Don't come to their office hours every week if you don't have anything to discuss. However, once you have developed the habit of seeing your professor during their office hours, you may come and just talk for a while about any other topic, not related with school. By this time, they will probably realize you are interested in them.
Familiarity can lead to fondness. Simply getting in face time with your professor can lead to them developing feelings., Try to arrive to your classroom or lecture hall a few minutes early, and make it a point to greet your professor with a smile. Say hello, ask them how their day is going, discuss an aspect of the class, whatever!Just make time to talk to them one-on-one. They will appreciate your friendly and outgoing nature.

, Ask them with a question about class or about a homework assignment. Share your thoughts on an interesting discussion brought up during class. Send them a link to an article that you think they would find interesting. Just do anything to make yourself stand out, and find reasons to start a dialogue.


In your e-mails, stay professional, but a little bit playful. If you're sending an e-mail at night or during a day off, think of a witty way to justify this. If your professor uses smileys, include a winky face too. Every professor's boundaries in correspondence are different, and you have to figure out the best way of writing to your teacher. You don't want to be just another student who sends them boring e-mails every other day.
Even if you want to talk to them every day, limit your correspondence unless it’s absolutely clear that your professor wants to speak that much as well. If you overdo it, you will be a nuisance.

, This technique works particularly well during office hours. If they seem friendly and not pressed for time, try talking about topics unrelated to class.Inquire about their hobbies and interests, ask for advice on an issue unrelated to school, or tell them about something you’re passionate about. Ask them about their background and how they became a professor.


By talking about subjects other than class, you can show them that you’re more than simply their student. You’re a three-dimensional person, just like them, and you can start to form a relationship like friends– and hopefully more!
Although you can try this technique before or after class, usually professors don’t have much time to hang around and chat. Office hours also provide the luxury of privacy.

, Unless you summon up the courage to put yourself out there, you probably won’t be able to set the stage for seduction. Put a little gift and a note on their desk.It doesn’t have to be anything major¬– maybe just a new pen or a baked good. In your note, write something beyond what a student would typically say to a professor, such as, “I was thinking of you and thought this would make you happy.” It doesn’t have to be a declaration of love or a raunchy offer, but just a little something to show that you see them as more than simply your professor.


Try to think of something small that your professor really needs. Do they constantly borrow pens from students? Get them one. Are they usually tired in class? Offer them a coffee. Do they complain about not having enough time to eat? Bring them a home-made muffin. This way, you can keep the note playful and light.
If they ask you about the gift, or even try to give it back to you, don’t shy away. Tell them that you really like them, and you want them to have it.

, Observe how your professor interacts with you versus other students. Do they give you a lot of eye contact? Are they friendly and receptive to your attempts at conversation? Do they treat you differently than other students? If they don’t seem interested, don’t push them.

, This may or may not be possible, but it is a great thing to do if you can manage it. Try to find out where they spend time on the weekends or after class. If they mentioned being a regular at a certain coffee shop near campus, do your studying there. If they brought up that their favorite musician was playing a gig that weekend, get tickets. If you’re committed to seducing them, go the extra mile to see them outside the classroom walls.


Not only will this give you more time with them and another opportunity to prove you’re more than just a student, it will also show them that you have similar interests and hobbies.
Don't be a stalker! If you 'accidentally' bump into your professor at a concert, you can ask them if they are going to the next one/another concert of a similar band. If they eat lunch at the same place every day, ask them if you can sit with them.

, Make an appointment to talk with them after final grades have been submitted.Ask for their advice about a class next semester or admission to professional school. Try to steer the conversation towards other topics as well. If they seem receptive and you are feeling brave, casually ask them to coffee.


Don’t make a move before the semester has ended. Most professors will not date you before the course has ended because of ethical and professional conflict.

The downside to agencies is that you will have to pay a bit more because you will pay a large agency fee which is rolled into the price., Some categories include; mature, brunette, blond, busty, VIP, and so forth. You can also classify by age, physical feature, and/or height. This is also the d=time to decide whether or not you want a meet-up, a date, or an all night affair., Keep in mind that you get what you pay for. If you only have $100-$200 to spend, you should consider saving up some more money. Once you click on a girl that you like, scroll down and look at her price. If she is nowhere within your budget then you might not want to waste your time reading her ad.Do not attempt to negotiate the price with an escort. If her price is not listed then she is usually more pricey.
If you found an escort that you really like and she is in your price range, make sure that there will be no added fees or ""tips"" once you arrive.

, Escorts who use fake photos will never tell you that it is not really them. Many girls using fake pics will blur out their face, but many beautiful escorts using real photos will blur their face as well for privacy reasons. Other clients will leave comments about her and let you know if she is the girl in the photo.Use a photo searching service. This will allow you to see if her pictures are stolen from an adult website or professional photo shoot (such as Playboy).

, This will allow you to see how long she has been working in the industry, and how she has been rated by clients. If she has only been doing this for a few weeks or months then you are taking a higher risk. Google her contact phone number and email to see if they are real, and legitimate as well.There are plenty of review sites online which rate escorts on appearance, personality, and openness. Some great review sites include TheEroticReview.com and TopKitten.com.

, Once you have decided on an escort, make sure that you have some idea of what will happen during your time together. If you discuss her services over the phone, make sure you know the correct code-words for the services you want.


Crude and graphic words may cause her to hang-up on you and ignore your calls. You may also be talking to her manager on the phone, so keep in mind the female who answers may not be the girl you're meeting.

, A cheap motel in a bad neighborhood may not be a great idea. Make sure the parking lot is not visible from the street if you are close to your home or office.

, When you arrive at an in-call location, look around. If you see anything suspicious (lots of people walking around, doing maintenance or clean-up, watching you), or get a weird feeling, just walk away. Remember that most hotels do their housekeeping early in the day, and maintenance is rarely done at night. Be safe and smart.

, Do this before you arrive at the location. You don't want a nefarious person seeing you do this. Only take your cell phone, cash and keys with you. If you have a spare wallet, use that one. You never know if the escort will rip you off and steal your valuables.

, When you get inside her in-call location, show her you have the agreed upon amount, and place it clearly on a nightstand or table. This money is only for her time(not for any illegal services). Do not attempt to exchange sex for money. It is against the law., Ask her if she is at least 18, and make sure she has a license to practice escorting in the state that you are in. If she does not answer yes to both of those questions then you are breaking the law. It could be a police officer, or an underage trafficker., Some escorts may ask you to wash your hands, or even take a shower. Taking a shower could mean she might leave with your money while you're not looking, so you can say you just took one (you should anyway, before and after). It's less likely an established escort will run off with your money, so keep that in mind when you're picking a new girl with no reviews or online history. You may be able to take the cash into the bathroom with you, she may or may not get offended at this. Take your wallet, cell phone and keys into the bathroom., Once she sees your donation and knows you're serious, she should have no problem undressing for you, which is a legal adult activity. However, state laws vary as to what is deemed legal and illegal. Make sure you look up your state's escort and sex laws beforehand to make sure., Escorts are very careful about how they talk about money, sex, dating etc. They will use code words like ""donations"" or ""girlfriend experience."" Make sure that when you are talking you also use code words. Never come right out and ask for sex, or a sexual act. Use terms like ""get comfortable"" or ""get to know you."", This is important, because you do not want the escort to steal your belongings while you are asleep. You also want to leave the in-call location, and move your car, so that no one you know finds out. Remember to leave at different times than your escort. You do not want to leave together."

Build trust.,
Create positive memories.,
See her as she wants to be seen.,
Maintain contact with other women.",How to Steal a Girl from Her Boyfriend1," To do this, spend time with her when you can. The idea is to treat her as any other female friend. Listen to her problems, try to get to know her better, and spend time doing friendly activities such as going out to eat and watching movies.Don’t rush to gain her as a girlfriend or else she’ll view you as intrusive and only using her as tool for your own enjoyment.
Stay independent. If you become clingy, she’ll view you as a friend only and not relationship material.;
, If she feels positive emotions with you, she’ll think of you. Be attentive to her and go out and do the activities that the two of you can enjoy together. If she likes bowling but her boyfriend doesn’t, go with her. Avoid getting into arguments and neither encourage her relationship or talk negatively about her boyfriend.This may mean finding out about the weaknesses in her relationship and filling the gaps her boyfriend leaves. Listen intently to her complaints.
Finding commonalities is a great way to cement a connection. If she wants to try skydiving but you want to go on a safari, link the two by explaining that as a desire to go on an adventure.
If she wants to spend a lot of time with you, that is an indication that she is not satisfied with her relationship.

, Flirting is appropriate, but you must also treat her as an individual rather than a relationship object. To do this, listen to her and be encouraging. If she wants to be a photographer, for example, give her positive compliments and feedback. Remember there are no shortage of guys out there who will be interested in her for her appearance and will get in the way of her dreams, possibly including her boyfriend., Being clingy is a sure turn-off for her. Show that you’re confident and don’t need her. This is very helpful against girls who send mixed signals. For instance, if you’re in a class together where her flirting changed to coldness, talk to the other girls. Get them to laugh. Her jealousy can provoke her to action.After communicating with other girls, ask her to spend time with you such as at lunch in a week. If she has a hard time accepting the invitation, she’s probably not interested enough to go out with you.

Build up communication.,
Discuss different subjects.,
Promote yourself.,
Don’t act like her second boyfriend.,
Flirt with her.,
Steal a kiss.",How to Steal a Girl from Her Boyfriend2," Build some history. It may take time, but a girl isn’t likely to leave her boyfriend for someone she hasn’t known long. The happier the relationship she has with her boyfriend, the more patient you’ll have to be. Talk to her in ways that show you’re confident, comfortable, and assertive.To do this, develop your own self-worth. Keep good hygiene, exercise, eat well, and practice speaking in a mirror or with others.
Approach while feeling secure. Speak clearly and maintain strong eye contact.
Be direct when opening up a topic relevant to her. If she’s reading a book, for example, ask her about it, focus on it until the conversation begins to wear out, then transition topics., It’s easy to resort to droning on about your job or your friends. This is a mistake, since this is boring and everyone else talks about the same things with their friends. Instead, engage her. Keep entertaining facts and stories and use them in small amounts.


A common communication trick people use is to ask deep questions of the other person that provoke more than a yes or no answer, such as, “You must meet a lot of interesting people as a bank teller, tell me about your favorite customer.”, To do this, find out her ideal boyfriend. Ask her, “If you could be with anyone in the world, what would he look like? What would he act like? How would you feel?” Make it as vivid as possible then compare her boyfriend to that ideal.For example, if she says, “I want someone who will listen to me,” say, “Your boyfriend seems so busy, but I’m sure he tries his best.”
Never insult the boyfriend or conclude his imperfections outright for her.

, The girl you’re attracted to can have hundreds of guys telling her she’s beautiful. Don’t sit around heaping compliments on her and don’t simply do the things her boyfriend doesn’t do, such as listen to her relationship problems or buy her food. These will make you into a friend or a source of money or attention before she goes back to her boyfriend.


Use your singleness. Stay mysterious, intriguing, and independent rather than expressing an intent to replace her boyfriend.

, The way to express your desire is to do it without saying it. Keep in mind that you need to make her want you without you telling her. Be verbally engaging and patient. Add in the occasional light touch on the hands, wrist, or shoulder, as long as she's comfortable with that. Over time you may find opportunities to add additional contact, such as when showing her how to roll a bowling ball or helping her climb during a hike.


Do not inform her of your intentions. She'll see you as a threat to her relationship and this can make her feel uncomfortable and used.
Since you're trying to involve yourself in her emotions, some mental discomfort will occur, but you should never make her feel threatened. Stop touching her when she tells you to stop.
You should also never make demands. Don't try to make her choose between you and her boyfriend.

, After some time of being friends, you can try to show physical affection. Use your judgment as to when the moment’s right. You should be alone and have established attraction through flirting, closeness, and positive experience. Don’t force the issue if she rejects this gesture.Rather than continuing to lay affection on strong, it may be more useful to you to leave her with that kiss and let her think about it.
This is a risky move, but can be necessary to cause emotional confusion if you’re stagnating in a friendship zone. If this scares her away, you should stop pursuing her.

Find the right partner.,
Treat the object of your affection as though s/he were your own age.,
Be fun, happy, and easy to talk to like any normal human being trying to make friends.,
Once the 18-to-21-year-old recognizes your unusual respect and admiration, his/her thought process will wander down one of several unfamiliar paths: S/he may see you as a means of much longed-for escape from a comparatively juvenile world.,
Alternatively, the teen may also find your respect frightening.,
Suggest activities that the two of you can do together, that emphasize your shared traits and experiences.,
Let them share their interests with you.,
After a friendship grows, your love interest may have difficulty spending one-on-one time with you.,
Be patient with the moral pressures that weigh on your love interest...show your disappointment but respect their moral concerns.

,
Once you are spending time alone together, be attuned to your love interest.,
At some point in the relationship, your love-interest will either pull closer or pull away.,
If s/he starts something physical, like a tickle-fight, a massage, or even just prolonged eye contact, then make a small move.

,
When you make your move, treat your teen like an adult.,
If s/he still seems physically uncertain, then stick to verbal compliments, telling him/her how you feel, and start conversations about what the feelings mean.",How to Seduce a Young Adult," There are no easy ways to distinguish between likely and unlikely prospects (see ""Tips"" below), so avoid making assumptions based on first impressions. Seemingly inaccessible 18-to-21-year olds are often very interested in exploring an older partner, because their experiences with younger partners has been unsatisfying. Likewise, seemingly aroused and flirtatious teens might actually bear deeper moral perspectives that will ultimately stifle the relationship. Trust your instincts and proceed with calm confidence.;
, Young adults are accustomed to being condescended to - so much so, in fact, that being treated with respect and camaraderie will often impress them, and bring them to their full potential as adult communicators. Catch your love interest by surprise with admiration and acknowledgement, make him/her feel strong and important. The use of gifts can also be used to make him/her feel special and loved (e.g. flowers, stuffed toys, tickets to concerts, phone credit, gift cards etc)

, Don't appear fixated or pay too much attention. Don't try to isolate her/him from her surroundings or peers - this is a common mistake in seduction of any kind. Your goal is to empower, not disempower.

, In that case, be a resource for maturity. Be a resource for honesty, self-expression, and clarity of intention. Let the teen empower you as well, showing your flaws. Be willing to give up authority. If you can't learn from this person, why are you wasting your time? Form a respectful, mutually-empowering friendship before moving forward.

, Seem indifferent to the fear, being neither pushy nor stand-off-ish. Give space, but don't react overtly. People who are afraid deserve space.

, You are in a position to help them learn, expand their horizons and introduce them to experiences that may not be able to encounter with the help of someone with a little more maturity (and maybe money). Don't force them to do anything they have no interest at all in.

, Don't be afraid to something your peers might think you are too old for., If s/he is afraid of her peers' or parents' judgment, act as though you understand. Remember, sexual desire is nothing to be ashamed of. But the best relationships are formed when sexual desire is expressed between people who are not afraid. You do NOT want to make a move on a fearful person.

,, Does s/he amaze you? (If not, maybe you're in the wrong relationship.) How did s/he get to be so unique? Ask that question to yourself first, and then show that his or her uniqueness matters, by exploring it further. Be appreciative (but don't overdo it).

, If s/he starts shortening your meetings, or resisting your meetings habitually, then move on. Resistance might not be expressed too well verbally, but don't push your love interest into an argument.

,, Refer to your love object as a man or woman. If your love object seems to want abundant physicality, then your move should be physical - a stroke of the hair or face, a clasp of hands.

, Teens will want to explore this...if not in the moment, then soon. Don't be discouraged...showing that you're not discouraged (but still sensitive to the teen's needs for space and privacy) makes the relationship an inevitable object of curiosity. Patience prevails.

Recognize when it's not working out.",How to Say Yes when a Guy Asks You Out," Let your sentence be well thought-out and avoid beating around the bush. Otherwise, he may be confused and a little hurt. Refrain from telling him something to the tune of ""Sounds okay"" or ""I'll go for it."" Both phrases convey reluctance which could give him a sense of insecurity about himself and nervousness. Instead, try for a phrase similar to ""Yes, I would love to!""


Here are examples of other responses that convey enthusiasm and certainty: ""That sounds great,"" ""Of course, I would love to,"" ""Yes, I'm so flattered you would ask,"" and ""That would be lovely.""
Here are some responses that would be appropriate for a text message proposal: ""Perfect, See U Then ;),"" "":) :) :) Yes! You can pick me up Friday,"" and ""I thought you'd never ask <3 <3 <3""
Don't feel like you need the perfect, well-thought out response. A perfect response can just be a sincere smile followed by an enthusiastic ""Yes!"";
, This step is especially ideal if you know beforehand that he's going to ask you out. Imagine him in your mind asking you out as vividly as possible so you can work through any fear you have beforehand. Carefully select the words you want to use in your response and say them out loud until you feel confident enough.

, Words are only half the battle when saying yes. If you are truly excited about his offer then your body should reflect that excitement. There are a few easy ways to convey enthusiasm throughout your body.


Keep an open posture. Don't cross your arms or your legs if you can avoid it. Stand with your arms open and your legs shoulder-width apart. A closed posture can convey fear, hesitation, and anxiety. Maintain eye contact and smile. You may become embarrassed or afraid, causing you to avert yours eyes away from him. Fight against your shyness and stare straight into his eyes while maintaining a bright, genuine smile so he knows you are as interested as he is. Don't be afraid of affection. If your reaction after saying yes is to give him a huge hug - then do it! Appropriate levels of physical affection, like a huge or a peck on the cheek, are an easy to show your enthusiasm.

, Being able to smoothly talk to romantic interests requires a strong sense of self-worth and belief in your own abilities. However, confidence doesn't happen overnight and you have to build it with a series of daily rituals and routines.


Make a habit of saying nice things to yourself. Focus on your strengths and constantly remind yourself of your best traits. For example, you might look at yourself in the mirror every once in awhile and say, ""I'm a caring, compassionate person and I deserve to feel confident.""
Talk to your friends and family about your insecurities. It's easy for negativity and self-doubt to build when you can't vent to anyone. Let your loved ones know when you're feeling down so they can remind you of your strengths and reaffirm how many people care about you.
Take time for yourself. Make sure you have time to immerse yourself in the things you enjoy. Paint, practice music, read, or engage with whatever your hobbies are so you can keep yourself upbeat and interested. Happy people are confident people.

, Inevitably you may trip up your words while responding to him, and that's completely fine. In fact, he may find your nervousness endearing. You don't need to be perfect, just keep talking to him and give him some form of a yes.

, You may have said ""No"" out of nervousness, shyness, or confusion. In this situation, your best course of action would be to talk to him as soon as you can and clear up your feelings. Explain the situation in a simple, calm fashion. For example, you might say, ""Wow, I can't believe how taken aback I was at your question the other day. I meant to say yes but I was so shocked that I blurted out no without thinking about it. I would love to go out with you!""

, ""Will you go out with me?"" is a vague question, and after or even before saying ""Yes"" you should make sure exactly what he's asking. Does he want to start a relationship? Is he interested in dating casually? Does he just want to go out to a movie? Understand his endgame so the two of you don't have different ideas about your future plans.

, Does he have a good personality that you are attracted to? Are you genuinely attracted to him or are you just flattered that someone would ask you out? Would you really consider starting a serious relationship with him?


If you answered yes to most of these questions, maybe he is someone you'd want to get into a relationship with. However, it's best that you get to know him better if you don't already know him well enough to go out with him.
If you answered no to most of these questions, perhaps you should reconsider your answer to him. You could decline or you could take the chance and go out with him, but remember to make sure you choose an answer that makes you happy and that you won't regret later.
Don't be afraid to take your time when deciding. Entering a relationship with someone is a decision that should be taken seriously. Remember that other partners will be available in the future so don't feel pressured to accept an offer from a person who you don't truly desire.

, Write down the traits you want your ideal partner to have. Consider things like religious beliefs, hobbies, career goals, ethics, physical features, sexual preferences, and lifestyle choices. Order them from most important to least important so you can determine which features you would be willing to compromise on. Next, try and discern how many of these features are mirrored in the guy who asked you out. , Think about whether you want to go out with him because you genuinely enjoy his company, or because you're trying to cover up insecurities. By accepting his invitation, you've started something with him, and you cannot end it after one day with him. Remember that boys are not toys - they have their own feelings as well, and you should respect that.

, This can be a good option if you're too taken aback or uncertain to respond immediately. If the guy cannot respect that, maybe you shouldn't consider dating him at all. However, if he truly cares about you and he respects your request then it's a good sign that he's worth your time.

, After saying yes, it's crucial to keep the momentum alive. A good way to do this is setting up another date after he initially asked you out. Maybe even switch roles and ask him out this time.

, For example, send a follow-up text after he asked you out saying how excited you are for the date. Or, you could just open more lines for casual conversation. Start asking him about his day, or open up and tell him some of the random thoughts on your mind that you might not communicate with anyone else.

, Unfortunately, a relationship may go awry even if you accepted his proposal in the best possible way. There can be number of early warning signs that can tell you whether the relationship, even if it's just casual dating, is worth it.


Look out for possessiveness. If you're only a few weeks into the relationship and he's trying to know your whereabouts 24/7, then something's not right. Make sure you have enough time for your own independence in the relationship. See if he's caught up on another lover. Some people rush into relationships in order to compensate for harsh breakups. Press gently on his past loves to gauge how he feels about them. Open up about your past relationships as well to make him feel more comfortable.
Heed advice from friends. Be sure to take him around your friends and family to get a feel for how he reacts around them. While you know what's best, the judgement of loved ones can be useful for judging whether someone is right for you.

Kiss her!",How to Pursue a Girl," First and foremost, you need to make this girl aware of your presence. Try to make a good first impression, but don't think too hard about it. Be confident, upbeat, and genuine. To start: try asking her a question, or making a situational joke. Tell her your name, and she'll probably tell you hers.


If you have a class together, find an excuse to talk to her about the class. Ask her about the homework, or crack a joke about the teacher.
Don't worry too much about saying exactly the right thing. The more natural and collected you feel, the better of an impression you will make.;
, It will probably be much easier to pursue a girl if you're on regular speaking terms with her. Strike up a conversation whenever you get the chance, and try to make a good impression each time. Do not fear the ""friend zone!"" Make friends with the girl, but be sure to keep up a sense of flirtation and mystery.

, Ask her questions about herself, and listen carefully to the answers. Don't let her do all of the talking, however! Many people love to talk about themselves, but you might come off as overbearing if you pin her down with a barrage of intense questioning. Make sure to keep up a careful balance of asking, listening, and talking.


What does she do for fun? What music, books, or movies does she love? Where did she come from? What is her favorite subject?
Be genuinely interested in what she has to say. You're trying to make a real connection with a human being, here – not just trying to ""get the girl."" Make her feel worthy of attention.

, Listen to her, and she may open up to you. There is a balance to be struck here: if she confides in you too intimately and platonically, it might be hard for her to make the mental jump to seeing you as a friend. That said, she'll probably be more comfortable taking you as a romantic partner if she knows that she can trust you.

, Throughout the day, steal glances at her when you get the chance. Don't be creepy about it – just make a point of looking in her direction. When she meets your gaze, smile slightly and look away quickly. This is a classic (and often effective) way of showing someone that you're interested.Studies have shown that basic flirting can be more important than physical attractiveness when it comes to getting someone's attention. People who signal their availability and confidence through smiling and eye contact tend to be the most effective at attracting mates.Eye contact can actually make someone more likely to find you attractive. Don't mistake this for a ""trick"" that will make your crush fall for you – but be aware of the effect, and try to use it to your advantage., Don't be afraid to smile and laugh a lot when you're talking to her. This shows her that you're interested in what she has to say, that you're enjoying her company, and that the two of you have a similar sense of humor. Be open and genuine.

, Once you've gotten to know her pretty well, look for ways to establish a physical connection. Offer a hug when you say hello and goodbye; touch her shoulder to get her attention or to emphasize a point; take her hand, briefly, to lead her somewhere; instead of sitting across from her, sit next to her with your thighs and shoulders touching. Find excuses to ""accidentally"" graze her arm or leg – even this can help you get her attention.Be aware that she may not be receptive to physical flirting. Stop what you're doing if she seems uncomfortable or doesn't respond well. She may not be interested in you, or she may not like being touched.
Touching is a great way to indicate that you're interested. If she responds well—and especially if she touches you back—there's a good chance that she's at least a bit interested., Say something sweet and simple so that she feels your attention on her. Say, ""I love your shoes!"" or ""Did you get a haircut? It looks really cute."" Try complimenting her on a talent or an accomplishment: ""Did you draw that? I'm impressed,"" or ""Great job in the 100-meter dash today!"" Make sure she knows that you appreciate her.

, When you are pursuing a girl, all of the talking and flirting is building up to one moment: the moment when you ""make a move."" This might take various forms, depending on the situation. Perhaps you want to ask her on a date, or to accompany you to a dance; perhaps you want to hook up with her at a party; perhaps you want to kiss her; or perhaps you just want her to know that you like her. No matter the case, the dynamic of pursuit means that you'll probably need to be the one to start this conversation.

, If you're serious about building a romantic relationship with this girl, consider asking her out on a ""date."" This can be as elaborate as a fancy dinner reservation or as simple as a walk to the park. The idea here is to spend meaningful one-on-one time together – to move your interaction pattern from ""friends-with-mutual-attraction"" to ""dating-and-acting-on-attraction.""


You may find that the simple act of asking her on a date changes the dynamic of your friendship. You are essentially shifting the agreed-upon balance from mostly-platonic to mostly-romantic. This is not bad, necessarily – but you should be aware of what's happening.

, This is a classic ""move"" that will show your interest and effectively set the stage for a more romantic relationship. Find the right moment: when you say goodnight at the end of an amazing date, or when the mood feels especially romantic. Be smooth and natural, and take it slow.


Notice when she wants to kiss you. If she is looking at you expectantly, watching your face, smiling a lot, and bringing her face close to yours – it might mean that she wants you to kiss her!
Wait for a moment that feels ""cinematic."" If it feels like this is the scene in a movie when the main character kisses the girl – then it is probably time for you to kiss the girl!
If she doesn't respond to the kiss, then you may have misread the moment. Don't be embarrassed. At the very least, going for a kiss makes your intentions clear, and it gives her the chance to accept or reject your advances.

Make sure you have flattering photos.,
Let her see that you have a social life.,
Let your profile reveal what makes you special.",How to Pick up Girls on Facebook1," Don't start chatting with a girl on Facebook if you haven't updated your photo since the eighth grade. Before you start picking up a girl on Facebook, you should make sure that your photos are up-to-date and that you look attractive, or at least like a nice guy. Don't put up a ton of photos with you and a million different girls unless you want to look like a player, and don't have a hundred photos of yourself being drunk or acting goofy unless you think that will appeal to the girl.


Just go through your photos and ask yourself ""Would the girl I'm trying to pick up be into this?"" If the answer is no, then delete the photos.
Keep some ""safe"" photos of you hanging out with some girls to show that girls actually like hanging out with you; Just don't have any pictures where your doing anything too provocative with another lady -- or a few other ladies.;
, If you're trying to pick up, and get to know a girl through Facebook, then she needs to see that you're a legit guy. You should have a fair amount of Facebook friends, post interesting things on your wall, show that you're attending events,comment on people's photos, and have people comment on your links. Let the girl see that you're a fun guy and that other people actually like talking to you.


If you only have ten Facebook friends and your wall hasn't been updated for a year, she'll get suspicious.
Don't post too often. Only post just enough to be active. You don't want the girl thinking that Facebook is your life.
Don't let her see that you're hitting on many girls on Facebook, even if you are. Be slick and keep your flirty messaging hidden, limited to chatting, or have private messages.

, While you shouldn't pour your heart out on Facebook, the girl should be able to browse your profile and learn a few cool things about you. If you're into a certain band, post a link to one of their songs on your wall; if you love surfing, have a few photos of you and your buddies hitting the waves. Let her see that you have many cool interests outside of Facebook.

Ask her to meet up.",How to Pick up Girls on Facebook2," Look through your Facebook and find a cute girl who seems fun, single, and lives in your area. Ideally, it should be someone who knows some friends of yours, someone from your school, or someone who is in your extended social circle. Don't pick a girl who is a stranger. Make sure she's not in a relationship, and if you can see her photos, look out for photos of a possessive-looking guy with his arm around her.

, If you're not friends with the girl yet, then you should ask her to accept you as a friend. Remember that a stranger will most likely not accept your friend request, and she may even be creeped out and block you. If you met the girl casually, then a friend request is okay, but if you just found her on someone else's profile and live on opposite sides of the country, it may be trickier to get her to accept your request.


If you met the girl briefly but aren't sure if she remembers you, you can send her a quick message with your request. Don't come on too strong. Just say something like, ""I had fun talking to you at Mike's party last week.""
If you see a cute girl posting on one of your friend's walls, then try to join the conversation. See if you can make a comment that she would like and try to get her to talk to you.
Be aware that Facebook has a strict no-harassment policy. If you send the girl a friend request and she doesn't accept it, leave her alone. Don't bombard her with aggressive messages, or she'll report you to Facebook and could get your profile disabled for good.

, Once you're Facebook friends with the girl, you'll have access to her page, where you can find out a few things about her, depending on how active she is on Facebook. The more you know about her before you begin really trying to pick her up, the easier it will be to talk to her and spark her interests. Pay attention to the following things:


See if you have any mutual friends. Check out your mutual friends or look through her photos to see whom she hangs out with. If you recognize one of the people, you can bring it up later -- in a natural way.
Pick up on her hobbies. Go through her pictures, wall, and Facebook groups to see if you can tell whether she likes going to the beach, playing tennis, or just going to many loud and crazy parties.
Check out her links. Does she link to the songs from Justin Timberlake's new album? Does she link to an article about Obama? See if you can notice more of her interests this way.
Read her posts. Read the posts on her timeline to see if you can learn what she thinks about work or school, who her favorite basketball team is, or even what she's doing for the holiday weekend.

, Take it nice and slow. Don't send her a message telling her she's hot the second she agrees to be your Facebook friend. Instead, spend some time developing your Facebook friendships. First, like one of her statuses or photos if it's appropriate. Then, you can start commenting on her photos or statuses. Make sure she communicates back to you and likes your comments and that you're not having a one-sided conversation.


Find the right time to start a longer conversation chain through comments. If she keeps writing back to you, then she must like talking to you.
As your relationship grows, you can post a link on her wall to something you think she'd like. Only do this once and wait for her to reciprocate before you do it again.
Don't mention that you know what her interests are from stalking her page. Just try to mention something that you've realized you have in common and wait for her to respond. For example, if you know she likes the Lakers, post about them and wait for her to like your status.

, Once you think she's feeling you and you've developed your posting and commenting relationship, you can take it to the next level by sending her a message. Just send her a few lines about something that reminded you of her, or direct her to a link you think she'd like. You can be a little flirtatious, but don't overwhelm the girl.






Wait for her to respond. If she asks you questions, then she wants to keep the messaging thing going.
Message her back. Once you do this a few times, then you can take this as a sign that she wants to take it to the next stage.

, Once you've been messaging back and forth with the girl for a while, then you can start Facebook chatting with her to have a more normal conversation. Just remember that not everybody likes to Facebook chat or even uses it -- she could be logged on to Facebook on her phone or at work, and not even realize that you're chatting her until later because she uses it so infrequently. But if she's into chatting, this is a great way to build your relationship.


Flirt it up. Now's the time to kick it up a notch. If she seems into you, you can say, ""Hey, cutie,"" or ""You looked great in that pic you just posted."" Don't be too forward, but let her know you're into her.
Talk about your common interests, or the things you know she likes. Remember all those things you learned about her from her profile? They'll come in handy here.

, You can message her and say that you like talking to her and would like to talk to her over the phone. This may freak her out and make her feel like you're coming on to strong, or it could be the perfect way for her to get to know you better before agreeing to go out with you in person. Feel her out to see what you think would be best.

, Unless you're just flirting with the girl on Facebook for the fun of it, you probably want to meet up with her in person at some point. So, once you have a good messaging and chat relationship, just say something like, ""I really like talking to you over Facebook, so I have a feeling I'd like talking to you even more in person. Do you want to meet some time?""


Keep it casual. Don't ask her out to a candle-lit restaurant. Ask her out for coffee or a drink. If she doesn't know you at all outside of Facebook and you don't have many mutual friends, she may be wary of this, so keep it in a public place and as chill as possible.
You can give her your number and wait for her to give you hers.
Have fun. If she agrees to meet in person, then enjoy building a relationship outside of Facebook. Moreover, if she rejects you, it's no big deal. The beauty of Facebook is that you can pick up multiple girls at once.

Find a balance between playing hard to get and being open to love.",How to Play Hard to Get While Encouraging Him to Want You," That's right. You have to own being a single lady while letting the guy see you in action. Being single is fun: you can meet a lot of new people, have a blast with your girlfriends, and go out without knowing what the night has in store for you. Let the guy see you laughing, dancing, and loving the single life, instead of looking around desperately, or being upset about not having a special someone.


If a guy sees you having fun living the single life, he'll want to be a part of your life even more.
You should enjoy the time you spend being single. You won't have it forever.;
, If you want him to want you, then you have to flirt with him at least a little bit. If he thinks you're an ice queen who doesn't want a moment of his time, then he'll quickly lose interest. So, flirt with him a little bit when you see him, but don't carry on too long. Just make eye contact, smile, and exchange a few playful words before you say you have to get going. Don't be rude; just don't be too enthusiastic, either.


Play with your hair while you talk to him.
Laugh and look at the floor; let him see you blush just a bit.
If you know each other well enough, you can give him a playful shove or a tap on the arm, that's really playing hard to get.

, If you want to play hard to get, then the guy can't think that he's the only person on your radar. You should flirt with a few other guys without taking advantage of them or being too obvious about it; let him see that you're desirable and that other guys want you, too. This doesn't mean you should do anything untoward or anything that makes you look promiscuous; just let him see that you're happy talking to other guys too.


Think of flirting with other guys as a way of keeping your options open.

, Guys want girls who are self-assured and come with a healthy dose of confidence. No guy wants to date a girl who seems like she has a confidence problem so he can help her get over all of her insecurities. It's okay: everyone is insecure. But the more you work on loving who you are, how you look, and what you do, the more appealing you'll be to the guy.


You want the guy to think that you're already awesome and that he'll just be adding to your awesomeness; not that you need him to make you whole.
If you want to feel confident, then you have to look confident. Walk with your head high, looking straight ahead of you, instead of down at the floor, and smile every chance you get.

, This doesn't mean you should dance on tables or laugh too loudly just to get some action from the male gaze. It does mean that you should have fun wherever you go, go a little crazy, and just have the time of your life no matter what you're doing. Guys are drawn to women who are fun-magnets, and if you're the life of the party, the guy will want to be around you even more.


And if you're in a bad mood or just not really feeling it, go home. It's better to leave if you're feeling grumpy than to force yourself to have a good time.

, If he asks for your number, be coy at first. Don't willingly recite your digits on command; make him work for it. Don't be rude, but don't act like you're ready to ride off into the sunset with him, either.

, If he asks if he can take you out Saturday, say you're busy. Give him another chance to ask you out.

, It goes without saying that you should avoid being clingy at all costs if you're trying to play hard to get. Sure, your third date might have gone fantastically well, but that doesn't mean you should start calling or texting the guy every hour to find out where he is and when you can hang out again. Even if you know he's into you, keep your distance, tone down the PDA, and let him see that you're your own person with your own interests and schedule.


The second you want to be around him 24/7 is the second he'll start rethinking your initial connection.
When you call him, don't just call to see how he's doing or what's up. Call to make plans or to talk over something concrete, so you don't look desperate.
Make sure to give him some of what he wants. If he wants to see you 24/7, make sure to see him at least once or twice a week. Don't be so afraid of being clingy that you're never around.

, If you want to stay mysterious, then you can't agree to hang out whenever the guy feels like it. If he asks what you're doing that weekend on a Tuesday or Wednesday, tell him you're booked, but that you're free one night the following weekend. If he texts you one day and wants to hang out just a few hours later, tell him you have plans; he can't think that he has you at his beck and call.


Make sure to find a balance. Don't pretend to be so busy that you never end up hanging out with the guy. Just don't make it look like your schedule is wide open.

, If you really want to play hard to get, then you can't put it all on the table. You should hang out with him, hook up or do whatever you want, and leave while you're still having a great time and enjoying each other's company. This doesn't mean you should excuse yourself in the middle of a make out session, but it does mean that you should leave him when you're both really feeling each other, instead of lingering around too long until you both get bored.


If you stay over, leave after some morning cuddling or breakfast; don't stick around looking all rumpled well into the afternoon.
It goes without saying: don't sleep with him right away. If you've just started to date, you don't want him to think that you're open for business whenever, wherever.

, Don't rush into the relationship if you want it to last. If you start talking about how many kids you want to have or rush to have him meet your parents and fifty closest friends after the third date, he will run for the hills. Instead, start off by seeing him just once a week or so, and don't rush to text or call him unless you have something to discuss. And, obviously, tone it down on the compliments or displays of affection until you know each other better.


It's tempting to rush in to a relationship that feels really right. But if you want to keep his interest, you have to keep him at a distance -- to an extent, anyway.

, If you want to stay mysterious, then you have to keep on doing the things that make you happy apart from the guy. This will show him that you're independent, self-assured, and that you know what you like and aren't afraid to go after it. Don't just drop your weekly yoga or art class just because it doesn't fit with the guy's schedule; in fact, let him know when you're going to be off doing your own thing and he'll like you even more for it.


Your schedule should be busy enough so that you have time to do the things you love, but not so packed that you only have time every three weeks to go on a date.
Don't be afraid to talk about the things you love with the guy, however far from mainstream they may be. This will only make him be even more interested in you.

, Keep on playing hard to get by continuing to enjoy a night out on the town with your girlfriends. Don't just start spending all of your time with your guy and abandon all of your single friends; keep on dancing, going out to eat, or doing whatever it is you love to do with your lady friends. And when you go out with the ladies, let the guy know. He may get a little jealous thinking about what you and your friends may be up to without him.


Even if you're just having harmless fun, making him a little jealous will get him to realize that he likes you even more.
Staying connected to your girlfriends will also keep you grounded and will deter you from getting into one of those obsessive relationships.

, This doesn't mean you should lie or be completely cagey about what you're up to that weekend. But hey, if you're busy next Saturday because you're going to Grandma Carol's eightieth birthday party, you can just tell the guy that you have plans and lead him to wonder about what you're doing; you won't be lying, right? If you put it all on the table and he knows exactly what you're up to every day of the week, then he'll think he has you in the palm of his hand.


If you're having a busy week, don't give him a list of all of the things you're doing. Just let him know you're busy.

, Even as you try to stay mysterious, make sure that the guy actually knows that you're into him. Compliment him, ask how he's doing, and generally show him that you care. If you want him to stick around, you have to put in some of the effort.


Just one simple compliment can go a long way. Try to give him at least one compliment every time you hang out.

, This can be a bit hard but once you get the hang of it then it will be as smooth as silk. Though you may be determined to play hard to get and to keep things a bit mysterious, you have to end up telling the guy how you feel if you want to keep him. You don't have to declare your love to him right away or tell him your fifty favorite qualities of his, but hey, if you do like the guy, it won't hurt to be honest with him. Tell him you had fun on your date, that you love hanging out with him, that you love his quirky sense of humor, whatever. If you don't give him anything to work with, he'll lose interest--fast.


And don't send him mixed signals, either. Telling him he's hot one night and being distant the next will just confuse him, not turn him on.

, Even if you're saying ""I love you"" and getting ready to say ""I do,"" you can always play hard to get to an extent. That means that, in any successful, long-lasting relationship, the courtship is never really over. Both you and your guy will continue making each other happy and will keep things exciting, interesting, and flexible. Don't stop flirting, being coy, or making your man continue to win you over, as long as he does the same.


Though the chase is never over, you don't have to play hard to get all the time once you're in a committed relationship. Try to minimize the mind games while keeping your man interested.

, If you got the guy's attention by playing hard to get to begin with, then you can't just quit the act and let him think that you will give up anything that matters to you to be with him. You will definitely need to adjust your schedule to make room for any serious love interest, but you should keep pursuing your interests, hanging out with you girlfriends, working out, or doing whatever it is you loved to do before you met the guy.


If both of you continue to spend time apart to do your own thing, then you'll be keeping each other interested. You'll be much more excited to see each other after some time apart.

, If you really want to go all in on a relationship, then you'll have to stop being so mysterious and just let love take you over. You should still make your guy see that you're desired by lots of guys and that you're an interesting person with a busy schedule, but you shouldn't make him continue to feel like you might have another guy on your mind, or like your heart isn't really in the relationship.


In the end, you'll have to open up and be more available if you're ready for long-lasting love. But if you're not ready and want to keep having fun, then play on.

Sometimes, if you think a guy is picking on you, or being mean to you, it can actually be a sign that he likes you. Young boys usually don't know how to express that they like someone and will act out instead. If there's a guy in your class who seems to pick on you more than others, and makes fun of you more regularly, it's probably a sign that he likes you.If he ever lightly punches or pokes you, imitates your voice or posture, or just tries to tease you somehow, it's almost always a sign that he likes you and wants you to notice him.
This generally applies more to younger guys than older guys, but then again, some guys are forever-13, so it might apply to any age.
Sometimes being mean is just a sign that someone's mean. It's not always a guarantee. Try being nice back and see if he changes his tone at all. If you always curl up your nose and tell him he's gross, he'll probably just keep being mean.;
, If a guy regularly looks in your direction and makes eye contact, that's often a sign that he likes looking at you. That probably means he likes you. If you're sitting in class and notice a boy staring in your direction, it could definitely be a sign of some major ""liking"" going on.


Does he look embarrassed when you make eye contact? Like he just got ""caught""? If so, that's definitely a sign that he likes you. Or it could also be a sign that you have some food on your face.

, If a guy has sudden urge to start talking to you regularly, it's obviously a sign that he wants to hear what you have to say. That means that he likes you. If a guy goes out of his way to talk to you more than once, it's because there's something about you that he finds interesting. Talk back and find out if you feel the same way.


If a guy you've never talked to starts trying to chat with you on social media, it could be a sign that he likes you and is shy. Talking on social media is one of the easiest ways to approach somebody, and will seem less intimidating than walking up to you in person.
If a guy starts asking you a lot of questions, it could be a sign that he's read a lot of online how-to articles about chatting with girls and wants you to be comfortable. Pretty good sign he likes you.

, If this guy seems normal around other people, but then starts getting quiet and shy around you, it's a good sign that he likes you. If a guy starts to get anxious when you're around, and stops talking, it means that he's nervous and wants to make a good impression on you, but might not know how.Try talking to this guy one-on-one, and ask him questions so he won't get so nervous and will be able to talk more easily. Or try chatting with him on social media, or texting. This can be a lot easier for shy types.

, Sometimes, guys just want to make you laugh. If you have a different sense of humor, though, his jokes just might seem weird to you. This can make you even more confused. If a guy's just acting weird, it could be a sign that he just wants to get your attention and make you laugh, because he likes you.Pay attention to see if this guy acts very different around you than around other people. If he starts doing weird things, but only when you're around, it's possibly a sign that he likes you.

, Do you notice that a guy seems to look better when you're around? If he's putting a little extra effort into his appearance, it's a sign that he's trying to impress someone. That someone might definitely be you, if it only seems to happen when you're together.

, If you're friends with a guy and you've started spending a lot of time together alone, it could be a sign that he likes you. Have you been hanging out one-on-one a lot lately? Does he seem hesitant when you suggest hanging out in a group? Could some of your hang-outs be called dates? If so, it could be a sign that he wants you to be more than a friend.


Alternatively, if he seems to pull away from you and spend less time around you, that may also be a sign that a guy likes you. It can be hard and confusing for guys when they realize they like somebody.

, If a guy lightly touches you on the shoulder, or on the leg, or goes in for a hug sometimes, it's probably a sign that he likes being close to you and wouldn't mind getting even closer. If a guy is comfortable with physical contact, it could definitely be a sign that he likes you.


If a guy is uncomfortable with a touch, that doesn't necessarily mean that he doesn't like you. It could just be a sign that he's super-nervous around you and doesn't know what to do.
If a guy touches you inappropriately, or touches you in any way that you don't like, that's a problem. Tell him to stop and tell your teacher, parent, or some other authority figure.

, If a guy gives you something, it's usually a sign that he likes you. Even if it's a weird gift that you're unsure how to take, it's a sign that he's thinking about you and wants to make some kind of impression.


If a guy gives you something that you don't like, try to be nice anyway. He's probably just guessing, or giving you something that he might like. Even something weird, like a jar of Play-Doh, could be a sign that he wants you to like him.

, Sometimes, it's hard to point to one thing in particular that a guy is doing differently, but you just have this feeling that he's acting differently around you. If that's the case, it might be true. You might be noticing that he's feeling attracted to you, and has started changing as a result of it. He might like you.

, So, you think this guy might like you. What are you going to do about it next? It's important to figure out how you feel about him, to know how to handle it.


If you like the guy, great! Keep reading this section for more advice about how to get to know him a little better and move forward.
If you don't like this guy, you can either ignore him entirely, or you can politely ask that he stop what he's doing and tell him that you don't feel the same way. It's best to do this in private, so you don't embarrass him or hurt his feelings.

, If you're unsure about whether or not a guy likes you, try talking to your friends to find out more. Maybe someone knows for a fact that he actually likes somebody else, or is seeing somebody else. Or, maybe one of them has heard specifically that he likes you. It's always best to check around and see if anybody heard any good gossip.


If you can, try talking to some of his friends to find out. They might know for sure. Or you can just observe them to see how they act when you're around. You can pick up a lot from the lunch room.
Don't send one of your friends to talk to one of his friends. The message can get easily lost in translation. Then he might find out that you actually like him, which might make for an awkward situation.

, If you hardly know this guy, friend him on Facebook and other social media and try to find out as much as you can about him and his interests. This is the best way to learn what you have in common, and it can give you some clues as to whether or not he likes you, too.


If he starts liking a lot of your pictures, or interacting with you a lot of Facebook, it could definitely be a sign that he likes you.
It's hard to tell much from Facebook, though. Some people just ""like"" a lot of stuff. It might just be a sign that he likes the way your dog looks.

, Of course it's always a little awkward to have that talk. If you're getting the signals, just try hanging out for a while one-on-one and see if you get along well together. Think of some way you two could hang out together and ask him.


See if he wants to go to the next school game with you, or sit with you at lunch, on the bus, or at some school function. It doesn't have to be like a ""date"" if you want to spend a little time talking together.
If he turns you down, it could be a sign that he doesn't like you, but it could also be a sign that he's just nervous, or doesn't know how to react. It could also be a sign that he's not allowed to date and would be embarrassed to tell his parents about this.

, If you've noticed a bunch of different signs, just try flirting back with this guy and seeing how he reacts. The single best way to learn whether or not a guy likes you is talking to him. It's a lot easier than sneaking through his photo history on Facebook and trying to figure out things based on the evidence. Quit beating around the bush and have a conversation with this guy if you want to learn more about his likes and dislikes.


try to talk to him one-on-one, not in a group. You don't need to do anything special, just say, ""Hey, I've just noticed you've been acting kind of different around me. Do you like me?""
If you like the guy, you could also just come right out and say it and see what he says. Just say, ""Hey, I've just been noticing you a lot lately. You seem funny and cute. I really like you.""

Luckily, looking good does not actually take a lot of work -- clean off, brush your teeth, and wear clean, crisp clothes.


Wear deodorant and, if you are putting on cologne or other fragrance, be sure to use it in moderation.
Imagine you are going out on a date. You want to be clean and prepared to impress.;
, Clubs are, without fail, hot, dark, and sweaty places. You want to look presentable but still have the freedom to move, dance, and enjoy yourself. Remember, however, that every club is different -- some have a dress code. You may want to check the place out online or ask a friend before you head out.


To look polished but still casual, try a pair of dark wash denim jeans.Try not to wear black, as black-lights have a habit of making unflattering reflections. Blues, grays, and solid color shirts or basic patterns look clean and cool., While you don't want to spend the whole night talking to people you already know, having friends around makes the whole evening more fun and gives you people to talk to when things get awkward. Most people go to the club with friends, and if one of your friends makes a connection with someone, the rest of the group often gets introduced as well.


Avoid calling your group an ""entourage"" or your ""wing-men.""
If you're going alone and aren't the most gregarious person, you may feel awkward. That's okay though! Just try to have fun, meet people, and dance.

, Despite the rumors of alcohol as ""liquid courage,"" sloppy drunks are no fun for anyone. There is nothing wrong with having 2-3 drinks throughout the night, but you shouldn't need to get hammered in order to talk to women. Pace yourself so that you are clear and coherent. You should be able to hold a conversation with someone and dance without stumbling.If you need a time-frame, try to limit yourself to one full drink an hour.

, No one likes a person who is clearly just looking for someone to hook-up with. It alienates your friends and, more often than not, comes off as visibly creepy. More importantly, having fun will make it easier to meet someone, as you won't feel as nervous and will have the confidence to talk to others. Having fun exudes positive energy!


It's fine to want to meet women when you go out. But if the only reason that you go clubbing is to meet women while intoxicated, then you will usually go home disappointed.

, Finding the right woman to talk to might be the hardest part of the whole process, but try not to overthink things. Head up to the bar and chat in line while you wait. Say hello to a woman sitting along the wall or at the edge of the dance floor. Focus on quiet areas where you could actually have a conversation.

, It is remarkably simple and yet remarkably effective.While you'll need to have some conversation topics on hand, breaking the ice doesn't require a perfect pick-up line. More often than not, they've heard it before and it won't be funny or charming.


If she smiles back and introduces herself, offer to buy her a drink. Make sure, however, that she doesn't have a full drink right in front of her., You aren't trying to determine if someone is your soulmate, you're just trying to break the ice. Mention something about the club, her drink, or the music. Humor is one of the best ice-breakers on the planet, so throwing in a joke here and there shows that you are spontaneous, fun, and laid-back.Avoid talking about marriage, exes, or long-term commitments. Remember that flirting is supposed to be light and fun, not serious.

, Saying ""you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen"" is bland and unspecific and she will, more likely than not, not believe you. But if she has beautiful eyes, a great fashion sense or killer hair, tell her. You don't want to rain compliments down on her, but a genuine compliment can go a long way.


If she complements you back, don't deflect or ignore it. Thank her politely and accept the compliment.

, Sometimes a simple, confident approach is all you need to get the girl on your arm. Once you've smiled, made eye contact, and said a few words, nod towards the floor and ask her to dance. While this may seem like the equivalent of asking for a kidney donation in the moment, just go for it. A little confidence and directness will go a long way. You could say:


""Let's dance.""
""Can I borrow you for a song?""
”I love this song. Want to join?”

, People will reject you for a variety or reasons, 99% of which aren't personal. They may have a partner, want to hang out with friends, feel tired, etc. Don't take it personally. It happens to everyone and your life will be no worse off because a stranger at the club wasn't interested in dancing with you., There is a variety of signs that someone may be interested, and they change from person to person. That said, there a few universal signs that she may want to take things to another level. If, however, she breaks eye-contact frequently, refuses to face you, or shrugs off the conversation, just move on -- she probably isn't interested. Here are some signs that she might enjoy your company:


She is laughing, smiling, and has an air of comfort around you.
She is breaking the touch barrier, often by touching your upper arm.
She is teasing, joking, or lightly making fun of you., She's laughing, making eye contact, and smiling, and the best way to see if she's ready for a dance is to lightly make contact. When you get up, gently place your hand on the top of her arm or the small of her back, or touch her hand at the bar when she makes a joke or good point.Don't linger or grab her; a brief touch on a non-threatening area, like the arm or hand, is enough.

, After you've danced, chatted, and had a good time, hand her your number and let her know you had a good time. More often than not she'll respond by giving you her number as well, but even if she doesn't, you've put the ball in her court.For example, you could say: ""I've had a good time, and I'd love to see you again. Give me a call sometime.""
You could also try something like: ""Let's grab another drink/coffee together soon.""

, If you've really clicked and can feel serious sparks between the two of you, let her know. Tell her you've had fun and ask if she wants to grab drinks, needs a ride/walk home, or wants to grab a late-night snack. If she asks you ""what are you doing after this,"" it is likely not for casual conversation: she wants to see you later that night. Let her know that you'd love to grab another drink or have her over to your place.


For instance, you could say: ""Let's grab a drink somewhere quieter.""
You could also try something like: ""I'm getting out of here -- you have any plans?""

If you want to go out with him, then just say yes.,

",How to Respond When Asked on a Date," If you really like him, then go for it. Even if you get embarrassed easily, it's just one word.;
, This could just end up hurting him more - no one wants to go out with someone who doesn't like them.

, If you say maybe, then it could just be giving false hope if you end up deciding not to go out with him. You don't want to lead him on.

, Don't be harsh in your letdown; it probably took him weeks to get the courage to confront you.

Invite her to coffee at the mall.",How to Pick up Girls at the Mall," When girls are at the mall, they’re engulfed in a world of fashion so they will be more likely to check out what you’re wearing. Make sure you come to the mall dressed in a stylish outfit that accents your best features. Wear something that is your style, but make sure not to wear anything that has lots of stains or looks dirty.Wear a shirt color that matches or complements your eye color. This will help accentuate your eyes and make them pop.
Classic pants like dark denim or khaki are a good option to appear stylish.;
, Before approaching a girl at the mall you want to make sure you look your best. Head to the bathroom to check out how you look. Make sure you don’t have any food on your mouth or shirt. Use a brush or your fingers to brush your hair and smooth over any stray hairs that might be sticking out.

, One way to get a girl to remember you is to wear a hint of scent on your body. Use one spritz of cologne or perfume to give yourself a subtle scent that will stay on the girl’s mind. Make sure you don’t put on too much or she might be turned off. Stick to one to two sprays max.

, Using eye contact to flirt with a girl is a great way to get her paying attention to you. Play an eye flirting game.Glance in her direction and wait for her to look over at you. When she does, turn away and look at something else. Do the same thing again, but this time wait a little longer before turning away. Continue until it’s obvious you’re looking at her and then go up to talk to her.
Say something like, “Hi, I just had to come talk to you. I could see how beautiful your eyes are from all the way over there.”

, If you see a girl your want to pick up in a store, try going up to her and asking for fashion advice. Grab a shirt off the rack and approach her with it. Hold it up to your face and ask her if she thinks it looks good with your eyes. Saying something like this will make her think you appreciate her knowledge and get her to look you in the eyes. Once she gives her answer you can continue the conversation. Try saying “Thanks. Wow, you have beautiful eyes. I bet everything in this store would look good with your eyes!”, A great way to pick up a girl at the mall is to be upfront and approach her directly. Directly telling a girl that you find her attractive can be intimidating, but it can also be very rewarding.Go up to her and say something like, “I’m sorry to interrupt you, but I just had to come over here to tell you how beautiful you are. You light up this entire room with your beauty!""
When you approach her directly, be calm and just act like yourself. If you feel awkward, say that. You could tell her, “Hey, I feel awkward saying this, but I wanted to tell you that I think you are incredibly beautiful.”

, If the girl you want to pick up is with a group of friends, approach the entire group first and then speak directly to her.You could say, “Excuse me ladies, sorry to interrupt your fun, but I just had to come over here to introduce myself to your friend.” Then, say your approach line to the girl you want to pick up.
Next say, “Hi, I’m Matt and I just needed to come tell you that you light up this entire mall with your smile. You must have a beautiful soul because you radiate with beauty.”

, When you approach a girl, she may be a little suspicious at first, so don’t immediately ask her for her number or give her yours. Let the approach lead you to a conversation with her. Talk to her for a while so that she’ll feel comfortable and get to know you a bit. She’ll be more likely to want to see you again if she feels like she knows you a bit., One of the best ways to seal the deal and get a girl’s phone number is to be confident and calm the entire time you are talking to her. If you are really anxious or self conscious, the girl will pick up on it, get a negative vibe from you, and most likely not give you her number. If you feel nervous, take a deep breath and try to fake the confidence. Imagine you’re just talking to a friend instead of a girl you like., At the end of your conversation, ask if you can exchange numbers with the girl to possibly see her again. Ask her to enter her number in your phone and you can to the same with hers, or you can call or send a quick text so your number is on her phone.Say something like, “I’m sorry to end this, but I have to be going. I’ve really enjoyed talking to you, and I’d love to do it again sometime. Let’s exchange numbers so we can meet up for coffee sometime.”

, The great thing about picking up a girl at the mall is that you don’t have to go far to have a first mini date. After talking to a girl for a bit, go out on a limb and ask her if she’d like to join you for coffee or lunch at a place in the mall. Tell her you want to hear more about her and would love to buy her a coffee.

Broaden your horizons.,
Understand the (straight) male-female dynamic.,
Be yourself, but be your best self.,
Perfect your body language.,
Never forget: body language is powerful, but it's not always clear.,
Learn this mantra: do or die.",How to Pick Up a Girl1," Don't get sucked in to thinking that you can find girls only to date when you're out at a party or at the bar or pub. You never know where or when you might meet a girl who would be open to a night out with you if you play your cards right. The saying “there are plenty of fish in the sea” reflects this fact. If you want to find a girl to pick up, keep your eyes open everywhere you go: at work, in cafes, on the street, pretty much anywhere public. That being said, there are a couple of important things to keep in mind:


A supermarket pickup is a hard sell. Most people don't go to the grocery store or the bank because they are hoping to find romance, which is why the conventional wisdom rightly suggests that bars, clubs, and parties are the best places to meet potential dates. Do not expect a good response if you try picking up girls in places they have to go because life demands it.
Instead, consider open-air markets, cafes, and other places people go because they want to be out. It is likely that girls in such places will be at least somewhat more receptive to meeting new people, since they are not on important business.
Unless you are hoping to become some sort of Don Juan (note: you will not succeed if this is your plan), perform a “ring test” before hitting on anyone. Is the girl wearing a band or diamond-set ring on either ring finger (or both)? If so, she is likely married (left hand) or engaged to be married (right hand). Respect that and leave her alone.;
, This varies widely from country to country, but generally speaking, there is a clear paradigm in the Western world (that is, Europe, Australia, and North America) that defines what men and women find attractive in the opposite sex. It's actually very complicated, but at the most basic level, it works like this: Women are primarily attracted to social power and influence; men are primarily attracted to fertility and health (which is why Western culture is obsessed with making women look youthful).


There is a whole universe of things that men can do to suggest social power and thus become more attractive. Consider developing a strong sense of style or a clever sense of humor. Physical wealth is a strong display of social power, which is why some guys maintain beautiful cars even though they're otherwise living in poverty. Think about how you can accentuate your life to emphasize your own strengths.
The most basic and perhaps most useful way to show that you have social power is to be confident. By demonstrating an ability to speak and act in a self-assured manner, you can show that you have nothing to fear from other men, which makes you seem relatively powerful. This is why it is often said that confidence is everything in the dating world. Become confident, and the rest of the pickup game boils down to details; fail to exhibit confidence, and you will always struggle to get dates.

, It's important that you avoid being fake. Women are very perceptive and will not take you seriously if you're disrespecting them by pretending to be someone or something you're not. On the other hand, women aren't looking for a mess to clean up, either. One of the greatest benefits of a long-term relationship is having the freedom to share your worries and fears with someone who loves you, but right now, you aren't in a long-term relationship - you're washing laundry next to someone with a cute smile and a funny T-shirt. Don't lose perspective. The pickup is your chance to show off all there is to like about you, not an excuse to start unloading on a girl who was nice enough to listen.

, Body language is more than just standing with a straight back and making eye contact: it's the whole package, everything you do to communicate that isn't the words coming out of your mouth. Body language is the primary way that human beings communicate emotional states to each other, making it an all-important “language” to learn if you want to be at the top of your dating game. The rules of thumb are as follows:


More eye contact is better than less eye contact.
Smile whenever you make eye contact. Don't look away until you've smiled.
Don't stare. Try to keep your eyes from glancing at a woman's body if you're talking to her.
Adopt an open stance: legs and arms uncrossed, shoulders back, head level. This makes you appear confident, relaxed, and receptive.
Don't mumble. Speak clearly and without hesitation.
Lean in slightly to the person you're interested in when you speak to her. Bringing your head slightly forward is fine if you're seated.

, For example, people tend to touch the parts of themselves they think are attractive when they are attracted to someone. A girl who keeps touching her lips or chest with one hand as she talks to you might be interested; then again, she could just be itchy. Take any cues you think you see with a grain of salt.

, If a girl was attracted to you, wouldn't you want her to let you know now instead of three years from now? Girls feel the same way. This is why slowly trying to win over a woman's heart by ingratiating yourself to her never seems to work: women want a man who will come right out and say how he feels. If he really is interested enough to want a date, he should be willing to risk rejection for the sake of the chance.


Even women who are very attracted to you won't wait around for you to ask them out forever. They'll either decide that you aren't attracted to them and give up, or that you aren't attractive because you were never brave enough to ask for a date.
When you feel attracted to a girl, if you don't ask her out the same day you realize you want to date her, assume you have around a month at most to make your intentions known. Don't wait for a perfect moment.

"
Have a line ready.,
Build the conversation.,
Use humor.,
Keep compliments subtle.,
Show your spine.,
Ask for her number.,
Prepare for a first date.",How to Pick Up a Girl2," Start by knowing the first thing you're going to say to the girl you have your eye on before you say it. It doesn't have to be anything especially exciting – just an invitation to talk. Try bringing up the weather if you're outside, or the decor if you're somewhere indoors. At a party, bring up something about the party or ask how she met the host or hostess. Just have a starting line picked out before you begin.

, If your prompt elicited a cold response, you have two options: give up or go straight to a flirt and hope for the best. If, on the other hand, the girl responded warmly to you, it's time to let your conversational skills shine.


Talking to someone you've only just met is challenging for both of you. If you make it easier for her she'll appreciate it. Try offering a few opinions on something inconsequential, such as the music in the background. Keep it honest, and see how she responds. Listen to what she says and ask her for more details about her opinion. By putting yourself out there first, you are making it safe for her to follow suit and agree or disagree with your opinion.
Try not to turn the conversation into an interview, asking things like: “What do you do?” “Where do you live?” “Where did you go to school?” in rapid succession. Instead, turn such questions into statements (like ""You look like you're from Rome"" or ""I bet you're an event planner""). You'll seem bolder and give her room to respond more naturally, which will help her relax and enjoy the talk.

, Humor is universal, and finding someone who appreciates your personal sense of humor is a great feeling. On the other hand, someone who lets your jokes fall flat is probably neither interested in you nor worth pursuing, which makes humor a great way to test the waters without being awkwardly upfront about it.


Even if you think your sense of humor is too quick, subtle, or strange for most people to appreciate or understand, unleash it during your conversation. If the girl you're talking to is interested, she'll hang on your jokes and laugh at them even when other people don't.

, Whatever compliments you make should come up naturally. The key to a good conversation is to talk about things you both feel comfortable discussing. When you find a way to give her a compliment or a flirt that doesn't break the flow of the conversation, go for it; otherwise, keep your pickup lines to yourself.


The only possible responses a woman can give to a blatant compliment are to agree with it (in which case she seems full of herself), disagree (in which case she seems embarrassed), or throw the compliment back at you, which is generally unlikely, especially early on in the conversation. It's more important to show that you're fun company than it is to explicitly state that you find her attractive, which should already have been obvious from the fact that you came over and started running your game on her.

, Girls like a guy who is secure and comfortable in his own skin. Never shy away from answering questions about yourself honestly. Most girls prefer the guy who builds robots in his basement and has the moxie to say so with a smile over the guy who acts ashamed or embarrassed about it.


Don't be afraid to make gentle criticisms (making them in the form of questions, as in “but isn't that kind of silly?” is a good way to do this) or gentle jokes at her expense, as long as you don't make very many. Girls appreciate it when a guy seems interested but not dazzled, because it means he's less likely to become too attached too quickly and make things uncomfortable for them. On the other hand, someone who's constantly making mean jokes at her expense is just going to seem rude and childish.

, When it's time to wrap up the conversation, cut things off on a high note and ask for her number. Say that you're having a great time, but it's time for you to head back home/off to work/whatever you were planning to do next. If she says she doesn't want to give you her number, be gracious and wish her a good rest of the day. If you do get her number, call within a day or two and see about scheduling a date for the weekend.

, The best first dates are those that do not require a lot of silent time together. Avoid concerts and movies. Instead, suggest something that will give you both room to talk, and which does not cost a lot of money. Have an idea and a couple of alternates ready ahead of time; most women prefer it when the man decides on the date.


If you have a guess about something out of the ordinary that you think she'll appreciate, such as renting a paddle boat, suggest that; otherwise, stick to lunch, coffee, or drinks somewhere. All of these options provide plenty of opportunities for uninterrupted conversation and (if you're lucky) a first kiss.
Offer to pay for the first date, but don't insist on it. Some women find the notion that a man should pay for every date insulting, and will prefer to split costs with you or pay their own way. Whatever your date prefers, go along with it.
Give her some space. This is a first date, not a marriage contract. Once you've settled on a time and place, don't call her again until it's time to meet. You'll have plenty of time to talk then.
If she calls and asks to reschedule, give her the benefit of the doubt – after all, if she wanted to reject you, she could already have done so before now. Be patient and flexible.

"

Understand the risks.,
Wait until you have some time alone.,
Ask her out simply.,
Exercise restraint.",How to Pick Up a Girl3," This is a delicate situation at best, but remember that your friend is unlikely to stop wanting to be your friend just because you asked her out, even if she doesn't want to go on a date. The bigger problem is likely to come from you, as you try to move on from asking her. If all your hopes and dreams are hinging on getting a date with your friend, you are probably in for a lot of disappointment.

, This can potentially save you a lot of embarrassment in front of mutual friends. If your friend has half as much respect for you as you have for her, she won't embarrass you about it after the fact. If she does cause a scene, she wasn't worth it anyway.

, Don't declare your love – just ask her to come on a date with you. It may very well be that you do love your friend, but saying it won't change anything because it doesn't give her any concrete reason to consider dating you. It's better to keep your feelings on the down low and treat your offer like any other.


Make sure you're very clear that you're asking for a romantic date, and not just a time to hang out. Hiding or muddling your intentions won't help anything.

, No matter what the result of your offer to take your friend on a date, the onus of responsibility is on you to be mature and graceful. If she says yes, that's great – but it's still no time to unload anything on her. After all, you haven't even gone on a first date yet. If she says no, don't take out your disappointment on her, either. Instead, excuse yourself (she'll understand) and go home to mourn in private.

"
"
Understand the risks.,
Don't poop where you eat.,
Be respectful.,
Be discreet.",How to Pick Up a Girl4," Unlike a classroom setting, the chances that you will have to work closely with a girl you ask out, regardless of whether or not she agrees to date you, is much higher in the workplace. You can't just request another partner or wait for the semester to end, and neither can she. As long as you understand the risks to your comfort level (and hers) if things don't go as planned, you can take steps to minimize those risks and ensure that your work life will continue to be bearable no matter what happens.

, This old adage (in any of its many colorful variations) is considered timeless for a good reason. The closer you are to someone outside of your dating life, the more likely it is that dating or otherwise pursuing that person will eventually lead to drama and misery. At work, this means you're better off trying to pick up a girl you don't work with very closely or very often, if you can help it at all.


If you work at a large business like a department store or a major business office, try to focus on picking up girls who work in other departments than your own. That way, no matter how things pan out, both of you will be able to come to work with minimal awkwardness afterward.

, Obviously, respect is an important component of any (realistic) dating strategy, but in the workplace, you must be especially conscious of it. Think about it from the girl's perspective: She's there because she needs a job, not because she thought there were a lot of cute boys behind the counter when she was job hunting. Anything that makes her job more stressful is going to ripple throughout her life, because she can't afford to just stop showing up on account of one uncomfortable exchange with a coworker. Never put a girl in the position of dreading work more than she already would have before you asked her out.


Be brief, be polite, and if you are rejected, don't press the issue or otherwise bother her afterward. Even if you think you're being friendly, chances are she's not going to appreciate you continuing to step into her sphere after she already said no. Give her plenty of space.

, A lot of employers frown on workplace romance, because it is often accompanied by lost productivity and conduct violations (ranging from overlong cigarette breaks to inappropriate breakup arguments and more). If you're going to pursue a woman at work, don't spread your intentions around.


As long as work continues more or less the same as it did yesterday, your bosses won't personally mind one bit if you try to pick up a girl on the job, or even end up regularly dating her. Just remember: the workplace is for work first; everything else is a secondary concern, no matter how interesting or important it might seem to you.

If it's going well, take it to the next level.",How to Pick Up a Woman," The first step to picking up a woman is finding the right woman. You should find a woman who looks ready to talk to someone new, whether it's because she's bored with her current company, or just because she's out and looking for some fun. Though you can't always tell if a woman wants some new company, the more open she is, the more likely you'll be to succeed. Here are some tell-tale signs that you should go up to her:


Obviously, if she's checking you out. If she has looked over at you more than once, and has even smiled when you caught eyes, then she is checking you out. If her friends are all looking over at you and giggling, then she -- or at least one of her friends -- is checking you out. Get over there already.
If she looks bored or annoyed with her company. Maybe she's yawning repeatedly when talking to a needy girlfriend, or she keeps rolling her eyes at the group of loud bros she showed up with. Come on, knight in shining armor -- it's your chance to gallop on over and save her from her company. If you read the situation correctly, then she'll appreciate the change of pace.
Don't approach if she's on a date, unless it's obviously not going well. If she's having an intense lip-locking session with her man, steer clear. But if she's on what looks like a first date and she looks absolutely bored or the guy she's with is spending more time checking his phone, you can approach her when the guy steps out if you're feeling bold.
Don't approach if she's having an intense catch-up session with her girlfriend. If she's in a big group of women, that's one thing, but if it's her and another friend, and they are talking quickly and intensely and they haven't scanned in crowd in over an hour, she's probably getting some much-needed catch up time with a friend.

, Once you've found your target, you need to show her that you're confident about who you are, that you love what you do, and that you'd love to get to know her, but your life won't be over if she rejects you. Remember that most women will know if they want to go home with you within the first fifteen minutes of the conversation, so make your time with the girl count. Here's how to do it:


Make eye contact. First, make eye contact with her from across the room. Then, make sure to lock eyes with the woman when you come up to her. You don't have to be creepy about it, but you should show that you're comfortable enough with the situation to look into her eyes instead of staring at the floor or your feet.
Smile. Smiling will show that you're cool with the situation, and that you're not nervous. Remember: you're happy with who you are, so even if she rejects you flat out, you'll walk out with your head high.
Don't slouch and don't cross your arms over your chest. Keep your body open -- anything can happen.
Give her all of your attention. Without getting too close, turn your body toward her, and avoid any distractions, like checking your phone every five seconds -- or at all.
Part of looking confident is dressing well. You don't have to wear something expensive, but just put on a flattering outfit that fits well, and look like you've showered earlier that day.

, Once you've come up to the girl, you have to make sure you say and do the right thing so you hook her interest. If you start off on the wrong foot, it may be hard to recover, so you should make a good impression as soon as you can. Here's how to do it:Relax. If you're not relaxed when you join her, she'll know it in a second and will be turned off. Remind yourself that the worst thing that can happen is that she rejects you. Can you survive that?
Don't use a pick up line. Unless you think she has a really silly sense of humor, avoid any common pick up lines like, ""You must be tired, because you've been running through my mind all night."" Women won't appreciate your lack of originality.
Make it clear that you're hitting on her. Though you'll need to charm her friends because their approval will be important to her, you should make it clear that you want her attention, not that you're the kind of guy who approaches a group of eight women hoping that just one of them will want him (even if this is the case).
Be direct. Just say, ""Mind if I join you?"" Or, if she looks bored with her company and you're feeling brave, just say, ""Would you like to come sit with me? I'd love to buy you a drink.""
Introduce yourself. Tell her your name, and if you want to be cute and formal, you can even shake her hand.

, Let's face it. People want to feel special. Don't feed her corny lines about how hot she is. Instead, let her know that you think she's a unique chick and do in an authentic way. Here's how to do it:


Ask her questions about herself. Don't pry or get personal. Just ask her a few questions about herself, like what she loves to do, if she likes her neighborhood, or even her favorite sports teams or TV shows. You don't want to walk away and have the girl think, ""Wow, he doesn't know one thing about me. He obviously just wanted to talk to me because he thought I was hot.""
Ask her opinion on things. Show that her opinion matters. Just ask her some light-hearted questions about what she thinks of the cocktails at the bar you're at, or even if she likes your new shoes.
Don't be afraid to compliment her even if you think she's heard it all before. If she's beautiful, interesting, or has a great sense of humor, tell her. If you're casual and honest about it, you won't overwhelm her.

, The key to picking up a woman is not only making her enjoy talking to you, but to make her think, ""Hey, this is awesome -- I want more of this."" She should not only think you're a fun guy to talk to at a bar, but that she'd like to see you outside of a public setting. Here's how to do it:


Show her what makes you special. Without showing off, tell her at least two or three things that will make her want to get to know you. Did you teach yourself Japanese or spend a year on a motorcycle in Rio? Cool. Just don't make anything up.
Find some common bonds. Find something you have in common, whether it's your love for college basketball or Mexican food, that you can talk about. Don't make her think, ""I love talking to this guy, but I just don't think it'll go anywhere because we don't have anything in common.""
Tell her something interesting. Show her that you're a guy who reads the paper and knows what's going on in the world. Without being boring, tell her a random fact that caught your eye recently.

, This means that you should show her who you really are instead of putting up a phony front, but that you should also tone down the more unique parts of your personality until she gets to know you better, or she may be thrown off. Here's how to do it:


Don't be a poser. Don't act like you're this hot shot who gets a lot of women. Just be a cool guy who wants to get to know her. Don't talk about all the other girls in your life, or she'll think, then why is he talking to me?
Show her who you are. Tell her a bit about your interests, what you do on the weekends, or mention that awesome trip you took to Tahoe with your buddies. The girl should have a sense of who you are besides that guy who is hitting on her.
Remember that you're not with your bros. Though she can get to know you for real later, hold off on the crass jokes, or the stories that might make you come off in an unflattering light.

, Women love guys who can make them laugh, especially if they can do it without trying too hard. You should show her that you're funny and that you can keep up with her. Don't make her think you're trying so hard to make her laugh that she just feels sorry for you. Here's how to do it:


Keep up some witty banter. If she says something funny, don't just say, ""That's so funny"" and laugh without responding. Instead, fire back something equally funny to show you can keep up.
Tease her gently. Women love if you tease them if you do it the right way. Just poke fun at something she says, or tease her about her unique laugh. This will develop your relationship on a more playful level.
Make fun of yourself. Don't be self-deprecating, but show that you don't take yourself too seriously and that you're able to laugh at yourself.

, Part of making a graceful exit is knowing when you are not wanted. This could be for a variety of reasons. Maybe the girl's just not digging you. That's okay. Maybe she has a boyfriend and doesn't want to waste your time. Maybe she just wants to spend time with her girlfriends. Whatever the reason, once you get the sense it's time to leave, get going.If the conversation lags completely and the girl is checking her phone or looking around constantly, it's time to leave.
If her friends start rolling their eyes at you or ignoring you, it's time to leave.
Once you know it's time to go, don't embarrass yourself further by saying, ""Well, it looks like you're just not interested"" or ""Sorry to bother you."" Just say, ""Hey, it was great talking to you. I'll see you around later.""
Walk out with a smile on your face, even if you're disappointed.
But if she's laughing a lot, maintaining eye contact, playing with her hair, and just generally looking like she's having a great time talking to you and wants more, it's time to step it up.

, If you've really clicked during the conversation, and the girl is clearly into you, then it's time to kick it up a notch and see where this thing goes. You're trying to pick up the woman, right? So what are you waiting for?


If you're at a bar or nightclub and things are wrapping up, you can say, ""How about we go somewhere more private to talk?"" Or, ""What do you say we get out of here?""
If you know the girl wants to keep hanging out but you don't want to turn her off by trying to isolate her yet, ask her if she and her friends want to go to a quieter bar down the street, or invite her out to an after party with your friends. Remember, she just met you, and even if she likes you, she may not want to get down on the first night.
If you're not ready to ask her to come home with you, get her number. Don't be nervous. Just make it clear that you're really asking her out. Say, ""Hey, this has been a great conversation, and I'd love to talk to you more over drinks or dinner. Can I get your number to set that up?""

Go with friends.,
Choose the bar.,
Look at the people the guy is hanging out with.,
Act confident.,
Make eye contact.,
Think of an icebreaker.,
Introduce yourself.,
Watch his response.,
Have a conversation.,
Look for mirroring.,
Be clear about your intentions.",How to Pick up a Guy at a Bar," Having fun with friends can make you look more attractive and interesting. It also provides a confidence boost, and people to watch your back. Just remember that people can find it intimidating to approach a large group of friends. Be ready to break the ice yourself if you need to.;
, Different bars attract different people. There's no one right choice, but try to find a place that suits your own mood and intentions. If everyone at the bar is dancing, you'd better be willing to join in. If they're all watching sports, you'll need to be familiar with that culture.

, It's more difficult to pick up a guy if he's in a group of friends, or if he's engrossed in a conversation that's tough to interrupt. Definitely don't try to pick up someone who arrived at the bar with a girl.

, The more relaxed and confident you can be, the better impression you can make.

, If you're not sitting next to the guy, it can be difficult to start a conversation. Meet his eyes across the room instead. If you want to turn up the sexiness, put on a half smile, tilt your head to one side, and check him out slowly.


If you're not sure whether the guy's in to you, take it slow. Make eye contact occasionally over the course of 10 to 15 minutes. If he's still meeting your eyes, go for it.

, Before you talk to the guy, think of something to say. A specific compliment is a great way to go. Tell him why you set your eyes on him instead of the other guys at the bar. Just take care not to come on too strong — at first, you're just trying to set up an introduction.


If you're extra shy, ask the guy to take a picture of you and your friends.
Avoid cheesy pickup lines.

, He seems interested, no one's hanging onto his arm, and it's time to make your move. A sincere introduction is often the best way to go. If he didn't approach you when you caught his eye, walk over to his end of the bar, tell him your name, and say ""I just thought we should meet,"" ""Do you want to dance?"" or ""Do you mind if I sit down?"" The subtext is obvious.


If you don't want to be too obvious about it, wait until he stands up and ""bump into him.""
""Want to buy me a drink?"" isn't a bad opener, but showing up with your own drink makes it more obvious that you're interested in him, rather than just trying to save a few dollars. You can even offer to buy him a drink if he doesn't have one.

, A lot of people will automatically respond with pleasantries or agreeable statements. If the guy's really into you, he'll continue to make eye contact, and make effort to drive the conversation forward. If he seems distracted or uninterested, politely excuse yourself. He may not be looking for the same thing you are.

, Act natural and enjoy a friendly conversation with the guy. Flirting is great, but even just laughing and smiling goes a long way toward forming a connection. If you overheard what he and his friends were talking about — and it's a topic that genuinely captures your interest — add your own opinion or make a joke about it.


If you don't know what to say, ask for more details about him or about what he just said. People enjoy talking about themselves.

, You probably already ""mirror"" people you're interested in subconsciously. This means you subtly copy his stance, mannerisms, and actions. Don't try to do this intentionally (which can come across as a bit creepy), but do look for signs that he's doing it to you. Mirroring is a definite sign of interest.

, Do you want a one night stand or a date? Are you looking for his phone number, or just a flirty conversation? Most of this gets communicated over the course of a conversation, but sometimes you need to be forthright. If he doesn't pick up on your hints, just tell him ""Come back to my place"" or ""What's your phone number?"" Either he'll accept, or he's not looking for the same thing you are anyway.

Understand the travel romance dynamic.,
Be upfront.,
Be quick.,
Be faithful.",How to Pick Up a Girl5," Maybe you're in town for a family reunion and you just aren't feeling it, so you've found yourself at a diner drinking coffee next to a cute girl. Maybe you're on a trip across the country by bus before you settle down, just to see what's out there. Picking up a girl while you're traveling is fine, as long as you remember to keep it light, be straightforward, and live in the moment. Approaching it like a normal pick up will only frustrate both of you.

, If you feel as though you have to lie or omit information to pick up a girl, you're wrong. It won't do either of you any good to pretend. Besides, some women find the idea of a date with someone who's “just passing through” intriguing or exciting, because there are likely to be no strings attached. You won't know until you make it clear that you're in that situation.


Traveling also makes for an interesting topic of conversation, so you probably won't have to try very hard to find things to talk about. Just mention that you're just visiting for a few days, and ask a question about the local area. Most girls will be happy to answer with their opinion on it, and just like that the conversation will be rolling along.

, You don't have time to be shy or demure. You want a date, a night out with someone you've just met and are unlikely to see again. The girl won't know you feel that way if you just try to “warm up” to her all night. Instead of getting her number, suggest that she come on a date with you now, before you're gone. Ask her for ideas on where to go, and offer to pay the tab (as usual). The key to picking up a girl for a short-term fling is to show her what you want (a fun night out together) and go for it right away.

, If you have someone waiting for you at home, don't pursue anyone else while you're away. It's cowardly and unfair, and it will weigh heavily on your conscience long after the fact. Imagine how you would feel if you knew that your girlfriend had a hot weekend with some random townie from five states away at her last family reunion, while you were sitting alone and missing her company the whole time. No momentary impulse or minor crush is worth jeopardizing the relationship you already have.


If you believe you're ready to end that relationship, do the right thing and end it first. Don't sneak around behind your girlfriend's back like some kind of spineless weasel. Once you're officially single, you'll have plenty of chances to fool around with other girls.

"
"
Gather a task squad (this can be just you and a friend or you and a group of friends).,
Prepare.,
Go somewhere where people gather to talk, whether it's a pub or a comic convention!,
Get out and talk to people.,
Just repeat the above, never try to push further from your end, but always respond, if they ask a question, or follow their answer to your question with a question, then respond.,
We now need to up the ante a bit - Take the conversation to the next level - you should now be proficient in the meet & greet stage of obtaining a date, if not repeat the above until you are.

,
So, you have said hello, asked if they are having a good night, you have pre-qualified the person, you like the way they look and they seem approachable.,
From here your natural conversation skills can kick in, conversation is as simple ABC.,
Once you find yourself in the flow of conversation, you need to add assertion to your game: ""It has been great talking, can I have your phone number/Blackberry pin/email address?"",
So by now you should be sat at home after your night out, with updated contact information on your phone or a scribble on a piece of paper - you are probably asking ""when should I contact them?"",
If you met on a Friday night, a casual text message on the Sunday afternoon would be appropriate ""Hi, its insert name from the Pub, nice meeting you on Friday, I hope you had a good evening."",
You need to spend the next 5 - 10 text messages reigniting that initial spark - refresh their memory as to why they were speaking to you in the first place.

,
Now you need to pop the question, no not marriage, you need to propose a meet-up.,
Date prep should be the same as before, groomed, clean teeth, look fresh, feel fresh.,
So you are here, you have achieved what not so long ago seemed the impossible.,
The kiss?",How to Meet People to Date," They need to play no part, it's best to be around people you enjoy being with as this will help you feel at ease.;
, Clothes, hair, aftershave, teeth - nothing over the top, dress appropriately, comfortable a must! 4 sprays of aftershave - behind each ear and on each shoulder. Nothing extreme, no bright colors, relaxed approach (unless you are heading somewhere which requires this).

, People go to these places knowing there are going to be other people there. They are prepared to TALK.

, You are not trying to pull tonight, you are still in training. With a pub as a scenario, don't hang outside the toilets waiting for your prey! Instead - go solo at the bar (this may sound scary, but this way no pressure, your friends can sometimes be off putting). When ordering drinks, look around casually, if you make eye contact with someone - SMILE but then turn away, remember these are skill building techniques. Spot someone of interest next to you - say hi, if you are given a positive response then follow with ""having a good evening?"" again, if their reaction is positive then ""Okay cool, catch you later"".

, This will happen naturally, we as humans are designed for conversation, it's a natural occurrence regardless of our physical appearance.

,, Now all you have to do is simply add to the conversation: (Ex. ""so, are you going to a bar or club after here?"" or ""Let me get this drink for you"")

, The thing you have to remember at this stage is, if its not going too well then there is a compatibility issue, when you find the right person, you WILL click.

,

, The answer is variable - you need to strike a balance between "" I'm not a stalker & hard to get"" Basically not to soon and not too late. My recommendation is as follows:

, DO NOT ask for a date right now

,, If you are a guy asking a girl, remember this can be delicate - I would recommend the initial meeting place to be the same venue as when you first met - the reason for this is it's a familiar place to your date and will help to make them feel at ease.

, Pre date nerves - don't worry, they will feel exactly the same!

, Remember you have one the hard part, this is now easy, you have clicked already, you have spoken, now you use this time to get to know each other. Make sure you show interest in your date, combine talking about yourself to asking questions about them and it should work both ways.

, That's down to you and your date how quickly you'd like to progress things. Just go with the flow, the combination of two people is a natural occurrence and the first kiss is included, you will both know when the time is right.

If you are at a local hangout, ask the girl if she took the day off of work to come to the beach.,
If you are at a touristy beach, first ask the girl if she’s a local or on vacation.,
Consider trying the classic “Do you come here often?” Try to mix it up a bit and try: “This is my favorite beach, what do you think of it?” Or you could ask her what other beaches she likes, or has been to, etc.

,
Keep the conversation focused on the girl.",How to Meet a Girl at the Beach," You’re goal is to look attractive and approachable, but not like you’ve spent all day primping and preening for the beach. Comb your hair, but don’t over-style it and choose beach attire that is flattering and comfortable.


If you feel confident heading out in nothing but your swimsuit, more power to you, but there’s nothing wrong with wearing a t-shirt or polo short and a pair of shorts.
Don’t forget to apply sunscreen, especially if you’re pale. The lobster look might get you some concerned glances, but not a lot of phone numbers;
, It’s best to have some ideas in mind for how you might approach women before you head out to the beach. Spend some time thinking about things you might say, and things you could do to attract a girl’s notice.

, Some of the best beach gambits work best with friends. But others work better if you go it alone. Think about what kind of approach you might want to try, and then choose your beach buddies wisely. You want to look like you are having a good time, so bring friends that you enjoy hanging out with. And make sure your friends understand beforehand that you are likely to ditch them for a while, or even the rest of the day if you meet the right girl., You will want to bring the usual beach stuff, including sunscreen, a towel or blanket, and a cooler with some water bottles. Also bring along some beach toys, including some things that you might not consider standard beach gear for an adult. Consider items like a Frisbee, a football, and a bucket and a pail for building sand castles. You’re not likely to meet anyone while you’re lying around on a towel. You need an excuse to be up and moving around, and toys will make you look like a fun, approachable guy!, Dogs are great for meeting women, and the beach is the perfect place to show off your pooch and what a great pet owner you are. Bring a ball and play fetch with your dog on the sand for all to see. Then leisurely walk Fido around on his leash. Assuming your dog is well-behaved and cute, you will likely have girls coming up to meet him, and by extension, you.


Be aware that some beaches do not allow dogs. Check the local rules before you go.
Make sure to be prepared to clean up after your dog. An irresponsible dog owner won’t score any points with the ladies.
Studies have shown that some breeds of dogs are better for picking up women than others: poodles, chihuahuas, golden retrievers and labs all rank highly on the list of most attractive pooches. , Find a place to lay out your towel and spend some time looking around, enjoying the sun. Scan the area for attractive girls, but do so in a friendly, non-leering manner. If you catch a girl’s eye, nod and smile or say hello, and then go back to looking around. Make sure to look over again in a few minutes to see if she is checking you out.

, Strutting up and down the beach or posing on your towel might get you looked at, but isn’t likely to score you a date. Girls will find you more attractive to you if they see you out playing and having a good time. Get up a game of catch with your friends. Go for a swim. Fly a kite. Start building a sandcastle. If you run into a girl during any of these activities, take the opportunity to strike up a conversation.

, Get up a game of Frisbee or catch with your buddies, or begin building a sandcastle. If you see a girl watching you, give her a smile and wave her over to join you. If she smiles back, but doesn’t come over right away, jog over and ask her if she’d like to play.


Sometimes a girl will act shy and say “no,” or “I don’t know” but in a coy way that suggests she’d really like to play. If this seems like the case (smiling and giggling are good indicators) give her some encouragement. “Oh, come on, you’ll be brilliant!” or “I’ll bet you throw a great spiral” would both work well.
If she says “no” and does not look amused or inviting, take the hint and let her be. You won’t receive any positive attention by being pushy or aggressive.

, Another way to get a girl’s attention while playing is to accidentally overthrow a ball, or miss a catch so that your ball or Frisbee lands near the girl and you have to approach her to retrieve it. Use this as an excuse to say hi and start a conversation. (You might start with, “Sorry about that, the sun was in my eyes.” Or “My friend can’t throw to save his life . . . “)


Try to make sure your ball doesn’t land right on the girl or knock over her stuff. There is a fine line between endearingly clumsy and just plain irritating.
Crashing a kite near a girl can also be a good ice-breaker, but make sure that you are actually in control of the kite, and don’t hit her.

, Bring a cooler full of ice-cold water bottles with you to the beach. If you see a girl you are interested in, you can walk up to her and say “Hi, I noticed you looked hot and I’ve got some extra waters here. Would you like one?” If she says yes, give her one, and then extend your hand for a handshake and tell her your name and go from there. (“Hi, I’m Brad, what’s your name?”)

, This is a popular gambit for meeting girls at the beach, but it requires ditching your buddies and going it alone. After you’ve spotted a girl you are interested in, gather up your stuff and ask her if she’d mind watching it for a few minutes while you take a quick swim or surf. (""Hi, I was hoping to take a quick swim, and was wondering if you'd be willing to look after my stuff."") If she agrees, thank her, and consider saying something funny like “Be careful, I've heard there are some vicious sunscreen thieves on the loose today.”


Do go out and swim or surf for a good 20 minutes before returning.
When you get back, thank her and playfully ask her if she had any trouble, or had to fight off any sunscreen thieves. Be sure to tell her how much you appreciate her help, and take the opportunity to begin a longer conversation.If things are going well, ask for her number. Better yet, ask her what she’s doing later tonight. If she doesn’t have plans, make arrangements to meet up with her in a few hours.

, There is an age old cliché that the best way to meet a girl at the beach is to walk up and offer to rub sunblock on her back. 99 times out of 100, this is going to come across as creepy or sleazy, and get you shunned or even slapped! If you see a girl nearby who is applying sunscreen, you can Try to make eye contact and give her the opportunity to ask you for help, but don’t ogle, and don’t approach her unless you get some indication (a smile, a wave, an actual request: “can you help me?”) that she wants you to come over.


Also avoid the “can I adjust your bathing suit?” gambit. This is an approach advocated on several online dating sites that is almost guaranteed to fail spectacularly. Remember that touching a girl who does not wish to be touched is sexual harassment! Don’t touch a girl or her swimsuit without her express verbal permission.

, A bit of planning ahead can make your attempts to start a conversation a lot more successful. Are you at a beach where most of the people there are locals? Or are you at a touristy beach where most people come from out of town? Do you know of any fun events happening later in the evening that you could invite a girl you meet to? Do you know of a great local restaurant or secret surf spot you could entice a girl to visit with you?


Check local movie listings and event calendars to get ideas for an evening activity.
Keep an ear out for upcoming parties that you might invite a girl to attend.

, Whether you’ve managed to catch a girl’s eye on the next towel over, or have bravely walked up to her as she plays in the surf, at some point you will need to begin a conversation with the girl. The best bet at the beach is to keep the conversation light and centered on the girl. Begin by asking her if she’s having a good day so far. (Hopefully she’ll say yes; if not, ask her what’s wrong.) Then tailor your approach to the kind of beach you are at.

, The answer will hopefully open up a chance to ask her about her work. Ask her if she likes her job, or if her boss is good about giving her days off. Listen for clues about the things she expresses interest in, and ask lots of follow-up questions.


If it turns out she is a student, ask her about her studies and what she likes best about them, etc.

, If she is from out of town, ask her how long she has been in town and what she thinks of it so far. Then ask her how long she is staying, and if there are places she’s still hoping to see. If she seems receptive to your conversation (look for smiling, laughing, and other signs of flirting), offer to show her around one evening, or take her to a favorite local spot.

,, This is the number one rule no matter what you are talking about. Ask her what she likes, what her interests are, etc. Remain mysterious about yourself, unless she asks you a direct question, and act enthusiastic and interested about whatever she has to say."

Make sure that you like this guy.,
Find out what he expects from you.,
Say yes.,
Get the details.",How to Give a Guy an Answer when He Asks You Out1," Ask yourself whether you are really interested in this guy, or if you're just flattered that he took an interest in you. If you touch base with your feelings and find that you're a wholehearted ""Yes!!"" on this guy, then feel free to accept his offer. If you're lukewarm about him, but you feel bad saying no, consider whether it will be easier to reject him now or later.;
, Some guys will ask you out on a first date to a park, a dance, or the movies just to spend time with you and get to know you better. Especially if you're in elementary school, middle school, or high school, guys might ask you to be their girlfriend without arranging a ""date"". This could mean that he wants to eat lunch together, or walk home together, or hold hands, or more. Some guys might just ask you to be their date to a dance or another event.


Don't be afraid to ask him what he means. If you like him, but he isn't clear about what he wants from you, it is completely your place to inquire further. If he says something as vague as, ""Will you go out with me?"", you can say, ""Sure! What did you have in mind?""
If it's a group event, make sure that he is inviting you explicitly as his ""date"". If he invites you along with him and his friends, it probably means that he likes you, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he's asking you to be his girlfriend yet. It might be a way for him to get to know you better, or to gauge whether you like him back before he makes a big move.

, Your exact response depends on his question. Think about what exactly he is asking you to do, and accept his request if you feel comfortable with it.


If he asks you to a specific event, all you need to do is agree to go. If he asks you to a dance, for instance, just smile and say, ""Yes, I'd love to.""

, If the guy asks you out on a first date, make sure that you get the time and place. Figure out whether he is going to pick you up, or whether he plans to meet you there. Find out if it's a group event or just the two of you. Make sure that you're available on that day, at that time, and that you don't have any prior plans.


You don't need to get the details before you say yes. The point isn't the event – it's that this guy wants to spend time with you. If you want to spend time with him, simply agree to go to the event, and work out the details later.
Don't be afraid to reschedule if you have a conflict. If you really want to show him that you're interested, offer an alternative. Say, ""I'd love to go to the movie with you, but I'm going to a friend's birthday party on Friday night. Could we go on Saturday instead?""

Explain your reasons for saying no.,
Be clear and straightforward.,
Be quick about it.",How to Give a Guy an Answer when He Asks You Out2," Be honest. You don't need to over-justify your decision; it is enough if you simply aren't attracted to this guy. You may be attracted to the guy, but you can't accept his offer for some reason – maybe your friend likes him, or your parents won't let you date, or you don't feel that you're ready for a relationship. No matter the situation, it's important that you are honest with this guy and with yourself.


If you aren't attracted to the guy, that's all you need to say. Don't be mean about it, and don't insult him. Say, ""I like our friendship, but I'm not attracted to you in that way.""
If your friend likes him, do not spill the secret – unless your friend says that it's okay. Just tell the guy that you aren't interested, and don't hint that there is any other reason behind your choice.
If your parents won't let you date, feel free to be honest with the guy. Be careful, however, about leading him on or giving him hope. If you tell him that you have a huge crush on him, but that you can't date him, you may not stop his advances.
If you don't feel that you're ready for a relationship, that's okay. You will find someone in your own time, and it will be so much better if your entire heart is in it. This guy might be the first one to ask you out, but he won't be the last.

, Don't make excuses, and don't agree to go on a date just to be nice. No doubt, he'd prefer a ""yes"" over a ""no"" – but odds are that he'd rather deal with an immediate rejection than force you to go on a pity-date.

, Say something simple like, ""I'm sorry, but I don't like you in that way."" You don't need to explain in great detail why you aren't interested; you just need to get the main idea across. Try not to humiliate him with a long, drawn-out speech.


If he asks for specific reasons, feel free to explain why you aren't interested. Make sure that you don't let it become a debate, and don't let him talk you into going out with him. Be firm and clear. Do not compromise.
If you are friends with the guy, you can cite this as a reason. Say, ""I love our friendship, but I'm not romantically attracted to you. Can we keep our friendship how it is?""

Tell him that you need to think about it, but that you'll give him a definite answer in the next few days. Try not to keep him guessing for too long – if he really likes you, he'll be anxiously awaiting your reply.


Make sure that you give him some sort of answer, even if you just explain why you can't give him a more definite answer yet. It takes courage to ask out someone that you really like, and the least you can do is acknowledge that you're thinking about it. This is especially important if he asks you out via text, email, or instant messaging: if you don't reply, he will have nothing to do but speculate!

, Make sure to only ask people that you trust. Describe the situation, explain why you aren't sure, and weigh out the pros and cons of saying yes or no. Remember: you don't need to take anyone's advice, but it might help you better understand your own feelings. If you don't feel comfortable asking anyone, make a list of the pros and cons and try to decide on your own.

, Try to make your response as close as possible to ""yes"" or ""no"", especially if it's conditional. Once you've thought through your choice, get the guy one-on-one and tell him what you've decided. If you can't get him alone face-to-face, send him a text or an instant message.


You don't need to explain your thought process, especially if had major qualms about going out with this guy. If you're comfortable doing so, however, it might help the guy understand why you took so long to answer him.

, There's no rush. You don't need to date him right this instant; if he respects you, he'll be patient and wait until you feel comfortable.


Tell him, ""I like you, but I want to get to know you better before I commit to a relationship. Let's hang out as friends and see what happens.""
If you want to say yes, but are not ready to have a relationship yet, you could say ""I want to date you. I want to hold your hand. I want to kiss you, but I don't think I'm ready for a relationship yet."" Give him a small peck on the cheek to show you mean it.

Make plans to meet again.",How to Meet a Nice Girl in a Bistro," There are probably dozens of bistro locations you can choose from so do your homework. Go to a couple to see what the vibe is like. Perhaps you are a more casual person and want a laid back atmosphere. Check out the crowd to see how they match your expectations or personal style.;
, Based on your research, determine which one fits your style the best. You’ll know it when you find it because you will feel very comfortable and relaxed.Be sure the one you pick isn’t too crowded or too loud. If you’re really interested in meeting someone, you will want to be able to have a conversation without having to yell or being pushed around by hundreds of people.

, Up your odds of meeting a nice girl by going to your chosen spot at the right time. Most don’t venture to a bistro at 8 a.m. so be strategic. Pick a time that will offer the best chances of meeting a girl.


Consider going right after school or work. The person you want to meet will likely have a similar schedule as you do.

, Head to the restroom to make sure you look presentable. You want to make an excellent first impression, right? Check your clothes, your teeth and don’t forget your breath.


Pop a piece of gum or a mint so you’re extra fresh.

, Perhaps while you’re heading back from the restroom, come up with a few options and go over them in your head. While the conversation shouldn’t sound rehearsed, running over it a few times will keep you from sounding too nervous.Once you’ve spotted a girl you’re interested in, note something special about her. Perhaps she’s flipping through a magazine or ordered the same thing you did. You can use this as a conversation starter.

, Before heading over, try to catch her eye to let her know she’s caught yours. This will help break the ice before you make your move and walk over.


Be sure to smile to show her you’re a friendly guy.

, Put a big smile on your face and walk over with confidence. Start the conversation with a warm hello and tell her your name. Try to avoid using any cheesy pick-up lines. She will probably see right through it and you may come across as disingenuous.


Shake her hand too as a friendly gesture. Not only will she think you’re a real gentleman, touching someone is a subtle way to flirt., If she’s sitting alone or even with a friend, ask if you can hang with them for a bit. Don’t just assume she’s in the mood for company or a chit chat. Your politeness will work in your favor.

, Keep the subjects light, casual and fun. This should be a lighthearted exchange about very general topics. Consider, for example, asking her where she grew up, what school she attended, what type of music she listens to or where she's traveled to recently. Try to let her do most of the talking so you can really get to know her.If you are still stuck for conversation starters, consider that you clearly like the same types of places so ask if she’s been there before or what her other favorite spots are around town.

, Let her know that you really like her eyes, her smile or her hair. Keep in mind that you don’t have to compliment a physical attribute. Think about pointing out how great her sense of humor is or how smart she seems to be.


It would be easy to overdo this but don’t. One compliment will do. Keep it short and sweet. Just enough to let her know you find her attractive., This is your first interaction so it’s completely acceptable if it only lasts a few minutes. Don’t feel obligated to camp out for hours on end.


Look for signs to see if she’s interested. Things to look for include: smiling, touching her hair, making direct eye contact, asking follow-up questions or touching your arm.If she’s not interested, she may have her arms crossed or be giving one word answers.

, Before leaving, ask if she might be interested in seeing you again. If you’ve been paying attention to her signals, you will know the answer to this question before even asking.


Instead of getting her number, consider giving her yours.

Be yourself.,
Improve your self esteem.,
Look for a guy that you can talk to.,
Search for someone that you have classes with.,
Date him first.,
Manage you time.,
To what extent is it worth having a boyfriend in IB?,
Listen to your friends.,
Remember, there are also boys who like smart and determined girlfriends.",How to Have a Boyfriend in International Baccalaureate," Don't try to be someone you aren't just to get a boyfriend. It's not worth it cause then you are pretending and its not real. And if a guy likes you than he won't care if you are a nerd or not the hottest girl.;
, This means that you shouldn't think you are ugly or obese. Every girl is beautiful in her own way. Some suggestions are that if you don't like your hair then change it or get clothes that improve your self esteem. You may also want to wear make up if this makes you feel more beautiful.

, How are you going to date a guy that you have nothing in common with? Just because a guy is hot doesn't mean he is going to be fun to be with or talk to. In other words, find a guy that is like you in a way.

, If you really want a boyfriend then you need to do this. Think about it, are you really going to have time to hang out with him after school with all that homework? Maybe only weekends in that case. But if you want someone you can see everyday then you should see who is in your classes.

, If you don't date him then how are you going to know if he is someone you want to be with? Plus, when dating, you shouldn't just date one guy. You need to meet a lot of people before going steady with someone. So find a lot of potential boyfriends.

, You do not want to fall behind in school for a guy. You went in IB for a specific reason or dream you have, so keep that in mind. That is why in step #4 i said that you should find a guy that is in your classes. And do not spend too much time talking to your boyfriend while you have 4 hours of homework a night. Make a schedule on when you can hang out with him or talk to him. School should always come first in your plans because you really do not want to fall behind in your classes.

, You should consider asking yourself this question and determine whether or not you should have one. There are many effects from having a boyfriend and not all of the are positive. It is also important to know that it is not worth having a boyfriend in ib if you might fall behind or may become distracted.

, If you think you are in love, well love blinds. Your friends may be able to see things you don't know. Usually your friends want what is best for you so remember and keep that in mind that you shouldn't give up your friends for a boyfriend either.

, This means they won't go out with you unless you receive all sevens on your IB tests. Full diploma students only!

See how he acts around other women.,
See if being flirty is just part of his job.,
See if he breaks the touch barrier.,
See if he laughs at your jokes.,

See if he fusses with his hair when he's with you.,
See if he preens around you.,
See if he talks to you with an open face.,
See if he speaks in a low-pitched voice.,
See if he confides in you.",How to Know a Guy Is Flirting," If he's just acting flirtatious towards you, it probably means there's something he likes about you in particular. However, if he's flirty with all of the ladies, then he may just be a flirtatious person who is naturally charming and charismatic. The next time you're hanging out with him and there are other women around, observe the way he talks to them and treats them. If this is exactly the same way that he talks to you, then he may not be truly flirting with you.;
, If he's on the job and is a waiter or bartender, for example, then part of his job may just have to do with being flirtatious with the ladies. Don't put too much stock into how he treats you on the job and see how he feels about you when he's off the clock. This will give you a better indication of how he really feels about you. On the other hand, if he's in a more professional setting with you, he may not flirt with you on the job even if he likes you because he doesn't want to get in trouble or doesn't feel comfortable flirting during work hours.

, If the guy likes you, then he'll look for any old excuse to touch you because he'll want to get closer to you. He may even linger his hand near yours when passing you a pencil or he may brush up against you, put his hand on the small of your back, or just sit extra close to you so your knees or feet touch. If he seems to always be looking for excuses to touch you, then he probably is flirting with you.

, Sure, you may be a comedian, but chances are that he thinks you're even funnier than you know you are, if he's flirting with you. If he likes you, then he'll laugh at anything you say, even if you're not trying to be funny. If you find him laughing way too loud when you make jokes, or even nervously laughing when you're talking about what you ate for lunch, then this may be his way of flirting with you. He's probably just laughing because he's excited to be around you.

, If the guy is flirting with you, then he's really just looking for more opportunities to spend time with you. If he's always asking to borrow your books, your movies, or your notes for class, then chances are that he's really just looking for more excuses to talk to you and to have some of your stuff around so he can think about you even more. This may also have to do with him acting like he shares all of your interests so he can get you to like him!

, Though some guys are just born gentlemen, if the guy likes you, then he'll want to open doors for you, pull out chairs for you, and offer you his coat if you're cold. If you're walking down the street, he may walk on the side of the street to ""protect"" you from traffic. Watch him around other girls; if he's only particularly gentlemanly to you, then he may definitely be flirting.

, Teasing is one of the biggest ways that a man can flirt with you. If he makes fun of you lightly for your clothes, for how you walk, how you laugh, or for any of the other things about you that he actually just thinks are really adorable, then he's definitely flirting with you. If you always feel like the guy is giving you a hard time and pointing out your ""faults,"" then it's really just that he's flirting with you because he's paying attention to all of the little things you do.

, It's great if you and the guy have the exact same taste in music, books, movies, or food, but chances are that your tastes do have to diverge somewhat. If he gets a little bit too excited and nods eagerly when you mention your favorite new movie or band, then it may be because he's just trying to flirt and form a common bond with you so you like him more. Don't count this against him; these harmless lies are just his way to win the key to your heart.

, He may give you a brand new pen because you never have one in class. He may give you Chapstick because you always have chapped lips. While this isn't the same as giving you a giant bouquet of flowers, this is the guy's way of flirting with you and of showing you that he pays attention to who you are and what you need. He's being thoughtful and doesn't want to scare you off with a grander gift if he's not sure that you really like him.

, This is a classic way for a guy to flirt with you and to let you know he's interested. If the guy always makes nasty or just mean and funny comments about any other guys you know or hang out with, then chances are it's because he's just jealous that you're paying attention to someone else who isn't him. If he says something like, ""What do you see in that guy, anyway?"" then he's definitely flirting with you.

, If he even calls other guys your boyfriend or teases you about having a hot date, then he's definitely flirting with you. He's playing around with the idea that you have a boyfriend or that you're seeing someone else because he wants to be the one that you're dating. This is his subtle (or not-so-subtle) way of letting you know that he wants to be the one you have a hot date with.

, If the guy blushes while you're talking, then this is definitely a sign that he likes you and that he's flirting with you. Check out his face the next time he says something to you, and if he turns bright red for no reason, or if he just turns red after saying something slightly personal to you, then it's definitely a sign that he likes you and is just flirting.

, He may not say, ""You are so totally hot,"" but he may compliment you in other ways that give away the fact that he's flirting with you. If he compliments your eyes, the color of your hair, your laugh, or an admirable aspect of your personality, then he's definitely flirting with you. He may even tease you a bit while flirting with you, like if he says something like, ""That's the brightest sweater I have ever seen,"" but he's still flirting with you. Most guys aren't comfortable with just casually complimenting a girl they like, so they may throw in some ambiguity or an insult for good measure.

, If the guy is flirting with you, then he'll lock eyes with you when he's talking to you. If he likes you, he'll be too distracted to look somewhere else, to check his phone, or to search around for his friends. His gaze may even linger on yours for a while, and then he may get nervous and break eye contact, even maybe with a little smile. He can also flirt with you by making eye contact from across the room, too. If you catch him staring at you, that can be his way of flirting, too.

, It's all in the body language. If he turns his shoulders, arms, and feet toward you when you're talking instead of turning his body away from yours, then he's keeping an open posture and flirting with you for sure. Check to see that his arms are at his sides instead of crossed over his chest, and that he's really turning his body toward yours. He'll be doing this because he likes you and wants to get even closer to you; he may even lean in close toward you from time to time.

, This is another key sign that he's really flirting with you. If he likes you, then he'll be worried about how he looks and how you perceive him, and one thing guys obsess over the most is their own hair. Check to see how many times he puts his hand in his hair or how many times he runs his hands around the back of his head the next time you're together. He may also just be playing with his hair because he's nervous around you, which is another sign that he likes you and is flirting.

, If the guy likes you, then he'll want to look his best around you. This means that he'll try to straighten any wrinkles in his clothes, pick off any crumbs from his pants, or just generally try to look his best around you. He wants you to see him at his best, so he'll do what he can to make his body look as appealing as possible. The next time you're around him, see if he takes care with his appearance, which can be a major sign of flirting.

, If the guy likes you, then his eyebrows will be slightly raised, his nostrils will be flared a bit, and his lips will be slightly parted. It's biological. If he likes you, then his face will be on the alert, and you'll be able to see if he's flirting with you just by reading his face. Don't stare at his nostrils or eyebrows too much, though, or he may get a bit freaked out.

, If a guy likes you, then he will lower his voice slightly as a sign that he's interested. The next time you talk to him, see if he lowers his voice a bit from what his voice usually sounds like when he talks to friends, teachers, or other girls. This may be a sign that he really likes you and that he's flirting with you.

, If the guy confides some personal information to you, then he's definitely flirting with you. If he tells you something personal about his family, his pets, his friends, or his relationship with his parents, then he's definitely flirting with you. His way of flirting with you is to open up and to show you that he may be deeper than you think. If he tells you things that he doesn't just tell everybody and you know you're having a real personal moment together, then he is flirting with you for sure.

Read up on your company policy regarding office romance (if one exists).,
Take extra care when asking someone on a date or trying to initiate a relationship.,
Decide together how you will present your relationship at the office.,
Exercise discretion.,
Try to judge the other person’s maturity early on.,
Waste no time ending a relationship that isn’t working, but do it right.,
Take a day or two off if you’re devastated after a breakup.,
Prepare yourselves for competition.

,
Find time to be apart.,
Use your best judgment.",How to Go About Office Romance," Some companies have “anti-fraternization policies” that prohibit or discourage dating your coworkers. You can ask your HR person what is and is not acceptable if the policies seem unclear. Beyond the explicit policies, you should also think about the company culture and how accepting your employer appears to be of office romances. While policies prohibiting dating may not withstand a court challenge, you should still be prepared to face the consequences (including termination) if you follow your heart and disregard the policy.;
, The office is not a bar or singles club, so you shouldn’t try to “pick up” someone at work. If you both have feelings for each other, they’ll become obvious eventually, but make sure that the feelings are mutual before you make a move. If they're not, back off and drop the subject immediately or you may find yourself in the midst of a sexual harassment complaint. If you’re not sure how the other person feels, and you’re getting impatient, just catch your love interest on the way out of the office, or when you’re out for drinks with coworkers, and ask. Especially at this early stage, do not discuss love matters in the office or on company time.

, When you first start a relationship with a coworker, you should discuss how you will treat each other at the office. Will you occasionally flirt playfully, or will you act as though you have no relationship outside of work? By extension, consider if and how you will disclose your relationship to other employees. At the beginning, you may want to keep the relationship secret, but you’ll both need to agree on this.

, Even if you’re married or in a long-term relationship with someone, don’t flaunt your relationship at work. Public displays of affection, frequent visits to each other’s desks, and discussion of your personal lives with coworkers are to be discouraged, if only because they are a waste of company time and give other employees more information than they need to know. Leave spats at home, and be professional when in the office.

, Most of the time you can tell pretty early whether a person will be able to handle a relationship (or a breakup) maturely. Does that person talk about their previous boyfriends or girlfriends at work? Are they particularly emotional? If a person seems to have a hard time with relationships or brings his or her love life into the office, avoid the risk of a bad scene by not getting involved with that person or, if you’re already involved, by getting out of the relationship quickly.

, If you’re not happy dating someone, sooner or later you’ll break up. All too often, people let things drag on for too long, but in the end this usually causes more deeply hurt feelings than a quick, early breakup. You want to avoid a blowup at the office, and you need to be able to continue to work with you ex, so minimize the damage to your working relationship by being decisive about a breakup while also being extra tactful. If you’re going to break up with someone, try to do it after work on a Friday so that you’ll both have time to calm down over the weekend.

, It’s hard to deal with feelings of rejection, but you don’t want to jeopardize your employment by bringing your pain into the office. If you just can’t handle seeing the person right away, take a little vacation so you have time to put things in perspective.

,, In the long run, one of the biggest challenges to an office romance is that you don’t get to spend any time apart, and this challenge becomes more serious when you’re married or living together. No matter how much you love someone, you need some time apart, and work usually serves this purpose. When you work with your spouse or boyfriend / girlfriend, however, you can end up spending every waking hour with that person. If this is the case, make time on some evenings or on weekends when you can both do your own thing and get away from each other.

, Office romances can be successful or they can be disasters. Only you know what the political atmosphere of your office is, and only you know how much you care about a person. Sometimes, despite the risk, love is worth it.

Dress nicely.,
Show him your appreciation.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Chase You Again," Don't make him the center of your universe: no one wants to, or can be solely responsible for the other person's happiness. It's too much to ask of anyone, and it is ultimately a relationship-killer.Spend time cultivating your own interests and allow him the time to do the same. When you make time for yourself, you'll be surprised at how much more frequent and enjoyable your time with your boyfriend will become.;
, Don't put your social life on hold for him. Make your own plans to hang out with your friends. This will let him see you as an independent person who has a social life apart from him. Over time, he'll realize that he needs to claim some of your time if he wants to be with you.

, This is especially important if you live with your boyfriend. You need to give him the physical space to miss you a little.Take a two-week vacation somewhere you've always wanted to visit. Go home to your family for a little bit, or go and visit some friends you haven't seen in a long time.


Important tip: resist the urge to call or text him, other than a short message to let him know you arrived safely at your destination.

, Simply put, if you're doing most of the chasing, you're not giving him the opportunity or the desire to chase you.Don't take charge of your relationship. Let him come forward in his own way, and in his own time. For example, try the following:


If he texts you or leaves you a message, don't return it right away. Make him wait a little.
Let him plan your next date. Make him do the work. The date will be much more satisfying for the both of you.

, As trite as this sounds, it is effective. It doesn't mean withholding sex, although that can be part of it. In modern practice it just means that you aren't always available when he asks you on a date or to hang out together. Even if you have no plans, don't agree to see him every time he calls you.

, You don't have to forsake your comfortable sweats and old ratty t-shirt, but you should dress up nicely sometimes. Studies show that when you like what you're wearing, you radiate self-confidence, and self-confidence is very attractive.


Choose outfits that you know compliment your body and that you feel confident in wearing. When you know you look good, it will show in the way you carry yourself, and nothing is more sexy to a man than a confident woman.

, Your boyfriend enjoys giving to you, and it's his goal to make you happy. So, when he succeeds, be sure to show him. Be specific, too: men respond best to compliments tied to a certain action rather than generalities.You can say something like ""Honey, I really enjoyed our date last night. You did a great job picking out that restaurant. Thank you for a wonderful night."" Knowing that he has pleased you will swell his chest with pride in himself and love for you, the amazing woman that he's so lucky to have in his life.

Don’t rush forever.",How to Get the Right Man," The best thing anyone can do to be more attractive is to lead an interesting, fulfilling life; only deeply manipulative or insecure people want to be with someone who has no side interests, activities, friends, or hobbies. Think about your own tastes: would you rather be with a man who spends his weekends hiking, traveling, playing cello, and taking you to dance classes or one who sit in his living room playing video games and catching up on his favorite shows? Hold yourself to these same standards by spending plenty of time with your friends, pursuing your own interests, and developing new hobbies. (In fact, you may just meet some interesting men while you’re there!) Don’t drop these things the second you meet someone; make them integral to your experience. You’ll find yourself happier and more independent while you’re at it, which will help steer your dating decisions and make you more compatible with interesting men as well.


Don’t be needy. Neediness repels most romantic partners – and the ones it attracts tend to be unbalanced in a complimentary way (ex. controlling). Read How to Stop Being Needy if this is an ongoing issue for you.;
, Start by imagining the type of man you're looking for. Make a list – at the top of which should be responsible, respectful, and honest – of characteristics, quirks, and deeper-level traits that you want in a man, but be careful not to get too caught up in non-essentials (ex. brown-haired) or you may find yourself writing off some real gems. (If you find your list goes on and on, you might have some soul-searching to do.) Then, imagine where that type man would be. Would he be hanging out at a bar? Or, more likely, would you find him golfing, hiking, getting an education, or pursuing some other similar activity? Make a list of 10 places that you would want your future husband to frequent (from art galleries to bookstores, anything goes as long as you are legitimately personally interested in what happens there and would choose to go there on your own). Finally, make a point of going to those places whenever possible - as long as you continue your own, fulfilling personal life. You've probably already found that you are meeting more men just by pursuing your passions!

, Letting old wounds spill over into new relationships, whether by reliving the same power struggles over and over again or by looking at your wonderful new partner with a skeptical eye, is one of the fastest ways you can either pick the wrong guy or sabotage a budding relationship with the right one. Learn how to cope with emotional pain or, if necessary, deal emotional abuse so that you can see your new relationships for what they really are.

, Never feel that you should have to dress in a sexually provocative way to attract a man. In general, women dressed in a way that is either too sexual or too prudish have a harder time gaining traction with men they don’t know yet; a woman who dresses in an overly sexy way looks like she's trying too hard to get attention, but a woman who is dressed in an overly conservative way looks like she's suppressing her natural self. All men are a little different, of course, but if you want to dress like a lady, you will attract men who are looking for a lady.


Make a point of confidently expressing who you are, instead of seeking approval or validation through your clothing.

, The best flirting skills to use on men tend to be physical ones. This doesn't mean you should be overtly sexual. When you see a man who interests you, make eye contact and smile; studies show that smiling is the single most effective thing a woman can do to look more attractive to men.The classic look you'll see is this: a woman makes eye contact, notices the man watching her, blushes, and looks down; then she bravely draws her eyes back up and smiles again. (That description may be a bit too demure or feminine for your style, but adaptations on it hit a chord for men.) However, confidence is key, and subservience rarely is attractive to good men (unless that is your cultural norm). Keep making eye contact and smiling, but don't be creepy. If he looks shy and isn't approaching you after awhile, give him a wink; if he looks uncomfortable and avoids eye contact, pick a different target. Read How to Flirt for more advice.


Once he approaches you, lean back and relax. Now is his turn to talk to you. Have fun and joke with him: gently tease him a little – nicely, not sexually. Tell him one thing exciting in your life, but focus on asking him about his life and commenting on it positively. If you're still attracted and he makes you laugh, touch his arm. (Don't look at your hand, but notice how he reacts.) Continue to touch him at intervals. If he starts to look uncomfortable, back off with both your body language and energy level.
Realize that many men love the process of pursuing a woman. This doesn't mean you should play games with him. It does, however, mean that often men like to initiate a kiss, initiate sex, say ""I love you"" first, ask a woman on a date, ask her to be his girlfriend and ask her to be his wife. However, there are obviously some cases where men are shy and therefore don't like to make the first move. This can happen at times when you either haven't given them enough encouragement or they're simply shy. During the first meeting, after you've made a connection and closer to when you both have to leave, mentioning a restaurant you've been itching to go to, some hobbies you like, or the fact that your activities for that weekend have fallen through may help to bring the process along. Don’t be afraid of giving him your telephone number; this is a harmless gesture, not a marriage proposal.

, It can be hard to tell whether or not someone you’re interested in is exhibiting suspect behavior, especially in the early stages of a relationship when your emotions – and hopes – are running high. If you have a tendency to fall in with bad eggs, read any of the following articles that may apply. Forewarned is forearmed.

, This is where many women, unfortunately, go wrong. Yes, many men on dates are interested in sex, but if he is looking for a relationship or marriage, he is more interested in getting to know the woman and seeing if she is the type of woman he could spend his life with. This is a slow process. He watches for clingy women who make him feel uncomfortable and instead focuses on finding fulfilled, interesting women who like him as he is. He doesn't want a woman who will take any man and then seek to change him; he is looking for a woman who doesn't need a man, but likes him in particular. When a man feels like things are getting too serious too soon, before he's ready, he may run out the door out of fear of committing to someone he isn't sure about yet. (In that sense, men are almost more serious about the dating process than women, and slower to commit because they are very selective.)


Do not over-share. Whether dealing with a man or a woman, a close friend or a stranger, someone on Facebook or in person, nobody wants to hear every detail of every event in someone else’s life. Talking your date’s ear off about hobbies, interests, gossip, or personal problems will send him running.

, As the relationship buds, ask him what he wants out of life. How does he plan on accomplishing those goals? What is he going to do to accomplish those goals? Do his goals fit with your goals? Similarity in values, backgrounds, and goals are a good predictor of success. Don’t overlook large discrepancies in interest (such as whether or not to have children) in the hope that one of you will feel differently later; this is a very unstable, unrealistic beginning to what could be a long-term disappointment.


College education is also a very strong predictor of success. Among educated people who wait until after college to marry, divorce rates are well below the national average of about 50%. Don’t put off your own education – or let your partner put off his – in order to rush into a long-term relationship.

, It’s not always easy to know what a relationship is supposed to be and feel like, especially if have been hurt before; having one awful relationship can completely throw off your sense of balance and self-trust, making you second-guess your every move for years to follow. Read How to Have a Healthy Relationship for more details.


Understand that is impossible to have a healthy relationship without a disagreement now and then. However, a lot of promising research that has emerged from the Gottman and other institutions is giving our society a better idea of what behavior leads to healthy marriages. Surprisingly, the number of arguments a couple has is not the issue at hand. In fact, it was found that all couples have some unresolved issues, but successful couples are comfortably able to live with these issues. Suppressing emotions and pretending there is no problem causes some of the highest rates of divorce. Contempt, eye rolling, discounting the other person's opinion, and showing disrespect are also extremely predictive of marriage failure. Men are especially sensitive to criticism, and criticism and harshness towards men is a high predictor of divorce. Living together has been shown to have no relationship to eventual marital success (and may even have a negative effect).
""Flooding"" a man with emotions is a high predictor of divorce. Talk to friends first, organize your thoughts, and focus on simply expressing your feelings instead of judgments. Instead of ""You always..."" say, ""I felt sad or hurt or angry...""
Loss of love and affection is an even more important determinant of divorce than conflict. According to one article covering Gottman's work, ""Those who remained happily married were very ""in love"" and affectionate as newlyweds. They showed less ambivalence, expressed negative feelings less often and viewed their mate more positively than other couples. Most important, these feelings remained stable over time."" Never treat your partner like a child: don't talk down to him, don't give him unsolicited advice, don't cast judgment on him, don't give him curfews or try to control him. Agree, if anything, to disagree about the way he does things, but accept the man as he is, appreciate him for who he is, don't try to change him. If you can't resist the urge, let him go for another girl who will appreciate him for him, not for what you consider to be his ""potential"". This is why it’s important to find men similar to you by going to the right places. Get to know each other first; do not marry too soon (within eight months of first sight) for a longer lasting marriage later.

, Couples who end up being successful in love are not the ones who commit while still ""starry-eyed""; the strongest couples have settled down from the initial hormone rush to a more stable love before marriage. Women could probably learn a few things from the stereotypical man. First, it is important to have a fun period of life in order to feel personally fulfilled and not resent others in the future, particularly your spouse or children. Next, it is also important to have fun dating without worrying about making commitments before you truly know your partner, and, when pursuing serious relationships, by ejecting men who are unsuitable so you can meet more suitable candidates. Being overly picky is not ideal, but never tolerate disrespect. The early stages of a relationship are filled with chemistry, so it is important for women to also take the time to ""screen"" men in the same way that men screen women.

Relax.",How to Make a Guy Laugh," Some girls aren't great at slaying a crowd with one-liners and well-timed anecdotes. To play up your humor, the simplest, most effective way is to just be silly. It shows you're happy, fun, and that you don't take life too seriously. Here are some ideas:


Go for physical humor. Make funny faces, pretend you're stuck in slow-motion, hop on him for a piggyback ride (if that's cool, of course), or start a well-meaning food fight.
Put on a show. Do a foreign accent or pretend you're him -- lightly mocking him as a form of flirting, of course.
React to him in silly ways. Are you snuggled up against him? Start purring like a cat! When he says, ""Oops, sorry, I drank your last soda,"" you respond with, ""THAT'S IT. I'M MOVING TO CANADA."" And then you smile and launch into how excited you are to play hockey and watch the beavers.;
, There is nothing better than someone who is truly genuine and comfortable with themselves. If you can be you, you're showing him that he can be him with nothing to worry about. The humor will come naturally when you're both happy and relaxed!


Don't worry about being funny enough for him! If you're light-hearted and enjoy having fun, he'll enjoy having fun with you. Don't worry about the impression you're making. Do what makes you happy and he'll probably want to join in.
If you're trying to be funny, it'll come across that you're trying to be funny. Be natural and let the conversation flow naturally. The humor will come!

, Sure, once in a while you get the person who can pull off being absolutely hilarious because they're so dry, cynical, sarcastic, and a little dark and twisty, but generally you want to be around those people in small doses. We live often crave being around people who are bright and cheery because it's contagious. They make us bright and cheery (and bright and cheery often means funnier), bringing out a side of us we feel confident about. He can't not love it.


When we're optimistic, everything is a bit brighter. When everything is a bit brighter, it's easier to crack jokes (and to crack a smile in return). It's easier to take a mundane situation and turn it into an opportunity to have fun. The more fun you have, the more you (and him!) will be laughing.

, Humor is subjective. What you find funny won't necessarily be the same thing even your best friend finds funny. So in order to know what tickles his funny bone, get to know him! What TV shows does he like? What comedians? What kind of humor does he use to amuse others? All of these are cues as to what gets him giggling.


The most aptly-timed joke on, say, Foucault won't be appreciated by the type of guy who prefers laughing at toilet humor. And it works the other way around, too. Does the guy you're eyeing prefer bro banter? Is he into witty non-sequiturs about current events? Can he be slayed by a play on words in Klingon? Find out!

, On the whole, women value a sense of humor more than men do. What do men want? Someone who will make them feel funny.Instead of trying to impress him, show him that he impresses you. Showing him that he has the right to laugh at his own jokes, too, because he's just so darn awesome could win him over in no time.


You don't have to laugh at every joke he makes like your world has just been altered. If he drops a dud, laugh at him, albeit playfully. Did he just try an unfunny, stereotypical, sexist, blonde joke? Oh, honey. Let him know how cute he is for trying with a fake chuckle and a forced grin.

, When we click with people, chemistry is pretty Unable to ignore. To show him that you just get him and that you appreciate his humor, feed off of it! Did he just whip out his Sean Connery impression on a dime? Keep it going with your best Alex Trebek or Pussy Galore (doesn't have to be good -- this moment is about him). If not an impression, can you drop a line from a movie or challenge him to up his game to Christopher Walken?


Establishing a banter can develop a rapport between you two, creating a bond that won't easily be broken. Whether his humor is self-deprecating or straight out of Family Guy, go with it. Show him that you appreciate how fun he is.

, When life is bleak, we're not going to laugh no matter what. To see the humorous side of things, we have to be willing. So work on helping him be happy (making someone happy is impossible -- they have to want it) by being your awesome self and gracing his presence with it.


By being positive and fun, you're really doing all you can. Be his friend (or whatever is fitting for your relationship), do little things for him, and just try to make his life easier (especially if he's been dealt a sour deck of cards). Let him see the bright side of life so the humor can start flowing.

, There are few things funnier (and mood-uplifting) than a person that can embarrass themselves and just roll with it. There are few things worse than a person that embarrasses themselves and gets all self-conscious and shameful. So when you spill that soda on yourself, just say that you're saving it for later and that brown looks better on you than white, anyway. Also, it's like two-for-one perfume. You're just being frugal!


Studies actually show that embarrassing yourself can actually get people to like you and trust you more. It sort of makes sense -- when you show you're down-to-earth, light-hearted, and just a plain human like they are, it takes away any possible intimidation and stress., Slapstick, physical comedy is the only kind of comedy that's been around for all of human history -- and it still is for a reason. If the witty asides don't come to you naturally, don't stress! You can convince him you're the funniest thing since Tina Fey by just using your non-verbal hilarity.


Popcorn? Uh, yes, please! It's time for a who's-got-better-aim contest. And spaghetti? It's totally Lady & the Tramp time.
Standing in line for your favorite movie? Bored so incredibly that you're practically gnawing off your arm for something to do? Why would you not bust out the macarena?

As long as he's the type that doesn't embarrass easily, that is.


Try play-fighting, tickling or play-attacking him. The bond of human touch is strong as steel. Is it time for a thumb war rematch yet?
Laugh yourself. You don't need a good reason! Laughing is a chain reaction that often causes other people to laugh. And it will make you happier, too!

, If you're visibly high strung or stressed, no situation you're in will be happy-go-lucky and funny. You know that one person that's always a negative Nancy? Don't be the party pooper! Relax. It's the only way to be yourself, be silly, and create an environment where the laughter will naturally flow. If you're relaxed and enjoy each others' company, the laughter will spontaneously start itself!


If he's not laughing at your jokes, it's fine. You think you're funny and that's all that matters. If he sees you in your element, being natural, there's nothing to not like. So take a breath -- you got this.

Don't be a completely open book.,
Be patient.",How to Learn the Art of Seduction," Neediness and seduction are mutually exclusive. The more desperate you are, the less attracted they will be. The very last thing you want to do is make the person feel pressured. If you want to seduce someone who's quite independent, you may also benefit from learning how to tame a free spirit.


Even if you feel neediness coming on, don't give in. Think of it this way: Your needs will be met at some point down the line, but maybe not now. Delayed gratification.
Get a devil-may-care attitude when you're seducing that special someone. Be, within reason, a little bit reckless: Do something a little risque or unexpected to keep them guessing. Maybe go out to the beach in the middle of the night. Maybe go on an unannounced trip for a couple of days. Try to cultivate a little bit of mystery.;
, The more comfortable you feel, the more comfortable the other person will feel around you, and the more receptive they'll be to your affection.

, Smile. Flirt. Touch. Tease. Don't be too serious, people enjoy having a good time. Have fun with this person. Enjoy the game.


Studies have found that a playful attitude makes people more attractive.Playfulness in males signals non-aggression, while in females it signals youth and fertility.
Humor, too, is another crucial aspect of your personality that plays a role in attractiveness. A study has found that women are more likely to give their phone number to men who use humor, while men too perceive humor as being an attractive trait in women.Be able to make fun of yourself. People generally don't like other people who can't take a joke or get offended when anything bad about them gets said. Don't be that person. Be able to take criticism in stride. Hey, if you dish it out to other people (and you should; playfulness is attractive) you should also be able to take it.

, People enjoy being with other people who have exciting and interesting things going on in their lives, because they feel happy at the prospect of someone like that sharing their precious time with them. So what will you achieve if you are trying to meet with them or talk to them every moment? Nothing. It's best not to overwhelm the other person with your time, and let the relationship unfold at a more measured pace.


On some occasions, if a person asks you for a date, don't immediately agree. Say you'll check your calendar first, and then agree. Even if you have nothing going on, play it cool. That way, your social appearance will be enhanced by a simple trick.
That being said, fill your calendar with real events and real people. There's no substitute for the real thing. You'll actually be happier and feel more fulfilled if you're out and about than if you're sitting at home twiddling your thumbs.

, Move confidently. Most people are not attracted to wallflowers, but to people who are sure of themselves. Don't forget to smile and, if possible, make body contact when appropriate and not intrusive.
Use your body language to flirt. If you're not Shakespeare-skilled with words, don't fret. You can send subtle signals to people you want to attract, depending on the social situation. Don't be afraid to touch someone's arm or shoulder lightly when you're talking to them. Physical contact by men actually increases the temperature of women, sometimes by a whole degree Celsius.Use eye contact to flirt. Eyes are incredibly powerful tools, so use them wisely. Lock eyes with your date when you're talking; there's nothing that screams confidence like a good look into someone's eyes. If you're using eye contact to flirt, however, don't scan the room staring at every person. People want to feel special, so learn to locate a few candidates and shower them with your eye-attention.






Use suggestive messages. If you're sending notes, texts, or email back and forth, learn to communicate calmness along with a little bit of intrigue. Instead of saying ""Hey, wanna grab coffee later on?"" try something a bit more suggestive: ""Having some cravings, and they may have to do with you. I'm in the mood for coffee, you in?""

, Leave something to the imagination. You should not share everything about you with the other person: mystery is always attractive. It makes people realize they don't know the whole you, and this secrecy will give off a seductive aura.


Resist the urge to tell this person about your entire life story, and especially your parents. Not that parents aren't great; they're just not very seductive!
If you're being forced into telling a little bit about yourself, stick to vague bits, not specific details. You can explain where you came from, how you grew up, and what your plans were to save the world, but put it in conversation form instead of a big, long essay.

, Wait for their desire for you to catch up with your desire for them. Believe that it's only a matter of time, that they just need to discover how awesome you really are. If you don't believe that, then you can't seduce anyone. But the fact is that we naturally become attracted to anyone who we feel comfortable with, makes us laugh, and is slightly out of reach (because of the thrill of the unknown). It's human nature.

Approach him.",How to Let a Guy Know You're Interested," This might seem like an obvious point, but that doesn't make it any less worth mentioning. If you spend the entire night avoiding the guy you're interested in because you find yourself in a panic about what to say and how to act, he will probably interpret your avoidance as disinterest, instead.;
, Once the conversation has been going on for a little while, start talking about yourself. Your interests, friends, work, and family are all fair game, but you should probably avoid talking about ex-boyfriends or failed relationships right away.


If your conversations stay centered on “safe” topics like the weather or the party, you are keeping your guard up, and this can make a guy think that you do not feel open to his advances. By letting him know a little about you, you can let him know that you are interested in him enough to invite him into your personal space and into your life.

, While talking about yourself is important, asking the guy about himself is just as essential. This gesture tells the guy that you are interested in learning more about him, which translates into you being interested in the guy himself.


You also need to reply as he is talking about his life to show that you really are paying attention and really are interested in knowing what he's all about.

, Forced laughter is never advised, but if you find something even mildly humorous, you should let him know you appreciate his humor with a laugh. Even a quiet giggle can speak volumes about your interest in the guy.


Forced laughter is usually pretty obvious, and forcing a laugh will make it seem as though you pity the poor guy rather than appreciate him. Moreover, if you have to force yourself to laugh at his jokes, you should be asking yourself if you are really as interested in this guy as you first thought.

, A little playful banter can be effective, but avoid stepping all over the poor guy's ego. In contemporary terms, a little sarcasm or dry wit can be very attractive, but it must be accompanied by body language that communicates your interest in order to let the guy know that you are being playful rather than critical.


Teasing should be playful in nature. For example, if his tie is crooked and he hurriedly tries to straighten it, you could laugh and tease that crooked ties are all the rage right now. If your teasing remark gets him joking back or at least gets a smile, you did it right.
On the other hand, any teasing you do should not be overly critical and should not cut him down. For instance, if he is nervous around you and accidentally spills his drink on your dress, you should not tease about him ruining a favorite dress or a family heirloom since this will only make him feel worse about his mistake.

, Everyone can appreciate a good compliment, as long as it seems genuine. Complimenting a guy's appearance is the easiest, most straight-forward way of letting a guy know you're interested. You could also throw out a compliment or two about the guy's personality, though, especially after you've been talking to him for a little while.


Compliments on his appearance can be about him or his clothes. For example, you could say, “Your eyes are amazingly expressive,” but you could also say, “Your shirt is great. That color blue really brings out your eyes.”

, Really, the easiest way to end a conversation in a way that let's your guy know that you want to see him again is to come straight out and say something along the lines of, ""I had a wonderful time talking with you tonight. I really hope we can do it again sometime.""Working in some nonverbal cues can also drive the point home. Try saying this line while lightly touching his arm.
With any luck, your guy will ask for your phone number at this point. If you can tell that he is clearly interested in you but too smitten to ask, you could always ask him for his number or offer yours.

, Eyes are “windows to the soul,” so eye contact is a vital element of letting a guy know that you're interested. That said, you do not want to stare the guy down straight-on. A better move would be to make eye contact, drop your eyes to the floor, then slowly sweep them back up to meet his again.Supposedly, by looking down after initial eye contact and dragging your eyes back up slowly, you are sending a signal that you feel attracted to the guy you saw and are processing your internal emotions about it. By returning eye contact after the pause, you tell the guy that, after processing your emotions, the prognosis is good for him.
Staring the guy straight on often suggests that you are not affected by him at all.

, Just about everyone appreciates a friendly smile, even when flirtation and romance are not the order of the day. Smiling implies friendliness and openness, and before you can let a guy know that you are interested in him romantically, you need to use this simple gesture to make yourself seem inviting enough to be around.


That said, you should only smile if it feels natural. If you feel nervous or otherwise don't feel like smiling, and smiling you do can come across as being forced and awkward. That will only turn the guy in question away.

, Never underestimate the power of physical contact. Brushing your hand against his arm during conversation is a fantastic way to bridge the distance between the two of you and suggest that you desire some sort of physical intimacy with the guy you're brushing against.


Be aware of the fact that some forms of touch are more suggestive than others. For example, touching a guy's arm is playful and flirtatious, but fairly safe. Placing your hand on a guy's thigh, however, is like implying that you want into his bed, and soon.

, If you cross your arms and keep the rest of your body equally closed off, you will send a clear signal that you want the guy to go away. If the rest of your body language is open, though, crossing your arms could actually send a good message to the guy in question.


When done the right way, it can be a subtle way of drawing attention to your chest and acknowledging a primal sort of attraction.
In order to do it well, you should keep one hand free and expressive while the other one lightly casually the opposite arm in a fold.

, By moving in closer, you convey the message that you want to be closer to the guy you move in toward. If you lean back or move away, you would essentially be saying that you want to put more distance between you and the person you're conversing with.


Lean in naturally and gracefully. The best time to do this is when you are already in conversation with they guy. Leaning in suggests that you are hanging on his every word, which is a clear sign of interest.

, Crossing and uncrossing your legs can convey a sense of nervousness, which can let the guy in question know that he is really getting under your skin. Do this occasionally to convey your attraction to the guy, but avoid overdoing it, otherwise he may perceive that he makes you uncomfortable in a bad way or feel as though he has too much power over you.


You can also use leg crossing as a way to express bold, direct interest. If the rest of your body language is confident and you cross your legs to show them off, it can be interpreted as a seductive action. If you intentionally point your top leg toward him, that can be interpreted as an even clearer sign of attraction.

, Twirling the ends of your hair in between your fingers can also convey nervousness and let a guy know that he is getting under your skin and into your thoughts. As with arm crossing and leg crossing, though, there are limits. Playing with your hair can express boredom if you do not keep the rest of your body language open.


Tossing your hair over your shoulder can also be a sexy gesture. Long hair is a feminine quality, and drawing attention to your hair draws attention to your femininity. Doing this suggests to a guy that you really, really want him to notice your womanly charms.

, Licking your lips is a dead giveaway that you are interested in a guy. When you feel attraction, your mouth and lips start to dry out, and you impulsively lick your lips as a way of moisturizing them.


Licking your lips also suggests that you are, subconsciously or consciously, thinking about kissing the guy.

, Splitting your attention between multiple guys and flirting with multiple guys may give the impression that you have a naturally flirtatious personality, thereby making your interest in the guy less apparent.

, If you meet a guy when you're already out and about, it might be too late to change your wardrobe, but if plan your outfit ahead of time whenever you can. Wear clothes that flatter your figure and show off your best attributes.


Note, however, that this does not mean you should dress provocatively. Wearing tight clothes that bare your cleavage, legs, back, and midriff can seem desperate, which might make a guy think that you are of the mindset that any guy will do as long as you can get whatever you crave from him.
Focus on one area of your body to emphasize. If a shirt really plays up your cleavage, avoid matching it with a skirt that really shows off your legs.

, In each scenario, a guy you do not know may find it difficult to approach you.


You do not necessarily need to be completely alone, but definitely opt for small groups over large groups.
If you are in a large group of girls, a guy might hesitate to approach you if he does not want to entertain a whole group and only wants to pay attention to you.
Any group that includes guys sends off the message that you might not be available, and a guy might completely miss the signs you're throwing at him one he gets this in his mind.

, When you decide to take a break from the activities going on around you, stand or sit in a fairly quiet area. A guy will be more likely to approach you there than he would be if he thinks he will need to shout above the noise for you to hear him.


Outdoor areas tend to be preferable to indoor areas, since it is easier to break away to a quiet location outside than it is in a packed, noisy room.

, Never leave the scene too early. You might think you've been laying on a full night's worth of signals in 30 minutes, but some guys can be shy about approaching women they do not know. If you think the guy in question might be interested in you, as well, make sure he has plenty of time to approach you before you give up.


If you're at a bar, party, or reception, keep in mind that the guy you have your eye on might feel like he needs a few glasses of “liquid courage” before he can approach the pretty woman making eyes at him. Give him a chance to work up the nerve.

, If all else fails, it is perfectly acceptable for you to approach a guy you are interested in. It can even be a good move if the guy has been dropping hints that he is interested but too shy to make the first move.


By making the first move, you create the impression that you are a confident person, and confidence is a highly appealing quality. Making the first move is also a clear declaration of your interest in him.

First, you will need to understand yourself.,
Once you understand what you are attracted to, you will need to begin learning how to understand and relate to the women you are attracted to.,
Learn to understand and train yourself to be aware of body language - hers and your own.,
Learn to read faces.,
Now, you have to find women to interact with, preferably those who fit your interests.,
Use your new-found skills to gauge how to proceed.",How to Get Her Interested," You are who you are, and you will be attractive to some women, and unattractive to others, no matter what you do, who you know or how you act. That is a fact. So you must understand what to look for based on what and who you are. Geek guys, for instance, generally place a high value on intelligence in a woman, while jocks are more likely to value her breast size than her I.Q. Know what it is you are genuinely attracted to in a woman.;
, Use what you know about what you are attracted to in order to narrow this down to as few specific groups or types of women as possible. The less you have to work with, the easier it will be.

, Women ""speak"" through body language quite clearly, and they ""hear you"" this way very clearly, too. Get some books on the subject, and spend some time people watching, too. Once you understand how a woman ""speaks"" using body language, you have just advanced 50% of the way forward. Really, it's that important. This point alone is why men and women often have a hard time communicating. Learn to understand her body language, and you'll save yourself (and her) a lot of time and trouble before you ever make a move at all.

, Reading faces is something that very few people have heard of, never mind knowing how to do. This is a more specific type of body language, but this works for men and women equally well. Once you learn to read faces, you'll know instantly many things about a woman, without ever doing anything but glancing at her. This is invaluable recon for approaching the target female in a way that she will find acceptable. This can be done with people-watching and reading pictures of faces, too.

, Seek them out, and socialize. Use the body language reading, face reading, and astrology to understand her and how to approach her. But also, use them to break the ice and entertain her! Whether she takes them seriously or not is not of any concern; just let her think what she likes, and have fun with her. They make wonderful icebreakers and conversation topics.

, Some women might require a quiet, slow approach; others might prefer a man who walks right up and speaks his mind. Your goal is to find women to interact with, who match your natural personality. If you cannot do that with the women you are attracted to, then you must make changes in yourself to become the type of man they find attractive.

See if he laughs for no reason when he's around you.",How to Know when a Man Is Attracted to You," Does he bring you coffee? Give you rides home? Unless he's really that much of a good citizen, chances are that he's not doing it out of the goodness of his heart only. He must be attracted to you and must want something more from you than just a ""thank you"" for all the nice stuff he's been doing for you.;
, Is he asking if you need his help with everything from home repairs to shoveling the snow of your driveway? Is he cooking for you because you've had a long day? If he's always around and finding ways to get close to you and to be in your presence, then it's likely that he's attracted to you.

, If a guy is interested in a girl, he will try to impress her. Even risk serious injury like jumping off cliffs into water or ride on trunks of moving cars or anything else to gain your attention and care if he does get hurt. If he's not generally a risk taker or if he takes his risk-taking to a new level when you're around, then chances are that he's doing it just to impress you. See if he tries to catch your eye or look at you after he's done the risky thing -- if so, then he's really just doing it to get a reaction from you.

, A guy would not flirt with a girl he wasn't attracted to. If a guy flirts with you, then he probably is testing you to see if the feelings are mutual. Seemingly harmless flirting may mask his fear of getting rejected if he were to ask you out outright. See if he's playful around you, if he teases you, and if he likes to make you laugh.


Just make sure he's not the kind of guy who flirts with every girl he sees. If he's a chronic flirt and that's just his way of talking to women, then it may not mean as much as it would if he were just flirting with only you.

, Do you notice unhappiness in him if you go for coffee or lunch with a male co-worker? Does he watch who is around you? If you have a male friend is he a little critical of him? His jealousy may not come out in the most obvious ways, but if he's truly jealous of you and another guy, he'll call attention to the fact that you're hanging out with another guy or he'll act extra distant when you make plans with another guy.


Each guy is different in terms of how he shows he's jealous, but if you do figure out that he's jealous of you, then it's a huge sign that he's attracted to you.

, If he gives you flowers or cute little tokens that will make you laugh or smile, then it's a big sign that he's attracted to you. Why else would he take the time to get you a gift that he knows will make your day more special? He may play down the gift when he gives it to you, making it seem like not a big deal in case you reject him, but really, he's doing this because he likes you!

, If he holds open doors and car doors for you, pulls out your chair before you sit down, offers you his coat, and does other various gentlemanly and chivalrous things around you, then yeah, there's a great chance that he's attracted to you and wants something more. Just make sure he's not acting all gentlemanly in front of all of the ladies.

, If he's fussing with his hair, picking lint off his clothes, messing with his shirt cuffs, adjusting his belt, removing a stain from his shoes, or just generally tending to his appearance around you, then it's a great sign that he's attracted to you. If you catch him acting extra self-conscious about his appearance, looking at himself in the mirror, or just generally caring more about his looks whenever you come by, then it's a big sign that he's into you.

, Really! Research has shown that when a guy is walking with a girl he is attracted to, he slows down or speeds up to match her walking pace. When the same guys walked with girls they only saw as friends, they did not slow down their pace to match the speed of their walking partner. The next time you walk with your crush, check out the pace of his feet!, If the man is attracted to you, then chances are that you'll be able to catch him staring at you from across the room. Of course, you shouldn't try too hard to see if you can catch him doing this, or he'll thinking that you're the one staring at him (which you are…sort of). If you look up and find him holding your gaze a few times, then he's probably attracted to you. Bonus points if he quickly looks away or looks embarrassed.

, If you do lock eyes and he keeps staring at you in a way that makes you blush or flush a bit, then he may be lingering because he's really attracted to you and wants more of you. Of course, if he's more shy, he may look away for a bit, but if he does stare at you for a few extra seconds, then there's a good chance he's attracted to you.

, If the man is attracted to you, then he will subtly -- or not so subtly -- turn his body toward you when you're speaking. This is just part of the basic rules of attraction. If he likes you, then he'll want to turn his shoulders, face, arms and body in your direction. If he's turned away from you or holding back, then he may not be as interested.

, If you see him playing with the buttons on his shirt, blushing, picking at his nails, playing with an object on his desk, moving his feet from side to side, or generally acting a little bit antsy, then there's a good chance that he's doing it because he's attracted to you. These are all classic signs of nervousness, and if you make him a little bit nervous, then yeah, he'll be fidgeting more than he normally would around you because he's excited by your presence.

, If he's really attracted to you, then he'll do everything in his power to get closer to you. This might mean he'll put his hand on the small of your back when you're walking into a room, he might give you a light pat on the shoulder or the arm, or he might even stand so close to you that your feet or legs touch and he doesn't move away from you right away.


He might even move a strand of hair away from your face if he really wants to get close to you.

, See if his lips are slightly parted. This is a classic sign of attraction. If he's attracted to you, his lips will part a bit when you make eye contact, or when you're talking. See if his nostrils are slightly flared when you talk. Check to see if his eyebrows are a bit raised when you talk to each other. All of these are signs that his face is opening up when you're together because he's really into you.

, If you're standing up, check to see that his head, shoulders, and feet are all pointed in your direction. If the guy is attracted to you, then this is his way of showing that he only wants to get closer to you. If he's looking away, facing in a slightly different direction, or moving his feet away from yours, then he may not see you in a romantic way.

, Have you heard that he was asking about you to your friends? Did he ask if you had a boyfriend? If so, then he's definitely attracted to you. It can be a little hard to figure out whether or not he's been asking about you without asking around yourself, because then it'll be obvious that you want to know because you like him. But if you've heard through the grapevine that he's been asking about you, then it definitely means that he's attracted to you.

, He may be so lost in his attraction to you that he ends up talking on and on about his love for Star Trek or his relationship with his kid sister. This kind of cute behavior stems from the fact that he's so into you that he can't even control the things that are coming out of his mouth. He may even apologize for talking so much or say, ""I don't know why I just told you that"" because he's self-conscious about looking like a fool in front of you.

, If he's attracted to you, then he may find himself revealing some personal stuff to you that he normally doesn't tell anyone. This is because he wants to get to know you and he wants you to get to know him. If you find him opening up, or even saying something like, ""I haven't told anyone that before"" or ""It's been years since I've brought that up,"" then it may be because he's really attracted to you and wants you to know more about him.

, Research shows that men lower the pitch of their voices when they're talking to females they're attracted to. The next time you have a conversation with your guy, check out the pitch of his voice. Compare it to how he talks to his friends or other girls and see if you can notice a difference. If you can, then there's a chance he's attracted to you!, He may not come right out and say, ""You're so hot. I am so attracted to you."" However, he might give you more subtle compliments that add up to say that he's really attracted to you. He may say that you have a unique hair color, that you have a great laugh, or that he likes that you're always in a good mood. See if he's given you multiple compliments recently -- he may be trying to tell you something.

, If he's attracted to you, then he'll definitely laugh more often just because he'll be excited to be around you. You might say something that's barely funny and he'll crack up, or you might even say something that wasn't meant to be taken as funny and he could start laughing just because he's nervous. These are all signs that he's attracted to you.


On the other hand, though, he may be so nervous that he won't laugh at something that you meant as a joke because he's too busy worrying about what you think of him to pay attention to everything you say!

Start the hug with a gentle touch on the arm, eye contact, or a smile.,
Wrap your arms around him.,
Press your upper body into his.,
Relax your body and fold comfortably into his arms.,
Press up even closer to him if you want to turn up the temperature.,
Gradually ease out of the embrace when it feels right.",How to Hug a Guy1," Whether you're in love or just dating, there is really no wrong way to move in for a hug. So just do it! A casual touch can be used to introduce a casual hug, and an intimate touch can be used to introduce an intimate hug. Let your hand brush against his arm a few times, or allow it to linger there for a few moments. Look into his eyes, or sneak up behind him and plant one on him. If you want to give him a hug, just give him the hug.;
, Don't overthink it, just wrap him up. In general, you'll slide both arms between his arms and his torso, connecting them around his back for a deep, close embrace. However, if you're feeling romantic, there are plenty of other ways to hug him:Wrap one hand behind his back, just above his butt. Place the other hand around his neck so that your fingers rest where his neck meets his shoulder.
Lightly grab onto the left side of his neck (his right side) with your left hand. If you're extra romantic, you can lightly tousle the back of his hair with your fingers.
Place one palm lightly on his upper chest, wrapping around his waist with your other arm., As you wrap your arms around his neck or chest, press your upper body into his. Pressing your chest into his is considered a ""heart to heart"" hug. If you're taller than him, you might rest your head on his shoulder. If you're shorter, turn so that you rest your cheek on his chest.

, Just slow down and relax. A hug is simply a chance to press close together, enjoying each other's company. If your first hug position isn’t right, simply move your arms and body into a more comfortable position. If you are in a good embrace, let your hug linger until the moment passes or you feel him begin to pull away.

, Pressing your upper half into his can indicate romantic interest, but it is still fairly tame. Allowing your hands to roam or your legs to intertwine, however, is a great way to kick it up a notch and suggest stronger desire.


Massage his back, neck or chest lightly with your fingers to kick things up a notch.
Pull his face down into a kiss if it feels right, or if you're both looking for more than a hug.

, Instead of stepping back and immediately breaking contact, take a half step out of his embrace and allow your hands to linger on his shoulders or chest. Look each other in the eyes and smile, or slide back in for a kiss.


If you feel him slightly pulling back from the hug, don't try and grip him tighter. Follow the mood and ease out as well.
There is no right amount of time to hold a hug, so just feel it out and enjoy yourself."

Flirt with her.,
Make her feel special.,
Charm her.,
Don't look too available.,
Know when enough is enough.",How to Hook Up with a Girl1," If you want to hook up with a girl, you have to flirt with her first to show that you can play ball. To flirt with a girl the right way, you have to let her know that you're interested without giving too much away. After you make eye contact, don't be afraid to approach the girl and get a flirty conversation going. Here are some ways to flirt:


Flirt with your body language. Maintain eye contact while you talk, keep your body turned toward her, and lean in a bit so you get closer.
Tease her. Gently tease the girl about anything from her obsession with her cat to her pink shoes, all the while letting her know you think she's really cute.
Keep it light. Maintain a light, fun, flirtatious banter when you're first trying to get to know the girl. If you try to get too serious right away, she'll think you're too intense.
Don't forget to smile and laugh. Let her know how much you like talking to her without saying so.
Touch her lightly. If it's going well, give her a light touch on the shoulder or arm.;
, Every girl wants to feel like she's the only girl in the world, so you should make her feel like a truly unique individual -- even if you're just trying to hook up with her. To make her feel special, you have to be a good listener, ask the right questions, and make her feel like everything she's saying is important.


Ask her questions about herself. Don't ask anything too deep -- just talk about her siblings, favorite bands, and what she likes to do on the weekends.
Listen intently. Don't look around the room while she's talking; instead, put your phone away, and only break eye contact to smile and look at the ground if things are getting too intense.
Let her know what makes her stand out. You don't have to say, ""I've never met anyone like you before,"" but you can say, ""I've never heard such an incredible laugh."" Let her know she's unique.

, Charming people can walk into any room and talk to any person at all without getting uncomfortable. To charm the girl, you have to exude confidence and show that you're completely comfortable with yourself and that you love talking to people and making them feel great.


Keep things positive. Charming people make the best of everything and are always emphasizing the great things in life -- that's why people want to be around them.
Show that you can talk to anyone. Though you should focus on the girl, if her friends are around, you should charm them while keeping her attention. This will show that you can keep up a conversation with anyone.
Impress her with your wit. Don't just laugh if she says something funny; fire back with a hilarious comment.

, Though it's important to get the girl interested, you still have to play it coy if you really want her to hook up with you. No girl wants to hook up with the low-hanging fruit; you should look interested, but not desperate to hook up with her at any cost. There's a fine line between flirting and coming on too strong, so make sure you don't smother the girl with affection.


You should compliment her, but don't tell her she's beautiful, amazing, and has an absolutely gorgeous body -- she will start to get overwhelmed or will suspect that you're not really being sincere.
Don't talk about how you never get girls and are surprised that a great girl like her is actually talking to you. You should make her think that girls love talking to you all the time, even if it's not true.
Sometimes it helps to make her jealous just a bit. If you mention another girl, briefly flirt with another girl, or just don't sound 100% invested in general, the girl will only want you more. Now, if you throw yourself at another girl right in front of her, she'll quickly lose interest.

, If the girl just isn't having it, you'll know pretty quickly. If you're pulling out all the stops but she's just rolling her eyes, looking around the room, or signaling her friends to save her, then it's time to cut her loose. Don't hang around longer than you're wanted, or you'll just embarrass yourself. If she doesn't want you, that's okay -- move on and know you'll find someone else who isn't immune to your charms.


If she clearly doesn't want you, be a gentleman as you say goodbye. Don't make things worse by saying, ""Well, you clearly don't like me"" -- instead, just tell her it was nice to meet her and go on your merry way.

Show her you're interested in her by saying, for example, ""I like your shirt"".,
Don't feel obliged to talk to her every time you see her.,
During a casual conversation mention you'll be doing something fun this weekend, like going to a new club.

,
Continue the conversation some 10 minutes, then say, ""It was nice talking to you.,
Some girls however aren't into parties and such like, so perhaps suggest going for a walk together (if you have a dog ask her if she'd like to join you sometime) or maybe going into town etc.

,
Girls like to feel pretty, so make SURE to compliment her.",How to Get the Girl You Like," It wasn't when you were near the person, it was while you were away, thinking about them! So if you're constantly around her, she'll lose interest. Make sure you make her think about you while you're away.;
, This way she won't lose interest too fast. For example, if you just met her and she asks about your job, give a few details but don't go overboard because she will probably ask you about it some more herself; make her feel more included in the conversation.

, Show her she has competition. But at the same time, treat her just that little bit more special than you do them.

, The balance is 'I want you but I don't need you' if you could successfully communicate this balance to a girl this is going to make you a lot more attractive. One way to incorporate this balance into your personality is to say the same thing repeatedly into your head when her thought comes to your head. The reasons for it are...

Neediness. Women or girls find neediness Gross in a guy or a man. Think of it this way women are the one, in most cases and cultures, who are lead by men, but when a man becomes needy this is like role reversal, which is one of the reason why this is gross for a girl when a guy acts needy. Again Neediness is Gross, women don't like a guy who is insecure......Bottom-line.
Scarcity. Its human nature, we are attracted to things which we can't have or are scarce. In the same way this balance can sub-communicate to the girl that you are scarce in the market, which in return would make you more attractive.

, Find out what she likes and dislikes and make a conversation out of it.

, You may not know that you're going on and on talking about something you like. Some girls get bored to death really quickly!

, Girls like guys that are sensitive and not afraid to crack a little joke every now and then. Marilyn Monroe once said that if you can make a woman smile, you can make her do anything.

, If she's sad, find a way to make her happy. If she's happy, help her stay that way, so that you both can have a great day.

, She'll think it's awkward and instead of walking with you she might run off with her friends where she knows she can talk.

,, Show her you can handle being the center of interest. To achieve this, you may want to work on your conversational skills.

,, If you feel she may like you back then move on to complimenting her looks slightly - but not in a perverted way. Tell her she's beautiful or that she has nice eyes.

, A simple greeting is enough, then get back to your business.

,, Gotta go."" Always put kisses (not an over the top amount though!) this will show her you like her and also hints at more than friends.

,, If it's her shirt, or her amazing eyes, it will make her feel better about herself!

Make eye contact and open your arms before moving in.,
Open your arms and take steps toward him.,
Slide your arms under his if he's taller than you.,
Wrap your arms all the way around his back.,
Embrace him warmly and briefly.,
Step away, re-establish eye contact and smile again.",How to Hug a Guy2," You don't have to be dating someone to give them a good, warm hug. However, with guys you aren't romantically involved with, you generally need to give him a little heads up. Make eye contact, smile, and open your arms up. Unless he firmly sticks his hand out for a shake or seems to shy away/avoid eye contact, just move into the hug.


Be flexible -- if he doesn't seem to want a hug, don't hug him. If he does, or you're unsure, just be yourself and do whatever you want. Very few guys will complain about a casual hug.

, You'll end up close enough that you can comfortably get your arms around each other and touch chests. In general, your feet will be 6-8"" away from each other, but don't worry about it too much. It is a casual hug, so just be casual about it. Unless you're pressing your entire body into his and pulling him in close, you're not going to send the wrong signal.


Open your arms as wide as you feel. You can feel free to open your arms wide if you want a big hug.
If he doesn’t seem like he wants a hug, you could give him a side hug. Move so you are side by side with him, and put your arm around his shoulder. This one-armed hug can get you out of many awkward moments if need be.

, Just make sure your head is going the opposite way of his head and you'll be fine. If you're the taller one, let him slide his arms under yours. This isn't a hard and fast rule, of course, but in general it is easier to slide into a hug if you don't have to reach down to get under someone's armpits.

, Once your arms are positioned in response to his, move them all the way around his body and gently but firmly embrace. Keep your body relaxed while you are putting your arms around his body. Your hands can be open and touch his back or shoulders, or you can clasp your own hands behind him.


Don’t think about yourself too much while hugging. This can make you feel awkward. Instead, concentrate on the guy you are hugging and try to enjoy the moment.
Just laugh if anything goes wrong or feels awkward. Hugs are not complex signals or mating rituals -- they're a pleasant way to greet someone. Don't overthink it!

, To embrace warmly, try to think about him and not yourself, enjoy the moment, and give him a firm but gentle squeeze. A good way to think about your timing, if you're extra worried, is to just exhale into the hug, relaxing your muscles as you do, then stepping back gently once you're done. This will give you a good 2-3 second hug.

, Ease gently out of the hug and step back -- he'll do the same thing 99% of the time. You want to be outside his personal space, but don’t move so far back that it seems unnatural -- one or two smalls steps is fine. Looking at him again will cement the good vibes from your hug so that you both leave the hug feeling great.

Look for open arms and body language.,
Use a simple one-armed handshake to adjust an awkward embrace.,
Take charge if the guy seems awkward or unsure of what to do.,
Skip the hassle of a hug altogether and use different, more casual greeting.,
Avoid hugs you don't want with a smile and your hand firmly extended.",How to Hug a Guy3," There are few more common, and more awkward, social moments then the debate between a hug and a handshake. One of the best indicators is someone's hands. If they extend their right hand towards you you can be pretty sure they want a handshake. However, if their hands move out, opening up their torso, there is a good chance they're expecting a hug.

, If you end up stuck between a hug and a handshake, simple wrap one arm around the lower back for a one-handed hug. Lean in so that one of your shoulders touches his, but don't feel like you need to really embrace him if you don't want to. You can keep some distance, or angle your body away from him to keep things casual.


This is a great way to end an awkward ""what should we do"" moment. Just wrap the arm, hug quickly, then stand back.

, There is no reason why you can't stick your hand out or simply move to a hug if you want. Without fail, the guy will adapt to you, so just take the initiative and move in however your feel comfortable. Just make eye contact and go for it-- there are very few guys who do not enjoy a hug from a woman. That said, there are times when you're better off sticking to a handshake, such as:


Buisness or professional settings.
The first time you meet him.
When you are unsure about his boundaries
If you do not know/feel unsure about local or international customs.

, This can demonstrate a sense of ease or camaraderie. For example, you start with a quick wave, a high-five or a fist bump. This sets a casual, platonic mood between you and him. You could start with a high five before drawing him into an embrace, or you could playfully give him a light punch or fist bump on the shoulder.If he smiles, makes eye contact, and seems at ease, you can always move in for a hug when you say good bye.
A quick wave and a smile from a distance is often a good way to gauge if they want a hug. If he responds warmly, just move on it.

, If you know someone is a ""hugger,"" or you just don't feel like a hug is appropriate for any reason, take charge and stick your hand out early. Make eye contact and smile, then give a firm handshake. In the rare case that a guy seems extra persistent, you can try to guide his hand to yours with your free hand, making it extra clear that you want no more than a handshake.


If you really, really, don't want to hug them, give your best smile and say something like ""It's great to see you, let me shake your hand."""
"
If it's going well, ask her out.,
Set the mood.,
Compliment her.,
Try some light touches.",How to Hook Up with a Girl2," You can't hook up with her if you don't ask her out, can you? Tell the girl that you've had a great time talking to her and ask her if she wants to pick up the conversation over drinks and dinner some time. Or if you're forward and met her out at a club or a bar, just ask her to come back home with you, but remember that this may make you look like a player if you're just getting to know each other. But if all you want to do is hook up, then hey--ask her to come over.


If you really like the girl, then you should take her on a few dates first before you try to really hook up with her.

, Once you've got her alone -- whether it's later that same night or after a few dates -- you should set the mood before you try anything so she's feeling more romantic. If she's going back to your place, make sure everything is clean, that the lights are relatively dim, and that you have some provisions -- wine, cheese, chocolate, or other sexy snacks.


Be an absolute gentleman when she comes over. Take off and hang up her coat and ask her if she'd like something to drink or eat.

, You don't have to go overboard. Just tell her she looks great that night, that you love her earrings, or just say that you like spending time with her. Make her feel special before you even make a move.


Don't be insincere. Tell her something nice that's actually true. She'll be able to tell if you're just buttering her up with compliments to try to get her to hook up.

, If she seems receptive and you're sitting next to her, then you can try some light touches before you start kissing her. Put your arm around her, place your hand on her knee, or even squeeze her hand to let her know that you're into her. You can even gently stroke her hair or put your arm around her waist if you're feeling more forward.


See how she responds. If she's comfortable with your touches, then she'll move closer to you, smile, and will start putting her hands on you too.
Once the light touches have done their trick, you can try to kiss her.

"
"
Kiss her.,
Touch her more intimately.,
Get undressed (optional).,
See if she's ready for more.",How to Hook Up with a Girl3," Kissing a girl for the first time doesn't have to be scary. Just remember to be confident, take it slow, and know what to do with the rest of your body. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to have a perfect first kiss with the girl, and just focus on enjoying lip-locking with the girl for the first time. Here's how to do it:


Look into her eyes and brush her hair out of her face. Let her know that you want to kiss her without saying so.
Move toward her with your lips slightly parted. Kiss her and see how she responds. You can lock lips for a few seconds or even longer if she's pulling away.
If she wants to keep kissing, then you can even try to French kiss her after a few minutes; just don't put your tongue into her mouth right away or she'll be thrown off guard.
Gently move your hands around her waist or shoulders, but don't start groping her in inappropriate places or she'll get uncomfortable.

, Once she lets you know that she's ready to take it to the next level, you can start touching her more intimately while you're kissing. If she moves onto your lap, or if you're on top of her, then things are getting hot and heavy. You can try running your hands over more intimate parts of her body once she's comfortable. This will turn her on and may get her in the mood for more.


If you've been kissing for a while and she's starting to touch you all over, run your hands over her breasts, but do it very carefully to see how she responds. If she lets you know she likes it, then keep going.
Stroke her thighs and the space behind her thighs. Keep going as long as she's letting you know she likes it.
You can start kissing her on her neck or below her ears. You don't have to limit kissing to lips.

, For some people, hooking up just means kissing, and if you've achieved that goal, then be happy for a job well done. But if both of you are wanting more, then it's time to go to the bedroom and start taking off your clothes. Help the girl remove her clothes gently, and don't be too forward about it.


Don't take off all of your clothes at once. Once she starts taking hers off, you should maintain the same level of relative nudity.
Don't make her uncomfortable by taking off all of your clothes while she's fully dressed, or by taking off all of her clothes while you still have yours on.
Unbutton her shirt or slide it over her head. Then, take off her bra by unclasping it in the back; don't make awkward comments about how tricky it is. Just relax and you'll be able to get it off.
Don't rush to take off your clothes. Wait for her to pull your shirt over your head or to start removing your belt.
Once she's undressed, tell her how beautiful she looks.

, If you want to have sex with the girl, make sure it's what she has in mind too. You should both be sober, into each other, and ready to have a good time. And being ready to have a good time means behind prepared in advance with condoms or anything else you might need to have sex.


Don't rush into sex. Make sure you have the girl's consent first, and that she's doing it because she really wants to, not because you're really putting the pressure on.
Even if it's clear that you both want to have sex, you should spend some time on foreplay so you're both turned on when the moment comes.

Your clothes: Make sure to exercise good fashion sense.,
Your integrity: Don't be so concerned with your image that you're putting up a front.,
Compromise: Nerds are well-known for their many hobbies and emphasis on learning, which takes up a lot of their time.,
Your approach: Act friendly, warm, and interested.,
Offer your company: Find a creative date idea, or one tailored to a shared interest between you.,
Talk.,
Take her on a date.,
Like her?",How to Impress a Nerd Girl," Wear clothes that fit well and don't look trashy or overly showy. Don't seem like you're doing all this for her, make it natural and normal.;
, Girls in general like a guy who'll look after himself, but not a guy who's convinced he has to be someone he's not in order to be likable. Nerd girls in particular have little tolerance for guys who aren't honest and down-to-earth.

, You'll need to respect her schedule.

, Ask her a lot about herself, and reveal things about yourself, too. This is called ""flirting."" It's not that difficult, so don't approach it as if it were. Don't make any comments about her body. All girls hate that.


Treat her like a friend, and you'll probably get... a friend. So what's the difference between flirting and normal talking? Flirting is the process by which you exchange information about each other. Someone talking to a friend might say: ""Which of the Alpha abilities do you think is the coolest?"" Flirting would sound more like: ""If you could have a superpower, what would it be and what would you do with it?"" because it helps you learn about the other person's personality.
Insecurity won't get you anywhere. Fact: You talked to this girl for thirty seconds and she did not run away screaming. Unless you're secretly a lazy slob whose hobby is punching cats in the face, chances are, you're worth talking to. Act like you know it. Self-respect and confidence are very attractive--to everyone, not just nerds.

, It really makes a girl feel good when a guy notices and remembers something about her, and uses it to make their time together more fun. Who knows--your unique idea might turn Tuesday into Tiramisu Night.

, A lot. Guys tend to bond by doing things together; girls tend to bond by talking. It helps if you can find a date that will incorporate both.

, Ask her casually, nerdy girls like a guy who can be her lover, and her friend. There are many different types of nerds. Take her somewhere based on what she likes, and what she is interested in. Try a romantic dinner or a polar coaster ride., At the end of the first date, don't rush straight to ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" Instead, say something like, ""I really enjoy spending time with you. We should do this again soon!"", and she'll probably say something similar back.


If you're feeling really good about how your date went, amp it up to, ""I really had fun tonight. Want to go back to Tiramisu and Tea again next Tuesday? I hear they do good tortes, trifles, and turnovers as well.""
Pay attention to what she says, and how she says it! It could indicate how much she likes you.

Build up your confidence.,
Don’t rehearse too much.,
Know your intentions.,
Be prepared for conversation.,
Don’t stalk them.",How to Get Someone's Phone Number1," A person with confidence is very attractive to the opposite gender.


Feel your best by putting on your favorite outfit, styling your hair, and listening to your favorite music. Of course, you can only do this if you know in advance that you plan on asking someone for their number.






Even if you don’t feel that confident, act with confidence. It will appear the same to onlookers, and eventually the act will transition to the real deal.;
, If you practice a scene over and over in your head about asking for someone’s number, it will either 1) look equally rehearsed in person, or 2) work out differently in real life, making the practice unnecessary.

, Are you asking this persons number to call them up for fun? To meet them the next day? For a date in a week? Have an idea of what you plan on doing with their number before you ask.

, Although nerves can get in the way and make real talking seem like the most frightening thing in the world, it is unfortunately necessary for you to sell your charming self in exchange for a number.


Don’t expect to just walk up, ask for a number, and leave. You will have to do a little talking before and after the number-taking goes down.
Be open and honest. They may ask you questions, in which case your best solution is to be brief and truthful.
Don’t monopolize the conversation. Although it is easy to talk about ourselves, ask your potential partner questions and give them time to respond. Be a good listener, it is very attractive.
Know when to end the conversation. Although a little discussion is good, drawing it out for too long becomes boring. Make sure that you aren’t being too time-consuming in your conversations.

, Although you may know in advance that you want a person’s phone number, never stalk them to get it. Being caught in the act of creeping on them will definitely not put you on their good side."
"
Try being direct.,
Ask to borrow something.,
Ask with a choice.,
Swap business cards.",How to Get Someone's Phone Number2," The most simple option is being very direct. Approach the person, start a conversation, and make a comment along the lines of “you know, I’ve really enjoyed talking to you. Do you think I could have your phone number and we could do it again sometime?”


If you are asking a stranger, don’t worry about having a lengthy conversation. The person likely knows that you are approaching them out of romantic interest.
If you know this person before asking for their number, make sure your intentions are clear. You don’t want to come across as a platonic friend looking for support when you are really romantically interested in them.

, Say that you need to borrow something, for example a pen, and then ask if you can have their phone number so you can call them to meet and give whatever the item was back to them. This is simultaneously flirty and straightforward, a perfect combination.

, Instead of asking a yes-or-no “can I have your number?” question, offer two choices. “Could I have your phone number or email?” This way, they are more likely to give you a definite means of contacting them.

, Although business cards are less commonly held by today's youth, swapping business cards is a great way to get someone’s contact. It also verifies that their number is real, not a fake one given because they aren’t interested."
"
Walk away smoothly.,
Wait patiently.,
Call, don’t text.,
Don’t panic.",How to Get Someone's Phone Number3," Once you’ve gotten their phone number, don’t linger. Instead, walk away calmly and either leave the scene or hang out in a different area.

, Although you have their number now, don’t take that as a sign to call them immediately. Wait at least 24 hours before making a move and giving them a call.

, Although texting offers an emotional shield, it is distancing and impersonal. For a much more personal conversation, call them. This goes for the first or the fortieth time you get a hold of them; calling is almost always preferable to texting.

, This is just another person, right? So don’t become anxious and worried the first time you actually use their number. Keep calm and collected and it will show, making you even that much more attractive to them.

"
"
Take their phone.,
Ask someone else for their number.,
Look it up in a directory.",How to Get Someone's Phone Number4," If you are with the person, try taking their phone. You could do this secretly and hide it, or be open and flirty about it.


Send yourself a text message from their phone, and add your contact to their list.
Look up their number in their phone settings.

, If you have a mutual friend, simply ask them for the person's number instead. This way, you get the number without having to be so up-front about it.

, If you have a phone book, school directory, or archive of coworker phone numbers, look up their number. Use whatever method you have available to find their number.

Find ways to surprise your partner.",How to Get Someone to Love You," Paying close attention to your physical appearance may help you to get your love interest’s attention. Make sure that you take time every day to groom yourself and keep yourself looking healthy and attractive. Some good ways to look your best include:


exercising on a regular basis
wearing nice clothes that fit you well and flatter your body
showering every day and using deodorant
keeping your hair neat and trimmed
brushing your teeth and using mints or gum to freshen your breath when needed
shaving your face or grooming your beard (men);
, Making someone love you isn’t about making someone love a fake version of you. Your love interest needs to love you for who you are.Keep in mind that not everyone is going to love you, but you should still project your authentic self. This might require some soul-searching and work on self-awareness to figure out who you really are. To help you find yourself, researchers have identified four elements that are important to individual authenticity:Self-awareness: knowing and trusting your own emotions, motivations, abilities, and preferences.
Clarity in evaluating strength and weakness
Behavior: acting in a way that reflects your true self and your beliefs
Close relationships: these are necessary because you allow others to know what you are really like, both good and bad

, Sometimes the person that interests us doesn’t even know we exist because we’re too shy to say anything. Work on overcoming any shyness you might have and talk to the person you are interested in. Tell funny stories or jokes. Making another person laugh is always a good start. If being funny is too terrifying, just try to bond over shared experiences – classes, traffic, the weather – however you can find to relate to the other person.“It is so rainy today I thought I was going to float off the road! I even saw a car underwater on my way here.”
“Did you know they’re going to start making fresh croissants at the cafe? I can’t wait to try them. I’ll probably order three and plan to eat just one and take the rest home, but then eat them all and then be sorry. Do you feel that way about any food?”
“My brother got dressed up like Darth Vader and is already in line for Star Wars, seven days early. I mean, I love Star Wars, but I can’t imagine camping out to see a movie!”

, Using open body language and inviting facial expressions is a good way improve the connection between you and your love interest. People are more attracted to people who are open and inviting, so make sure that you are always projecting these qualities to your love interest. Some good ways to use open body language and inviting facial expressions include:sitting so that you are facing your love interest
smiling at your love interest
leaning in towards your love interest
making eye contact with your love interest

, People are also more attracted to people who are kind to others, so make sure that you let your kindness shine when you are with your love interest.Some easy ways to show kindness include:


saying nice things about people (not gossiping or speaking ill of others)
showing genuine concern if your love interest is sad or in pain
offering your assistance to your love interest and others whenever you can
saying positive encouraging things to your love interest and others to acknowledge their accomplishments

, Even if you don’t feel brave inside, projecting confidence can make you seem confident. If you’re shy, take it as an acting challenge to show the people around you that you have confidence. Cultivate your own interests, think about your big goals in life, and work toward them. People are attracted to those that can both complement and expand their own life and interests.Learn something new: a language, a sport, a craft. You might be surprised at the feeling of well-being and confidence it gives you. It can also be a great conversation starter.
Get involved in performing. If you’re shy, joining a sports, drama, or musical group can be a great way to overcome nerves and make you more confident around strangers.

, Sometimes we think that we want someone to love us, but when we actually get to know that person, we discover that he or she is not a person we want to pursue. Before you put in all the energy to get someone to love you, make sure that you really like that person – both the way he or she looks and the way he or she acts and deals with others. See if you can sit next to the person in class or at a restaurant. Ask him or her about interests and goals.What did you do on your last vacation?
What do you like to do for fun?
What places do you most want to visit?
What kinds of music do you like?
What’s your favorite kind of food?

, Hanging around with the people that your love interest likes can be revealing. Pay attention to how your love interest treats these people. Think about whether you would like to be treated this way. If not, then you should not pursue a relationship with this person., You should also take some time to get to know your love interest as a person. Try hanging out in a big group with your love interest before you have too much one-on-one time together. This will allow you to get to know your love interest slowly and see how he or she acts in different situations. After a while, you will begin to see your love interest’s true character and then you can determine if you still like the person.

, It’s important to have time alone with your love interest as well. This will help you see how he or she interacts when it’s just the two of you. Even if your love interest sees you as just a friend, it can be the start of a closer relationship. On the other hand, spending time alone with your love interest could also be the start of a romantic relationship. Some good things to do with your love interest early on include:

hiking
rock climbing
going out to eat
volunteering at an animal shelter
visiting a museum
going bowling
meeting up for coffee

, Tell your love interest what you admire about him or her. Focusing on someone’s looks is fine, but it’s a lot nicer to share what you like about your love interest that goes beyond his or her looks.


“You are so good with animals -- and they all seem to love you!”
“I’m so impressed that you’re writing a book. I don’t think I could ever do that. How did you ever get started?”
“You are seriously the best skier I have ever seen. Why didn’t you go pro?”

, Flirting is not for everyone, but it can help to move your relationship along. Gentle teasing or in-jokes with the person can be part of it, or even making good eye contact and smiling. Gentle touching can be flirtatious as well. Try gently touching your love interest on the arm or on the hand during a conversation to show your interest.Watch for signs of interest before you try flirting. If your love interest is doing things like smiling, making eye contact, and touching you now and then, flirting will most likely work. But if your love interest is avoiding eye contact with you, being cold or rude to you, and keeping some distance between the two of you, then flirting may not work.

, This might be the moment that he or she really sees you as a potential romantic partner. It can be nerve-wracking to ask someone out, but if you’re trying to get someone to love you, you will have to ask for a date at some point.

Taking a dance lesson together. This will give you a good excuse to get close to your love interest.
Going on a picnic. Some nice cheese, bread, and a bottle of wine makes for a great evening.
Checking out a jazz club. Even if you don’t like the music, the ambience and having to get close to talk to each other can bring two people together.

, Good listening skills are crucial to maintain a healthy relationship. Try to develop your active listening skills and always give your partner your full attention when he or she is talking. Some good ways to practice active listening include:


looking at your partner when he or she is speaking
nodding and making neutral statements to indicate your attention
repeating what your partner has said now and then to show that you are paying close attention
asking questions to help you understand if something is unclear, Honesty is an important part of a healthy relationship as well. If there is something that you need from your partner or if you are upset about something, then you should say so. Your partner should feel like he or she can do the same.For example, if you are always the one who makes the bed in the morning and it has been frustrating you, then ask your partner if he or she would help you make the bed or take turns with you.

, Keeping your relationship exciting will be easier if you plan some fun outings and activities with your partner. Try to go on a date at least once per month and do other little things together to make life more interesting.


For example, you could take an art class together, learn a language together, or take up a new sport., In healthy relationships, it is also important to have some time away from your partner to spend time with friends or engage in your own interests. Try to set aside one night per week where you do not spend time with your partner.For example, you could go out with your friends, head to a café with a book for a few hours, see a movie that your partner would not enjoy, or stay home and work on an art project.

, Doing little things to make your partner happy and to surprise your partner now and then will also help to maintain your healthy relationship. For example, you can bring your partner a cup of coffee during her shift at work, surprise your partner with flowers or some other small gift, or just give your partner a genuine complement to brighten his day.

You are in control of your emotions; your emotions are not in control of you. While you can’t decide what you feel, you can decide how to act upon those feelings. Stay conscious of what you’re feeling and thinking in order to keep your confidence high and find the courage to talk to women.
Use self-talk to stay positive. Self-talk is the inner monologue you have with yourself, the running script in your mind.

When brushing, use the roll method. This involves moving the brush not in straight vertical or horizontal lines across your teeth, but in tight, concentric circles from the base of your gums to the ends of your teeth.
If you have dandruff, use a specialized dandruff shampoo and conditioner. Avoid dry places and consider buying a humidifier in order to mitigate the effects of the dry environment on your scalp.

, Don’t listen to people who make you feel you’re too tall, too fat, too thin, or too short to talk to women. Don’t buy into the lie that women will never be attracted to you because of some deficiency that someone at some point insisted you suffer from.If someone makes you feel bad, let them know. Say something along the lines of “What you said earlier really hurt my feelings. I did nothing to deserve your cruel words. Please do not speak unkindly to me."" This will bring the negative behavior to the offending party’s attention and they will probably apologize.

, A few simple, healthy habits will give you a more positive energy when dealing with others and when thinking about your own abilities and self-worth.

If you’re skilled at telling jokes, you’ll easily make a positive impression on women and will have no reason to fear talking to them.
Focus on the topic at hand, not on your own perception of yourself. Don’t worry about how you look, what may or may not be between your teeth, or how your hair is combed. Being engaged, not distracted, when in conversation with a woman will make you less anxious during the exchange.

Make eye contact.Don’t stare at her constantly and freak her out, but make sure she knows you are looking at her.,
Take up a lot of space in the room.,
Put yourself near her.You need to be in a position where she can see you if you want to attract her attention.,
Talk to people around her.Sometimes it can be nerve wracking to talk directly to the person that you are attracted to.,
Wear bright colors.",How to Get Someone to Notice You1," It’s so simple, and yet it is so effective.A smile immediately opens the door to a conversation. More than likely, she will smile back at you too. Smiling is very inviting and attractive.;
, If you make eye contact, smile and hold it for a second, then look away. This will let her know that you are into her, and she will be more likely to notice you.


Some say maintaining eye contact 50 % of the time while talking and 70 % of the time while listening is a good balance.Obviously there is no exact calculation, but it is a good idea to make eye contact early and often and maintain it for at least four or five seconds.For example, try to make eye contact with her periodically while you joke around and hang out with your friends. If you can catch her eye while you are smiling and laughing with your friends she'll be more likely to notice you. She'll see you are having a good time and that you are the life of the party.

, This is true for both genders.. If you come off seeming sociable and confident by taking up a lot of space in the room and engaging with many different people, you are much more likely to be noticed. If you’re shy and standing in the corner you aren’t doing yourself many favors. You need to be brave and put yourself out there.


Even if you aren’t very brave, this can be an easier way to get noticed. Your friends are probably the people you feel most comfortable around. Joking with them is much easier than making conversation with the person you want to notice you.

, However, talking to other people around her while you are in a group is a good way to get her to notice you. If you are friends with some or one of her friends, you could talk to this person while they are with her. You could even ask this person to introduce the two of you.


For example, if you know someone that she is talking to come up and enter the conversation by talking to that person. Then, once you reach a break in the conversation, you can introduce yourself to her without any awkwardness.

Be friendly when he's having bad days.",How to Get Him to Make a Move1," Think about what he likes and dislikes and where he spends his time. Without going overboard, try to arrange a meeting that seems like a random coincidence. Show interest in the things that he's interested in, and he may take notice.For example, if you know he likes to rock climb, plan a trip to the local climbing gym at a time he's likely to be there. You might even tell him it's your first time and see if he can help you get started. This might give you the opportunity to flirt and invites casual physical contact.

See women as people.,
Gain some perspective on the issues that women struggle with.,
Identify women’s accomplishments.,
Don’t focus so much on women’s appearance.Women are more than just a pretty face.,
Don’t believe that all women are materialists.",How to Get Over Your Fear of Women2," Do not place women, or any particular woman, on a pedestal. No woman is perfect. Women are human beings just like you, with their own struggles and challenges. Many women are just as scared and vulnerable as you are. Being realistic in your evaluation of women as a whole can render you less afraid of them.


Every woman has her own unique characteristics and traits. Learn about them in greater depth to find out how to best converse with a given woman. For instance, you might ask one woman about her favorite sports team, while you might inquire with another about her family. Learn what each woman values in their life, and encourage her to share it with you.
Accept that not all women will get along with you. Women are individuals, each of whom has their own tastes and preferences. Some people just don’t get along.

, Women confront huge problems in their everyday lives that men never have to think about. Wage disparities, sexual harassment, abortion rights, and the double day are just a handful of the challenges unique to women.The more you understand women and their struggles, the less they will seem to be an alien race, and the less scared of them you will become.


Read accounts of women’s liberation and struggles. Literature by feminist activists like Gloria Steinem will enlighten you as to how women’s experiences and goals are different than -- but just as valid as -- those of men.
Other important feminist literature like A Room of One’s Own, Herland, and The Yellow Wallpaper will illustrate women’s issues for you in great relief. Understanding these differences can erode the fear you have for women and replace it with an abiding respect and admiration.

, Some people think women are best suited to simply being mothers or wives and doing domestic chores. When you see that women are just as capable of greatness as men, you’ll be less likely to think of them as another, separate category unto themselves.Think of a professional field and think about all the women who have contributed to it. Seeing accomplished women will help you realize that they can inspire you as much as a man can. Conversing with talented women can expand your horizons.


Women artists include Mary Cassatt and Georgia O’Keefe
Women scientists include Marie Curie and Carolyn Porco
Women politicians include Margaret Thatcher and Elizabeth Warren

, While society tends to reinforce the idea that beauty is of paramount importance to a woman’s identity, this is not the case. Women can be tall, short, fat, thin, and conform to various notions of beauty. Beauty is “in the eye of the beholder,” after all, and is defined very differently in different cultures.


Instead of immediately being scared off by a tall or very beautiful woman, try calmly introducing yourself to her. Say something like, ""Hi, my name is ___."" As the conversation progresses, focus on the topic at hand, not the way she looks.

, Being a materialist means you only care about the superficial things in life, like being beautiful and having money. Not all women pursue men who are rich simply because they want money. Lots of women are not attracted to the most handsome, buff guy; some prefer funny or introspective men. Others value kindness and a warm heart. Recognizing that women don't share a single set of values and goals will help you revise your stereotyped image of them and thus, overcome your fear.


Try to get over your fear of women by approaching every woman with an open mind. Don’t create negative associations between one woman and another based solely on gender. Ask yourself how you’d like it if a woman judged all men’s worth and value by comparing them to thugs and criminals.
In actual fact, men are more materialistic than women, placing greater importance on status and wealth."

Be yourself.Being honest about who you really are and what you think is a skill few possess.,
Use friendly body language.,
Talk about what she wants to talk about.,
Try talking to women with a friend or in groups.,
Don’t talk to women who are rude and uninterested.Make it a point to only talk to women who are friendly and polite.,
Make sure you’re not taking things the wrong way.,
Be patient.",How to Get Over Your Fear of Women3," It is very important to treat all women as human beings and as equals, not just as potential wives or girlfriends. You might be apprehensive about talking to women because the ones you usually try to talk to are the ones you’re very attracted to and have a hard time conversing with naturally. But if you talk to more women, not just the ones who seem like potential dates, you'll get a lot of practice talking to women which you can apply to the rest of your life. After all, 50% of people on earth are women; you’ll need to talk to some of them at some point.


Talking to women should not always be with some ulterior motive in mind like getting a date. Talk to women as you would any other (male) friend. Consider your conversation with women as a mutually beneficial exchange through which you can grow as a person.

, Being yourself will put you more at ease around women. If you put on a show in order to overcome your fear of women -- engaging in braggadocio or bravado -- you will eventually be found out, plus you’ll be unhappy since you’ll feel obligated to constantly be the person you initially pretended to be.


For instance, if a woman is really into Western films, you should not pretend to also be into Western films just to impress her or make her think you're cool. Use your ignorance as an opportunity to let her wax poetic about High Plains Drifter. Ask lots of engaging questions like ""When did it come out?"" and ""Who starred in it?"" The conversation should be an opportunity to learn about the other person and their interests as much as an opportunity for you to demonstrate who you are.

, Instead of crossing your arms or looking down at your feet, look women in the eye and keep your hands in your pockets or at your sides. Greet everyone with a smile.When telling a story or a joke, use your hands to emphasize and illustrate what you’re saying. A wag of the finger or an open, upward-facing palm are two examples of common hand gestures used when in conversation.

, Don’t just focus on yourself or your likes to the exclusion of her interests. Conversation should be a two-way street. Find out what movies, books, music, and media she likes. Does she like to travel? If so, where to? If you don’t know what she’s interested in, just ask. Don’t get hung up on topics, either. If either of you are ready to talk about something else, jump into the next phase of the conversation.


Ask for clarification when she’s explaining or describing something. “Where was that, exactly?” or “What do you mean by that?” are good questions to get deeper into conversation with a woman and show you’re interested.
Recognize signs of boredom during a conversation: answers that are short, impersonal, superficial, and delivered in a deadpan manner. If a woman grows quiet and her eyes glaze over, you might want to change the topic or invite her to take the reins of the conversation. Ask “What do you think of that?” or “Have you ever tried that?” to keep her engaged., Going out to talk to women with a friend or two can make the process of meeting and talking to women easier. Ideally, you’ll head out with someone who has different strengths or conversation techniques than you do. Use the firsthand experience to learn from your friends, and ask for pointers. Head out to bars, clubs, and parties with your friend to get practice talking to women.You don’t have to meet women in traditional dating settings in order to overcome your fear of them. You could start out talking to women in online forums or chatrooms, then later move to face-to-face interaction. Try meeting women at book clubs, coffee shops, and on inter-gender sports teams.

, Even if a woman isn't interested in your romantically, there are very gracious ways to make that known; she doesn't need to treat you like an annoyance. If she rolls her eyes at you, barely answers you, and acts generally rude, excuse yourself politely. Don’t let anyone act as though they are too good for you.


For instance, if you offer to buy a woman a drink and she sneers, ""From you? No thanks!"", simply shrug and walk away. Nobody deserves that kind of treatment.

, Sometimes we take comments that were meant only jokingly to heart, especially when they’re from the opposite sex. Before getting hurt or upset, try to rethink the context of the conversation. If you’re hurt by something a woman said, tell her. Chances are she didn’t mean to hurt your feelings., You might get blown off a few times. You might get nervous and need to bail occasionally. No big deal! Stick with it and don’t be discouraged. Eventually, you will successfully talk to a woman. When you do not effectively talk to women, don’t blame yourself or dwell on it. Think of the conversation as practice, not as a failure. Try to learn something from it and don’t over-analyze any one conversation.


It’s hard to know sometimes why a conversation didn’t go well. Try different approaches when talking to women. Talk to women by meeting them on their terms. Be funny in one instance, and reflective and thoughtful in another.
Think about the woman you’re talking to: is she a deep thinker or is she more interested in superficial conversation? Match your conversational style and approach to the personality of the person you’re talking to.

If he drops something on the street, help him pick it up. If he isn’t sure what to order at a bar, make a suggestion. Little favors like this won’t freak him out but will definitely make him notice you. Empathetic statements work really well too.For example, if he is complaining about his job say something like. ""I could see that being really difficult. How do you handle that day by day?""

, Flirting is a time-honored way to get someone to notice you. Make little jokes or tease the person. Try complimenting him in an indirect way. Flirt with him partially with body language and partially with the things you say. Try to maintain eye contact and smile at the things that he says. Move closer to him in a non-threatening way and open up your body towards him. If you’re sitting on a couch close together, don’t be afraid to let your knee slide over and touch his. Ask the person questions and find out what he is interested in. You should try to be genuinely interested in what he is saying.For example, if you’re ordering drinks at a busy bar try saying “could you help me out here? I think the bartender might notice a cute guy more quickly than he’ll notice me.”

This will make you more confident and therefore more attractive.

, If in spite of all you have done to encourage his interest, he does not come up to you, he might just be in a relationship with another girl or plain disinterested in your friendship. Don't feel disheartened because something better must definitely be in store for you.

, If a guy shows enough interest in you you are raring to go and have a rocking relationship!

Minimize the importance of negative responses.,
Develop a fear of regret.,
Get rejected.,
Laugh about it.",How to Get Over Your Fear of Women4," This can best be accomplished through a strategy known as emotion-focused coping. Emotion-focused coping is the process of recognizing that while you cannot change the situation you are in, you can change the way you react to and feel about it.Change the way you feel about being rejected by understanding that women who reject you don’t understand you, may be just having a bad day, or are already romantically involved with someone else. In other words, you don’t need to take it personally.

, The possibility that you could miss out on a great opportunity to talk to or date a woman is more frightening than the prospect of rejection. There’s nothing worse than realizing how different your life could be if only you’d gone out and talked to women more often or earlier.Imagine your life as a branching path. At one point in your life, you chose to talk to a certain woman, then you fell in love, got married, had kids, and lived happily ever after. In the other scenario, you spent your life afraid of talking to women and spent the rest of your days free and unencumbered, but alone. Which would you prefer?

, The only way to make a sword is to put the metal in the fire. Being rejected in a truly painful way will only make you stronger after you get over it. Once your heart has been ripped out by being rejected by a woman you really care for, future rejections, by contrast, will seem less intense.


Don't take your rejection personally. Recognize that the rejection has to do with the other person's faults and feelings, not yours.It's okay to feel disappointed when you've been rejected, but don't react with anger or violence against yourself or others when you've been rejected. Yelling or throwing things, for instance, are both unacceptable. There will be more opportunities for you to get over your fear of women in the future, so don't let a few rejections get you down.

, Finding something funny about your rejection may be hard, but it’s an effective way to get over it. When you laugh and smile, you release endorphins, natural painkillers which relieve stress and make us feel good.After you get rejected, try to find at least one funny thing about the situation.


It helps if you have a friend along with you to review the experience. Ask your friend, “Wow, did you see her face when I asked her if she wanted to dance?” Being sarcastic, but not bitter, about your experience can help too. “Well that went well,” you might tell yourself after a harsh rejection.

Start off by introducing yourself, if you don’t already know her.,
Maintain positive body language.,
Do not boast.,
Be a challenge.,
Avoid being overbearing.,
Be humorous.,
Act naturally.,
Listen to her.,
Notice all of her good qualities, both physical and intellectual.,

Understand her sense of humor and pop culture interests.,
Find activities that you both enjoy together.,
Never tell lies to her.,
Show her that you are always there for her.,
Share your dreams with each other.,
Show affection.",How to Get Close to a Girl," Make sure that you choose a very good and appropriate moment to first approach her. If you pick the right moment, you’ll be able to present yourself in the best light possible. Remember, first impressions are everything. Consider the following:


Avoid moments when she is busy or distracted.
Avoid inappropriate moments like during a lecture or exam.
Try to take advantage of a moment when you’ve naturally come into contact with her, like when both checking out in the lunch line, or in the library.;
, Introductions are important, so don’t botch this up. Make sure your introduction is memorable and smooth. Put a little forethought into it. Consider:


Quickly telling her something interesting about yourself, so that you’re more memorable.
Asking her simple facts about herself, if you don’t already know.
Don’t keep her too long, if either of you are in the middle of going somewhere.
Comment about your surroundings., Body language is extremely important when people make their first impressions of others. You want to do everything you can to come across as an interesting, relaxed, and likeable person.


Make sure to smile, when appropriate.
Avoid fidgeting.
Avoid crossing your arms or other nervous or threatening postures.
Maintain good posture: stand up straight, don't hunch your shoulders forward, and hold your head up high., Boasting can be a really big conversation disaster. While it’s both a good thing and very tempting to try to talk yourself up when you initially meet her, this could be dangerous. You don’t want to come across as a braggart, as arrogant, or as overly confident. However, you do want to show yourself in the best light possible.

, Avoid sending her the message that you’ll do anything to be with her and you’re essentially a pushover. Try to find the middle ground where she knows you want to be with her, but she knows she’s got to work a little bit too if she wants to be with you. There is no real formula for this, and you’ve got to feel it out as you get to know her.


Don’t play petty games like “if she doesn’t call me, I won’t call her.”
Avoid making your schedule completely open to her. After all, you’ve got your own friends and family, and they are important, too.
Give her time. Don’t return calls immediately (unless appropriate) and don’t expect phone calls back right away. Relax, and let things develop over time., You don’t want to come across as the person who is obsessed with her and will do anything to be in her life. Give her space when appropriate. Remember, if she likes you and wants to be close to you, she’ll probably do something to send you signals or to reciprocate your interest and feelings.


Don’t call her every day.
Don’t ask her out every weekend, unless she suggests that she wants to go out, too.
Don’t invite yourself to events where she’ll be, and try to work yourself into her social activities., Humor makes most people more relaxed. Most people also like to be around others who are humorous or funny. Humor might relax you, too, and you might seem less awkward or nervous. But remember, you don't need to be a comedian, just add in humor wherever it seems appropriate. , Above and beyond all else, act naturally and be true to yourself. You don’t want to make yourself into someone completely different just to get close to the girl that interests you. You want someone who will like – and maybe love – you for who you are. If who you are makes it so she doesn’t want to be close to you, that’s okay. Maintain the friendship, but move on and find another romantic interest. Everything will work out for you in the end., Listening is the most important part of forming a relationship with anyone. This is because most people enjoy talking about themselves, their problems, and their interests. You’ll do very well by quieting yourself and listening to the girl that you’re interested in dating.


Be conscious of how much you talk and how much you talk about yourself.
Ask her questions about herself and what she thinks.
Pay attention to what she says, and avoid day dreaming., People like to be noticed, and they like to think that others think highly of them. Take some time to notice the little things about her or even the small things that you just love about her. This might be the way she smiles, the way she laughs, and more. Figure out what she's good at (it could be sports, academics, her job) and what she takes pride in. This is an important part of moving to the next level, because it will send the signal that you’re interested in more than just friendship.


Feel free to compliment her; tell her you love her eyes, or that she has an infectious laugh. Try to avoid focusing on her body, which can be uncomfortable for girls.
Let her know you've noticed when she is good at something or when she takes pride in something., After you've gotten to know her generally, you should invest more time in finding what makes her a unique person. Engage in long discussions. Consider the following:


Talk to her about her aspirations and what interests her.
Discuss people who influence both of you.
Find out what drives her and who and what she cares about the most.

, One of the most important things about growing close to a girl is understanding when and why she feels certain ways sometimes. Pay attention to her. Know what makes her happy, what makes her sad, and why she feels the way she does about things she cares about.


Is she grumpy in the morning? She may not be a morning person.
What makes her most happy? Is it spending time with family or friends?
Does her job or school make her happy or miserable., You've already had your chance to be funny and share your humor. Take the time to form an understanding of her interests and sense of humor.


Talk to her about what she likes watching, what music she likes, and what she thinks is funny.
Watch TV together, and pay attention to the shows she likes.
Invite her to a comedy club or a movie and ask her to pick the performer or show., Finding activities that you both enjoy will help you form a deeper relationship and connection. It will help you understand what you both have in common. It will allow you to watch how she interacts with others. It will also help you work together as a team. Consider:


Letting each of you rotate picking the location/activity of a date.
Each proposing an idea and then choosing which one suits you as a couple.
Trying a different activity each date to test as many possibilities as you can., Be honest about who you are and what you are like. You don’t want to build a relationship on dishonesty and deception. Such a relationship would just be one that would falter and fade later.


Don’t lie or embellish your reputation and your achievements.
Be honest about what you like to do for fun and what interests you.
Be honest, but don’t be blunt or insulting. If she asks you a question, don’t blurt out whatever you are thinking. Answer her questions truthfully, but tactfully and carefully., You need to work to demonstrate that you are more than just a fairweather friend. You’re there for the good times and the bad times. This will signal to her that she is an important part of your life.


Talk to her and console her when she does poorly on an exam.
Offer support when there has been a death in the family or a divorce.
Bring her small gifts when she's sick or down.
Ask her how she's doing when you see her. If you notice something is bothering her, ask her if she want's to talk about it. But don't push too hard., Try to spark some conversations in which you can share your dreams with each other. This will be important as it will help you learn more about each other as individuals. As a result, you should be able to grow closer to each other.


Spend a date, like a picnic, talking about where you both want to be in 5, 10 and 20 years.
Talk about where you both want to live, ideally.
Talk about your career and family aspirations., Show affection when and if it is appropriate to do so. Showing affection might help draw you closer to each other, and will signal to her that you care about her and want to take your relationship to the next level. If she reciprocates, you'll definitely know that you've been successful. But be careful and consider:


Showing affection may include hugs, snuggling, kissing, and even thoughtful and loving looks and comments.
Only show affection if it is appropriate to do so, and if she consents and is enthusiastic.
If she rebuffs your affection or tells you not to do so, stop immediately. She might not be ready, so give her time and be sure to move at a pace that is comfortable for both of you."

Remember the CUFF rule!,
Be friendly!,
Be yourself!,
Flirt with him.",How to Get an Older Boy to Like You in Junior High1," Confidence, Uniqueness, Friendliness, Flirty. These 4 tips will get a guy drooling over you.


Be confident! Every guy likes a girl whose comfortable in her own skin. Be cheerful and happy about who you are and don't change drastically just for him to like you. Chances are, he'll notice the change and shy away.;
, Be open and kind-hearted, that way he'll feel more comfortable around you. He'll be attracted and won't be scared away. Shy boys tend to be too scared to approach you, so be kind and show him that you are okay with him asking you out.

, If he doesn't like you for who you are, then don't bother to go for him. it's hard but if you want a true and stable relationship with someone, he has to appreciate you for who YOU are - not some fake person you pretend to be around him

,

Touch his shoulder or arm lightly when you talk






Nudge his foot while talking with him, this will show him that you are interested






If you are close friends, mess with his hair. It's really cute when you do that






Find an excuse to touch him whenever you two are talking.







"
"
Introduce yourself.,
Learn things about him.,
Talk about yourself.,
Use social media to your advantage.,
Try to see him on a regular basis.,
Look your best.,
Use your connections.,
Don't frighten him.,
Include him in your circle of friends.,
Make him feel special.,
Be subtle.,
Don't discuss your plans with other people.,
Make it more obvious.,
Touch him more.,
Leave him wanting more.,
Ask him out.",How to Get a Man Addicted to You," This might sound ridiculous, but it is very important. First, you want to be sure he's really that perfect man you think he is – not just a handsome face for your idea of Prince Charming – and you also want him to know you exist! So take a deep breath and go talk to him.A very simple ""Hi, I'm..."" will do. Try to sound as normal as possible. Talk to him as you would talk to someone you would like to befriend – seducing him will come later.;
, If you want to hook this guy, you need to learn some things about him – what he likes, what he doesn’t like, what he does for a living, what some of his hobbies are. The more information you know about him, the more tools you’ll have to use in your quest to win his affections.


If you find out things he likes, you can bring up your shared interests in casual conversation. That way, he’ll know that you have things in common and he’ll begin to think about doing some of those things together.
For example, if you find out that he likes to play golf, casually mention your trip to the range with your dad last weekend.
Additionally, if you get a guy talking about something they are passionate about, they’ll feel good about it and later relate those positive feelings back to their experience with you., A good way to learn things about someone else is by seeing how they react to what others say. So, tell him some things about yourself and see how he reacts. But don’t get too personal right away. This can be off-putting.You can also talk about sports, movies, music, politics – whatever. Just engage him in a conversation so you can learn more about him.

, Add him on Instagram and start engaging with him there. Like a few of his photos to begin with, but not too many. Once you are following each other, like some of his selfies so he knows you appreciate the way he looks, but be sure to like some of photos that are indicative of his interests too.If he starts reciprocating with likes and comments, it is a very good sign for you. At this point, you should pull back a little bit so that he will start wondering where you are and why you haven’t been liking as many of his posts. Give him an occasional like every now and then, but be very cautious about overdoing it.

, OK, now he knows who you are. Don't worry if your first time talking to him wasn't perfect because you're now going to try to be around him more and start to pique his interests. Put yourself in his path when you know he’s going to be somewhere.Be logical: would you at all have a sentimental interest in someone whose existence you are only marginally aware of? Well, that's the way he feels about you at the moment.
Repeated exposure to you will increase his feelings for you. If he was attracted to you initially, the attraction will only increase the more he encounters you.Some good ways to spend more time around him are to start frequenting his local venues (bars, restaurants, book stores, etc.) or to try to get invited to some of the same social events as him.

, While looks definitely aren’t everything, they can be a very big part of attracting a person initially. For this reason, it is important that you try to look your best when you are putting yourself in his way. Even if you are dressed casually, wear a little makeup so he’ll think you are a natural beauty. Make sure you smell good too so that he’ll associate you with smelling good in his mind.And remember that everyone loves a great smile. So remember to flash him a grin when you see him., If you have common friends (friends, not random acquaintances. Otherwise it'll be too suspicious), try being around them more – and if he comes, talk to him. Answer what he says, react. Don't push yourself forward too much, but try to make him feel like you're a person worth knowing.If your two circles of friends don't cross, don't lose hope! Be strategical. If you see him alone at lunch, invite him to join you at your table. If you see him in the corridors, try having a conversation with him.

, Don't follow him everywhere he goes; don't join every club he's in. Be nice and cheerful when with him, but your encounters must not be forced. If he suddenly sees you everywhere, you'll scare him. This is one of the most difficult steps – finding the right balance. But you'll manage eventually.Don't turn into a stalker, but be open and friendly. The feeling you must convey is of interest. That way, he'll feel comfortable if he wants to get to know you a little bit more.
Some good behaviors to avoid are showing up where you know he’ll be too often, calling or texting him repeatedly, liking or commenting on everything he does on his social media accounts, or visiting his place of employment too often.
Remember: you can't force time. He'll come your way if you maintain those dispositions of friendly interest.

, Now that you're a bit more than just vague acquaintances, the next step is becoming friends. Lots of people say this might be a wrong move, but most of the time, this is not the case. It will help you to avoid the main risk, that is to say, to make him fall in love with a person you are not. Among your friends, you are yourself – and if you want him to be addicted to you, you have to be your true self from the beginning.


Moreover, becoming friends will help to see how much common ground you have. If you go on being warm, friendly, and interesting (which you undoubtedly are) you'll become friends in the most natural way possible.
Remember: how did you befriend all those people you're surrounded by? Well, if it worked for them, it'll work for him too!

, Once you are friends, you want him to know he's more than just ""one of the guys"" for you. Don't make it too obvious, but try to make him stand out a little. Don't tell him your biggest secret ever – you'll scare him – but do slightly odd things that show you feel close to him or that you thought of him.For example, if you don't share your feelings easily, try telling him things like, ""Well, I feel a bit blue today."" Or if you talked about some kind of sweet he liked, try to bring him a piece of it (and one for yourself, too).

, What you want is him slowly wrapping his head around the fact that you and him have a lot in common. By showing him trust and giving him a little more attention than your other friends, he will subconsciously register that something's happening.Don't make it too obvious. If we take the first example again, don't tell him, ""OMG I feel so depressed. I'm so sad, it's awful,"" because you would scare him: he wouldn't understand why, suddenly, you began talking that much about yourself. Everything must be natural. A bit odd, perhaps, but never forced.
Try telling him a story first (when it is just the two of you) that you plan on telling your other friends later. It will make him feel special to know he heard it before the others. Or try touching him just a little bit more than you touch other people. You could touch his arm while you are talking to him or give him a hug when you see him.

, For one, you'll be less embarrassed if it turns out you're not that into him. For two, you'll avoid awkward situations like: ""Is this the one?"" in the loudest voice possible when he's just a few meters away. You'll also avoid your friends trying to give you a hand. They mean well – but it often ends in disaster.


You can feel comfortable telling other people (including your friends) only if they don't have even the remotest chance of meeting him or if one of the steps described here cannot physically be achieved without their collaboration. But otherwise, you're on your own on this one.

, After a safe amount of time spent in this intermediate zone, you can proceed to the next step. This amount of time will vary depending on the guy: you'll have to feel when it's safe to move on. Basically, you'll know you can go on when he starts giving you some extra attention too. Now, it's time to enter the very-near-to-flirt zone.


Tell him things like ""I miss/missed you,"" ""I saw/made/met... and I thought of you.""

, Lean on his shoulder if you're tired, for example. At this point, you must have reached a level of confidence between you and him where it's possible for you to do such a thing.


Physical intimacy is essential: it will allow him to start questioning his feelings. But don't go overboard; at this point, he's still only your friend. Physical contact must therefore be occasional.
Always have a plausible reason: tiredness, feeling blue, or needing a hug. Once again, it is essential not to scare him.

, Never make it absolutely clear that he is the one you want. Guys like to fight for what they want. So, make him chase you a little bit. Let him know that you’re interested, but don’t be so available that he thinks you have nothing better to do.Don’t respond to his texts immediately. Don’t answer the phone every time he calls. Don’t be available every time he asks you out.
Ignore him only a few times; the risks are if you ignore him too much, there will be trouble coming in the long run. The up side is his heart will be questioning whether you like him or not.
Don't seem available all the time after you've gone past your ""friend stage."" This will make him miss you and wonder what is going on in your life. He will know he's not the only subject on your schedule, leading him to care and love you more and more.

, Perhaps he'll do it himself – in that case, congratulations – but perhaps he won't. In that case, don't panic. Remember it's just as hard for boys as it is for girls. If he doesn't ask you out, it doesn't mean he doesn't like you. It might mean he's scared.Drop hints like ""I'd love to see this movie but, alas, all my friends have seen it already."" And if he still doesn't ask you out, well... do it yourself. Gender roles are so last century.

Pay attention if he sits with his legs pointed towards you.,
Use your own body language to show you like him.,
Talk to him!",How to Get an Older Boy to Like You in Junior High2," If so, he may be attracted towards you. Does he stare at you often? Does he look genuinely happy when he's around you? These MAY be signs that he likes you.

,


Always face him
Stare at him and if he catches you, sweep your eyes up and down his body a few times then smile at him slyly. This will show him you're definitely interested.
Flaunt your body once in a while.
Smile when he comes near you.

,

When he comes into the room, onto the bus, into the library, ect., say a simple greeting to him. If he responds enthusiastically, then he likes you. If he responds awkwardly, then maybe you should find another boy....






Say Goodbye to him when he leaves, this will give him a chance to remember you.






Talk to him when you have the chance, comment about the weather, his clothing, school, ect.






Compliment him! Every guy loves to be complimented, say how great he looks in his jacket, or that black looks wonderful on him. Maybe say that you love his new hair cut or his new shoes. Don't compliment him too often though, or else he may not treasure your compliments. Do it once in a while so that he finds it very precious and special.






Sometimes, he may express his feelings about other girls to you. He may say something like ""That girl really likes me and I just... don't really like her."" Or ""That girl is really pretty."" This could be good or bad, it could mean he sees you as a good friend who's like 'one of the guys' and probably doesn't look at you romantically, or it could mean he wants you to get to know him and he wants to get to know you, and is not afraid to open up to you.

If he points out that he doesn't like a girl who likes him, it COULD be a way of showing that he is not interested in other girls, but he is in you. Don't get TOO excited when he talks about other girls to you, because it could be a sign you are stuck in the friend zone.

Observe your date's face.,
Notice his eye contact.,
Watch his chest.,
Peek at his legs.,
Be mindful of his hands.",How to Read Men's Body Language for Flirting1," Most flirting starts with facial expressions. Here are a few things to watch for in your date's face:


The head tilt. If your date tilts his head slightly when he looks at you, you can bet he's subconsciously showing you he likes you.
The eyebrow flash. In other words, watch for your man to lift his eyebrows when he looks over at you. Though subtle, men tend to lift their eyebrows quickly when they see someone they're attracted to .
Flared nostrils. Often, a man's nostrils will flare slightly when he's interested in a woman. This gives his face a more ""open"" expression and betters his chances of appearing attractive to you .
A flirtatious smile. There are a number of flirtatious smiles a boy can flash at you when you're just getting to know each other:

The sneer. While this can come across as cute and coy, it's often an indication that the boy just wants something physical. This half smile is meant to look mysterious and alluring without inviting you to get emotionally attached.
The closed mouth smile. This is usually construed as a good thing; he's into you, but he's shy. Don't be surprised if he takes a while to open up to you.
The smirk. This one is easy to get confused with the closed mouth smile. However, generally the smirk will come from one side of the mouth, whereas the open mouth smile will be the same on both sides.

;
, If you have just met, he may look away every time he catches you looking at him. As you get more comfortable together, you'll notice stronger eye contact and gazes that last longer than a couple seconds.

, A man keeps his torso pointed towards the most important thing in the room . Therefore, a man who is interested in you will keep his chest and shoulders pointed at you, even if he is looking in a different direction.


Note that this also holds true for his pelvis. If you're standing apart and he keeps his pelvis pointed at you, even when he turns, he's probably interested.

, If he's standing with his feet set wide apart, he's trying to look powerful and show off for you.

, If he hooks his hands on his belt loop or pockets, he may be trying to subconsciously move your attention to that part of his body . Likewise, standing with his hands on his hips is a subconscious way for your date to look powerful and sexy for you .

Unless the situation is downright tragic, people are always looking for positive and welcoming reinforcement. Smiling is the world’s most powerful and universal gesture for doing so. By smiling, you send out a positive and happy image to those around you.Smiling has actually been found to increase your own happiness and mood as well as the moods of others. This can go a long way in making people like you, as no one wants to be around someone considered to be moping, negative or brooding. Spreading some happiness by smiling can go a long way in making people like you.;
, Wash your face, bathe on a regular basis, get those tangles out of your hair and don’t forget to brush your teeth. These are all things you can do to make sure your body is clean. People like approachable people, and the easiest way to come off as approachable is by being clean. Get a regular routine going and you’ll begin to see results when it comes to people liking you.


Cleanliness can help take care of one of the most important senses regularly affecting nearby people: smell. The sense of smell is closely related to memory and emotion. Certain smells – mostly used by the perfume industry – bring about feelings of desire, power, vitality and relaxation. Others, such as the smell of smoke, fire or rotten food, are universally viewed as bad due to their warning of danger. Make sure your smell matches the vibe you’d like to give other people., Use clothing to make a strong first impression to people. Wear your hair, top, bottom and shoes in an interesting way to make yourself memorable. Utilizing fashion will allow you to be both a novelty and a conformity to what they already know, creating both inspiration and familiarity. In other words, people can appreciate when you take something they know and use it in an interesting way.Research has shown most people make a decision about another person within the first seven seconds. The rest of the time during the meeting or conversation is usually spent justifying the initial reaction. Don’t let your lack of fashion sense become a reason for them not to like you – make it a reason for them to like you.Always dress for the occasion. Sure, a suit and tie or a fancy dress will always look good for evening occasions or at the workplace, but they may not always fit the situation at hand. If you’re working out at a gym or going out in a casual setting, dress how you normally would and add a personal touch. There’s always a way to make each outfit your own., Ask questions to get people to talk about themselves. No matter whom you are talking to, people are always an expert on one subject: themselves. People are naturally egocentric, meaning they love to talk to themselves. Find out about interests, hobbies and passions and you’re sure to get subconscious brownie points. Since you’re engaging on something they love, they’ll leave the conversation thinking you’re simply the coolest.Talking about one’s self actually activates the same pleasure centers of the brain as food and money. Give that opportunity to people you meet and they’ll be sure to come back for more., Actively listen to what people are saying during a conversation. Chances are, you can mentally note subjects that have come up in conversation and use them as other topic points. Also, if the person sees you genuinely care about what they have to say, they will be more likely to come to you for more conversation, thus increasing your likeability.


Use verbal confirmation during conversation to show you are listening. Verbal confirmation is a big portion of actively listening and is easy to perform. For example, if someone is telling you about a new type of pasta they’ve tried, repeat that in the form of a question to keep the ball rolling. Be sure to name specifics if they come up., Always meet the gaze of the person you’re talking to. Not only do your eyes show that you’re listening, but that you’re paying attention to every ounce of their persona, be it their facial expressions, hair, gestures and more. Eyes can create a bond and feeling of intimacy almost immediately.


Visible eyes during a conversation have been found to create a sense of cooperation among participants. In other words, eye contact promotes a sense of social bonding between people. If people feel like being around you helps both you and themselves, they’re more likely to return to you for conversation., People love the sound of their own name. Use names as often as you can – without overdoing it of course – to earn friendship points with people. Naming people is a sign of respect and importance and sure to make a lasting impression. Not only will reusing the name help you remember it, but also pat the ego of the person whose name is being said. Don’t overdo it. Only drop the name when beginning a new statement in the conversation in addition to the initial greeting and final goodbye. The last thing you want to do when getting people to like you is scare them off!
Remember names. Studies have shown that remembering someone's name activates their brain, allowing them to pay attention more. It also shows them significant amounts of respect in addition to making them feel good. Face association - a full examination and mental notes about a face - as well as consistent repetition go a long way in making sure you remember names., A quick way to make people like you is to have fun and interesting stories to share with them. Sharing stories not only provides an opportunity for humor, but also shares various aspects of your personality. It’s been a tried and tested part of social bonding for as long as language has been around – use it to your advantage!Have a couple of stories you feel can apply to every situation on hand at all times. The more you tell these stories, the better you’ll be at telling them further along down the road. You’re going to want to entertain your newfound friends at some point, so be ready with an engaging and humorous story.
Make sure your stories are appropriate. If you always stick to one type of story or tell something not appropriate for the setting you're in, you may give the wrong impression. The last thing you want to do is tell a story to make people around you feel uncomfortable, threatened or persecuted. You also wouldn't tell people you're trying to impress a story involving something you've done illegally (no matter how fun or exciting it was). Tone down any and all subject matter to ensure you make a good impression.

, When you’re talking to someone, smiling and nodding can go a long way, but be sure to also use subtle forms of body language. Turn toward people when they’re talking to you. Mirror their stance if standing and turn your body partially toward them no matter what the situation calls for. This lets them know you’re fully engaged with what they’re saying.Standing toe-to-toe with someone or facing him or her fully can often come off as more intimidating than engaging. Save this for further along down the road after you’ve gotten to know them. This can help give off the right impression. The last thing you want to do is come off as threatening.
Avoid crossing your arms, fidgeting with your hands, or crossing your legs too tightly when talking with people. This can often send signals that you’re anxious or dwelling on something else when talking. Make sure people know you’re comfortable, open and listening to what they have to say. This can go a long way in a long friendship.

, Bring up previous conversation topics or aspects of a conversation. If someone mentions their family a day prior or earlier on in the day, bring it up again after you’ve had time to fully assess what you can bring to the conversation. This will not only show that you’ve been listening, but that you care about what the other person has to say.


When recalling conversation, the topics do not have to be big and life changing. In fact, studies have shown that recalling the smaller details often have a bigger impact on the people you talk to. Did they mention they were eating out over the weekend on Friday? Ask them where they went and what they got on Monday. These will provide more fruitful conversation topics later on down the road., Eventually open up about deeper interests, passions and issues happening in your life. However, do not do so immediately. Likeable people know when to share their personal problems and confessions. To do so too soon can often result in being labeled a complainer. Let the other person guide you. The end result is an intimate bond and more personal friendship., Don’t be afraid to ask others for their opinions, feelings and advice on any subject. Asking someone for their opinion on a particular issue, be it a popular radio hit or a jealous ex-girlfriend, opens up the conversation while also garnering interest.Asking for advice also helps your newfound friend warm up to you. You’re leveling the playing field and asking for them to cope. Even if people do not like you, asking them for a favor and subsequently returning it can put their actions against their initial beliefs, resulting in what’s called cognitive dissonance. Their actions (being nice) go against their brain activity (not liking you) and correct it. This was a method used by Benjamin Franklin in confronting bitter rivals., Don’t be afraid to give compliments. Praise their looks, performance or intellect regularly. People crave appreciation almost constantly. Doing so can provide positive reinforcement and genuinely make the other person feel good. Making others feel good is key to being well liked.Make sure your praise is also warranted and authentic. Empty flattery is often seen through. The last thing you want to do during your quest to be liked and loved is come off as a liar. Most people do not appreciate being sucked up to and their needs pandered to, as it’s often not genuine.

, Make others feel like they matter. Congratulate their accomplishments. Ask what’s going on in their life. Let them know you think they have a lot to offer. We tend to like people who like us, as we reinforce each other’s egos. The key is to not provide empty flattery.Tip: External validation has even been cited as an addiction because of how good it feels. Be sure not to become the go-to person for validation unless you know exactly what you’re getting into. Be sure to ration it out as sparingly as compliments and praise.

Try going up and talking to him and making your interest obvious. You don't have to have a full-on conversation at first, but just start making contact. Every time you see him, say hello, and introduce yourself if necessary.


Remember that you're on the clock, so look for an appropriate time to talk or have a chat if you're going to have a longer conversation.Smiling and ""checking out"" this guy can also help to get the message across. You don't have to be lewd, but if you're interested in a little flirting you can make it clear.;
, Everyone likes to hear their own name spoken aloud in conversation. Using someone's name a few times while you're talking is a good way to show that you're interested in the person, not just in what they're saying. Using someone's name shows that you care and want to dig deeper.


Don't overdo it. Every sentence doesn't need to end with his first name.

, It can be hard to strike up work conversations sometimes, because it's the one thing you're positive you've got in common. If you want to get a guy to notice you, though, it's a good idea to try to figure out some subject that you can both talk about, completely outside the world of your job. This can bring coworkers really close together and can be a great way to make a friend.


Look for clues. If your coworker is wearing a shirt from a band you like, or drives a car that you've always had an eye on, that is a perfect opportunity to strike up some conversation. Comment by saying, 'Wow! Great shirt. I saw them at such and such festival last year"" or ""I'm so jealous! That's my dream car.""

, Want to find out what you have in common with this guy? Ask. The easiest way to get someone to open up is by putting the ball in their court and asking them questions to get to know them better. If you like this guy, show an honest interest in his life and find out more about him by asking.


""What's your favorite thing to do on the weekends?""
""Where did you work before this?""
""Where are you from originally?""
""Where do you go to school?""
""Who's your favorite Beatle?""

, Compliments are another great way to strike up conversation. It can be as simple as liking the color of their shoes or noticing that they got a haircut. People, not matter who they are talking to, love a sincere compliment.


You can also comment on something that they are wearing, music they are listening to, the car they drive, or anything else.
Just make sure it's sincere. Over-doing it on the compliments can make you seen inauthentic and fake., It may be a cliché, but that's because it works. The more you try to be someone you think that person will notice, the less confident you will be. If you try to guess what you think he may or may not like, you are relying entirely on his approval for you to be ""good enough."" You don't have to be someone you're not.

, You don't need to attract this guy in the first couple hours of the day. Remember that you're going to be seeing a lot of each other, probably every day, and you can give this budding flirtatious relationship plenty of time to develop. You've got time on your side.


Some guys won't take the hint at first, either. At work, some guys are pretty focused on doing their work. Likewise, some guys might not be into side conversations at work, and might seem uninterested. This doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't like you, just that he's trying to focus on his work so he can finish for the day and go home.

, You may think it's exciting to be the work fling, but this almost never works out for you in the long run, and can cause a lot of pain and frustration. Starting a relationship with cheating makes it difficult. Not to mention that you would be working hard for nothing, if they are happily taken.


It's also important to make sure it would be appropriate to flirt with this guy. Both superiors and subordinate employees can cause conflicts if you attempt to start a flirtatious relationship. Even coworkers can get a little awkward if things go sour.
If you don't know, just ask. ""Do you have a partner?"" isn't an awkward question. It's the kind of thing people talk about at work.

, Your most attractive traits are always emphasized by confidence. You don't need to look any particular way at work to attract a certain guy, and it's important to focus on your own comfort and style. Always keep in mind the dress code at your job and keep it professional.


Emphasize your natural beauty. Instead of trying to fit a mold you think this guy would like, amp up the goods that you already have. Looking nice will definitely help. If you have your own style, flaunt it in a tasteful way. You want to catch his eye, but a major turn-off is being explicit. It's a fine line.

, A little physical contact can be instant and electric, increasing intimacy and making you closer. If you want to increase the attraction between you and a coworker, finding an excuse to touch a little can be a great way to pull him in. Just touch his shoulder when he makes a joke, or give him a hug when you're leaving for the day.


Remember you are in the work place, so keep it PG. There is little wrong with a brush of the arm or a touch of the shoulder, but keep anything else for after work.
If he's not into it, don't go grabbing someone. Only reach out if you get a positive vibe back. Never approach someone unsolicited.

, Offer to help him with something that is not necessarily in your job title. This can be a a great way to show that you are a nice and caring person, and is also an excuse to spend more time with him. In the same sense, you can ask him to help you with something as well.


Never use your position to manipulate things, or promote someone who doesn't deserve it. This will hurt your credibility in the workplace.
Make sure you stay focused on your work as well. Don't work together if it's going to affect your productivity.

, The best time to get to know someone at work? After work. Typically, you'll only get a little bit of time during breaks to make jokes, or will only have a few chances to actually work together. Most of the time you'll just be working. If you want to get to know someone a little better and get him to notice you, do it after work.


Invite a group of people to get a drink after work, or to grab a bite to eat somewhere. Invite this guy specifically, and get a chance to talk.
If you have work-related holiday parties, or other after-work functions, see if you can ride together, or just make a point of hanging out at those parties.

, At some workplaces, it's not appropriate to date coworkers. If it is permitted, it's often required that your relationship be declared to the HR department, so the two of you will be separated for the most part while you work.


If your relationship would be controversial or problematic at work, you've got the option of deciding to go forward with it anyway and avoid telling anyone. This can be very difficult to actually pull off nowadays, especially with Facebook and other social media. It's always better to come clean and deal with the consequences., Even if your relationship is permitted, it can be awkward for your coworkers to know that you're in a relationship with someone else that you work with. If you want to let your coworkers know, it's a good idea to tell them as soon as possible after you've started seeing someone at work.

, When you're at work, focus on your work. When you have time off, then you can spend your time dating this guy. Make sure you don't spend time at work sneaking into the broom closet, and your relationship will be better for it. Don't let your relationship or your job suffer because of this relationship.

, It can be tough to be in a relationship with someone you work with, because you've got no time apart. You see each other in the evenings, and during the day at work. Make a point of spending some of your time apart, devoting plenty of time to your individual friends, instead of spending all your time together.Seeing each other at work and taking a lunch break at the same time doesn't constitute a ""date."" It's important to make time for each other outside the world of work.

, One of the most awkward things that can happen is to go through a break-up with someone that you'll have to continue seeing every day at work. If you try to date someone at work, talk about what will happen when and if you do decide to break up. Would one of you switch jobs? Would you be able to keep things civil? Have an honest and open conversation. Talk about it like the professionals you are.

Pay attention to his touch.,
Hugging.,
Watch his hands.,
Look at his posture.,
Gauge his giggle-factor.,
Take careful watch when he is standing near you.,
Notice proximity when you sit next to each other.,
Comparing his body to yours.,
Look deep into his eyes.",How to Read Men's Body Language for Flirting2," A man who is interested will find any excuse to touch you. This could be anything from simply touching your arm when you say something funny to reaching over and brushing an eyelash off your face.



Where he touches you is also important. If your date is trying to flirt with you, he'll make a point to touch your back, upper thigh/arm, or your sides.He also may try to grab your elbow to guide you through a crowd, showing you and everyone else that he's with you. , When you hug, is the duration of the hug longer than 5-10 seconds? Platonic hugs are usually about that, but if he's holding on longer than that, it probably means he doesn't want it to be a 'just friends' hug. If he lingers and holds on a little when you pull away, you know he doesn't want to let go.


This may change based on the two people's comfort level, but if he gently strokes your back or sways a little while you hug, he probably really cares about you. He may also try to hug you so that your arms go around his neck and his arms around your waist. Waists are fascinating to guys because they don't have them, so he'll want to hug you around the waist.

, As a man begins to flirt more, he'll start to use his hands more, too. He'll get more animated and use more gestures when he speaks. He'll also start to fidget more and use his hands to fix his hair, clothing, etc. Here are some examples of behavior to watch for:


He fixes his hair. Watch him when you get up to leave a room. Do his hands immediately fly up to fix his hair? Smoothing or ruffling his hair is a sign he's trying to look good for you. He touches his face. When humans are attracted to someone, their skin (especially on their face) becomes more sensitive. Therefore, look for him to continuously rub his chin, cheek, or lips. He may also lick his lips or take frequent sips from his drink.
He rubs his stomach. While this can be a sign of insecurity, there's a good chance that it also means your man is trying to get you to notice him. He smooths his shirt or pants. This form of preening can mean both that he's nervous and that he's trying to look his best for you.
He offers you his hand palm-up. If you're at the hand-holding stage, pay attention to the way he offers you his hand. If his palm is facing up, he's hoping to connect on more than just a physical level., This is a tricky one, but if your man usually has good posture, look for slight slouching around you. This indicates not only that he feels comfortable around you, but also that he wants to take you into his arms. , Does he laugh easily around you? A man who is attracted to and comfortable around you will laugh more easily than a man who couldn't care less. In addition, he may try harder to make you laugh or get you to notice him. If your date is exceptionally silly around you or exceptionally loud when you're in the same room, you can bet he's hoping you find him as funny as he finds you.
, He may try to move in closer when you don't seem to be watching to test if you feel comfortable around him. In normal conversation, a man will be 1.5–2 feet (0.5–0.6 m) away from another person. If he is closer, you can take that as a sign that he's attracted to you.

, If your calves are pressed against one another, if he leans in very close pressed against your shoulder to whisper to you, if he leans his head on yours or on your shoulder, if he nudges you or lightly pushes you, these are all signs he's interested in you.

, It may sound creepy, but does he hold out his hand to compare how much smaller your hands are to his? Is he fascinated by the difference in your leg-torso proportions and his? Does he look at your feet when they are next to his? If he is interested in you as a person, he'll be interested in your body as well as it is one component of who you are. Depending on the guy this might come off as either an almost child-like curiosity about your body to the other extreme of a more 'checking-you-out' kind of sexual vibe. This should hopefully be a clue to if he likes you as a person or just your body.

, Does he blink frequently? Do his pupils dilate around you? These are both indications that he's interested in you. In addition, he may return your long stare. Long lasting, comfortable (not piercing) eye contact is a sign that he wants to get to know you.


Notice the pattern in which he looks at you. If he moves his eyes in a triangular pattern (eye to eye to nose/mouth), he likes the way you look. . This is also true if he lets you notice him checking you out.

If you want to be approached, it's better to stay as casual as possible. Try to match your dress style to your personality.Give people who look at you some indication of who you are as a person without even having to know your name. If you want to be approached, this should at least make you more compatible with the people you attract.


For instance, band shirts are a great thing because they advertise something (in this case, music) you are passionate about. The same goes for other kinds of merchandise. It offers an opportunity for someone with similar tastes to approach and compliment you.;
, Body language can be used to your advantage. In the case of wanting to be asked out, body language is essential. It lets someone know subconsciously that you are potentially interested, and that you want him to come to you. Body language often goes hand-in-hand with flirting in this regard.If you're interested in a guy, position your body to face him directly. This will signal to him that you're interested.It's commonly said that women twirl their hair when they're talking to a guy they're interested in.
Positioning your body to face the guy you're interested in is a good way to show interest.

, While many will see taking care of their body as a way to look better, the more important benefit lies in the way you feel. A lot of the way you feel emotionally has to do with your physical health. Give your body the respect it deserves. Healthy living tends to lead to a lot of other great things. Expect a better mood. While health doesn't direct relate to being asked out, it can make a huge difference in attracting someone.


Exercise is a great way to strengthen your body and mind. Exercising at least a couple of times per week can alleviate stress and actually give you more energy than you'd normally have.Eating well has a major impact on the way you feel in your day-to-day life.Even if you don't want to go for a purely health-conscious diet, it doesn't hurt to cut out the worst things and replace them with something better. The way you feel should be worth losing the junk food.
Many people get less than 5 hours of sleep per night. This will leave you irritable and dependent on coffee for energy. Try to get between 6-9 hours to ensure you're well-rested throughout the day.

, Don't be afraid to prolong your eye contact. It may feel uncomfortable, but it's an almost surefire way of expressing your interest. While a normal face scan lasts three seconds, anything longer than means that someone is probably interested. If you hold someone's gaze, you can let him know you're interested without ever having to open up your mouth.


Eye contact alone may go a long way, but girls can make it even more inviting by batting their lashes while staring.People tend to blink more when they're looking at someone they're attracted to.
Eye contact should be kept light-hearted. You don't want to come off as creepy to someone. Remember to smile when you're looking someone's way. The way eye contact is received also depends on whether the guy thinks you're attractive.

, Smiling can say more than words. If you haven't met someone, a smile can let him you are interested in getting to know him.You may be shy to smile at first, but there are very few people who won't appreciate the positive attention of a smile. Smiles are best when they are natural. Fake smiles may come across as creepy, so do your best to be relaxed when you first smile at someone.


Smiling is best used with eye contact. That way, there's no doubting whom that smile is aimed at.

, Some girls will feel put off by the idea of showing their attraction first, but if you want to get a guy to ask you out, you have to let him know you're interested. Light touching is a good way to show your attraction once you've started a conversation. A playful touch on the arm or a prolonged hug can express attraction just as well as saying ""I like you.""Light touching should be kept very casual, and you should only do it if the conversation you're having is fairly light. It won't have the same effect if the conversation is depressing.

, Some of the world's most beautiful women report having a hard time getting asked out. Why? Because they often intimidate men and inadvertently scare them away.The most important thing if you want to get asked out is the make yourself approachable. This can be done by staying relaxed and casual.


The best way to actively get around the issue of approachability is to give guys an open invitation to approach you. If you ask a boring question, like ""What is the best thing to eat here?"", it gives the other person an opportunity to spark up a conversation with you on friendlier terms., Whether it's apparent or not, a lot of people deal with feelings of sadness on a daily basis. Some may even struggle with depression. Depression is nothing to be ashamed about, but it's undeniable that a glum mood can hurt your chances of being asked out. If you struggle with negative feelings or self-doubt, it is a challenging (but not impossible) process to weed those bad thoughts out. Make a habit of stamping out bad feelings, and practicing gratitude for the things you already have in your life.You shouldn't be trying to conquer something like depression purely for the sake of being asked out, but it is something that will become easier to manage once your inner demons are silenced.


Confide in friends if you're struggling with any feelings of self-doubt. Chances are high your friends would do anything to help you out, and an earnest discussion about vulnerable things can make a world of difference.

, Even if you're only talking as friends (at first), a conversation is necessary if you want to be asked out. It doesn't matter what the conversation is about. All that matters is that good energy is being shared between the two of you. You don't have to worry about being the best conversationalist. Be an active listener, and empathize with what he tells you.Ask questions about things you are interested in hearing about, and respond to questions you are asked. Be proud of who you are. The other person is bound to get interested in time.


Look to your surroundings for a conversation starter. For example, if you're striking up conversation at a concert, you might ask: ""Which band are you here for? Are there any songs you're excited to hear?""
If being shy is your thing, you can do lots to get him interested in approaching you for a conversation. Flash him a smile and hold his gaze. If he's available, he should get the message.

, Sometimes, the reason a guy won't ask you out is because he's unsure as to whether you're interested in him yourself.The way to get over this hoop is by dropping hints that you like him. This can be done through playful flirting, or taking an active role in interacting with him. Everyone likes to feel wanted, and you will make him feel wanted by keeping a conversation going.


In conversation, playful teasing shows you're interested without having to tell him outright.
Light, playful touching (like touching the arm) is an example of physical flirting.
Compliments can be seen as flirting, especially if you're complimenting the guy on something you're normally attracted in, such as his looks or his intelligence.
Text messages and phone calls can also be flirtatious.

, Whether or not you are doing the asking out yourself, making things specific in a conversation means more of the other person's attention will be focused on you. Making things specific also offers more natural ways for the other person to ask you out. Bringing up specific people and places that somehow relate to a dating scenario gives him a chance to ask the question without feeling like he's jumping the gun.


For example, if you want him to ask you out on a movie date, don't just say you want to see a movie. Specify which movie you want to see, especially if you already know he wants to see it too. This gives him a specific opportunity to pop the question.

, You don't stand much chance of being asked out unless people think you are fun to be around. Light-hearted behaviour (like flirting) puts others in a better mood and opens an invitation to be asked out.Even if you're not typically a cheerful person, putting on a bright face invites good things into your life.


This can sometimes be done as simple as making the conscious choice to show a brighter side of yourself.

, There are sneaky ways of directing a conversation to make it seem like he was the one that asked you out. You can do this by working a conversation in such a way that it seems like he's indirectly asking you out himself.While this is technically manipulative, if there is attraction and chemistry between the two of you, he won't be complaining about it.


For instance, you might ask something like: ""Are the any great sushi places nearby?"" When he gives you an answer, you could respond in turn by saying ""That sounds great. When should we go?"" This way, it makes his suggestion seem like a veiled proposal to go together.This is easier to do if the two of you are already playful and have chemistry. It's also quite easy to botch if the chemistry is not there. If it doesn't feel natural, you might be interpreted as being needy.

, This isn't always the case, but it's a good idea to understand that some guys may be taken aback if you ask them out. Guys may be put off if a total stranger suddenly asks them out. If a girl asks out a guy she already knows fairly well, it will seem much less odd.

, If you insist on waiting for someone to ask you out rather than doing it yourself, you have to be patient. You are agreeing to play on their terms, and not everyone is going to jump into things quickly.Whether you're a boy or a girl, if you decide to put in the ball in the other person's court, the best thing you can do is play it cool.


At the same time, this also means not putting your life on hold to wait for the person to ask you out. Do the things you love to do, and don't be afraid to leap into another relationship if you think the person is taking too long to ask you out.

, Girls may be waiting a long time for a guy to make his move. If you're not ready to show your feelings directly, asking someone out on a casual date like a movie or the beach at least lets the guy know you want to see more of him. Be specific with the plans.That makes it clear to the guy that you're not playing around and feel serious about it. If a guy didn't take the hint when to ask you out, being direct is sometimes the only way to get through to him.


Say something that lets him know you enjoy his company and want to see more of him: ""Hey, I've been enjoying talking to you a lot. We should go catch a movie sometime.""

, With some guys, their shyness may keep them from asking you out. In other cases, a guy may not be sure if you're interested. Jumping into making a move probably not a risk you were planning to make if you were expecting to be asked out, but it can end up resulting in a passionate moment for the both of you. Guys aren't usually used to a girl making a move on them, so it can be very flattering for them.Boldness can mean anything from a kiss to directly approaching and starting a conversation if you haven't done so already. One way or another, it will prove that you're confident.

, While you should make your feelings known and never just assume he's not interested, rejection is always a possibility. If you find out he's not interested in you, the best thing you can do is focus on feeling better. Remind yourself that it's perfectly okay to feel hurt. The pain is temporary. Before too long, you will run into someone else who catches your eye.


Don't take the pain at face value. Look into it and break down the pain. Positive self-talk won't make the pain go away completely, but it will do a lot.

See if he initiates touch.,
Notice his eye contact.,
Look at how he’s sitting or standing.,
See if he lifts his eyebrow while in conversation with you.",How to Tell if He's Flirting1," While touch doesn't necessarily guarantee that he's interested or flirting, there are definitely certain touches make it more likely. You want the touches that are more charged, and less ""friends.""


Friendly pat-on-the-back touch means that he’s comfortable and friendly with you, but not necessarily flirting. Likewise, high-fives, fist bumps are more likely a friendly action than a flirtatious gesture.
A lingering hand touch or a hug that goes on a little longer than with his friends are more likely to be signs of flirting, or that he's interested in you.;
, Eye contact is one of the biggest parts of flirting. It creates a charged between two people and it can mean that he can't take his eyes off you. Lingering eye contact, eye contact that goes on for longer than normal, is especially a good sign.He’ll want to look at you, especially if he’s teasing you (teasing is another good sign of flirting), this way he can see what your reaction is, or just admire how you look.
If he’s smiling or grinning at you, even better; flirting should be fun, smiles between two people can signal communication and interest

, People tend to subconsciously mirror the actions of those that they like. When you're with him, notice if he mirrors your actions, such as taking a sip of coffee a few moments after you do and so on.Notice things like: is he seated facing towards you? Does he make sure to keep in your line of sight so he can look at you? Does he lean forward when you speak?
If he’s facing away or looking elsewhere, turning away in a middle of the conversation, crossing arms or legs and pulling back, probably he’s not flirting with you.

, Men tend to raise their eyebrows slightly upwards when they're talking to a woman they're interested in. You'll want to observe what his eyebrows are doing when you're with him and when he's with other people to see whether it's different."
"
Notice whether he asks for your recommendations.,
See if he teases you.,
Notice whether he compliments you.,
See if he asks dangling questions.",How to Tell if He's Flirting2," A guy who likes you, wants to connect with you. This will mean borrowing books from you, taking movie or music recommendations. He may even turn this into a chance to get in a little verbal flirting, by teasing you about your choicesThis shows that he values your opinion and wants to connect with you on a deeper level. It also probably means that you've got awesome taste!

, Gentle teasing can be a big part of flirting, so a guy who is teasing you is probably trying to flirt with you. This means teasing you about something you're doing, or making jokes about your terrible sense of direction, for example.


He might also make jokes around you more often than normal, because he's trying to get your attention by making you laugh. This could be anything from making bad puns to making gentle fun of himself (his bad sense of direction).
Make sure that he isn’t saying mean or hurtful things. Teasing shouldn’t make you feel bad about yourself. He might be trying to flirt, but he's not doing it in a very kind way. Give this sort of guy a pass.

, A guy who's interested in you and wants to flirt is going to be paying attention to you. Complimenting can also be a part of flirting, especially if he couples if with teasing.He might compliment your appearance, your smile, what you're wearing, and so on.
He might also compliment you on things other than your appearance. Things like your writing ability, your story-telling abilities, your head for math, your skill with videogames, etc.

, These are the kinds of questions that keep you talking, as well as see if he can hang out with you more, or flirt with you more. Pay attention to whether he drops these into the conversation.


A couple examples of dangling questions are: “So you’re single because…” or “You’re doing what this weekend…”
These questions indicate his interest in your relationship status or whether or not he can see you, but in a flirtatious manner.

Pay attention to whether he’s around.,
See if he tries to impress you.,
Pay attention to whether he laughs at the things you say.,
Notice if he is thoughtful towards you.,
Observe how he treats you.,
See if he jumps to your defense.",How to Tell if He's Flirting3," A guy who's interested in you and who wants to flirt with you is going to be around. End of story. He's not going to be busy all the time, he'll make time for you. Even if he's shows his interest by ignoring you, he'll make sure to be ignoring you in person.


Remember, it's hard to flirt if he’s not even there. If he's never around, he's not likely to be flirting with you.
Even if he's not physically around, he'll make his presence felt by sending texts, calling you, and making sure to show up at the same things you’re going to.

, A guy who's interested in you and wants to spend time flirting with you might try to impress you. When he's doing or saying something ""cool"" he'll make sure to check in to see if you're paying attention to how awesome he is.


See if he tries to outdo his friends when he’s around you. He outdoes them in terms of the cool things he's done, he wants to outdance them on the dance floor (and show you what a good dancer he is), he wants to try out that new bike trick.

, A guy who likes you is going to laugh at your hilarious comments (even if they aren't that funny, especially if they aren't that funny). Your flirty banter is going to make him laugh, if he's into you.


Just remember, mean laughter is not a good sign. He can laugh at you when you're acting silly, but if his laughter hurts, run away from that guy. You don't want to flirt, or do anything else, with that guy.

, Again, a guy who is interested is a guy who is paying attention. If he's acting very kindly towards you, doing nice things for you, helping you out, there's a definite chance that he might be interested (especially depending on the types of things).


For example: if he brings you flowers, or a little something because he thought of you (even if it's something silly), that's a very good sign.
He also might do something like bring you soup when you’re sick. It shows that he's thinking of you and it shows that he's willing to help you out, especially if it's out of his way.

, This is a big one. A guy who has a flirty personality might be flirting with you, but that might be how he treats everyone. A guy who is looking to flirt with you because he's interested in you is going to treat you differently than he's going to treat other people, especially his friends.


For example: even if he’s giving lingering hand touches and flowers, if he’s doing that for all the ladies or gentlemen, then he might be flirting, but that’s simply how he operates. It’s probably not specific to you.

, There's nothing like a guy who steps in to take your side. If you're having an argument with someone, or someone is being mean to you, see if the guy takes this as his cue to help you out.


If someone is hurting your feelings does he step in? Even if he was teasing you earlier? This is a good sign that not only is he interested, but it goes beyond simply flirting.

Create a profile on a dating site.,
Chat with someone before meeting them in person.,
Connect with others through social media.",How to Get Dates As an Introvert1," Many introverts have difficulty being open and friendly to strangers or potential dates in person. Online dating gives introverts a way to meet and chat with others in a controlled way and decide how often they connect with others. It may also be easier for introverts to talk about themselves and chat with new people without the pressure of doing so face to face.You may make a profile on a dating site like Match.com or PlentyofFish.com or use a mobile dating App like Tinder or Bumble.
When making a dating profile, try to put yourself out there and describe yourself to others. Include a picture of yourself that you like and list some of your interests so people can get a glimpse of who you are.
You may even make a note on your profile that you are introverted by nature but open up over time. Being honest about this upfront could help you find someone who will be willing to invest time and energy into the relationship so they can get to know you better.;
, You can use online dating to get to know someone better before you meet in person, which may make you feel more comfortable once you have a face to face date. Strike up a conversation with the person on the online dating site and chat with them.Ask them about one of the interests listed on their profile and start talking. Test out the waters with some light chatting so you can come out of your shell a little and get to know the person.
You may end up chatting with the person over a period of time, becoming more and more comfortable with them as time goes on. Once you start to form a daily or weekly relationship with the person over online chatting, you may be comfortable enough to meet with them in person on a date.

, You can also use online social media platforms to connect and meet others who may be dating material. People’s social media profiles can often tell you a lot about what they are interested in and what they like to do with their time. You may end up following someone on Instagram or Snapchat that seems interesting to you.As an introvert, you may be nervous about asking someone out over social media. One option is to like or comment on their posts to get their attention. Over time, this could lead to online chatting with them or even an in person date.

Prepare yourself with rest and alone time.,
Get dates through an outgoing friend.,
Meet someone at a small group hangout.,
Connect with others through hobbies or activities you enjoy.,
Attract attention without making conversation.,
Give yourself time.",How to Get Dates As an Introvert2," For introverts, the socializing that is necessary when you go on dates can be exhausting. Prepare yourself for the date by getting plenty of rest the night before and by having some alone time.


Try sleeping an extra hour, such as by going to bed earlier than usual.
Before your date, spend some time alone in your room and do something that is enjoyable for you, such as reading a book, drawing, or listening to music.

, If you prefer to meet people in person but are not sure how to do this as an introvert, you may try reaching out to friends who are more extroverted or outgoing. Ask the friend to introduce you to someone they think might be a good fit for you or to set you up on a date with someone who is comfortable around introverts. Often, meeting people through friends will be less nerve wracking and weird for you as an introvert.You may also ask a friend who is extroverted to be your wingman/wingperson in social situations. This friend may go out with you to bars or clubs and bring you into a conversation with someone you find interesting. This may make it easier for you to then continue the conversation and feel comfortable hanging out with new people.

, As an introvert, you may be more comfortable meeting new people in smaller groups. You may try chatting up someone interesting at small gatherings at a friend’s house or when you are in a small group at a bar or club. This may feel less intimidating for you, as introverts tend to do better with one-on-one conversations or small group hangs, rather than big crowds.You may strike up a conversation with someone in a small group by asking them how they know the host of the party or how they know a mutual friend. You may also make a witty remark about your surroundings as a way to connect to new people and get them talking without having to resort to small talk.

, You can find people who may be dating material by chatting with someone in the same recreational class or team as you. You may take a class in a hobby you like, such as painting, sculpting, or woodworking. Or you may join a recreational team where you can do a sport you enjoy, such as a volleyball or soccer team. This could then expose you to other people who share the same interests as you.You may end up striking up a conversation with someone you find attractive in the same class or team as you. Talk about something happening in the class or a difficult play in the last game you played. Use your shared hobby or activity as a starting point for a conversation and go from there.

, If banter drains you, you can also attract the attention of others in non-conversational ways. You may wear unique clothing or put together outfits that show your personality and your tastes. Presenting yourself in a certain way may tell a person a lot about your personality, without having to even talk to you or be social with you.


You can also attract notice by doing art or otherwise putting your interests out in the community. You may paint, draw, write stories, or sing on your own. You could then post them online or share them with a few friends to show them how you feel and how you view the world. This could help you show your personality.

, Introverts often take longer to feel comfortable with other people, especially people they have just met. If you notice that you feel a little suspicious of the people you date, then keep in mind that this might just be part of your personality. Give yourself time to warm up to them.For example, you might consider going on a second date with someone even if you had a hard time connecting with them on the first date. You might just need to be around the person more than once before you start to feel connected and comfortable.

"
"
Choose a comfortable setting for the date.,
Practice before the date.,
Be upfront about your introverted nature.,
Ask thoughtful questions.,
Try to come out of your shell.,
Consider going on a double date with a friend.",How to Get Dates As an Introvert3," You may feel a lot of pressure and anxiety around an in person date with someone you like. You can calm your nerves by choosing a setting where you feel comfortable and able to be yourself. Suggest a restaurant you like and go to often or a spot in a public place that you find soothing and calming. This way, you are less nervous and able to be yourself during the date.For example, you may ask the person to go out for a coffee at a local coffee shop near your home so you have an out in case the date goes south. Or you may suggest that you meet at a bench in a quiet park so you can have a quality conversation and feel relaxed around each other.

, If you get nervous before a date and worry that you will be too introverted, you may practice before the date to loosen up and relax. Ask a friend to practice with you. Think about how you will start a conversation with the person and how you will keep the conversation going on the date. You may practice some conversation starters and remind yourself to be calm and be yourself.For example, you and your friend may pretend to go on a date. This will allow you to try out some conversation starters and get used to chatting with someone in a casual setting. You may then find it easier to chat on your date once you are in the mindset of being social around others.

, You may find it easier to be honest with the person about your introverted nature so you do not have to pretend or be more outgoing than you really are. Sometimes, being transparent and honest can break the ice and make you both feel more comfortable around each other. You may be surprised to find out that the person is just as nervous as you are and they may appreciate your vulnerability, especially on a first date.For example, you may tell the person, “To be honest, I’m pretty introverted so it takes some time for me to come out of my shell. But I’m glad we could get together.”

, Many introverts struggle with making small talk, where you talk about surface level things and don’t really get to know each other. You can try skipping small talk by asking the person thoughtful questions instead. This may allow you to get to know each other on a deeper level and feel less pressure to talk about superficial things.For example, you may ask the person, “Why did you leave the country for school?” or “What was it like living on your own?” Try to ask follow up questions once they answer you so they can tell you are engaged.

, Though you should ask the person thoughtful questions, you should also try to answer their questions with honesty and sincerity. Work on opening up and coming out of your shell. You may find this difficult at first but as you get more comfortable around the person, it should get easier to do this.You may need a few dates with the same person to feel you can be yourself and be less shy. Be okay with this and be patient with yourself, as it may pay off if you end up finding someone who accepts and appreciates your introverted nature.

, Introverts sometimes feel more comfortable when they are with people who they know and trust.If you are worried about having a first date with someone on your own, then you might consider setting up a double date with a friend.


For example, if you have a close friend who has a boyfriend, then you might consider arranging to go on a date with her and her boyfriend plus your date.

Know when to make your move.",How to Woo a Girl," This can seem scary to do, but once you have done this, holding a conversation and laughing will be easy, and you will be able to build a friendship. There are lots of different ways that you can break the ice, but just remember to make a good first impression. You don't want her to remember you for being a jerk or making a really offensive joke!


A good laugh is always a smart way to break the ice. For example, you would show this webpage to her, and have a laugh over what is written and the whole idea of having such a page as well.
Learn to be spontaneous. Taking an improv acting class can help with ideas for breaking the ice, and can help you be confident with talking to new people. Ideas flow, and it becomes easier to enter into and disengage from conversation, and can help you be more comfortable with any situation.;
, Girls love guys with a great sense of humor. Don't be offensive or mean with your humor, because you'll make her worry that you also say bad things about her when she's not around. Instead, be smart with your humor. Look at comedians like Louis CK and Aziz Ansari for some examples.


This doesn't mean you should never take anything seriously though, or else you'll come off as a clown.
Try to know her a little bit more before you attempt to be jocular (certain jokes for you might not be funny to her). Knowing her culture, her background, and most importantly things she likes will also be helpful.

, Fashion isn't just for girls... it's for guys to be recognized by girls too. Get a good pair of shoes. A pair of nice jeans will also look cool...just make sure they fit and look nice on your body! Same goes for shirts.


Don't just buy one outfit. Clothes should never be worn more than twice a week.

, Smell is incredibly important in attracting people. While smelling amazing may not be a deal breaker, being stinky is! You'll want to take some basic steps to fight all of the normal body odors that come along with being human!


Shower often, and not just with water. Actually use soap give yourself a good scrub to help keep your skin healthy. If you just came from PE or playing a sport, this step is going to be extra important. Some women are attracted to the smell of fresh sweat, but anything more than a few minutes old will scare them away!
Get a basic clean-smelling or citrusy cologne or body spray. Use it only lightly. It should be a hint of smell, not a cloud. If you use just a hint, she'll want to lean in to smell you more...a cloud will keep her 5 feet (1.5 m) away!

, You have to remember that girls and women are often subject to violence and are often cautious around guys for this reason. You have to make them feel comfortable if you want them to get the chance to know you. One common mistake is to be a little too much on the stalker side: being too familiar with the girl and too clingy. You have to give girls space. If you stalk them and cling too much, they'll feel harassed and they will start to avoid you.


Be close, keeping in touch every once in a while, but remember she has friends and doesn't (or shouldn't) want to hang out with just you. Dropping cute text messages once a week or so is okay, though.
Compliment her in a non-stalker way too. If she's wearing an interesting necklace, say ""That's an interesting necklace"" or ""That's a cool necklace"" NOT ""I always like your necklaces"".

, Everyone has a talent. Develop yours or learn a new one, because talents are super sexy! You'll be sure to get her attention with your skill. Just be sure that it's something you can be passionate about. The passion is the real key, because it makes girls hope that you'll care about them as much as you care about your craft.


Think about learning to play an instrument. Girls love guys who can serenade them by playing music.

, Nothing is sexier than confidence. However, nothing is as unattractive as arrogance or more annoying than a needy lack of self-esteem. This is why it's important to know what real confidence looks like. Confidence is being willing to be weak or wrong but press forward anyway because you know you can get through it and be a better person in the end.


When a man is really confident, he doesn't put himself down. He speaks up and gives and defends his opinion. He makes friends and is willing to talk to people he doesn't know.
A confident man is NOT one that constantly refocuses a conversation on himself or puts others down to build himself up. A confident man is NOT one who thinks he can do no wrong.

, Looking into her eyes helps tell her that you're paying attention to what she's saying, and she'll appreciate having someone that really listens to her. This also will subtly will make her see that you are really taking an interest.


Just be careful not to get lost in her eyes when she's talking, otherwise the only thing you'll have to respond with is ""Wow, you've got pretty eyes.""

, Cute teasing is okay. Something like mimicking how she talks or giving her a funny nickname like ""Giggles"" is fine and will create a playful relationship between the two of you. Going over the top, however, and constantly putting her down will just make her angry and she'll probably tell people that you're a jerk. This will result in anger and distrust — not exactly what we're aiming for.

, Let her cry on your shoulder if she's sad. Make her smile when she's feeling crummy. Listen to her when she talks and support her when she's going through a tough time. Women look for relationships with someone who can be their pillar of strength when everything else is going wrong, so show her that you really care for her and that you're up to the task.


Ask her how she's doing and try to notice her moods. If she's sad, comfort her. If she is mad, ask her ""What's wrong?"" If you think something's wrong, ask her but if she does not want to talk about it then don't press.
If you have little siblings, nieces, or nephews, show her that you really care for them. Play with them, watch over and protect them, show the girl that they look up to you.
Help others in front of her (although you should be helpful anyway). Help the poor and needy to show that how much you care for others. This shows her that you have a good spirit.

, Having a couple of things that you enjoy in common is really important for the success of a relationship. Some differences are good and make for excitement and opportunities for personal growth, but you'll need to at least learn to enjoy some of the same things that she does.


Explore one of her hobbies. Even if it seems really girly or not really your thing, you might end up surprising yourself. Lots of ""girly"" activities are great ways to reduce stress for guys too!

, Don't lie to her, even if you think you're doing her a favor. For example, if she asks you about how she looks in a dress that you hate, give a polite response but don't be rude and tell her that you hate the dress. Just say something like ""That's nice but I really liked how you looked in that red dress.""

, Girls want to be with someone that they know will be loyal and that they don't have to worry will just leave them for the next hot girl. This is partially because they want to feel like you really like them, not just how pretty they are or what they might do for you. While being with your girl, make sure your eyes are set on her and only her. It might be hard, but ignore the sexy girl at the next table.

, Treat her with respect. Make sure that you are not mean to her, ever. Girls simply do not accept that. You should value her opinion, listen to her, never put her down or insult her, and don't do things that you know are hurtful (like flirting with other girls, even when she's not there).


Don't say rude things about her behind her back. And certainly don't kiss and tell! Behavior like this will get out and you'll not only scare her away, you'll send other girls a message that you're bad dating material too, hurting your future chances.

, Some girls like a guy who leads the way to romance, some girls like to take hold of the reigns. Most enjoy switching it up every now and again. You have to be willing to take charge and make the first move if she's not doing it but you also have to be willing to accept her being dominant too. If you can't, then she's not the right girl for you.

, Take some ballroom classes to build your confidence, so you learn to lead a girl through a song. You can even teach yourself using online videos or even wikiHow! Girls love guys that can dance. You might even want to ask her to take dance classes with you, if you're already close or dating. This is a great bonding experience and will give you lots of reasons to hang out.

, Best friends are a great resource. If you can get close to her best friend, it can be a gateway to learn things about the girl. For example, every girl has talked with her friends about romantic things she wants to happen to her or maybe even a romantic movie that she really likes that you can take ideas from. You can use this information to give her something that is more meaningful than all that cheesy standard romance stuff.


Just be up-front with the friend. You don't want the friend to fall for you too! A good friend will be more than happy to vet the guy that's interested in her bestie. If you show her how great you are, she'll even want to help you two get together!
A good review from friends can only help you, while a bad review could put some serious doubts into the girl's head.

, When you are ready for the first kiss and the mood is right, lean towards her slowly, but don't shove your face into hers. If she doesn't back away, gently lean the rest of the way in for the kiss. Some tips say go halfway there, or 80 or 90 percent. Go with what feels natural for the moment. Going all the way can work, but it depends on the girl. Bottom line: lead the kiss, but let her come to you.


This will let her be able to make the choice about whether or not she wants to kiss you. This shows her that you respect her and value her feelings, making you both more likely to enjoy the kiss!
Impress her and show her you're a real gentleman. Don't ever kiss on the first date unless she is ready to.

, For example, for Valentine's Day (if you celebrate it) be sweet or thoughtful instead of showy and cliched. A dozen red roses may be the traditional romantic gift, but most girls will be happier with a few of their favorite flowers tied with a red, pink, or white ribbon. Actually remembering a girl's favorites will endear you to her more than any elaborate scheme.


If it's early in the relationship, though, and you don't know her favorites yet, get her a gift that symbolizes your feelings or reminds you of something that you've done or will do together. For example, give her peach-scented perfume and tell her that the smell reminds you of how each one of her smiles is like a perfect summer day.

, You can send a real romantic message by memorizing a poem and writing it to her in a letter or reciting it when the two of you are alone or in a romantic situation. You can also use quotes about love. Not only is this just the right kind of cheesy, but it shows her that you're willing to branch outside of your normal comfort zone in order to make her happy.

, Or, rather, it's important to know that you might never have a clear sign or perfect opportunity. This isn't a teen movie: it's real life. Girls will react in different ways, show their affection or lack of it in different ways...some might say nothing at all! All you can do is let a girl know how you feel as soon as you're really sure. You don't want someone else to come in and sweep her off her feet, so take a chance on love!

If you want to change your relationship with a girl from ""friend"" to ""lover,"" you need to distance yourself from her immediately. If you're spending all your time hanging out with this girl, it's possible that she doesn't think of you ""that way"" any more. Some people call this the ""friend zone."" If you want to get her attention, stop hanging out with her as much.You don't have to be mean to her, or try to ignore her, but just stop giving her the same kind of attention you once did. Be friendly, but don't go out of your way to talk to her, chat with her on IM, or run into her in the hallways. Just be casual.;
, She needs to see that you're turning the charm elsewhere, so she'll reconsider the way that she thinks about you. If you want to turn her on, she needs to see that you're a viable partner and a flirty kind of person. She needs to see you act differently than you usually act with her.


Make sure she sees! Try doing it in public places, like in the lunch room. Make a point of sitting close to her, but ignore her while you chat up her friends, or people she hangs out with. Make it seem like your eye is roaming around.
Do some Facebook flirting, which is its own kind of public. Start having funny exchanges with some girl that's in your class. Make sure they're both friends, so it shows up on her feed as well.
Worried about your flirting skills? There's no big secret. Just have light, fun, funny conversations. Teasing girls gently can be flirtatious. Don't be mean, just poke a little fun.

, If you start changing, she may start to think something is wrong and you might have to do a little work to make sure she doesn't get angry with you. Remember, this is your friend. You're not trying to hurt her. Make sure you're friendly with her when you are together, but make sure you pay more attention to other girls in your social circle.


If she asks something like, ""What's wrong? Are you mad at me?"" just be really casual. Say, ""Of course not! We're buds."" But keep doing the same things, and don't go out of your way to hang out with her a lot.

, If you're trying to get this girl turned onto you, slow things down a little. Once you've stopped hanging out and started flirting around with others, let that go on for at least a week or two, depending on how close you two were to begin with. Make sure to spend enough time that she gets the hint.


If you were hanging out with this girl every day, she'll get the hint a lot more quickly. If you only hung out every now and then, it might take a while before she sees that you've changed. Go with the flow and try to read her response.
Don't wait too long. If she gets the impression that you're not even friends anymore, she might move on from you completely and start dating another guy, or lose interest in you.

, After a while, you can start putting your plan into effect by hitting her up and arranging a hangout. After a period of not hanging out, you'll have made her feel like she'll have to do some work to get your attention back, since you've been cool to her lately. Sent a text or shoot her a message asking if she wants to hang out.


Ideally, she'll be the one to ask if you want to hang out. If she does, you'll be in a lot better shape. Don't cave at first, if she's been asking you to hang out for a couple weeks while you've been laying the groundwork. Now you know she's interested.

, When you do get back together and hangout, make sure it's something where you'll be able to be in private together. Ask if she wants to get a coffee together, or to go do something that might be considered date-like. This will give you the chance to make her think of you differently.


You just want to avoid doing something casual, like what you used to do. If you always used to hang out at one or the other's house and watch TV together, go out for a bite instead. You want things to be different now.

, Make a few little changes so she'll have a jaw-drop moment when you guys get together to hang out. Get a new outfit of clothes, get a haircut, and groom yourself. Make sure you're smelling good so she'll be able to look on your with different eyes. You want her to think of you as a potential date, not her regular old guy friend.


There's no specific way to dress to turn a girl on. Just wear what feels comfortable and what you think makes you look good. Maybe consider dressing up slightly. No ratty b-ball shorts and joke-message t-shirt. Wear a button-down that makes you look good.

, When you get back together, don't make it all buddy-buddy. Do something different than the way you normally talk to her. If you usually joke around and make crude jokes, have a more serious conversation. Ask her serious questions and open up to her as well.


Try complaining about your relationships with her. If you want to get her thinking about you differently, try bringing up the subject of dating and see how she reacts. Say, ""I've been so unhappy with the girls I've been seeing lately. I just wish I could find someone who got me like you do..."", You need to find out if she's attracted to you, or not. If she is, giving her a cooling period should have warmed her up to you considerably. She should be excited to be around you, just as you are excited to be around her. If you get similar vibes form her, then keep moving forward and try to turn her on some more. If you don't, call it quits. It didn't work. Move on.


If she scrunches her face up and looks confused, or continues to punch your arm like the good ol' buddy you are, this might not work. She's giving you signs that you're friends and nothing more. That's ok. But don't keep going and embarrass yourself.
If she's looking good and flirting back, it might be ok to move a little farther and see if she likes you enough for a kiss. Move slowly, but keep going., Check her out. Once you've let her cool off for a while, start giving her different sorts of looks. The kinds of looks she saw you giving other girls while you were ignoring her. Just smile at her and make eye contact every now and then, then look away like you're embarrassed. If she asks what you're thinking, say, ""Nothing.""


Don't be creepy and stare, just let yourself act the way you want to act with her. If you're feeling attracted to her, then look at her as if you enjoy it.

, A gentle touch on the hand or on the arm can be electric when you're flirting with someone. It can also be a quick and easy way to gauge how she reacts and see what she's thinking. If you brush her hand when you're talking, to emphasize something funny that she says, see how she reacts. If she smiles big and seems happy, good move. If she backs up, stop.


If you've gotten there ok, try touching her hair, or her shoulder. Just a quick caress. Don't make a big deal out of it and be creepy. Just keep it casual.
Again, this can come off a little creepy if she's unprepared or if she doesn't feel the same way. You have to lay some groundwork for this.

, It's always nice to know that someone likes you. If you want to turn this girl on, tell her so. There's some electric chemistry between you that you're feeling, and you think she feels it too. You don't need to treat this any differently than if you were with some girl that wasn't your friend. Just tell her you've been thinking about there a lot lately, and you've been thinking of her as more than a friend.


Tell her you'd like to kiss her and ask if it would be ok to do so, if you're feeling comfortable enough with her to try. She may say no, she may say yes. But at least you'll know.

, Sometimes, you're just not right for each other. It's not because you failed in the ""friend zone,"" and there's nothing you can do about it. It may just be because she doesn't like you in that way. It's ok. That may change in the future and it may not. But if you force the issue now, you may risk losing a good friend and embarrassing yourself. So know when to back off, if it doesn't go your way.


If she's not attracted to you, she's not attracted to you. Sometimes it's just as simple as that.

Just smile at her from across the room, excuse yourself as you brush past her, or just lock eyes, look away, and then look back at her after enough time has passed. You don't have to say hi to her the second you notice her; instead, you can spend some time making her curious about you first. If you already know the girl, of course, then don't play too hard to get and go right up and say hi to her. If you feel you have the confidence, why not introduce yourself?


Make sure to keep up confident body language as you approach. Keep your head up high, your gaze straight ahead of you, and maintain good posture as you approach her.
If you wait too long to say hello, she might feel like she's getting ignored.

, All you have to do is say, ""Hello, I'm Joe -- what's your name?"" Or, ""I'm Joe. It's nice to meet you."" You could also start by asking her about something you have in common, ie: a class you both share. When she responds and gives you her name, reach out and lightly shake her hand. Don't be awkward about it. Sure, it may feel a little old school, but it's the way mature people introduce themselves. If you already know the girl, you can just say hi and make sure to use her name.


Once you know the girl's name, use it a few times so she thinks that you're really invested in the conversation and care about what she has to say. Just once or twice is enough.

, Loosen up and let this girl see who you really are. If you're a goofy, funny guy, make her laugh. If you're more serious, talk to her about topics that are interesting and meaningful without being too serious instead of cracking tons of jokes -- unless jokes are your thing. Also, while you need to find out about her, you also need to tell her yourself so that she can get to know you. This is a part of being yourself. But whatever you do, make sure you don't spend the whole time talking about yourself, ask her about herself and even if you're not, you should act genuinely interested in her answer.


Remember that, while it's important to be yourself, you should hold back on the more eccentric stuff, the kind of qualities that make people say, ""You have to get to know him first..."" You don't want to creep her out! Try to talk about things she might be interested in as well.

, This can help a lot. It shows that you are enjoying the conversation and that you feel comfortable, which will make the girl continue talking with you. Try to have a natural expression that has your lips slightly upturned in a smile, and at the appropriate moments, smile bigger and grin. You don't have to smile the whole time, but smiling at key moments at the beginning of a conversation can make the girl feel appreciated. If she says something funny, laugh.


Smiling will put the girl at ease and will make her feel like you really like what she has to say.
Don't smile the whole time, obviously, or you'll look nervous, or even constipated.

, If you like the girl, then sure, the goal is to get to know her on a deep level eventually, but that doesn't mean you should talk about your grief over your grandmother's death or to describe the rash on your back in great detail seconds after you meet. Instead, pick light topics that are inoffensive and are easy to talk about, such as your pets, favorite bands, or hobbies, so that you don't make the girl uncomfortable before you really get to know each other.


Picking light topics to start off doesn't mean you have to pick boring topics. You don't have to talk about the weather just to avoid saying anything slightly personal. Unless you live somewhere where people are actually interested in the weather, then talk about it.
Follow the flow of the conversation. Sometimes two people really hit it off and start opening up to each other much faster than they would expect. If the girl starts opening up to you and really trusts you, you can hold back a bit less, too.

, Try to steer the topic in the direction of something you both care about, from your obsession with Community to your love of biking. You don't have to do this by asking her about her five favorite bands, types of food, hobbies, or forms of exercise; you can just listen to the natural flow of the conversation, and see if you can find something you both like, or if you can get her to notice something you like. For example, if you casually mention that you were coming back from the As game yesterday, then she'll respond if she's a big As fan, too.


When you're talking, make sure you ask open-ended questions instead of ""yes"" or ""no"" questions, so you can keep the conversation going.
Make sure to avoid awkward silences! Remember: things will only be awkward if you make them awkward, be confident and keep the conversation flowing as best as you can.
Don't despair if you feel like you have nothing in common. You'll be able to find something eventually if you keep up a fun conversation for long enough.
It may turn out that you don't have so much in common, but that you click because you have similar personalities or outlooks. That's great, too.
When you mention a band you like, ask her if she likes the band too; let her see that you care about her interests when you're talking about yours.

, This is another way to make her feel special. You don't have to stare into her eyes like you're searching for your own reflection and creep her out, but you should make a point of giving her all of your attention, and not looking down at your phone or scoping out the room to see if anyone more interesting has walked by. You can break eye contact every once in a while, but only to keep things interesting, not to show that you're bored.


Making eye contact shows confidence. If you make a point of locking eyes with the girl, she'll see that you're confident about getting to know her.

, Listen intently when she speaks. Girls like guys that listen to them and like what they say. Don't constantly interrupt her to state your opinion; let her talk and share thoughts with you. However, show that you're listening by nodding, saying ""yes"" or ""no"" at the appropriate times, and answering her questions.


Ask her what she thinks about whatever it is you care about -- your favorite music, the new fashion trends this season, or the importance of friendship.
Though it's important to ask for her opinion, try to avoid talking about religion or politics immediately, or you may get into an argument you didn't anticipate.
When she says something, make sure you respond and show that you're listening by rephrasing what she says occasionally. You can say, ""I completely agree with what you said about how hard it is to stay in touch with friends who move out of town..."" to show that you're hanging on to her every word.

, You should compliment an aspect of her personality or her looks without freaking her out to show her that you care. If you like her type of music, or the books she reads, tell her that she has great taste. It's all right to compliment her clothes, hair, or jewelry, but you'll really win a girl's heart if she sees that you're into more than just her outside. Also, if you're feeling super confident, why not compliment her in a flirty way?


If you're going for the physical compliment, don't do more than compliment her clothes, hair, or in more intimate cases, her eyes. It's not time to freak her out by telling her how hot she is before she even knows your last name.
If she has a great laugh, don't be afraid to tell her that.

, You don't have to bore her by asking about her favorite part of Algebra II; however, you can show that you're interested by asking her what her favorite subjects in school are, asking about her favorite teachers, or even letting that lead you to a discussion on what she wants to do when she gets older. Don't just nod and say, ""That's interesting..."" ask her why she likes a certain subject or why she wants to be a nurse or a lawyer when she grows up.


Some girls don't like talking about school that much. If you're sensing a lack of interest, just move on.
Don't make it feel like an interrogation. You can talk about the subjects you like, too.

, It's best to not tease girls about things they might take seriously, especially weight, looks, or intelligence. It's especially important not to make a comment that the girl can take the wrong way when you're just getting to know her. If you manage to deeply offend the girl at the beginning of your contact, it'll be hard to dig yourself out of that hole.


Err on the side of caution. Don't tease her unless you really feel confident that she'll get it.
Follow her lead. If she has been teasing you for a while, it's okay to tease her back. Just make sure to keep your jokes on the same light level.

, Girls like guys that make them laugh. Don't be afraid to flaunt your wit and sense of humor -- as long as you aren't too raunchy or inappropriate in the beginning. You don't have to start off with a series of knock-knock jokes to get her attention; just make sharp comments, fire back a quick joke if she has one, and make unique observations about the world around you that make her think. Don't overthink it. If you have a goofy or a cornball sense of humor, let her see it.


If you try a joke and she doesn't laugh, show her that you don't take yourself too seriously. Say, ""Maybe I'll have better luck next time..."" and it'll make her laugh.
If she makes a funny comment, don't just say, ""That's really funny."" Show her that you can make a funny comment right back, or laugh with her at it.

, A girl will be able to tell if you're trying too hard from a mile away. If you want to keep her interested, then you shouldn't relentlessly pursue her if she doesn't want to be pursued, compliment her ten million times when she's clearly uncomfortable, or show off by bragging about how much you can bench press or about the home run record you're trying to set for your county. Relax and stop caring so much about impressing her and you will actually end up impressing her more.


If the girl sees that you're comfortable enough with yourself that you don't have to try so hard to get her to like you, she'll want to talk to you even more.
If you flex your bicep, talk about what great shape you're in, or tell her how good you look with your shirt off, she will be nothing but turned off.

, Be confident in yourself and don't be afraid of saying something stupid. If you're not afraid then you probably won't. Just keep engaging her and be okay with the occasional awkward exchange, silence, or story that you had trouble telling the right way. Stay positive, relaxed, and happy, and she'll have even more fun talking to you. Don't be too self-deprecating, even if you think it'll make her laugh, or she'll think you have a low self-image.


You don't have to brag to be confident. You can talk about how much you love baseball without telling her that you're a star athlete.
One sign of confidence is being able to laugh at yourself. This will show her that you don't take yourself too seriously.

, If you're nervous, sweaty, or scared, the girl will be able to tell. If you're feeling nervous, just slow down your speech, focus on the dynamics of the conversation instead of every word you're saying, and stop fidgeting with your hands or looking around the room. If you're not relaxed, the girl will pick up on your tension and will feel uneasy as well. Take deep breaths, slow down your speech and movement, and think about the best case scenario instead of the worst thing that can happen.


If you're really nervous and it's painfully obvious, you can make a small joke about it to lighten the mood.
If you're really the nervous type, bring a bottle of water or soda around with you so you can sip on it from time to time to calm yourself down and to take small breaks.

, Talk to her honestly, and don't stretch the truth. The natural inclination is to embellish things, but it's much more trouble than it's worth. If you really get to know and like her and she eventually finds out you lied to her, it's extremely embarrassing to you and breaks her trust (and the relationship). You shouldn't be putting on an act whenever you see her, in any sense.


Even if she doesn't notice for a while, other people (and other girls) will notice you're acting more impressive around her.
If you want to see the girl again, then your lies will eventually catch up with you. If you want her to like you, then she has to like the real you -- from the beginning.

, People like hanging out with people who make them laugh, feel happy, and have a positive outlook on the world. If you're feeling grumpy or like the world is against you, then it's not the best day to approach a girl. Talk about the things and people that make you happy and focus on the positive experiences you've both had; when you get to know each other better, you can talk more about the negative stuff, too, but if you want to keep her engaged at first, then you should set a decidedly positive tone.


You can even catch yourself if you're having a negative moment. If she asks you how traffic was getting there and you say, ""Terrible,"" fix the negatively by saying, ""But I'm really loving this new audio book I'm listening to,"" or ""But I saw the cutest family of deer on the way over.""
If she asks you about a certain band that you really hate, you can say something like, ""I haven't really heard enough of their music"" or ""They're not my favorite, but they're pretty good."" Don't go off on a rant about how much you hate something when you're first talking to a girl.

, If you really hit it off with the girl, then you can ask for her email, phone number, or even just for her last name so you can be Facebook friends. If you're asking her out, you can be more blunt about it, but if you just like her and want to talk to her again, just say something like, ""I have to get going, but I'd love to pick up this conversation another time. Can I call you so we can do that?"" She'll say yes without hesitating.


If you're feeling more shy, get her Facebook or email, and send her something goofy with it--a link to a web comic she'd enjoy or a silly forum thread. It's also less awkward than the phone. It helps her notice you more and you have a better chance of meeting again.
Get her contact information just when the conversation is going great, and you're at your peak of finding fun things to talk about. Don't wait until the conversation drags to ask for her contact info, or she'll be less inclined to see you again.

Enjoy your date!",How to Talk to Girls Online," There are many websites and platforms to choose from that include ways to connect with girls. Consider online games, dating websites, or blog forums as possibilities when trying to find a girl with similar interests as you.;
, Wherever you choose to connect with someone, your online profile will be scrutinized. Be sure that you are presenting yourself in the best light by exhibiting the unique qualities that you would want others to perceive. When creating an online profile, be literate; bad grammar, bad spelling, and even text speak can be a huge turn-off to girls.


Remove any negative or disrespectful photos.
Delete posts that are disrespectful or inflammatory.
Post a profile picture that accurately represents your personality, Many people open conversations with “hey,” “hi,” “hello,” or “holla”, but these words are overused and not easily remembered. Using a unique greeting will ensure that you will be memorable to the girl you are talking to. Instead of the mundane greeting that won't make you stand out, try one of these openers:


“What's Up Wonderful""
“How are you today”
“Howdy”
“How’s it going”

, Now that you've started a dialogue, it's time to keep the conversation going. Avoid yes or no questions. Open ended questions specific to her, will encourage her to become engaged in the conversation. Find shared interests through online profiles and expand your conversation around common ground.


Ask “What types of outdoor activities do you enjoy?” instead of “Do you like sports?”
Build common ground with things like, “I got a dog in college, what animals are your favorites?

, Avoid seeming spammy by limiting your responses to one message for each one received. This is a way to encourage the conversation to move forward so that she wants to keep talking to you.

, Give her a compliment focused on part of the conversation or her personality. It is OK to have some fun with your conversation and show your sense of humor.


""Talking with you has been one of the best parts of my day.""
""Just when I thought everyone online was fake, I meet you.""
NOTE: Avoid complimenting physical appearances at this point. Phrases like “You’re hot” or “sexy” may seem like a good idea, but they give the impression that you are shallow and only care about looks. Use the information you have learned as the conversation develops to build the base of a fun relationship.

, Find common interests that you can relate to and share personal experiences. Do not dominate the conversation by making it about you, but keep her involved by showing you are interested in the same things she is.

, Express your happiness that you had the opportunity to talk with her. Let her know that you want to talk again by casually creating the opportunity to talk again. Try these lines and you can create an opening:


""This has been awesome. I hope we can talk again soon!""
""You mentioned (pick something from your conversation), I wanted to email you an article I found. What's your email address?""
""I gotta go, but I really want to hear more about _______, will you email me a link to your favorite site? My email is ______________.""

, Open up deeper conversations through email. You can create a stronger relationship by sharing personal stories or events from your life. Make a connection last by showing her who you are and being honest about your past., Keep her thinking about you by keeping up with what she's doing on social media and engage in conversations through comments and likes.

, Remember that she has a life too, and don't expect an instant reply to every email. It may take her a few days to respond to your emails, so be patient and let her respond before you send multiple emails. , Once you have exchanged four or five emails, it's time to bring the relationship into the real world. Ask her what her schedule is for the next week and pick a day that she's free. Tell her the time and place you'd like to meet, and be confident. She'll appreciate that you are able to make decisions.

, You put in a lot of work to get to this point in a relationship that started online. Be yourself and remember her interests from your early conversations to keep the date from going stale.


NOTE: Be sure you tell family and friends where you're going and when to expect you back just to be safe!

The other girl may initiate the flirting with your boyfriend, but your boyfriend may play a part, too. Try to look closely at their interaction to see if they're both flirting or if it's really one-sided.The point of analyzing the situation is to see how to better deal with it. Once you figure out who exactly is involved with the flirtation, you can decide whether to deal with just the other girl, your boyfriend, or both. It can also help you decide when to time any conversations you have.
For instance, if she's leaning in close to him, batting her eyelashes, or puffing out her chest, she's flirting with him, especially if she engages in flirty banter.
If he leans in close to her and encourages the banter, then he's flirting back. If he doesn't engage in the behavior with her, he's trying to shut down the flirting.;
, If your boyfriend's not engaging, focus on dealing with her in the moment. You can find tips on doing so in another section of this article. You don't have to get mean, but you can deal with the flirting in subtle but meaningful ways that will help get the point across.You can simply raise your eyebrows at her to let her you know what she's doing.
You may also choose not to deal with it. If you're out in public, you may just want to move on.

, If your boyfriend is either starting or engaging in the behavior, wait to deal with him until you can talk to him in private. That way, you don't start a serious discussion in public, and you can do it when you aren't so agitated., The easiest way to send a message to someone flirting with your boyfriend is to simply take her down with a look. Stare her down without a smile until she backs away. If she doesn't get the message, you need to move on to other tactics., When she starts flirting, let her know he's your boyfriend by physically touching him. Wrap your arm around his shoulders, or curve your arm into his, grabbing his hand. Lean your head on his shoulder. These subtle movements will tell her to back off., Another way to stake your territory is to use your words to emphasize you are together. For instance, if a girl asks what your boyfriend is doing next weekend, say, ""Oh, we're going to see a movie together. It's our favorite movie, isn't it honey?""Emphasizing ""we"" and ""our"" will help most people get the message.
Establishing other types of intimacy, such as having a shared favorite movie, also emphasizes you're together.

, If the girl is obviously flirting, one way to point it out without actually being mean to make a lighthearted comment about it. That way, you call attention to the situation, so you are doing something about it, but you aren't lashing out and creating a sticky situation.For example, say the girl is laughing too much at your boyfriend's jokes. You could say something like, ""Well, that was funny, but not that funny! He's always making bad puns.""

, If you don't want to cause a scene, you may need to draw her aside to talk about it. This tactic might work better with someone you know rather than a stranger. If she doesn't respond to other measures, ask if you can talk to her for a minute, then bring up the problem.For example, you could say, ""You may not realize that you're doing it, but you're flirting with my boyfriend. I find it really disrespectful, and I would appreciate it if you would stop.""

, When you become aware that your boyfriend always gets flirted with when you're in certain situations, maybe you should start avoiding that situation. For example, if you notice your boyfriend constantly gets flirted with when you go to the club, maybe it's better to skip going to the club all together.


Another option is to avoid the person. If it's someone you know who's flirting with your boyfriend, stop meeting up with that person if at all possible.

, Another option is to simply ignore the flirting. If your boyfriend is ignoring the girl, there's no reason that you can't do that, too. In addition, the flirting may make your boyfriend more excited to be with you, so you can enjoy time together later., Let your boyfriend know you want to have a conversation about your relationship. Telling him ahead of time lets him get prepared for the conversation, so you're not blindsiding him out of the blue. It also gives you a chance to pick a good time to talk.If you pick a time, it can keep you from blowing up in anger in the moment he flirts because you've had a chance to talk about it.
When you do talk, make sure you have some time to do it, and you turn off the electronics so you don't get distracted.

, Start the conversation from what you're observing and how it makes you feel. That way, you start out by helping your boyfriend see where you're coming from. You don't want to blame him, as that will just put him on the defensive. Focus on what you're feeling.You could start by saying, ""I notice girls flirt with you a lot. I like that you're attractive. It's one of the things that made me want to date you in the first place. However, it upsets me when you engage in the flirting instead of trying to shut it down.""

, You may know why flirting is a trigger for you. For instance, maybe you've had flirtatious boyfriends in the past who ended up leaving you or another girl, and therefore, when your boyfriend flirts, you're afraid he's going to leave you for another girl.You may need to spend some time thinking about the problem to figure out why the flirting bothers you so much. Often, it comes down to trust.
You could tell him, ""Flirting bothers me because my old boyfriend, Jake, used to flirt all the time, and you know he left me for another girl.""

, Now that you've started the conversation and explained how you're feeling, you should give your boyfriend a chance to have his say, too. For instance, he may not even realize he's flirting or maybe he didn't realize how much it upset you. Maybe to him, it's just being nice to other people.Pay attention to what he's saying, instead of trying to think of the next point you're going to bring up.
Don't just focus on your hurt. Listen to his feelings and intentions.
Nod and ask leading questions to get to the heart of what he's saying. For example, you could say, ""I feel like what you're saying is that you don't see flirting as a big deal. Why do you feel that way?""

, Flirting is often connected to jealousy. Maybe he's intentionally flirting because he wants to make you jealous. Maybe you're overreacting because you have a tendency to be overly jealous and protective. Open the conversation to see if jealousy is a part of the problem.For instance, you could say, ""I know I've been acting overly jealous. I think I have a problem with you flirting because I feel like I'm not enough for you.""
You could also ask, ""Do you sometimes flirt so that I will feel jealous? I only ask so I can figure out how we can fix what's wrong with our relationship that would make you want to do that.""
Let him talk about how he thinks jealousy is affecting his flirting to help continue the conversation.

, Once you've both discussed your feelings, talk about how you can make it better. You may need to compromise to figure out a solution that works for both of you, so that both of you have your needs met as much as possible.One way you could compromise is to reevaluate what you consider flirting. For instance, maybe you could start to see him having a friendly conversation with a girl as not flirting, even if you considered it flirting before, while if he's touching her or leaning towards her, you could consider that flirting.
Find ways to let him know when you think he's going to far. For instance, you could whisper in his ear when you think he's flirting too much to help get his attention.
Talk about it as it comes up. You don't need to have a serious conversation in a restaurant. However, when you feel like he flirted too much, try to talk about it within a day, so he can realize you're feeling hurt and help to rectify that.
Be more intimate. Sometimes flirting can come from a lack of flirting with you. Take time to hold his hand, kiss him, or dance with him on the porch. All the little things add up to make you both feel more loved and secure.

, One final option is leaving him. If you can't stand the flirting and it bothers you enough to make you upset on a regular basis, you do have the option of getting out of the relationship. Sometimes the only option is putting up with it or getting out."

Also, a smile makes you seem like a happier person, while at the same time increasing your happiness. In turn, that shows the woman you are glad to see her.Smile a big, genuine smile to show that your attracted to a woman.

You can even flash a smile from across the room to show you're interested in someone.;
, You may not even notice that you're crossing your arms and legs. For many people, it's natural to cross one or the other. However, for open body language, you should uncross your arms and legs, as that signals to the woman that you're open to her.Crossing your arms and legs comes off as a defensive pose even if you're not feeling defensive at the moment.
It says, ""Hey! I don't want to talk to you. Go away!""
It can also help to turn your body towards her instead of away from her.

, Looking down at your shoes or lap doesn't draw people to you. Plus, it indicates a lack of confidence. Make sure you are looking up at the person, so that you show you are interested in her. Gazing into her eyes is a good way to start.Combining a smile with gazing in someone's eyes, even from the other side of the room, can be an effective way to say you like a woman.
However, you should stare at her. Keep your glance across the room to a couple of seconds. If you're talking to a person, though, looking into her eyes throughout the conversation can let her know you are interested.

, Often, when you're trying to show attraction to a woman, part of your nonverbal body language is a bit of preening. For example, you may want to stand up straighter or pull your stomach in. You may also touch your hair or your clothing.Mostly, you'll do these actions without even thinking about them. However, they can show your attraction without you realizing it.
You also want to exude confidence. Stand up straight, look the person in the eye, and talk in a confident tone of voice when speaking., When talking to a woman you like, one way you can show attraction is to lean towards her. It subtly indicates that you like the woman you're talking to, so as you lean, she'll feel your attraction. However, if she pulls back or tries to walk away, let her. You don't want to invade her personal space without her permission.Don't try to corner a woman in a private setting, such as an elevator, especially if you don't know her at all. That can seem threatening. Stick to using this technique when you're in a crowded area.

, Of course, you don't want to grab someone and kiss them without their permission. However, casual touching in a conversation can help create intimacy. For example, touching her arm or shoulder when you are talking to her can let her know that you like her.You could touch her shoulder as you compliment her sweater, as another example, such as ""This sweater looks nice on you.""
If she pulls back from your touch, don't try to do it again.

, When you tilt your head, you show you're engaged in the conversation and that you care about what's going on. It tells the other person that you're listening intently because you're inclining an ear towards them, which in turn shows your attraction.The opposite of engagement is looking around the room. If you're looking around, you're saying you don't care about the person you're talking to.
Instead of looking around, gaze into the person eyes, as that indicates you like her.

Read her positive signals.,
Consider testing the waters.,
Offer to buy her something first.,
Suggest an alternative activity beforehand.,
Choose an appropriate phrase.",How to Whisper in a Girl's Ear1," The appropriate time to whisper in a girl’s ear can vary, but at least make sure that she’s enjoying your company, and hasn’t been shying away from you. If she laughs at something you say, smiles frequently while you’re talking, and consistently makes eye contact with you, the chances are good that she finds you likable. If you began speaking as part of a group, and she breaks off from that group to talk to you alone, this is also a likely signal that she’s interested in getting to know you., A good way to get an idea about whether she’d be comfortable with close contact such as a whisper, is to touch her hand or arm lightly while making a joke or confiding something. If she seems okay with this, then she’d probably not have a problem with your whispering to her. But if she draws back from you, and the tone of the conversation deteriorates after that, it’s best not to try making any further contact.

, If you’re at a bar or nightclub, a good way to begin working your way to earning her affection is to ask if you can buy her a drink. If she accepts, this is an indication that she’ll at least give you a chance to show that you’re worth her time. If she’s with a group of friends, offer to buy them something as well. If you’re up to something subtler, and there happens to be a jukebox onsite, offer to buy her a few songs.If you ask her for a drink, and she says no thanks, explaining that she doesn’t drink, take her word for it. But don’t consider it as a rejection, even if you offer her a non-alcoholic drink without success. She may really just not be thirsty.
For the jukebox, you could try, “Did you notice the jukebox in the corner? How about I get some platters spinning—anything you’d like to hear?”

, A bold gesture such as whispering in her ear may come off more naturally if the two of you are already doing something fun together. If you’re at a bar, getting her to play an arcade game, pool, or darts with you will allow you to shift the tone of your interaction from formal to informal. Once you’ve a had a laugh together, you’ll both be more in the mood for flirting involving bodily contact.Some ways to suggest this would be, “How about getting away from the crowd for a bit and trying our hand at Space Invaders?” or “I’m sure you know a good trick shot or two at the pool table. I’d be thrilled if you could show me.”

, Be sure you know just what you’re going to say, and how to say it, before whispering. Pretend you’re on stage, and need to deliver your lines convincingly. You can whisper sweet nothings, secrets, or whatever else you fancy, as long as it will fit with the tone of the conversation you’ve already been having. If you want to make her laugh, and the joke is slightly off-color, you can whisper the punch line in her ear. If you’d like to come off as seductive, be careful not to use descriptive language that might offend most people, especially if you’ve only recently met her.


If you’ve only met that day, try something simple and attentive that is not likely to offend, such as, “Has anyone told you how pretty you look tonight?”If you’re feeling confident, you could try a suggestive phrase such as, “Have you seen how beautiful the moon looks tonight?”

Exude confidence.,
Get her attention.,
Concentrate on her assets.,
Impress her with your independence.,
Ask her out.,
Take her out on a date.,
Be a gentleman.,
Use your age to your advantage.,
Be honest about wanting to take her to bed.,
Take control.,
Don't overwhelm her with praise.,
Impress her with your experience.,
Make her want you again.",How to Seduce an Older Woman," Older women like men who are confident. They want to feel that you are capable of dealing with the complexities of life without them needing to guide you. Projecting an air of self-assurance will take you a long way. Even if you're not feeling confident when you approach an older woman, fake it until you make it.


When you first talk to an older woman, don't start complimenting her right away, or you'll sound like a little kid asking for candy. She won't take you seriously if you do. Instead, use your confidence to impress her.;
, Remember, you’re approaching an older woman. She’s not going to put up with nonsense like you flaunting your car and checking out every babe that walks by. Try to show your keen interest in politics, world events, books, music—in short, things that make you more interesting in general.


If you haven't accomplished a lot, talk about the things you want to do. Don't focus on what you haven't done, or she'll get bored.
If you're a lot younger, don't talk about your friends or the things people ""your age"" do, or she may really feel how much older she is. For example, if you're in college and she's in her thirties, don't tell her about the keg stand you did the other night; instead, talk about your experiences studying abroad in Paris.

, Though you don't have to overwhelm her with compliments, you should let her know what you like about her. Appreciate her for who she is. Is she funny? Laugh with her and tell her. Warm? Respond in kind—if she likes to touch you when she has a conversation, do the same and touch her back. Is she sexy? Let her know that her look really works for you.


Don't make her age a factor at first. You don't want her to think you like her just because she's an older woman. Don't say, ""You're beautiful for your age,"" or you'll sound foolish.
If she does mention her age, you can say, ""I never would have guessed.""
If she ask you how old you think she is, always guess a few years younger. Don't be too obvious about it. If she's in her mid-thirties, don't guess ""twenty-three""; guess ""twenty-nine"" instead.
Once you do start talking about her age, you can even ask how a woman her age got to be single, or how she's kept so many men at bay. Just don't make it sound too corny or put on.

, Older women appreciate men who are not needy and dependent. Being clingy may work for puppies, but not for you. Talk about the things you love to do for fun, your favorite sports, your favorite hobbies, or just the things you do or have done on your own to develop your character. If you're always talking about your friends and family, then she may not think you've ever spent a moment alone and will be turned off.


Do you have a good career with a bright future? Let her know without showing off. Tell her what you do, and if she wants to know more, she’ll ask. However, don’t worry, even if you aren’t independent or career wise, at least show that you have a passion for life and an optimistic outlook.

, Don't delay. Once you've charmed the woman and proven how mature and independent you are, just ask her out. Simply say, ""I've loved talking to you, but I have to get going. Do you want to continue this conversation over food or drinks?"" and ask for her number. Always play it cool; don't seem desperate or too eager to see her again and don't ask to see her the next night. Ask to see her the following week so she knows -- or thinks -- that you have a busy schedule.


There's a difference between playing it cool and being a jerk. You should still smile, look her in the eyes, and give her a small complement when you ask her out.

, Whatever you've been doing with the girls or women your age won't cut it. While taking a girl your age out to dinner and a movie or just bringing some beers or a bottle of cheap wine over to her place might have cut it, you'll have to try harder to impress an older woman. Find out what she likes, whether it's fine foods, classy wine, or just having a good time in one of her favorite local spots.


Just remember that older women are not that different from younger women in the sense that they still like to have a good time. And they might not have fine tastes just because they're older.
If you're out at a restaurant and you're old enough to drink, don't order a beer, unless you want to look like a frat boy. Order a classy cocktail, like a gin and tonic, that makes her see you as more of a man. Of course, don't drink more than you can handle, especially if you're driving.

, If you want to impress an older woman, you should tell her she looks beautiful, hold doors for her, and hold out her chair when she sits down. If she's holding anything heavy, carry it. It's the little things that will make her see whether you're a real man or just a boy trying to be a man to impress her. Don't show up late, have a scruffy face, or wear day-old clothes that you put on at the last minute, or you won't make the right impression.

, Don't be embarrassed or shy about being younger than her -- even if you're ten or fifteen years younger! Instead, think of things a man your age might have that a man her age does not have. Sure, you may not be as financially stable or experienced, but you do have a few things going for you: a youthful and attractive body, lots of energy and enthusiasm for life, and no baggage or worries to wear you down or stress you out.


Call attention to your strengths instead of pointing out your weaknesses. Don't talk about your lack of experience or job prospects. Instead, talk about how excited you are for the future and about how happy and free you are at your age.

, Be honest and open if you want to take a mature woman to bed. Don’t be crude, of course, but if you’re on a date, and it’s going well, don’t be too coy about your intentions. Tell her you find her incredibly attractive, and that you would love to spend the night with her, or wait until you drop her off and make intense eye contact, kiss her, or complement her until she asks for you to come in.


By the end of the date, your intentions should be clear. Before you even drive her home or go back to her place or yours, she should know that you want her -- and she should want you too.
Remember the part about having confidence. Don't make it sound like a question -- ""Can I please please take you to bed?"" Instead, make a simple declarative statement that makes her want you even more.

, Though the woman is older and may expect that you'll do exactly as she says, she'll be really impressed if you take control and let her follow your lead. Take control from the moment you step in her place or yours by kissing her, opening the bottle of wine, and leading her to the bedroom. She'll be pleasantly surprised and impressed. Though you should still let her do what she wants, don't let her take total control of you or you won't be making the most of your experience.


If you plan on going over to the home of an older woman, please learn how to open a bottle of wine before you do. Nothing will make you look like a little boy faster than the fact that you don't know how to open a bottle of wine.

, Okay, so maybe you're excited -- very excited -- to be alone with the woman, but don't go for the gold quite yet. You should tell her she looks beautiful or that she has an amazing body, but leave it at that. Don't tell her she's the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, or that you're so lucky to be alone with her, or that she's the best kisser you've ever met. This will make you look like you're groveling and inexperienced.


She wants to be treated as an equal, not like a goddess or a statue. Filling her with praise will make her even more aware of your age difference.

, Okay, so you may have very much experience to impress the woman with. Still, it's all in the attitude. Don't be nervous when you go to bed or start kissing her, and don't be awkward when you fumble with her bra. If you can't unsnap it, just laugh about it instead of blushing or being embarrassed.


Don't say, ""I haven't done this before..."" or she'll be instantly turned off. If you get into the mindset that you don't have to impress her any more than an ordinary woman, your sense of your own experience will grow along with your confidence.
If you feel really inexperienced but are determined to impress older women, then you may want to try your hand at hooking up with girls your own age first. As long as you're not using them and you're both enjoying yourselves, this can help build your confidence.

, After you've taken her to bed, you should leave on a good note. Don't tell her you had the most unforgettable time of your life; instead, tell her you'd call her again -- if you'd like to -- and follow through after a couple of days. Play it cool and forget that you're ten years her junior and the rest will take care of itself. If you make it clear that you have a busy, interesting life, but that you'd like to fit her in to you schedule, she'll be happy to hear from you.

Get the conversation going.,
Keep the conversation going.,
Compliment her.,
Repeat her name.,
Laugh with her when she says something funny.,
Be attentive.",How to Show a Woman You're Attracted to Her2," It can be hard to get the conversation going with someone you don't know, especially if you find the person attractive. Your attraction can make you a little tongue-tied and shy, but don't worry, you don't have to use a super cheesy pickup line to get her attention. Simpler tactics can be more effective, as long as they get you talking to her.For example, asking her a question can help get the conversation going. It can be something as simple as, ""How do you like this warm weather?"" or ""Isn't this coffee amazing?"" This tactic can work even better if you get the person to evaluate themselves instead of you, such as ""Is that a designer bag you have?""
Ask them to do something for you, such as pass a napkin or move her bag. Asking her a favor will actually endear her towards you and can help get a conversation going.
Don't forget to introduce yourself and ask the person's name.

, If you say hello and then walk away, that doesn't show much interest. However, if you keep the conversation going, especially if you are getting her to talk about herself, you show you are interested in her and what she has to say.Ask her questions about herself, such as ""What do you do for a living?"" or ""What do you like to do for fun?""
As you listen to her, try to to find common interests, so that when there's a lull, you can bring up something about yourself that you have in common with her.

, A genuine compliment goes a long way in showing her that you are attracted to her. The emphasis is on genuine. Therefore, as you're talking to her, notice something unique about her that you like, such as her beautiful green eyes or her witty banter.

For example, you could say, ""You know, you have really engaging eyes. They are such a beautiful green.""
You could also say, ""You're so witty!""

, Once you know her name, try using it conversation. You don't want to overuse it, but saying it once or twice can help create a sense of intimacy. It shows that you cared enough to remember it. Plus, people like hearing the sound of their own names.For example, you could say, ""Nice to meet you, Jessica."" or ""What do you think about this weather, Jessica?""

, If she tells a joke, be sure to laugh at it. You don't want to go overboard. Laughing too much can come off as trying too hard. However, giving her a laugh when you know she is cracking a joke can endear you towards her and let her know you find her attractive, especially if you both know the joke wasn't that funny.If she seems too nervous to crack a joke, crack one yourself. You could poke fun at yourself, such as saying, ""Giants cause all kinds of trouble. That's why people get their pitchforks when we're around,"" if you're tall and accidentally knock over a chair.

, Being attentive to her needs will let her know that you care about her. Anticipating her needs will wow her, along with showing her that you care about her enough to figure out what she wants and needs before she asks for it.For example, if you notice her drink is empty, ask if she'd like another. If you notice she's getting antsy standing up, ask her if she wants to find a table to sit down and chat.

Show interest in the woman.,
Stay in contact.,
Give her a nickname.,
Give her a gift.,
Create a running joke.,
Show support for her interests.,
Get her opinion.",How to Show a Woman You're Attracted to Her3," That is, be sure to talk to the person every time you see them, even if she only has time for a ""Hello!"" If you have more time, ask how she's doing, and be sure to show genuine interest in how she responds. Try to remember little details about her that you can slip into the next conversation.


For example, if she says, ""Just okay,"" dig a little deeper. You could say, ""Just okay? That doesn't sound too great. Want to tell me about it?""
If she mentions her dog is sick in one conversation, ask her about the dog the next time you see her. Just a simple, ""Is your dog doing better?"" is all you need.

, If you can, find the person on Facebook. You don't want to seem like you're stalking her, but if you've seen her more more than a couple of times and had genuine conversations with her, most women will be receptive to a friend request.


Once she accepts, try to make the occasional casual comment on her wall. Keep it light and borderline flirty. For instance, if she updates her profile picture, you could say, ""Cute picture!""

, Create a nickname that is for her and only her. Don't use it much when other people are around. You don't want other people to start using it. It should be one only you use. Creating a private nickname helps create a sense of intimacy between the two of you. Just make sure it isn't a name she hates.This approach will probably work better with a woman you know pretty well. Giving someone you've met twice a nickname may come off as creepy.

, You don't want to do something too elaborate, as that may turn her off. However, bringing her a small gift just because or because it's her birthday can send the message that you think of her as someone special, not just another woman.

For example, bring her a small bouquet of flowers on her birthday, or grab her a coffee when you're getting yours.
In the same vein, once she tells you her birthday, remember it, and always acknowledge it.

, Laughter is one of the great social connectors, and if you share a running joke that's just between the two of you, it can create a sense of intimacy and togetherness. Try playing off of something you both see all the time or a mistake you made to poke fun at yourself.For example, maybe you slipped up one time and asked her if she wanted her coffee purple instead of black. Now, every time you bring her coffee, you could say, ""I've got your purple coffee right here.""

, Everyone likes having support for the things they do, so if she mentions something she's doing soon, show your support for it. Giving attention to what she likes will help show her that you care about her and what she does.For example, say she mentions that she enjoys poetry and often reads at an open mic. Tell her you'd like to come hear her sometime, and then show up. That shows that you have a genuine interest in what she does because you've backed up your talk with an action.
Let her borrow something she's mentioned. If she's brought up something she'd like to read or watch, let her borrow it. Don't even say you'll do it. Just show up with it sometime when you know you'll see her. She'll appreciate your thoughtfulness, and she'll likely notice you're giving her special attention. You could say, ""You mentioned this book the other day, so I thought you might like to borrow it.""
Offer her an ""extra"" ticket. If you want to ask her on a date without really asking her, you can offer her an ""extra"" ticket that you specifically bought for her to a fun event, like an art gallery gala. Inviting her to an event shows you enjoy her company., When you're trying to make a decision, ask for her opinion on it. Doing so will help her see that you value her and what she thinks, and then when you follow her it advice, it will make her feel good about herself and being around you.For example, say you want to paint your bedroom. Ask her what she thinks a good color would be.
If you commit to that color, show her a picture later or invite her over to see your remodel.

Stand or sit to the side of her.,
Cup your hand around your mouth.,
Approach her ear.,
Ensure that she can hear you.,
Follow up according to her reaction.",How to Whisper in a Girl's Ear2," This will make it easier to whisper in her ear, which would be awkward directly from the front—it could appear as if you’re going in for a kiss. If you’d still like to add some element of surprise, wait until she turns her head away from you before approaching her ear.


If you already know her fairly well, you could try to surprise her by whispering from behind her. But do this only if you know she’s not easily frightened, since it could produce a big scare.
If you especially want to avoid startling her, you can try placing one hand gently on her shoulder before approaching her ear.

, If you’re on her right side, use your right hand to cup your mouth. If you’re on her left side, use your left hand to cup your mouth. This way your whispering will be shielded from the hearing of any others who might be in front of her or to her side.


If her hair is covering her ear, avoid brushing it away if you’ve just met her that day. If you’ve been on at least a couple of dates, brushing her hair aside should be acceptable.

, If you’ve only just met the person, avoid making direct contact between your cupped hand and her ear. If she’s your girlfriend or if you’ve been dating for some time, it should be okay to press your hand lightly against her ear while whispering.

, If you’re in a noisy area such as a busy bar or at a party, you may have to speak above a whispering tone in order for her to hear you. Be careful not to yell, though. A tone slightly above a whisper should be audible, since your mouth will be close to her ear. But if there is little or no background noise in your area, speak slowly in a whisper.

, If she immediately moves away from you even before you get a chance to whisper, or after, you’ll know to avoid trying to make physical contact with her for the moment. But if she responds with a smile, giggle, and sustained eye contact, you’ve done well. Yet be careful not to take a positive reaction as an invitation to move a step beyond by hugging her or holding her hand right away. Be content with having made her laugh and smile, and wait for a response from her, such as touching your hand or moving closer to you, that shows she’s probably comfortable with more involved flirting.

Move forward slowly.",How to Seduce a Woman," Seduction is all about timing. Part of what makes a person want another person is the anticipation. When you meet a woman you're interested in, proceed slowly. Wait a bit to approach her and start off by listening more than you talk. Do not reveal your intention right away as this might be off-putting. Move slowly, at least at first., If you want a woman to notice you, you'll have to dress your best. Work on dressing up if you expect to see someone you're attracted to at a bar, party, or other event.


Choose nice, flattering clothing. If you're worried your current wardrobe is too drab, go to a department store. You can ask a sales consultant to help you choose an outfit that's flattering for your body.
Remember, it's sexy to be yourself. Strive to look your best on your own terms. That is, do not shave if you enjoy having a beard or dress in a suit where you're more of a button down guy. You won't feel comfortable if you're not behaving like yourself. This is something your date can easily sense and confidence is key to seduction.Take a shower before you go out and consider using a bit of cologne. Too much could be overpowering, but a dab of a classy scent can help.

, When you approach a woman, try to listen. People tend to be attracted to those who seem interested in them. Rather than boasting about your own accomplishment and telling all your own stories, try listening instead.


Try to ask more questions than you answer. Simple ice breaking questions are nice. Try things like ""What do you do for living?"" and ""Where did you grow up?""Always convey that you're listening. Smile, nod, and occasionally offer commentary like ""Uh-huh"" or ""Yeah."" Ask follow up questions as well. Ask for clarification or further details on stories and personal information.
Sexual attraction is tied to personality. Getting to know a person well can actually enhance your sexual feelings for that person. If you do end up successfully seducing a woman, you might enjoy the sexual encounter more if you know the person well., Confidence is something most people are attracted to. Being comfortable with yourself will draw other people to you. Try to proceed with confidence while you interact with the women you' desire.


Remember, there's a fine line between confidence and egomania. Dominating the conversation to brag is off-putting. However, it's fine to take pride in what you do for a living, where you're from, and other details about yourself she might ask for.Make her laugh. Many people are attracted to people with a healthy sense of humor. Try to crack an appropriate joke during your encounter to see if you can impress her with your comedic side., Direct and confident body language can signal your interest. Try using cues to show a woman you're attracted to her and interested in getting physical.


Stand up straight. Keep your head up and with your shoulders pulled back. Do not fold your arms or hold a drink across your chest. Signal in every way you're feeling confident.Find ways to break the touch barrier flirtatiously. Take a woman's hand to lead her around a bar or wherever you meet her. Guide her by placing your hand on the small of her back. Try and slowly get a woman more comfortable with your touch., Pick-up lines have a bad rap. However, if you choose a pick-up line that's not overused or sleazy, it can actually highlight your charm and get a woman interested.


Research on pick-up lines shows that this is a situation where highlighting your good qualities--that is, bragging a little--can help. Women respond less favorably to pick-up lines that are empty compliments or sexual in nature. They tend to be more interested in pick-up lines that allow them to learn something about a stranger that helps them stand out amongst other potential matches.For example, if you're a nurse, you could try something like, ""Wow, this party is pretty lifeless, huh? As a nurse I think I'm pronouncing this DOA."" Or, if you're a firefighter, you could try something like, ""Is it just me or is it hot in here? As a firefighter I think you might be the source of the fire here.""
If you want to choose a pick-up line, think of something clever that highlights an aspect of your own personality or life. Work in your occupation, if it's interesting, or some of your hobbies or positive qualities. Do not leave it at a pick-up line, however. Research indicates pick-up lines work best when they're followed by conversation., When you invite a woman over, a pleasant aroma is key to successful seduction. Try opening the windows for a few hours before she comes, letting any bad smells out. Light some incense. Choose a smell that's pleasant without being overpowering, like a light vanilla scent or something like sandalwood. Try to do a little research into what she likes beforehand. Try to work questions about smell into a conversation. Ask her about types of perfumes she likes or body washes to get a sense of the kind of smells she prefers., A little music can help get her in the mood. Remember, keep the focus on her and not you. Choose a type of music she'd like but also songs that are slow, soothing, and sensual.


Ask her about her musical tastes beforehand. Try putting on a band she likes, but choose songs that are slower. Quicker pop tunes are more likely to put someone in a dancing mood than a sexual mood.Classic choices, like Barry White, run the risk of coming off as cheesy. Stick to somewhat non-traditional choices so your date won't end up rolling her eyes., Ambiance is important when it comes to seduction. Try to set the mood with a little decoration.


Candles and mood lighting can go a long way. If you're sleeping with someone for the first time, she might be a little insecure. Dimming the lights and using candles can help her feel more comfortable getting undressed. Candles are also viewed as romantic and exciting by many.Try to clean up a bit before she comes over. A nice, clean house can make you come off as put together and responsible, which can be a turn on for many.

, Initiate touch. When starting to initiate things, move slowly. Initiate touch by sitting close, placing your hand on her knee or shoulder. Seduction, once again, is all about pacing. Going too fast can be a turn off.


The first kiss should be gentle, more than a peck but not full on making out. Leave her wanting more. Try to figure out her kissing style as well. How did she kiss back? That gives you a clue as to what she might enjoy.If you're trying to seduce someone you've been with a long time, try to initiate things in unexpected places. People fall into routines in longterm relationships, which can get boring. Try making out, say, in the kitchen or hopping in the shower with your wife or girlfriend., Erogenous zones are parts of the body that stimulate sexual desire when touched, kissed, licked, or otherwise caressed. Not everyone's erogenous zones are the same, but certain areas of the body tend to be sensitive for many women.


The neck and ears have many nerve endings and are generally not touched during the day. They might respond well to kissing, sucking, licking, and gentle biting.
The head and feet are major erogenous zones for many. A gentle scalp or foot massage might help get things moving.
When kissing, focus on the lips. Try licking, biting, and sucking on the lips.
The abdomen, lower back, and inner thighs are also sensitive to the touch. Many women derive sexual pleasure from being touched here., Seduction is all about maintaining momentum. Moving too fast can make a person uncomfortable or turned off. As you proceed, do so slowly. Pay attention to what a woman wants and what pleases her. Try to be in tune with her needs so the experience is mutually pleasurable experience. Occasionally stop and ask if something feels good and pay close attention to how she responds.

In the movie, the general plan is described as this:


The pledge: You need to get the people's attention and interest, give them a reason to listen to you, create trust, offer a wider perspective, promise fun, security, happiness, benefit or advantage.
The turn: Without interaction and emotional involvement, your pledge will lead to nothing and will soon be forgotten. You will not obtain the desired outcome, unless you work toward it in a planned, structured, strategic way. You need to obtain interaction and emotional involvement from your listener.
The prestige: But of course, unless you can close the deal, nothing is ever won. The turn, therefore is always function of the prestige. You cannot hit a target if you don’t know what you are aiming at. Good strategies are of little use if you do not have a fixed goal, determination and self confidence.;
, At the start, mostly, you don’t know anything about their values. So you have to be careful: stick to what you see (appearance, clothes, …) and return the information they are giving you. When connecting this information to such abstract things as their feelings and opinions, be vague. Let their own imagination fill in the gaps.


The deeper the rapport, the more they will trust what you say. Instinctively, they will then complete the vague images that you are offering with content that is meaningful to them and which they will agree with. This will further deepen the established rapport and make them more receptive to what you are saying. If you say, “On my way here, I saw this beautiful, green Jaguar”, they might think that a green Jaguar is not what they consider being a beautiful car.
This would weaken and possibly break the rapport. If, on the other hand, you just say: “On my way here, I saw this beautiful car”, that would probably help them to feel as if they were seeing a beautiful car. So remember: Provide a vivid, detailed description in terms of the senses, to engage the imagination; Agree, Praise and Confirm : Be empathic and similar, to create rapport; Compliment: clothes, interior, this is so great, you are so …; Be vague when it comes to facts or feelings he is supposed to have now, in order to lead your listener’s imagination and emotions in the direction that you have set out, allowing your vague descriptions to further intensify the established rapport.
How to be vague? Adapt your use of language: Use Pronouns (it, he, …)instead of concrete nouns; use nominalizations(independent verbs such as “the going”); use Metaphors “the black gold” instead of “petrol”); use Paradoxes (“the sound of silence”); use Alliteration (successive words starting with the same sound); use Ellipses (leave out unnecessary words); use Personalizing Repetitions (With me, …); use Personifications (“the rain is telling us …”); Use Stories, Fairy Tales and Myths .... and meanwhile, discover their values and use them in all you say.
Make them talk or think about themselves, their emotions, desires, … by asking questions as: ""What are you looking for in a car, boyfriend, …?"", ""Why did you buy this?"", ""What do you like most about it?"", ""How would you describe your ideal …?"". Also: Ask for advice: ""what would you do?"", ""how do you do this?"", ""what do you suggest?"".

, A good but very straightforward method is: The direct suggestion + feed back question. Using phrases like: “If you were to imagine feeling really sad right now, how would that feel like?” will take people’s imagination back to moments in which they felt that way, inducing a similar feeling right now. Of course, saying something like that so blatantly requires that you have previously built up a good deal of trust and comfort.


Unless people accept that you have some right to share the information asked for, and unless the context allows for believing that you have a genuine interest in the subject at the time of asking, you are prone to meet with strong opposition just because it is straight out suggestive.
A more indirect way to obtain the same result is: The manipulative question. You might say: ""What do you need to feel in order to be really comfortable around someone?"" , or: ""What does it feel like when you feel incredibly happy / attracted to someone…?"" A still somewhat weaker variation hereof is the indirect manipulative question. This would sound like: ""Have you ever found yourself becoming so longing to buy a product, that the rest of the world just seems to fade away and all you can think of is how much you need to have this thing? And have you ever felt this so strongly that you were ready to pay almost just about anything to get it?”
The disadvantage here is that you could get a simple “yes” or “no” without the other person ever having done a conscious effort to re-live the situation. At that point, you simply ask: “why was that?”, “Can you tell me some more about it?” These questions have four important advantages: The answers will provide you with useful information about the deeper structure of the listener’s mind and of his world-view,
They will reveal you which kind of arguments are likely to influence this person. e.g. which qualities are needed by this person to feel comfortable with somebody , At the same time they will make him actually go through the experience and relive the connected feelings, in order to being able to describe them to you and their subconscious mind will automatically associate the context with the speaker, the result being that the listener will instantly feel more attracted to you.
Always keep in mind to: Present evidence for what you say, Submit your proof for verification, Be confident and relaxed, Look into the eyes of the listener (but don’t overdo it) and Use your listener’s Christian name.

, We've used the word before in this article, and you have certainly read it many times before. But what is rapport in fact, and how do you create it? We all know that “A man convinced against his will, remains of the same opinion still ..” That is why every sales- or hypnosis course and every article about dating will tell you that you need to start with creating as much rapport as possible.


Only after you have created sufficiently emotional connection and trust, will your listener feel comfortable enough to actually listen to you, and accept and emotionally respond to images that you are describing. Creating rapport goes as follows:
Mirror your listener’s body language, That is: his posture, movements, breathing rhythm and physical state. Why? Copying his behavior causes him to feel similar to you, which in turn will lead to your listener starting to copy you in response.
Confirm and match your listener’s inner world. That is: his values, perceptions, beliefs, emotions, ideas and assumptions. Why? when you copy your listener’s way of seeing the world (visual, audio …), his way of expressing himself (words and expressions he uses), repeat his values, accept him as he is and confirm him in his beliefs and opinions, he will listen to you, accept what you are saying and start to like you because he will see you as very similar to himself and will appreciate the respect you show him.
After all, you are confirming him in what and how he is and what you are telling, is the truth, such as he too perceives it. Useful techniques for creating rapport are : Agree, Praise and Confirm, Practice Overall empathic interaction, Copy patterns of speech, words and images used,
Tell about similar experiences, Ask for advice, Insert pauses between phrases, talk slowly, whisper. Examples: O.k., right, exactly my idea; I have that same feeling all the time; I was just about to say exactly the same thing; You are great, smart, good, …; I couldn’t agree more; How would you … ? What would you do if … ?

, Using gathered information for “mind reading” or making correct assumptions is very useful to build a sensation of rapport and will make the listener more receptive to your propositions. Examples: Right now you may ask yourself; You probably feel something, By now you will see, understand, agree …; I see that you start to understand, … ; I am so glad to hear that you feel the same way …; You will soon start feeling, you will see, you will enjoy; We will first … and then you will know, see, feel, …;


a)Once you have fully understood this, you will be able to. Be careful to use vague or ambiguous phrases: By this time, you might start to become aware of this special sensation; That (what ??) can feel so good, can’t it?.
b)A good and safe way is to tell things by implication: I wonder if you already realize that the main advantage …; I don’t know if you already noticed that …; By now, you may feel how the desire keeps growing; And then this sensation of … will increase more and more; You can keep feeling more …; You will feel completely satisfied; Again, we …; Once you have fully understood this, you will be able to …; Everybody knows, We all feel that …; You will feel so secure, so relaxed, so happy …
Telling the listener what he knows, feels and thinks, is not enough though: you should link it to what he must do next using straight links (and, also, but, …), Implicit links (while, during, after, before … you feel, are, will see…) or Links which reveal a necessity (since you have experienced for yourself … you know; A causes B; this requires, Because X …follows Y; Since we agreed that A = B, therefore …)
However bear in mind to avoid giving direct orders: A/ use superpositions instead (NOT: “imagine”, or “try to imagine”, BUT: “While you imagine this, you will realize that …”; NOT: “look at this”, BUT: “we can see that …”). You might also want to simultaneously build silent acceptation (which will make it more difficult for the other to disagree later) by finishing your sentences with ""Yes?"", ""Right?"", ""You see?"", ""Got it?""

, A 'suggestive predicate' is a predicate that sets up the material that immediately follows it as a powerful suggestion. Among the following examples, you will recognize many introductory phrases used before in these worksheets: After you come to....; After you've...; And the more you (X)...the more you (Y); And as you...; Are you curious about...; Are you aware that...; Are you still interested in...; As you hear these words they...; As you... ...then...; As you consider this...; Be aware of what you can sense...; Before you think...; Can you imagine...; Can I ask you to...; Can you visualize...; Can you...; Can you remember...; Could you...; Do you realize that you can become aware of…; Do you think that...; Do you remember when...; Do you...; Do you ever...; Don't think of...; Has it ever occurred to you that...; Have you noticed that...; Have you ever wondered...; Have you...; Have you ever...; How would you feel if...; How do you know that...; How do you feel when...; I don't want you to be...; I want you to learn...; I know you are curious...; I saw someone do this in minutes once...; I wonder if...; I don't know how soon...; I wonder could you...; I would like to suggest that...; I want you to bear in mind...; I want you to become aware...; I can remember...; I'd like you to pretend that...; I'm wondering...; I'm curious to know...; If you could...; In my experience...; Is it that you are...; Is it possible...; Is it that you have...; Is it that there is...; It is useful that...; It's just like...; It's impossible...; It's good to know that...; It's useful that...; It's good that...; It's either (A) or (B); which is it...; It's not important that...; It's as if...; People can loosen up easily...; Perhaps you are...; Perhaps you can...; Perhaps you could...; Perhaps you're wondering...; This can be learned easily...; What do you think would happen if...; What would happen if...; What's it like to...; When you notice... ...then...; Will you...; Would you...; You come to...; You are learning to anticipate...; You can become aware that...; You know about these things...; You will feel...

, By inserting embedded commands, you may talk about anything but simultaneously you will be programming the listener, “ordering” him to like you, desire your product, accept your argumentation, …


An embedded command is reinforced considerably when you use the listener’s name to mark the begin of your command. We were …, and suddenly my friend says: “We are going to ……”; I read an article / book / watched a movie / saw on TV …; So, this guy said to her: “I want you to …”; ""meanwhile, they arrived at the cabin. Now, imagine, …""; It was like … (+ because + feeling) … Now, with me …; You know … Notice : the first part of the phrase is in the past tense, the embedded command is in the present tense!
Telling stories is like painting (mental) pictures with words. Stories are so great to stimulate someone’s imagination. Because you are talking about fictive experiences or about other people’s experiences, he will be less critical and feel more free in his interpretation of your words.
Almost instinctively, the listener will connect to the situation and feel the emotions that the characters in the story feel, and apply them to the present moment. You will make your listener think about anything you want, just by telling him stories about the subject of your choice. The more vivid, descriptive, detailed and emotional your stories, the more he will think about how these things would feel to him, and the more emotional he will react to your stories.
After all, you are not telling him what to do or how to feel, but just telling about what somebody else did and felt. It’s important therefore to mention the desired result or feeling over and over again: Use chains of always stronger, connected feelings: A leads to B, B to C …; Link descriptions of actions and situations to feelings - For instance: Description of action or situation + and this made him feel like … / gives you the feeling of … and finally, use ambiguous words and expressions: light = ""not heavy"", but also means ""bright"", or ""told a lie""; below me = blow me; close off = clothes off; laugh = love; new direction = nude erection; come = cum, ...

, When you tell somebody not to think of an old gnome, not to imagine his red pointed cap, not to think of his long white beard, nor of his high boots and typical duds, … What happens ? He inevitably thinks of a gnome anyway.


To understand what you are saying, the listener has no choice but to create in his mind some representation of an old gnome. A handy way to make your listener think about or imagine something, is to tell them not to think about it, or that there’s no such thing as …, or that it is impossible to imagine … Always remember: Whatever you describe, your listener will visualize.
The more sensory details you include (colors, sounds, smells, feelings, tastes, …), the stronger his response will be. Use vivid descriptions to allow your listener to feel as if he is directly experiencing what you describe, with all the emotions that follow from that experience :
When you talk about a beach, don’t just refer to it as “a beach”, but tell how you walked up a hill and suddenly spotted this pure strip of land, hidden between two dunes, where the light blue water glittered between the sun, with the softly murmuring wide ocean caressing the white sandy shore below you in an eternally repeated leisurely rising and falling flow of its white foamy waves.

, Emotions are associative; they get linked to particular stimuli, which can later revive that emotion, even if there’s no logical connection between the stimulus itself and the emotion. Lots of people react very emotionally to certain old songs, because they automatically connect these songs to a special moment in their life.


There are places, sounds, … that make us feel very good or sad, depending on which experiences we associate them with. If you had a truly positive experience with an Italian girl many years ago, you may suddenly realize that you have become a lover of all things Italian and maybe not even be able to remember or explain why. In exactly the same way, you can “anchor” strong emotions, that is: mark them and in this way link them to a touch, to a specific motion, to a painting, to the starlit sky … in fact, to anything at all.
The stronger the emotion felt when the anchor is set, the stronger the response will be when the anchor is “fired” later. The more special and specific the anchor, the longer it will retain its function. Remember Jung’s Archetypes? People share a number of inner images. Some are universal, most however culturally determined.
The trigger words that activate these images are nowadays called: power words. When talking to women for instance, chances are you trigger a few emotions when using these power expressions and words : expressions: It feels as if I loved you before I met you; - as if I have always loved only you; - as if I have been searching for you all my life; - as if I love you since the dawn of mankind. I will love you as long as I live … and more.
Just imagine feeling more intensely than ever before, feel this sense of overwhelming, irresistible passion… and then realize you can feel completely one with yourself, with the universe … and even more. Some Power Words are: angels, sacred, magic, fairy tales, princess, goddess, paranormal experiences, the inner voice, the inner self, the pure soul, biorhythm,the true nature, bigger whole, wholeness, universal bond, signs, destiny, fate, serendipity, be in touch with her path, true passion, be connected, connection with self, finding the One, the other half, things that are meant to be, realization cycle, harmony, peace, safety, protection, sharing, trust, calm ocean, safe harbor, feelings that bridge time, more, deeper, surrender = give in to, something overwhelming, all-enveloping emotion, emotional growth, grow, learn, reaching deeper levels, enhance, beauty, adoration

, Presuppositions assume that the person you're persuading has already accepted your proposal or has reached an agreement with you, even he has not yet done so.


See how the questions below ""presupposes"" your desired outcome. ""Are you still willing to join me in my quest?"" (This question does not ask ""if"" you're willing, but it presupposes that you're already willing.); ""I will give you $100 when you finish this task. (Notice I didn't say ""if"" but ""when.""); ""When do you want to start doing your assignment?"" (It assumes you already want to do it; the only question is ""when"" to start); ""How happy are you to be here in this memorable event?"" (It assumes you're already happy; the only question is your level of happiness.); ""I'm glad you checked this out. How will you apply it to your business?"" (It assumes you will apply it; the only question is ""how"" you will apply it.); ""Shall we start the program on Thursday or Friday?"" (It assumes the program will push through; the only question is ""when."")
When you ask these questions, people will also start thinking of answers and may therefore get distracted from thoroughly understanding your question. You can then easily persuade them at this point.

, You can make people do what you want right now by asking a question that assumes he has already did your desired request. Here's an example: ""If you made money with this program, would you continue your membership?"" - If he says ""yes"", then you're in a much better position to persuade. That's because he will never know if he will make money with your program... unless he joined.


Another way of asking is called: The false choice. ""Do you want to completely relax or do you prefer to just chill out?"", ""Would you prefer to go to ""the Kings"", or do you prefer ""the Shakespeare""?"" ... whatever choice is made, leads to a convenient situation for you! In fact, where it comes down to is : never ask questions, but make it seem like you are.
Never, never EVER do I ask someone to do something. Tell them they can. Tell them they will. But let them THINK you are asking. ""We have a household goal of $60 once for the year. We only come around once a year and $60 gives us $5 a month to budget with, fight the cause in your name and win. You can meet that goal tonight, right.""
Notice there is no question mark at the end of that sentence. That's because there is no question. The words may sound like a question, but your tone should sound like you are stating a cold hard fact. You can say no to a question, it's a lot harder to say no to a fact. Confidence is key. Be confident that your listener wants to do what you are suggesting. Be positive. Not selling your idea isn’t an option.
Talk, confident that the other is interested in what you are having to say. Confident also that they want to get involved. Most of the time they will do what you want, because it never even occurs to them to do otherwise. Back that confidence by using strong assertive language: NOT: “I am trying, maybe we could, …” BUT: “I will” - NOT: not “you could help me if …” BUT: “you will help me by …”

, Make yourself a winner : Have others name you, ""The one they trust"", ""The (only)one that can satisfy their desire, need, longing...""; Healthy, handsome, smart, tender, protective, strong, caring,...


Make them repeat : I want, need, desire … and Include specific positive information about yourself: Your Preferences, Things you are good at and Your Successes. Also, don't forget to refer to previous periods of well being, happiness, success.

Repeated direct eye contact from across the room is a sure sign she wants you to come say hi, especially if it's accompanied by a smile.;
, Women's faces tend to be more animated when they're interested in you. Pay attention to her eyebrows, lips, and eyes to see how she reacts to the things you have to say. Here a few things to keep your eyes peeled for:


Raised eyebrows. This can be used in a number of situations, but most of the time, it's a good thing. When paired with a smile and a nod, raised eyebrows means that she agrees with what you're saying—even if it's just because you're the one who's saying it. Women will also raise their eyebrows after making eye contact to show that they like what they see.
Fidgety lips. If she chews on her lips when she's thinking or listening, she's drawing attention to her lips, and thus probably interested. Likewise, look for her to be licking her lips. Not only is this a subconscious way to draw attention to her lips, but women's mouths get drier when they're excited and/or aroused, .
Dilated pupils. Both males and females' pupils dilate when they are interested in the person they're talking to. This will be especially apparent if you're in a light setting, as darker settings will naturally produce more dilated pupils.
Overactive eyelids. If she's batting her eyelashes, she's definitely flirting. While this move is very cliched, the stereotype comes from somewhere. If a woman is interested in you, she'll blink slightly faster than she would normally.
Flared nostrils. When women are interested or aroused, their nostrils flare. It's an involuntary response to excitement, so, like dilated pupils, you can be pretty sure she's genuinely interested if her nostrils are flared.

, Interested women will lean in close. If you're sitting at a table, she may rest her head on one or both of her hands to get closer to you.


Beware of crossed arms. If she's sitting back in her chair with her arms crossed, chances are she's bored or uninterested. Try regaining her interest by sparking conversation about her and her life. If nothing works, you may need to find another girl.
On the other hand, if she touches your hand or arm and immediately brings it back towards her chest area, she is displaying interest.

, Gentle movements, such as mindlessly twirling a strand around her finger or running her fingers through it slowly are signs that she's very interested. Quick, jerky movements indicate that she's embarrassed or impatient, especially when paired with wandering eyes.


Quick, jerky movements don't mean that the situation is hopeless. If you're coming on super strong, back off a little bit. Be sure that you're not dominating the conversation or complimenting her too much. If you're not sure, check out How to Flirt for some tips on turning the conversation around.

, Women who are interested will use their fingers to caress erogenous zones on their body, fiddle with jewelry, or play with their glass.



Caressing erogenous zones. When a woman often caresses her lips, neck, or collarbones, she's sending you a signal that she wants you. This is commonly a subconscious way of drawing your attention to these areas, reminding you that she's sexy.

Fiddling with jewelry. When a woman is around someone that she's interested in, her heart beats faster. This makes her feel nervous excitement. As a sort of outlet for that tension, she'll twist her rings, play with her earring, or tug at her necklace. She may also bounce her foot or leg to get rid of the extra energy.

Digging her nose. The nose is connected to nerves in erogenous zones. A girl digging her nose will usually try to conceal it but you should tell her it's beautiful. This bridges the psychological barrier and brings the couple to a higher level of intimacy.

Playing with objects. When a woman strokes the stem of a wine glass or runs her fingers along the rim of her water cup, she's trying to get your attention. If the movements are slow and controlled, she's likely interested. If, however, she's tapping the glass and pursing her lips, she probably can't wait to get out of there.

, Often times, an interested woman will cross her legs. This is an especially good sign if her top leg is pointed towards you. She may also stroke her lower thigh or smooth her pants as or before she does this to further draw attention to her legs.

, Everyone has a personal ""bubble"" of about 18 inches (45.7 cm). If she gets into your personal space, or even finds excuses to touch you, you can bet she's interested. Be ready for any ""tests"" she might make for herself—stepping into your personal space to let someone walk past, touching your arm as a condolence when you're sad, or putting her hand on your knee to emphasize that she finds you funny are all quick breakdowns of the physical barriers to see how you react.


If you're interested in her, respond by doing a few little ""tests"" of your own. She'll know you're interested, and it'll open up the doors for longer, more prolonged touching.

, A woman will let you know she thinks you're the most interesting person in the room by staring into your eyes. If you're just getting to know each other, she will only hold it a couple seconds longer than normal. However, if you know each other well, she may feel comfortable enough to stare deep into your eyes for long periods of time.


It takes two. She can't make prolonged eye contact with you if you shift your gaze. If you're uncomfortable by her advances, feel free to look away quickly. However, if you're interested in her, let the eye contact last for a couple seconds before you let yourself (or her!) look away.

, Take notice of how often she smiles or laughs around you comparatively to other people. Often times, a woman who's interested in you will find it hard to stop laughing in your presence. This may be during a conversation with you, during which she'll make lots of eye contact, smile, and giggle or laugh at even the most pitiful jokes, or it may be simply when she's in the same room with you. Look also for overly loud, boisterous behavior when she's engaged in a different conversation in the same room; it's a sure sign she wants you to notice her.

, There are a few gestures that women will make to encourage your desire to take her into your arms. The most important of these is the shoulder shrug. Open, upturned palms are also important signs that she's interested.


If she leans forward on the seat and turns slightly towards you, she is displaying her shape and subconsciously wants you to check her out.
If she lets her hand move down your back and just barely slide off the top of your butt, she is very interested in you.

, If you are comfortable enough with each other to cuddle, put your head on her chest. If her heart is racing, she's really interested. If you're not comfortable enough to get close to her heart, check out her wrist pulse. Lightly grab her hand and rest a finger on her wrist. This is difficult to master, but if you can pin down a racing heart, you have a pretty good sign that she's very into you.


You can also gauge her heartbeat by observing her breathing patterns. This is just as difficult, if not more so, than feeling for a pulse, but doesn't require prolonged touch. When you're sitting next to each other during a movie, lightly brush up against her. If she's breathing very quickly, it's probable that she's interested. If she's holding her breath, she might be trying to hide the fact that she's breathing hard.

, Often, a woman who is interested will subconsciously mirror your movements. This shows that the two of you are on the same wavelength and can thus increase intimacy in the relationship. That's why dancing is considered intimate or sexy—it forces you to mirror each other's movements! "

Give someone a seductive look when they smile back.,
Keep up what you're doing, but occasionally make eye contact.,
Seal the deal with eye contact after making conversation.",How to Seduce Someone Using Only Your Eyes2," If you smile at someone, wait for a smile back. When the person returns your smile, give him or her a seductive look. Use your eyes to show your sexual interest.

Once you've initiated conversation with someone, glance away while he or she talking now and again. Do not be rude by glancing away to look at your phone or someone else. Just briefly glance to the left or right to avoid being overwhelming with eye contact.You should strive to look at someone's face about three quarters of the time you're talking to that person.

No matter what your eye color and complexion, you can pull it off. Not all smoky eyes should be the basic black, grey, or brown. Some colors to use are: plum, olive green, navy blue, gold, silver, copper, burgundy, rosy pink, or even if you want a punk look a bright color. If you have green eyes, it's well known that a purple can make your eye colour really stand out, or technically any colour with a hint of red in it, as red is opposite to green on the colour wheel, and will be complimentary. Mossy green makes brown eyes smolder!. Blue eyes can get away will anything as most colours work. Hazel eyes look nice with a brown eyeshadow, but if you want to go on full on fierceness, go for the black, just not too heavy, that's such a turn-off. Also, it is known that eye shadow colour the same as your eye colour with enhance its colour. For example, you could use a brown eyeshadow with brown eyes, it looks gorgeous!

, Use a subtle bronzer or shimmer to set. Using a dusty rose blush, just smile and pop this pink colour on the apples of your cheeks. Do not smudge up the cheekbone, this is slightly old-fashioned now and if you use too much, it can make you look strange and stripy, the same goes for bronzer. Use the bronzer on the hollows of your cheeks (imagine contouring the bronzer where your cheeks are sucked in, this can make your face look slimmer). Also, if you want to lose 10 pounds, dust some bronzer on each jawline, slightly underneath. Don't go overboard and make it obvious though.

Spritz your favorite perfume in the air, one spray, in front of you and walk through it.

,
Allow some to fall in your hair.",How to Seduce Anyone (for Females)6,", Musky scents work the best. Fruity and floral scents are alright, but make sure you aim to please him, not another girlie-girl. Although, you should be in love with your perfume because you will be the one wearing it.

Take whatever style you like and wear it confidently.,
Keep things simple.,
Consider wearing pantyhose.",How to Seduce Anyone (for Females)7," Although, some styles that flatter you most and grab guys attention are surprisingly not what you see in fashion magazines but are: vintage, retro, Victorian, classy, sophisticated, and womanly styles.


Choose colors that flatter you. Hold up different fabrics up to your face at a fabric store and ask a friend what colors look best on you. Mimic the ones that make your eyes pop in your clothing. A hint: the color of your eyes with always look good on you.
Black is a good color as well, as it lets your features stand out more, and it doesn't distract from you.
Black also adds mystery.

, Anything too frilly or 'fruity' will turn a guy off. Do not show a lot of skin either. A low cut shirt is alright, but rather than skimpy clothing, wear tight clothing. You show what you have while still being covered and add mystery. The guy will automatically want to see more. If you show it all right away he may be satisfied right away in that moment, but what reason does he have to stick around? What more is there to see? Always keep something hidden to keep him coming for more., Many women don't give hosiery a second thought, but it's a turn-on for nearly all men, and it will flatter your legs. Having him stare at your legs will give you a sense of power, too.

Pay attention to him.,
Open up the conversation.,
Give him a compliment.,
Try to keep the conversation going.,
Don't forget your body language.",How to React to a Guy's Flirting1," If you are interested, smile at him, and if he says something funny, laugh. Put down your phone, and make eye contact while you are talking. You're not just being superficial. Rather, you're showing him you're interested in him, just as he's interested in you.Also, the brain perceives the smiles of other people as a reward. In other words, when you smile at someone, their brain processes that as a reward. If you want to encourage someone who's flirting with you, a smile is a good place to start.;
, If he's just smiling at you, don't be afraid to say hello if you want to talk to him more. If he’s asking you questions, respond in such a way that leaves room for more conversation. You want to open the conversation, so he understands that you find him interesting.One way to encourage him to start talking is to ask him his opinion about something. For instance, ask what he thinks of the restaurant, what he's eating, or even a question about the team playing on television behind you.
Make questions open-ended. Asking a simple yes-or-no question will get you a simple yes-or-no answer. An open ended question requires more than a simple yes or no to answer it. For instance, asking ""Do you like the wine?"" is a yes-or-no question. Asking ""What do you like about that wine?"" requires that he provide a deeper answer.

, If he’s been flirting with you, he’s most likely said some nice things to you, so return the favor. Everyone likes to hear nice things about themselves, and guys are no exception. Plus, giving him a compliment back lets him know you're interested.Keep it honest. Try to look for something you can sincerely compliment him on, and make it specific. For example, ""You're handsome,"" is pretty general. ""Your smile lights up the room,"" is much more specific.
Don't stick to just good looks. Complimenting his brain can be just as flirtatious. For example, you could say, ""What an insightful comment. You seem like a really smart guy.""

, It's not enough just to open up the conversation. You also have a responsibility to help keep it going. If you keep talking, you show you're interested in his flirting and him as a potential date.


Try digging a little deeper. Ask about what interests him. See if he has any interesting hobbies or if he has pets.
Ask about his job or what he likes to do outside of work. Use anything to keep the conversation going., As your showing interest, your body says a lot about how you feel, too. If you like someone, you will probably use some unconscious body language to tell the person that, but you can also be conscious of what your body is saying, too.For instance, you don't want to use closed-off body language, such as crossing your arms or legs and turning your body away from the person.
Leaning in, touching the other person, adopting open body language, and smiling are all ways of encouraging interest.

Keep the girl on her toes after you meet.,
Play it cool when it comes to calling or texting her.,
Once you exchange phone numbers with her, let her call you first.,
Don't open up about your feelings too fast.,
Don't look available all of the time.,
Don't break the touch barrier too soon.,
Don't linger too long at first.,
Open up to her little by little.,
Don't be mean or rude when playing hard to get.,
Don't be completely open about your plans.,
Reveal your true feelings little by little.,
Make sure you don't take it too far.,
Know that the chase is never over.",How to Play Hard to Get for Guys," If you want to play hard to get, then you can't be too open about how much you like the girl or let her know exactly how you feel. Instead, you have to keep things fun and interesting by teasing her, being playful, gently bumping into her, and just generally keeping things light and fun without letting the girl know where you stand. Keep her guessing about your true feelings by teasing her a bit, but then pulling away if things get too friendly. Make her wonder how you really feel while encouraging her enough to keep her interested.


To keep her on her toes, you can call her out in a joking way, by saying things like, ""How much pink can one person really wear?"" Or, ""I've never known anyone who is so obsessed with her cat."" Joke around with her and let her see that you appreciate her without all-out complimenting her, and you'll only intrigue her further.;
, If you want to play hard to get, then you don't want the girl you like to feel like you are at her beck and call. If she calls you, don't pick up on the first — or even the second or third — ring. Let her feel like you have something more important to do. Though you don't want to look like you're too booked to care about her, you may not want to pick up the phone every time she calls, either. Give it a few hours to let her see that you have a lot going on.


Don't hang around the phone and annoy the girl you like by texting her what you ate for breakfast or asking what she thinks is the meaning of life.
Who says you have to focus on talking to just one girl at a time? Instead of lingering over one person, use this time to be free and explore your options.
Don't respond right away when your interest texts you. Go make a sandwich and wait fifteen minutes to respond, even if it's hard to wait. If she calls, let it go to voicemail and wait a few hours to call her back. If you really want to answer the phone, at least wait until the third ring.

, Of course, she may not do so, expecting you to make the first move. After a certain amount of time has passed, you will have to decide whether or not to abandon your ""hard-to-get"" strategy. You can eventually call her first, but let her call you first the next time. You have to make it clear that you won't be doing all of the work. If she just expects to wait around for your call all day, it won't happen.

, Wait to let her bring these things up. If you start talking about these topics, she may feel uncomfortable or like you're coming on too strong. The longer you keep a girl desiring your words of affirmation or affection, the better it'll be when you finally decide to make your move; also, of course the greater the risk that she'll decide that you're simply not interested and move on. At this point, revealing that you were playing ""hard-to-get"" all along and are actually interested in her isn't likely to meet with an enthusiastic response.


You can let her know you like her in subtle ways, such as giving her compliments or saying that you like hanging out with her, but you shouldn't say anything too extreme or intense, like, ""I've never met a girl like you"" or ""I think I'm really falling for you,"" or your act will be over.

, Though the girl you like will quickly get bored if you act like you only have one free weekend a month, you don't want to make it seem like your schedule is wide open and that you would drop everything to hang out with the girl at any moment. If she invites you to hang out somewhere, you can tell her you're busy and suggest another time to meet. Or, if you're really eager to hang out, you can accept the invitation but make it seem like you have a busy week coming up after that. Find a balance between being around enough to get to know her and not looking like you have no social life.


As a rule, if the girl asks you what you're doing this weekend, and it's just a day or two away, you may not want to hang out. You don't want it to look like your weekends are always free — this may lead her to wonder why you have nothing going on on a Friday and Saturday night.

, Of course, if you want the girl to like you, then you'll have to show her some affection. But at first, you may not want to put your arm around her the second you sit down at the movies, or try to hold her hand when you're on a walk together. Wait until you've hung out a few times, or at least spent a few hours together, before you make a move. If you come on too strong before the girl is ready, then she'll be turned off. You have to find the moment to surprise and excite her with a bit of physical affection.


Taking your time — within reason — will keep the girl guessing because she'll keep wondering whether you like her and what you want while you're together. If you put your arm around her the second you pick her up for a date, then your intentions will be clear.

, After you hang out with the girl for an evening, don't stall too much or delay leaving. If you hang around flirting with the girl and looking into her eyes, she'll see that she has you hooked. Instead, make your way for the exit and let her know you had a great time. Stick around long enough that she's happy for the company, but not for so long that she wonders, ""When is this guy leaving already?""


This is true both for your dates and for when you run into each other in the halls. If you jump into a great conversation, say you have to go while the conversation is at its peak, not once you're running out of things to say. This will leave her wishing she could talk to you longer instead of struggling to come up with ways to fill an awkward silence.

, The trick to playing hard to get is to keep the girl interested while making her want more. If you reveal everything about yourself to her at once, then she won't feel like she has to do any work to get to know you. You should make your relationship feel like a challenge, and show her that you have to develop trust in people before opening up about the things that matter to you, the things that make you tick, and your fears and doubts. Every time you hang out with the girl, let her in a bit more.


The first time you're together, you can talk about something innocent, like your hobbies or your dog. The next time you hang out, you can tell her a bit more about your friends and family. The third time, you can talk about your dreams for the future or something else she wouldn't realize about you at first glance. This will make her see that you're an interesting person who is worth getting to know, instead of someone who tells her every little thing at once.

, Don't go overboard on trying to get her jealous or talking about other girls you like. She wants a mysterious man with power, not one who's a ladies' man and a jerk to her. This is especially pointless if you really are just going after one girl instead of trying to appear mysterious and elusive to a number of girls. There's a difference between playing it cool and not coming on too strong and just being downright mean. Make sure that you never play hard to get at the expense of a girl's feelings.


You can joke around with the girl as long as the jokes go both ways; don't make her feel like you're teasing her to be mean, but to flirt with her. If you put her down for real, she won't be interested.

, If you have to go somewhere, don't tell her every little detail about where you're going and what you have to do. While you shouldn't lie that you're going out on another date (or be open if you really are going out to womanize), you also don't have to tell her where you're going every time you have to leave. If you have to celebrate your Aunt Gerta's retirement this Saturday, just say that you have plans Saturday night. This is both telling the truth and leading the girl to wonder about your exciting weekend plans.


It's a fact: the more busy and mysterious you seem, the more the girl will want to be a part of your plans. Don't let her know that you're only busy because you have to babysit your little brother; if she imagines you going on an exotic date with a celebrity instead of taking your little brother to pee wee football practice, then all the better.

, After some time has passed, come back to her and let her know you're still interested. Ease up on the cold shoulder that you've been giving her. Come around a bit more, and be more sensitive than when you started. You've nudged your way into her heart already and you made her want you more than she would have if you didn't play hard to get. It's important to not make her wait too long when you play hard to get, otherwise she'll become frustrated and move on. Leave her hints and keep her locked into liking you.


If you tell her how you feel little by little instead of being completely secretive about it, she will appreciate it all the more. As you come to like the girl more, you can be more honest about your feelings. She'll see that sticking it out was worth it.

, The important thing with playing hard to get is to use good measure. As you journey down the road of playing hard to get, make sure she is still interested. You don't want to overdo the game; if you feel she is losing interest, then encourage her to pay attention to you, and pay more attention to her. Remember, it's a game, or if you prefer, a dance. If you act like you're completely unavailable and not really that interested, she will move on to a guy who is more open with his affection. You should let the girl know that you're interested without coming on too strong.

If you put off hanging out with the girl for weeks to look like you're super busy, then she'll start to look for someone with a more flexible schedule.
If you never compliment the girl or give her any indication that you like her, then she'll start to feel snubbed. It won't be any fun for her if you don't give her anything at all to work with. Think about it: would you keep hanging out with a girl who doesn't act like she really cares about you at all?

, Even if you've snagged the girl of your dreams by playing hard to get, you should always keep the relationship interesting by continuing the chase. This doesn't mean that you should be secretive about your feelings forever, or that you should act like you're busy when you're not, but that both you and the girl should feel like you have to work for each other's affection. Keep your relationship fresh, exciting, and interesting long after you've both said how much you like each other.


It should be mutual, of course. If your whole relationship is based on the girl trying to chase you while you remain mysterious, then she will tire of you quickly.

Always be prepared to meet a new girl.,
Dress neatly, in a fashion that reflects your personality.,

Be aware of the line between a friendly pick-up attempt and sexual harassment, and do not cross it.",How to Pick Up Girls While Walking Down the Street," If you are looking to pick to girls, it helps to be mentally and physically prepared to do so.


Before you go out, have a few funny anecdotes lined up, should the opportunity to talk to a girl arise.
Continually scan your environment for suitable candidates; you never know when a hottie is going to wander by.
Pay attention to your surroundings so that when an opportunity arises for small talk, you can quickly think up an icebreaker comment about something nearby.;
, If you are a slacker dressed in a business suit, the disconnect between your personality and your clothing is going to come across very quickly in conversation and confuse the girl, or make her uncomfortable. Dress in a way that advertises the kind of person you are, but do choose the nicest clothes of your preferred type that you have available. At very least, make sure that your clothing and hair are clean and presentable.
If you’ve got a few extra bucks to spend, invest in a new pair of shoes.

, If you want to pick up girls, you need to go to where they are. Choose a place with a lot of foot traffic to hang out, such as a street with many restaurants, the sidewalk outside of a popular coffee shop, or the arcade in front of a big bookstore. Also, plan your search for a time of day when the girls who walk by are likely to have a bit of time to spare.People who are rushing to get to work or or an early class are unlikely to be in the mood to stop and chat. Aim for the lunch hour, or mid-morning, when many people go out for a coffee break.

, Most women will be put off by a man (or woman) slouching on a street corner, calling out to various girls as they walk by. No one enjoys being harassed in the street! Your advance will seem far less threatening and contrived if it appears you are busy or out running errands.


Even though you may actually just be walking around aimlessly looking for girls, it’s best to have some kind of destination in mind, in case an opportunity for conversation or an invitation arises (“I was just on my way to the Farmer’s market, would you care to join me?”)
You can also try “getting lost” in the vicinity of a known destination, so you can ask a girl for directions. (“I was just looking for the Apple store, but seem to be turned around. Can you help me out?”)

, If a girl who catches your attention, try to quickly make eye contact and smile as you walk past her. Don’t stare for too long, and then look away for a few seconds to give her a chance to look you over, if she is also interested.

, If you glance back and catch her looking at you, smile and give a quick wave. If she smiles or waves back, walk right up to her. Then proceed straight to the third part : Starting the Conversation.


If you do not see her looking back, that does not necessarily mean she is not interested. She may not have seen you, or you may have missed her glance. You’re going to have to keep at it to find out.
If you do catch her looking back, and she quickly turns away from you and walks on, that’s a signal that she knows you were trying to connect with her, and is brushing you off. Let this one go.

, You can either walk quickly to catch up to her, or follow her until she reaches a crosswalk and has to stop. Walk a few blocks if you have to, in order to approach her in a calm and natural fashion.Do not tap her on the back or startle her from behind. This can come across as threatening.
It would also be inappropriate and frightening to the woman if you were to run after her, or approach her all sweaty and out of breath. As Han Solo once advised, “fly casual.”

, There is a huge difference between following a person for a few blocks in order to catch up and introduce yourself, and stalking someone. Do not follow the girl for more than two or three blocks, and pay close attention to her signals. If she does not make it easy for you to catch up to her, she is most likely not interested.


If the girl seems to be speeding up, making it hard for you to catch up, she is aware of your approach, and trying to shake you off.
If she gets out her phone to make a call, this is another strategy for shaking off an unwanted advance. Take it as a hint to back off and leave her alone.
Do not try to follow her until she is done with her call, or the next call she makes could be to the police.
Don’t follow a person into an office building or other place of business.
If she casually wanders into a coffee shop or store, you may try approaching her there, but bear in mind that there is a good chance she is alarmed by your approach, and looking for witnesses and/or assistance in getting rid of you.

, You might startle her if you begin talking without warning, so it’s good to open with something along the lines of “Excuse me, but I saw you walk by a few minutes ago, and just wanted to say ‘hi’. . . “ and go from there.

, If you don’t feel comfortable starting with “excuse me,” try making a brief comment about something in the surrounding area.If you are standing in front of a restaurant, you might say “Something smells good, doesn’t it?”
If a bus just drove off leaving a person behind at the stop, you might remark “TriMet, right?” and give her a knowing glance.

, Better yet, try for a compliment that invites some kind of explanation or response. Is she wearing an interesting hat? Say “Cool hat, where did you get it?.” Does she have a unique hair color? Try: “Your hair is amazing, what would you call that shade?” Is she sporting the t-shirt of your favorite band? Tell her that it's one of your favorites and ask her if she saw their show at the last (awesome) venue.


Crass compliments about butts and sexiness will offend many women, so it’s best to avoid them.

, 55 % of human communication is visual, and another 38% is vocal, so your body language and how you speak are both far more important than anything you actually have to say.Smile and maintain eye contact.

Try to keep the pitch of your voice low, and resist the temptation to speak too quickly.

, Try to stay in the conversation for two full minutes, even if you fear the conversation is boring. Talk about the weather, or current events. Ask her if she did anything fun over the weekend, or if she’s seen the newest Marvel flick. It doesn’t matter what you say, so long as you keep her talking. The longer the conversation goes on, the better your chances are of making a connection. You should probably aim to keep talking for a good five to ten minutes before asking for her number.

, If your initial conversation has gone well, go ahead and take the next step. You aren’t going to get to know everything about each other right there in the middle of the street. Ask her for her number, and let her know that you’ll be calling or texting her soon. Then tell her how happy you are to have met her, and let her get on with her day.If you have some free time, you could invite her to walk with you for a bit, or sit down for a cup of coffee, but the anticipation of having to wait to get to know you more can often work to your advantage, so don’t prolong it too long.

, Oftentimes, the girl that you approach simply won’t be interested in you. In some cases, especially if your approach was awkward or inadvertently threatening, she may be frightened, irritated by, or even angry at your advance. Be mindful of the signals she gives off, and always be respectful.


If the woman fails to respond, does not return your smile, or looks away when you attempt eye contact, she is probably not interested and is trying to be polite about it. Take the hint and move on!
If she turns away, or walks off, do not try to follow her, just let her go and don’t take it personally.
If she says something rude to you, don’t retaliate. Remember that YOU are the one who tried to intrude on her life uninvited, not the other way around. If you feel like you have to say something, say “I’m sorry to have bothered you,” or “Have a great day!” and leave it at that.

, Sexual harassment laws vary by region, but in most places, making unwanted sexual advances towards another person is a criminal offense. Keep your interactions with the girls you try to pick up respectful and polite. Don’t say anything to a girl you just met that you wouldn’t tell in front of your grandmother or a priest ! Back away at the first sign of disinterest.

It is a playful way to draw attention to it while not being a jerk about it.

You may have to test out a few things before you truly understand where the boundaries are. Trust your instincts and watch for clues about how she feels., If your flirting falls flat, make sure you don't take your bad attempt out on her. Also, if you offend her, make sure you apologize.

Don't try to play it off as if she is being too sensitive., If you have just met the girl, you can't tease her the same way you can a girl you've been dating for a few months. Making jokes about sex or inappropriately touching her are things you should avoid early on in a relationship. Make sure you aren't overly vulgar if that is going to make her uncomfortable. If you don’t know her very well, you’ll either freak her out or get a reputation as a jerk., When you tease her, don't make it feel like a personal critique of something about her or something that is important to her. If she is really into saving animals, don't try to tease her with lines like: ""Wow, you have a lot of cats. Does that make you a crazy cat lady?"" If her passion means a lot to her, she could take the critique too harshly and you could make her feel uncomfortable.


If you disagree with something she believes, try teasing her instead with something trivial to alleviate the tension. If you disagree about politics, don't critique the way she feels. Instead of insulting her views, say something like: ""While I can't fault you for your opinion here, if you tell me you like Bach instead of Beethoven, then I think the date might be over."" This moves the topic to something more trivial and helps stop an argument."

It helps to create an intense emotional connection between the two people locking eyes.

A few seconds of lingering eye contact is enough to signal interest, but also quick enough to pass off as a mistake if she isn’t seem interested.;
, When you lock eyes, make sure you have a pleasant expression on your face. Smiling projects confidence and friendliness, and most people respond favorably to that. If he’s interested, he’ll definitely smile back.If you want to enhance your smile with a laugh when he says something, go ahead. A little giggle or chuckle helps indicate your interest, but you can always pass it off as something being funny.

, Keep your head up, arms open and your feet pointed in the direction of the person you are trying to attract. This subtly shows that you are focused on her and what she has to say. Avoid closed off behavior like crossing your arms, which keeps people out.Also look for ways to draw attention to your physical attributes, though of course these are different for men and women.For men, try to find postures that make you appear taller and more impressive. This can be putting your hands in your pockets with your elbows out, or leaning against the wall with one hand above your shoulder.For women, find postures that accentuate your physique. Try postures and positions that draw attention to your physical attributes, such as arching your back to push out your chest, or deliberately cross and uncross your legs.Try to keep your body position natural. Spreading your legs too far apart, say beyond the width of your shoulders, is an aggressive posture, which makes you look threatening or sexually suggestive.

, Don’t get right into her face, but make sure you incline your head or body in her direction, especially if she is talking to you. This will show you are interested in what she is saying without having to say it directly.

This is also effective if you are with a group of people. Leaning in the direction of that one person can signal your interest. Subconsciously, he may even begin to lean back in your direction, which increases the chances for making eye contact and other signs of attraction.If you are closer together, and don’t want to risk any kind of physical contact, this is a good way to move a little bit closer to her without invading her personal space.

, Make your body position match his. This kind of positioning will make him think more favorably of you, even if he doesn’t exactly notice what you are doing. Notice something like how he has positioned his arms, and try to match that.You don’t want to overdo it and be an exact mirror image. This is especially true if it puts you in an unnatural or awkward position like having your legs crossed, or leaning on something you shouldn’t be.

, You don’t want to grab the other person, just something brief to make it look like an accident, or you just got overly excited. The physical connection should be enough to get her attention, and suggest your interest in her is more than just friendly.The best way to pull this off is to stand close to her. Grab the seat next to her, or at least move next to her when you want to start talking. In general, it’s harder to flirt from across the room.
You can touch her arm to emphasize a point, or brush your hand against hers. Play up the spontaneity by apologizing for the contact.
If you are in a crowded space, you can “accidentally” bump into her. You are trying to avoid being obvious here, so if you are somewhere with lots of space between you two, don’t try this one.
Notice her reaction to any contact. If she smiles, increases eye contact, or responds to your apology with something like “I don’t mind” or “That’s alright,” that’s a good sign. Alternatively, if she jumps back or frowns, you know there isn’t much interest., If you feel the tension building, excuse yourself. Don’t attempt to ask for a number or set up a date. If the other person is interested, he’ll follow you or try to make a move before you step away.When you step away, you can always say something like “It was good to talk to you” to emphasize that you enjoyed the conversation. Avoid baiting the other person with lines like “We should do this again sometime.”
You can always spare a quick glace backward to see if you catch his eye again, or check if he’s following you, but don’t linger.

, If people are around when you try to flirt, it can hurt your chances to be both subtle and successful. Keep the interaction friendly, but not flirtatious, until the two of you are by yourselves.Other people may see you as competition, and try to break up the interaction. Alternatively, they may not like watching other people flirt, especially if you are in a professional environment like an office.
People also act different when they are alone, so your target might not be willing to play along if there are others around.

, Even simple phrases like “Hello” can be said in a variety of ways to indicate personal feeling. A change in tone, using a “sexier” voice, can signal interest without you having to change the words.Keep your voice lower, and add a rising inflection to the end of your sentences, as if you were asking as question. This is a subtle maneuver that encourages your target to continue the conversation, without directly signaling interest.

, If he tells you his name, make sure you keep using it when talking to him. This suggests he is important to you, and keeps your conversation directed at him.


This is also a good way to help remember a person’s name, which you can always give as an excuse if he starts to ask why you are doing it.

, Liking the same things is a good start to further compatibility.You will need to be paying attention to when your target talks to you to find her interest. Listen to music she puts on, or foods she likes, then give some vague approval like “Good call. I love this song.”
This can also work when paying simple compliments. A polite “I like that shirt” or “You look nice today” suggests you are paying attention to what she is doing. Just try to avoid being more explicit, or giving more than one compliment for the same thing, as that is too obvious.Of course, you don’t want to lie in this instance. If your tastes clash it’s better not to pretend.

, Regularly showering, keeping your hair brushed or combed, and making sure your breath is fresh will make you more attractive to those around you, including the person you want to notice you. Besides, you never know when you’ll run into him, so you want to be prepared.This is always better to do before running into the person you want to flirt with. Chances are he won’t notice if you excuse yourself to the bathroom to re-apply makeup partway through your conversation.Artificial scents like perfume or cologne can be helpful, but apply lightly. You want your natural scent to come out a little as well, and no one likes getting a strong whiff of cologne just because you walked into the room., Your clothes can say a lot about you if you let them. Dressing well can help draw the other person’s attention, even if he doesn’t realize you don’t usually dress like that. Aside from specifics for different genders, you’ll want your clothes to be neat and fit you well.For women, look for softer colors that signal romance, like pink or coral. For style, accentuate your curves, especially those parts of your body that you want the guy to look at.For men, your clothes should be clean and wrinkle-free. Nice shoes, instead of a ragged pair of old sneakers, can help as well. In terms of color, red is always good for drawing attention, and projecting an image of strength and confidence.If your target compliments your clothing, be sure to thank him. Adding a line like “Thanks for noticing” can slyly suggest you wanted him to notice. Just avoid more explicit comments like “I wore it for you,” which is too obvious.

, If you want to be subtle with your flirting, you are probably hoping the other person makes the first move. To encourage him, do something visible that expresses something you are interested in so he’ll have an excuse to start talking to you.This should be a visual cue, like letting him see the cover of the book you are reading, or subtly tilting your phone in his direction so he can see the music you are listening to. You may need to do some guessing about his interests, but that can be part of the fun.
This can be especially true when flirting with guys, as men usually prefer to initiate conversation.

, If you have a phone number, or some other contact information, send a quick text reminding her of something fun you did together. Texting is better than calling because it gives the other person room to ignore your message if she isn’t interested, or gives her time to craft a funny or witty response.Keep your message short and to the point. A brief reminder of how nice it was to meet, or a reminder about how you are still laughing at a joke she told, is a good icebreaker. Most importantly, it lets her know that she is on your mind.

, If your target suggested his likes a certain kind of book, music, or movie, lend him your copy (or something similar). It will keep the conversation going about something you two both like, and show him you listen to his interests.


Perhaps most importantly, you’ll have an excuse to see him again when he returns the item.

, Not everyone will notice or react to your flirting right away. Keep at it for a few minutes, or try a few different techniques to make sure the other person really isn’t interested before cutting off your attempts. Don’t be afraid to try another time either."

Use the right body language.,
Keep the conversation playful.,
Compliment your crush.,
Use touch sparingly.,
Let only your crush see that you’re flirting.,
Keep it short.",How to Flirt Without Getting a Bad Reputation2," When you’re talking to your crush, use subtle body language to show your interest. Using non-verbal cues is a great way of letting your crush know you’re interested in them, even if everyone around you has no idea!Turn your whole body, in particular your torso, feet and face, toward your crush as you talk. This will show your crush that you are interested in what they have to say and that you have their undivided attention.
Mirror your crush’s body stance and gestures to subconsciously communicate to him or her that the two of you are in sync.
Stand or sit closer to your crush than you would to a friend. Getting in your crush’s personal space shows them that you are comfortable with being close to them.
Look at your crush’s mouth. While your crush is talking, look into their eyes, then flick your eyes downward toward their mouth. This may awaken your crush’s desire to give you a kiss!

, Aim to keep the conversation light and fun. Smile while you are talking to your crush, and if the moment is right, gently joke or tease them about something. Joking with your crush is a great way to take the conversation into flirting territory.For instance, if you run into your crush constantly you could say, “I’ve been seeing you everywhere! I have to ask, are you following me?”
Remember to smile and speak with a playful tone of voice so your crush knows that you are joking.
Don’t make a joke that is overly sexual. This could make the person you are flirting with feel uncomfortable, which is the opposite of what you want!

, Complimenting your crush is an innocent yet effective way of flirting that shows that your interest. A compliment is a great tool to use because on the surface it just seems like a nice thing to say, but in the context of your conversation it’s a subtle way to be flirty.Some compliments you might give include:


“You have the best hair! It always looks amazing!”
“I saw you score at the game the other day. You are so athletic!”
“I love this shirt on you. The color really complements your eyes.”

, Touch is a powerful tool to use during flirting when used correctly. If your crush seems receptive to your flirtations in general, do something like touching your crush’s arm when you are laughing at their jokes. Even a brief, friendly touch can change the dynamic of the conversation and bring it to the next level.Touch your crush on a place like their shoulder or arm, rather than an area that may feel too intimate.
Don’t touch your crush more than once or twice in the course of the conversation. If you’re hanging onto your crush or too insistent on physical contact, it will make your crush uncomfortable and may cause the people around you to talk.

, Try to flirt in a way that is apparent only to your crush. Communicate your interest with your eyes and your tone of voice so that the fact that you’re flirting isn’t immediately obvious to those around you.If you are a very friendly or touchy-feely person, try to tone these aspects down. Even though they are part of your personality, if your crush or the people around you don’t already know you well, your flirting could seem over the top!

, Aim to keep your conversation short and playful so that you leave your crush intrigued. It’s better to have a brief, flirty conversation than a long, lackluster one. If you leave your crush feeling like they want more, they’ll initiate flirtatious conversation in the future and take some of the pressure off you!

Be yourself.,
Dress casually.,
Keep your social media tame.,
Don’t sext.,
Don’t flirt with everyone.,
Keep your love life private.",How to Flirt Without Getting a Bad Reputation3," The simplest way to maintain a great image is to be true to who you are and to be willing to share that honestly with other people. If you are still exploring your identity, then that is fine. Enjoy the process of finding who you are and what you like.

Try to avoid presenting yourself as something you are not to get someone to like you. It is important to find people who like and accept you for who you are. If you pretend to be something you are not, then this will become clear to people eventually.

, Dress in a way that is comfortable for you. Don’t dress in a way that you think others might find impressive. To avoid looking like you’re trying too hard, wear clothes that are casual and comfortable but still make you look good.Try to choose clothes that flatter your body and that you feel comfortable wearing. Avoid wearing clothes that are too tight or that make you feel self-conscious.

, Sometimes it’s easy to forget how many people can see your social media, including the gossipers in your life. Instead of posting directly to your crush’s page on social media, try texting or messaging them instead. This will keep your flirtations out of the public eye.If you are worried about your reputation in general, don’t post provocative pictures of yourself on social media. This will definitely garner attention, but it may not be the attention that you want.

, When you are texting or messaging your crush, don’t send explicit pictures or messages. Many people, younger girls in particular, think that they need to send these kinds of messages to get the attention of their crush. This is not true, and if the recipient of these texts decides to share them with his friends, he could do a lot of harm to your reputation.Even if your crush asks for these kind of texts, remember that you don’t owe them to him and that there are other ways to flirt.
Keep in mind that sexting may even be illegal if your crush is under the age of consent and you are over the age of consent (or vice versa).

, Save flirting for people that you are genuinely interested in. If you flirt with everyone in your class, you’ll get a reputation as a “player” or as someone who is desperate for a girlfriend or boyfriend. Even if you are just having harmless fun, flirting with a large amount of people can cause damage to your reputation.Be very careful to not flirt with a group of friends. For instance, if you flirt with one girl and she doesn’t seem into you, don’t flirt with her friends right after her. This will make you seem inconsiderate and shallow.

, Don’t make your love life the stuff of cafeteria gossip. Confide the details of your personal life only to trusted friends and acquaintances. Even if many people know your dating history or who you have asked out, stay mum about this aspect of your life, especially around people you know like to gossip.

Show her that you're attracted to her.,
Use your eyes.,
Be confident.,
Touch her.,
Smile at her.",How to Flirt With Your Girlfriend1," Go out of your way to touch her, look at her, and create sexual attention. Make her feel wanted! You may notice that you aren't doing these things because you're embarrassed, or insecure, or unsure of how she will react. If she is your girlfriend, and you've been intimate with each other, and you're attracted to her, then you don't need to hold back. Let your hormones take control from time to time, and show her that she is the object of your animal urges.;
, Let your gaze rest on her when she's working on something, when she's in the other room, or when she just looks particularly beautiful. Do not worry about being weird! You're attracted to her, and she's attracted to you, and there's nothing wrong with owning that dynamic by staring at her.When she asks you what you're looking at, tell her how beautiful she looks. Only say it if you truly mean it!

, Do not hesitate to flirt with your girlfriend. She is your girlfriend because the two of you have entered into a verbal agreement – so there's a pretty good chance that she likes you and wants your attention. Many people find confidence sexy. Own it!

, Don't be afraid to get casually physical. Touch is one of the most powerful ways to build attraction and sexual tension.

However, it doesn't need to be overtly sexual. A light touch can be enough to signal that you're thinking about her, and it can go a long way toward reestablishing intimacy.

Put your arm around her when you're watching a movie, or hug her from behind while she's standing at the counter. Run your fingers through her hair. Touch her arm, gently, when you pass her in the hall.
Don't be afraid to get more sexual if you're comfortable being intimate with one another. Grab her butt, or caress her thigh. If you're in a private place: walk up behind her, put your hands around her waist, and grind slowly into her body.
Hold her hand! This is a great way to flirt, and it can also break the touch barrier if you're in a new relationship. You don't need to come up with a reason to hold her hand; if you feel it, do it., Even if you are upset, or stressed out, or thinking about something else: take the time to be present and smile a lot in her presence. There's something about a guy's smile that can really turn a girl on. Girls like genuine smiles, not just flirtatious smiles. Don't try too hard on this one. Just think positive thoughts and let your face do the work.

Keep the conversation going.",How to Flirt With Women," This may seem simple, but it's baffling how many guys don't take hygiene seriously. Physical attractiveness isn't the most important thing when it comes to being able to approach a woman you are interested in flirting with. Even if you don't consider yourself attractive, a little personal maintenance can go a long way.


This includes things like wearing clean clothes, showering every day, using deodorant in the morning, brushing your teeth, making sure your hair looks presentable, etc.;
, This does not mean that you should be overly arrogant and brag about every wonderful thing in your life. But it does mean that you should go into a flirting encounter acknowledging your value as a person so that the object of your flirtation will pick up on this.


Women are receptive to how people feel about themselves and they will pick up on it if you have no faith in yourself.

, Smiling sends a positive initial message, and can also raise a woman’s first impression of you before you even decide to start flirting with her.

, Research shows that about 93% of our communication is non-verbal, with only 7% of communication happening through our actual words.Because of this, body language is by far the most powerful weapon you have in your romantic arsenal. Understanding how to employ body language in your favor will overshadow almost any other mistake that you might make during the flirting process.

, This basically means that you should imitate the other person's tone of voice, facial expressions, etc.This will make the other person feel at ease with you and build rapport between you both.

, Having an open demeanor is what you should aim for when flirting with women. This means that you need to avoid crossing your arms (i.e. closing your body) or legs. Crossing your arms can be viewed as trying to put a barrier between yourself and the other person.Try to keep your arms hanging at your sides if you are standing. And if you are sitting, open your legs toward the woman, if possible, and rest your arms on the tops of your legs, with your hands dangling between your legs. This stance demonstrates confidence and openness., This goes back to creating an open feeling between you and the woman you're flirting with. Tilting your head towards a person lets them know you're listening. Tilting your body towards a person lets them know you are fully engaged in the conversation.

, A small touch can let a woman know you are interested in more than just talking to her.Try complimenting her on her necklace and touching it briefly or lightly touching her arm as you laugh at something funny she's said.

, The first initial interaction with a woman will set the stage for the remainder of the encounter, so it is important to choose your approach wisely. It is possible to


Research shows that women are more receptive to third-party introductions or direct introductions than to cute-flippant lines, compliments, or attempts at humor.So, your best bet is to find someone who knows the girl you want to flirt with and have them introduce you to her.

, We communicate in many different ways. Body language, as discussed earlier, is very important, as is verbal communication. Both types of communication can be very powerful, so attention must be paid to both.


Studies have shown that women employ more nonverbal flirting cues than men, but that they are prone to anticipate and expect more verbal flirting cues from the men who flirt with them.As such, men who employ nonverbal flirting cues when engaging with flirtations with women might not be received as positively as men who employ more verbal flirting cues, which is what women are prone to expect. These men might even be viewed as less masculine because they are implementing flirting techniques that are considered to be more feminine.

, Notice if she is leaning in towards you or offering you small, quick smiles. Both of these are good signs and indicate that you should continue. If, however, she is not smiling or is constantly looking away, take this as an indicator that she is not receptive to your advances.


Recognizing these types of physical cues is an ability that is very much instinctual. Because reproduction is necessary for the continuation of our species, we can inherently tell when another person is a good potential mate. In animal/instinctual terms, these physical cues are signals that you don't intend to dominate, nor do you intend to flee--both useful messages potential mates need to send before they can proceed to intercourse/reproduction. , Remember that women respond better to direct introductions, so keep this in mind. Smile as you approach and maintain open, confident body language.

, Say hello and tell her your name. Or, better yet, have a mutual acquaintance introduce you to each other. Shake her hand firmly to show you are confident in yourself and that you respect her.

, There are many ways to make women laugh. You can try walking a tricky line by integrating two things that normally wouldn't be good at all by themselves: arrogance and stupid humor.


If you're arrogant, she won't want anything to do with you, and if you just make stupid funny comments all the time she's going to think you're just a clown and won't take you seriously. But when you mix these two tactics together, the combination becomes something that'll draw the girl's attention to you like a magnet to metal.
You've probably heard and seen things about nice guys finishing last and that jerks always get the girl. This is often because the nice guys don't use this technique, but the jerks do. This technique is effective because it shows the woman that you're funny and that you can laugh at yourself (by laughing at your own implied, pretend arrogance).

, Do this by asking her questions!


Ask questions about the environment (What do you think about the band playing at this party? or Have you tried the food here?) or about things happening in the world (How do you like that new comedy movie?).
And remember, a person's favorite topic to talk about is always themselves.
If you're planning on truly getting the girl you must become the girl. Find out what her interests are, her style, sense of humor, likes and dislikes, and other things that make her her. That way she may feel comfortable when you approach her. Then mimic and compliment her voice and other traits with yours.

Appreciate her.,
Declare your feelings for her.,
Write notes.,
Give her something sweet.",How to Flirt With Your Girlfriend2," Every day, find the opportunity to compliment her about small things: tell her that she's beautiful, or that you love it when she sings, or that you admire the way that she stood up to her frustrating boss. Don't just recycle the same compliments! Try to think of something new to say. This is not just about giving her a compliment – it's about challenging yourself to continually appreciate your girlfriend for the unique, beautiful, and always-growing human being that she is.


Find unique and genuine ways to phrase your compliments. Don't just say, ""You're really beautiful."" Say, ""Sometimes I am just so captivated by how gorgeous you are. I can't stop staring at you today.""
Don't just appreciate her physical beauty. Show her that you appreciate her personality, her creativity, her intellect – the things that really make her who she is. Try to compliment her on the qualities that you know are important to her.

, A romantic declaration isn't always as playful as some of the other flirting methods, but it can make your girlfriend feel warm, safe, and loved. She might even respond to your words with a physical demonstration of that love! It's always important to check in with your partner and affirm your feelings, especially if you think that she might feel insecure about the state of your relationship. Tell her that you love her, or that you really like her, or just that you think she's awesome. When you feel it, say it!

, Send her a sweet ""good morning"" text message to wake up to. Leave a physical note on her bathroom mirror, her car window, or her locker at school. Make her a card, or draw her a picture, or write her a poem. Tell her that you love her, or that she is awesome, or that you're thinking of her. The medium and the message don't matter so much as the act of showing her that you care.

If she is having a big day, write her a note that encourages her and inspires her. ""Go get 'em, tiger! You're brilliant, and you're going to ace this test today!"" or ""You've got this. Play hard and good luck!""

, Bring her flowers, or a box of chocolates, or a book that you think she'd like. Bake something for her, or make something for her, or give her something pretty that you've found. You never need a reason to give your girlfriend a thoughtful gift.

The gift can be something incredibly simple. When you meet up with her, bring her favorite snack or a bottle of her favorite drink. It is truly the thought that counts.
Ask her what her favorite flower is. Not every girl has a favorite flower – but many do. You can use this knowledge again and again, or you can surprise her with new flower types that make you think of her.
Consider hand-making something for her. Write her a song, or paint her a picture, or fold a piece of origami, or whittle her something from a piece of wood. She will appreciate the time you spend.

"
"
Make her laugh.,
Be present.,
Take her out.,
Surprise her.",How to Flirt With Your Girlfriend3," Using your sense of humor is a wonderful way to flirt around. It's good to be able to talk about serious things – but don't let your relationship itself become too starchy and serious! Relax and have fun every once in a while. Don't be afraid to get goofy and let your true self shine!

, Put away your phone, your computer, and your other devices when she's around. If you are always fixated on other things when you're hanging out with your girlfriend, she might feel as though you don't value her time. Listen to her, and make it clear that she has your full attention. This is one of the simplest ways to make your girlfriend—or anyone, really—feel wanted and appreciated.


Keep perspective. Your phone isn't going to go anywhere. You can call that person back. Indeed, it can be a great, simple romantic gesture if you make a show of seeing your phone buzz, then decisively turning it off and putting it away.
If you absolutely need to take a call or send a text, just explain yourself and get it over with. Say, ""I'm sorry to be rude and text while we're at dinner! I just want to send this quick text to my brother so that I can give you my full attention.""

, Set some plans in advance, but remember to be spontaneous! Create new experiences together, and make her feel as though her life is an adventure. This can be as simple as a trip to the movies, or as involved as a spur-of-the-moment trip to Hawaii. It can be easy to fall into a routine when you're always going to the same places and doing the same things together. She's your girlfriend, now, but that doesn't mean that you should stop dating her!


Take her on a trip for the day or the weekend. Go camping, or to the beach, or to a new city. Shake the patterns of the everyday, and see how it spices up your love life!
Find something that neither of you have ever done before. Explore the world together. Choose experiences that enrich and excite you both.

, Not every girl likes surprises. If she does, however, a mystery date or an unexpected visit to her workplace can be a great way to show her that you're thinking about her. Building anticipation can also be a great way to create sexual tension and get her thinking about you

Don’t hide your youth, either.It might seem like you don't have enough in common with him to hold his interest.,
Be yourself.Older men have had more time to figure out who they are, and they’re usually secure in their personalities, likes, and dislikes.,
Make eye contact.,
Touch your hair and neck.,
Be aware of your body language.",How to Flirt With Older Men," When younger women talk to older men, they sometimes feel the need to explain in detail what precisely they like about older men. This might make the man feel like you're after a ""type,"" not a person.


Instead of starting with why you're attracted to older men in general, focus first on why you want to talk to him specifically.

Do you like his salt and pepper hair? Is he particularly well-dressed? Did you overhear him talking about a subject that interested you?;
, You want him to feel relaxed and comfortable with you, so let him decide whether he wants to talk about the elephant in the room. If he never brings up the age difference, that's fine. Discussing other subjects suggests you're not attracted to each other because of your ages. But, if he does bring up how much younger you are than him, don't shy away from the conversation.


After assuring him that you're interested in him for himself, you can move on to a discussion of why you may prefer older men in general.
Don't dwell on past relationships, but speak in broad terms about what you think older men have to offer that men your age don't.
Financial stability should not be the focus of this conversation. Think about all the other things older men can offer — emotional stability, perspective, a calmer lifestyle.

, Different men will have different approaches to dealing with the issue of financial stability. Let him choose how much he wants to reveal about his employment.


If you steer the conversation toward his job, he might wonder if you're flirting with him only because you think he's rich.
On the other hand, he may want to show off his great job. Let him use it as a flirting asset, just like you're using your youth!

, Even if he doesn't choose to talk about his job, make a point of telling him about yours.


Don't discuss the specifics of your salary, of course. But talking about your job lets him know subtly that you're a workingwoman who can take care of herself.
If you're at a bar and he tries to pay for your tab, thank him, but laugh it off. Say, ""You're so sweet, but you don't have to do that!""

, If there's one thing adults of all ages can agree on, it's that there's nothing more irritating than a younger person who thinks they know better. While you don't have to agree with everything he says, don't contradict him constantly. Some people worry about growing ""out of touch"" with current ways of thinking as they get older. You want to make him feel ""experienced,"" but not ""old.""


A good way to deal with a difference of opinion is to treat it as a learning experience. Instead of emphasizing how much you disagree, ask him to explain why he feels the way he does.
Listen thoughtfully and openly. You don't have to change your mind, but you've shown him that you respect him enough to want to understand him.
Of course, if he holds personal opinions you find offensive, feel free to give him an earful and walk away. Don't sacrifice your principles just to date someone.

, Although you should respect his opinions, you also want to show him that you have a mind of your own.A difference of opinion can often result in an absorbing discussion instead of an argument. What man wouldn't go crazy for a woman who can turn a disagreement into great conversation?


Relax your facial expression to let him know you're not getting worked up about any differences of opinion.
Be able to laugh about how far apart you might be on an issue.
If you're lucky, you might have found someone who's actually on the same page as you. In that case, celebrate!

, Your youth is one of your biggest assets when flirting with an older man. Use it to your advantage! When you get ready to go out at night, wear fashion styles that set you apart from older women. Of course, you shouldn't dress like a teenager. You don't want him thinking about you dragging him to One Direction concerts! Wear clothes that look good on a woman in her mid twenties or thirties, but might look a little strange on a woman in her forties.


To older men, the most attractive thing about young women is that they're already at the ideal age. You don't have to try to look older or younger. You're already in the sweet spot!

, He sees you, and he can already tell you’re a younger woman. You don’t have to play up your youth to get his attention in conversation. Own your age, but don’t make it the central focus of the conversation. Highlighting it repeatedly (“That’s my dad’s favorite song!”) might make the conversation grow tiresome for him. He might also start thinking of you as a pretty face without substance.Instead of spending your time talking about how young you are, focus instead on how mature you are for your age.

, For example, he may bring up children, mortgages, 70s music, or any number of other things you have no experience with. Don't fake your way through the conversation, pretending you understand what parenthood is like. He'll see right through it.


Make sure you don't come off as childish. You're young, but not frivolous. Instead of saying ""I have no idea how mortgages work,"" steer the conversation toward something he wants to talk about. Ask him what he likes about home ownership, for example.
Even if he focuses about how hard something is, just smile and say ""I haven't experienced it yet, but I can't wait to.""
If he wants to share an experience with you, agree to keep an open mind: “I don’t really like music from before the 80s, but I’ll give it a shot if you think I’ll like it.”

, They want the same thing in a woman, even if she's younger. Listen to him talk about himself, but also share who you are. If you're actually looking for a calmer lifestyle than the one you led when you were younger, say so. If you still enjoy ripping it up with the girls on the weekend, own it. Don't apologize for it — it's part of what makes you you.

, Don’t challenge him to a staring contest, but connect with him through his eyes. Maintaining eye contact shows that you're both confident in yourself and drawn to him.

, These are very personal areas on the body. Even our oldest, closest friends don't usually touch our necks. The neck and hair are off-limits to everyone but sexual partners, for the most part. Draw attention to them to let him know what you're thinking.

, This applies to all flirting, not just flirting with older men. Note that much of this body language might suggest you're interested in a sexual relationship. Consider his feelings and your personal safety. Don't make him think you're sexually interested if you're not. But if you are interested, what you say with your body might come across more clearly than what you say with your words.


Draw attention to your lips: nibble your lower lip, purse your lips when you're thinking, or apply a nice, bright lip balm. Make him think about kissing you.
Don't be too shy to touch him: rest your hand on his when you laugh at something he says, or place it on his shoulder when you lean in to share something private.
Don't cross your arms: this makes you seem closed off.Lean toward him to close the distance between you.

Ask yourself why you want to flirt with your boss? Are you bored? Do you feel an attraction to your boss that you think could develop into a real relationship? Are you trying to gain some kind of advantage or favor in the workplace? Knowing why you are interested in flirting will help you determine if it's worth the risk.


A bit of casual flirting with your boss might attract just enough extra attention to land you that key assignment you were hoping for, or help you secure a more desirable shift. Of course, this could also backfire depending on the culture of your workplace.;
, Do you intend to simply flirt and leave it at that, or are you hoping to eventually begin a romantic relationship with your boss? Figure out what your limits are, and don't offer more than you intend to offer. Leading someone on is unlikely to get you anything you want., Relationships in the workplace, especially between supervisors and employees, are prohibited in many companies. Getting involved with your boss might put one or both of you at risk for losing your jobs. If your flirting is unwelcome or excessive, you also run the risk of crossing the line from flirtation into sexual harassment, which in many offices can result in immediate termination.Finally, you might run the risk of losing your credibility or reputation for trustworthiness at work.Even after-hours interactions with your boss can be used as a legal basis for one or both of you to be fired, so beware!Research the relationship guidelines in your workplace before proceeding. If they aren't published, ask an HR person for assistance.
If you are afraid to make these inquiries because you fear that people will gossip, remember that they will gossip even more if you get involved with your boss, so factor that into your decision.

, If your flirting doesn't get you in trouble at work, it could still make you very unpopular. Other coworkers might look down on you for flirting with the boss, or become jealous if it looks like you are getting special treatment because of your flirting. You might also suffer from considerable embarrassment if the flirting goes badly, or you do end up in a relationship that doesn't end well.

, You've decided that it's worth the risk, and you want to go ahead and flirt with your boss. Now be careful! Since there are so many possible risks, the best approach is to be very sensitive to any responses you might receive for your efforts, and subtle enough with your behavior that you can deny that flirting was your intention if it doesn't go off as planned. Try to flirt without looking like you are flirting., Making and holding eye contact is the first lesson of Flirting 101, and is sometimes the only tool you need to convey your interest in another person. Eye contact is an equally effective tool for men and for women, and can even make someone feel more attracted to you.Try to catch your bosses eye in a meeting and hold his or her gaze a bit longer than you normally would.
When your boss addresses you, be sure to look her directly in the eye when she speaks to you.
Create more opportunities for eye contact by intentionally walking past your boss's office more often, or arranging in person meetings in lieu of phone calls or emails.
Note that it takes more than a single passing glance to get the message across. It might take between 3 and 13 soulful looks for your boss to realize that you are trying to signal attraction.Too much eye contact, however, can quickly become creepy, so be attentive to how you are being received. If your boss tries to avoid your gaze or seems shifty or uncomfortable, be sure to back off.

, It seems like a simple piece of advice, but there are few things more appealing than a friendly, genuine smile. Interestingly enough, crow's feet are the marker of a happy, non-forced smile, so don't worry about any wrinkles you may or may not have. Flash your boss a real smile every now and again to let her know that you are pleased to see her.By definition, it's hard to rehearse a genuine smile, but if you want to see what yours looks like, try thinking of something really funny and then looking in the mirror.

, Pay close attention when your boss speaks to you and try to act interested, even if you aren't particularly excited about the subject matter. Ask follow-up questions that show you are engaged, and make comments that show your enthusiasm. (""Wow, I had no idea!"")Don't overact on this one. Being genuine is more important than being attentive.
Mimicking your boss's body language as you talk is a great non-verbal way to show you are paying attention.

, This is probably the riskiest move you can make when flirting with your boss, but it is one of the most effective ways of conveying your interest. Don't proceed with this unless you are already getting some definitive, positive feedback from your earlier attempts (your boss reciprocates your eye contact and smiles, and seems very attentive to you). Offer a handshake and a smile at the end of a meeting.
Try a gentle, brief touch on the forearm or the shoulder when speaking with your boss.
If your boss makes a joke, laugh and place your hand on her forearm. Linger for a second before removing it.
Avoid any overtly affectionate or sexual touching in the workplace. This includes shoulder rubs, hugs, placing a hand on someone's knee, etc. Even if the contact is desired, it could still get your fired.

, Flirting with your boss is dangerous territory, so pay very close attention to the feedback you are getting, and take it slow. If your eye contact and smiles are being reciprocated, things are probably going well. If, however, your boss seems to be shifty or brisk around you, or seems to be going out of her way to avoid you, you have likely made her uncomfortable and should abort your flirtations immediately.

, You might send a flirty text message or email to someone you are interested in outside of work, but written communication is hard to take back or ignore if things go awry, and should be avoided in a workplace flirtation or romance. You should also avoid obviously flirting in front of other people.


Remember that in many cases, your employer has the right to track and examine any emails you send or receive using a company-owned computer, or even texts and calls made from a company phone.If your flirting is reciprocated and does proceed to the texting/emailing stage, remember to conduct your interactions using your personal computer and/or phone, and email accounts.

, If things go well, someone will eventually have to make a move if the relationship is going to progress. Because of the complexities involved in a workplace relationship, it is better to talk about the situation up front rather than plunge ahead with an overtly sexual advance. Be direct and honest about your intentions, and give your boss a chance to respond. It may feel awkward, but it's important to be certain that you are both on the same page before things go any further.


Ask your boss to join you for coffee or lunch, and bring up the subject there.
Broach the subject gradually, and leave yourself an exit in case you misread the situation.
For example, you might begin with some work-related small talk and work towards the inquiry: ""What do you think about office relationships?"" Your boss's answer to this should give you a pretty clear indication as to whether you should proceed or back off.
Remember: if it turns out you misread things and your boss is not interested, you will have a lot less to be embarrassed about from a straight-forward conversation than if you had attempted to kiss him, or worse.

Close the door when you're getting ready for a date.,
Surprise him.,
Send a cryptic message.,
Whisper to him.",How to Flirt With Your Boyfriend1," Putting a (temporary) barrier between the two of you bolsters his surprise and delight when you appear gorgeously dressed and smiling., It may be as simple as buying tickets to a movie he wants to see or a pint of his favorite ice cream. Little surprises along the way brighten his life and break up the usual routine.


Be sure to let him know there's a surprise in store. Drop a suggestive hint like, ""Just wanted to make sure you're free tonight because you have a little something waiting for you."", Making up a little code that he probably won't be able to crack keeps you on his mind all day as he tries to figure out what ""cot pets roll day"" means. (""Let's play doctor!"")Anagrams (scrambling the letters in a word or phrase) are great for this.

, It doesn't need to be anything eloquent; just leaning in and saying something for his ears only creates a sphere of intimacy and can help bring you out of routine conversations. It can be a simple ""I love you,"" or a question you were going to ask him anyway, like, ""Want to go for a walk with me?""


You can even do this when there's no one else around - even better!

Listen to him.,
Write your baby a letter.,
Go to his football (or band) practice.",How to Flirt With Your Boyfriend2," When your boyfriend is talking, stop doing other things and give him your full attention. The world is full of distraction, from our own inner preoccupations to the vibration of our mobile phones, but try to put these aside and really listen. Chances are your boyfriend will feel much closer to you if he knows he can confide in you.

, Expressing your feelings every so often might just take his breath away. Leave a note on the fridge (""Bon appetit! I love you!""), slip a hand-written card into his backpack or briefcase, or, if you're digitally inclined, post an e-card on his Facebook wall.


Remember restraint is a key element in flirtation: rather than gushing on and on, try to express your feelings in just a few words or sentences., Being present at times when he's doing something else can be a fun surprise and also give you a slightly new view of your other half. He might get a kick out of the interest you show, and if no one else knows you're together, he gets the benefit of having a beautiful girl batting eyes at him in front of his pals.Use your judgement, however: sometimes it's not appropriate for there to be onlookers, in which case you might be an unwelcome distraction. Discreetly find out if it's okay before suddenly showing up.

"
"
Angle yourself towards him.,
Maintain eye contact a bit longer.,
Use your magic touch.",How to Flirt With Your Boyfriend3," When you are sitting next to your guy, angle your body toward his: make him know that you're not afraid to get close to him, and that you want to talk to him.

, Your eyes probably meet plenty over the course of a day or a date. Next time, when you're in a relaxed situation (eating dinner, talking casually), try consciously holding his gaze for a few moments longer than normal. Eye contact taps into one of the most basic ways that humans communicate and connect., Touch sparks a chemical reaction that boosts desire. That's just one reason why you should hold his hand, touch his shoulder when you laugh, kiss him hello and goodbye, and snuggle close to him when you're watching TV."
"
Be confident.,
Add a few jokes to your repertoire.,
When all else fails, laugh together.",How to Flirt With Your Boyfriend4," Inner confidence is a remarkably attractive attribute, which is why it is probably the first and only law of flirtation. But let's be clear: ""confidence"" doesn't mean arrogance. Confidence means that you are aware of yourself and comfortable with yourself, embodying your positive traits without flaunting them.If you aren't a very confident person, consider building your self confidence. Feeling good in your own skin will help you in all aspects of life, not just your relationship.

, Cracking corny jokes or one-liners can be a great ice-breaker, especially if they flatter his manliness. For example, you can accidentally trip and fall into your man, commenting, ""My, your chest is so firm I thought I was falling onto a wall!"", Your attempts to introduce something new might elicit a laugh, but don't worry: this is a natural reaction to a break from the status quo. Laughing along with him keeps things playful and reinforces the bonds that keep you together."

When setting up, upload at least 3 pictures of yourself that are clear.,

Once it's up and running, you'll have to wait to send any winks and/or messages, but it's always good to have a quick look.,
When messaging and winking is enabled, before sending them out, read the users bio carefully and don't miss out on any details.,

When things get good between you, give them your email address and nothing else until you can trust them.,
Don't talk about marriage or relationships for your newly found interest.",How to Flirt With Geeky Men on Dating Sites Without Revealing Too Much Too Soon," The reason I say upload 3 photos is because you want one of your face, a full body shot and one of you in your best clothes (a picture of you at a party, wedding, etc);
, Don't use bad language, no slang or deliberate miss spelling as it's not really something a man of the geeky/nerdy world will enjoy reading and will most defiantly just skim to the next person.

, Not only will you be putting yourself at risk, but your account will be permanently deleted as it's reviewed before it's published. Also, you cannot add any personal contact details in the description, as it's another way of having your account deactivated.

, You want to list what personality traits best suits you as a person and if you want to add certain physical attractions you may have, don't make it too long. There aren't going to be many ""supermodel"" types around on the site. Here's some good examples of what to list for the physical aspect of the description: Good hygiene, tall, with or without glasses,etc.

, The site has a handy feature where you can search for matches based on your area. They will either send you local or out of area matches, but it will always be in the country you'll be living in.

, Check to see how often they have been using the site as well, because if they use it regularly, you have more of a chance at getting a response.

, Spamming is when a user sends irrelevant and offensive messages or is trying to promote a product through illegal advertising methods.

, Use positive language, ask questions of your own but nothing sexually suggestive, offensive or anything too personal, as this could give the user the wrong idea.

, With email accounts, it's easy to block a contact that you will either find distressing and/or offensive.

, You're still at the ""getting to know each other stage"", but if asked about your views on those topics, it's ok to be honest about your views on them, just as long as the newly found interest isn't being told that you want that with him.

Be conscious of your appearance.,
Groom yourself to look more beautiful.,
Give him the opportunity to approach you.,
Ensure that you are sitting or standing alone for at least some time, so that he can approach you easily.,
Remember that actions are powerful.,
Start conversations.,
Get to know him.,
Lastly, if he's interested in you, don't just go immediately to be ""best friends"" or ""boyfriend and girlfriend"".",How to Flirt With Guys at School," If you want to flirt with guys, the first thing that you need is to pay attention to your physical appearance. You should wear clothes that look good on you - something elegant, clean looking, comfortable, and at the same time, something that makes you feel confident. Remember, you don't need to have millions of expensive outfits to look beautiful because some simple fashions never go out of style!


Try sporting dark, slimming jeans, a simple solid colored tank or cami, some chunky bead necklaces, or a cute sun dress.
Avoid looking like a slob or wearing any outfits that have stains or wrinkles in them.;
, Be sure that you shower and clean yourself regularly. You should also wear deodorant, shave frequently, clean your ears, brush your teeth and hair, and you could try to paint your nails. Also, try to wear your hair in a style that makes you feel pretty - have a variety of hairstyles so you don't look boring!


If desired, use a perfume that smells sweet, but is not too overpowering. Two sprays on the neck and one spray on one wrist, then rub your two wrists together to transfer the scent.

, Don't stay in a group. A guy may find it a little uncomfortable to approach you if you are in a large group of people. No man can bear a rejection in front of a herd. Also, he may feel that he can't approach you because of your friends.

, Also, try to minimize the distance between the two of you. For example, you can sit at the chair next to him.

, There are multiple ways to act flirty, here are some of the best suggestions:



Compliments. Be sure to compliment him on things that are true. Be sincere. Sometimes people will make up compliments just to talk to someone, but that is a totally wrong thing to do. You really should compliment on things you actually like about a person, so you sound more natural and confident.

Eye contact. The eyes can be the most effective tool for flirting. It's possible to make a guy's heart skip a beat simply by giving him a playful, lusty, or lingering stare. Here is how to do it:

If you're walking by someone you've got the hots for, give him a 2-3 second stare and then slowly glance away (slow is important). Smile just as you start to look away. He'll get the message.
Additionally, when you're talking to a guy you like, take a second to momentarily break away from his eyes and pause on his upper body or chest. Let 2 seconds pass. Then slowly move your eyes back up and make eye contact again. This will give him chills of excitement. He'll realize that you were checking him out - and he'll love it. However, be warned that shy guys will feel uncomfortable and more nervous, as much as they may like it!



Smile and giggle. According to polls, a laugh and a smile are the sexiest things a female can wear. If you perfect your smile and laugh to be seductive and sweet, you will find some great results. Practice forcing a natural smile and laugh, it can help through awkward situations.

Magic Touch

You can learn to brush a guy in such a way that you send tingles up and down his spine. Casually and gently tap him on the hand while laughing, it will give him a sense of manliness.



, Approach him and start a light conversation to get things going, but don't make it too obvious that you like him. If he approaches you, look him in the eyes as a sign of affection and confidence. The best opening line is just saying hello. Talk about what you have in common, talk about your surroundings, ask a question, ask for help, state an opinion.

, After he has come up to you and both of you have started talking, just try to find out whether he is your type or not. Is he one of the pushy ones, or will he stop at the line you draw? If you feel comfortable with him, carry on with the evening. In case he is not your type, just excuse yourself politely from his company. However, remember that you are the one who led him on. Now if you don't feel up to it, don't get outright rude.

, Just start hanging out with him, become friends first, slowly become best friends or even more, let the relationship develop naturally! You want to make sure that he is the right guy for you, and you have things in common! It's fine if he doesn't seem like your type; stick with him and you may have secured yourself a best friend for life!

Wash your hair with both shampoo, and conditioner. You want your hair smooth and soft when your potential partner goes to touch it. Always apply deodorant every morning before you put on your clothes.Consistently brush your teeth. You do not want your breath smelling bad when you go to ask someone out for Valentine's day. Flossing and using mouthwash is also a bonus.
Make your you brush or comb your hair. You want to get the knots out, and rid your hair of frizziness.;
, This is probably the most critical aspect of how you appear. The goal is to show your partner that you care about yourself, and them, to maintain how you look. For men, you need to trim your facial, chest, and pubic hair. If you want to leave some hair that is fine, but trim it back, especially the wild hairs. For women, shave underarm and leg hair, and trim/shave/wax pubic hair. Once more, it is not necessary to get rid of it all, but try to get most of it.After you have shaved or trimmed your hair, use lotion on your skin. Use one which explicitly is designed to hydrate your skin. Rub it on your legs, your arms, and hands. You want your skin soft and smooth when your partner goes to touch it.

, This is mostly for people who plan well in advance of Valentine's Day. While some people do not need to go to the gym, others might want to in order to improve their physique. Work with weights, or run on the treadmill. The goal is not to look like a bodybuilder, but to build some tone, and perhaps lose a few pounds.Not only will going to the gym make you more physically fit, but it will also give you a newfound confidence when you ask your potential date out for Valentine's Day.
Set a goal a few months ahead of time. For example, you might want to lose ten pounds and sharpen the tone around your stomach. Create a daily or weekly schedule that meets your individual needs.
You can also work on changing your diet. Eating fruits and vegetables instead of snacks and junk food can help you quickly lose weight as well.

, For men this means applying cologne, or aftershave. For women this means applying perfume. The goal is to attract your partner using pheromones. Apply your fragrance onto ""pulse points."" These ""points"" are where blood vessels are close to the skin, thereby giving off heat, and spreading the smell better.The key ""pulse points"" include: behind knees, ankles, around belly button, underneath your armpits, around your neckline, and on your wrists.
Only choose one or two, and only use a couple of sprays at most. The less the better. The smell of the fragrance will spread out over time.

, This does not mean wearing a suit to school, but it does mean getting those wrinkles out of your clothes, and wearing attire that is flattering to your significant other. Spend time in the morning picking out outfits which match, and showcase your assets. There is no reason to deviate too much from your typical wardrobe, but take extra care when picking out an outfit and it will show.For girls, maybe wear a nice dress. Showing off skin is always an easy way to attract guys. Using the color red to your advantage is also important, as studies have shown that red is rather seductive.
For guys, wear clothes which fit tighter around the body. Show a little chest by unbuttoning the top few buttons of your shirt. Wearing clean shoes is also a plus, rather than ones trampled in mud and dirt.
For both guys and girls, make sure that your clothes are ironed, and don't have any holes in them. Also, make sure that they have been recently washed, so that they have a fresh, clean smell.

, For girls, this might mean talking football with your guy. For guys, this might mean talking about a recent book she has read. Whatever it may be, find what your partner is interested in, and talk about it. This will show your potential date that you care about what interests them.Ask some of their friends what they are into. This way you can study up before you begin to talk to them. For example, if your guy likes the Carolina Panthers football team, read about whether they have been playing good or bad, what what players they have on the team.
If you hear from your girl's friends that she is into Twilight, it wouldn't hurt to at least pick up the first book and read it. This way you can bring it up casually in conversation, and she will know that you are interested in her interests.
Never go overboard. Some people just don't match. If someone has totally different interests than you, you should probably look for someone a bit more familiar.

, This is the key to asking your potential partner out on a date. While being shy can be cute, most of the time you will want to exude confidence. Stand up straight, and speak clearly. Look your partner square in the eyes as you ask them ""Will you be my Valentine?"" or ""Would you like to go out on Valentine's Day?""When you ask your date to go out, make sure they are not in a group. With other people around, you can lose confidence. There is also social pressure on the person to say either yes or no, depending on the circumstance. You want to make sure that it is only you two engaging with one another.
Do not force your partner into panicked positions. For instance, it is not good to pull your potential date aside as they are running to class. Wait until after school, or well before school starts. If you are out of school, don't bother them while they are in the middle of their job.

, You can throw a single's party so that you can find a potential match. This takes the couples out of the equation. Get a group of friends to come over for hors d'oeuvres and drinks. You can also invite people where you work to come over as well. Keep it light by getting people up and talking.Focus your singles night around a central event. Super Bowl weekend is usually a few days before. This is a great reason to bring people together.Talk with some people, and get their phone numbers. Pick out one which you made a real connection with. If you really hit it off with someone, you can ask them right then and there to go out for Valentine's Day.

, These are often used for asking dates out to Prom, but they can work for Valentine's Day as well. Buy some glass-friendly markers to write on your potential date's back windshield ""Will you be my Valentine? --(insert name)"" Send your date ""anonymous flowers,"" asking them out for Valentine's Day on the attached card. The list can go on and on forever, as far as your imagination takes it.


The goal is to create a cute, and fun way to ask them out. Knowing that you put in a lot of effort to do so will also entice your partner to say yes.
Another interesting idea is to create a chain text message. One friend will text your date ""Will."" Another friend will text your date ""you."" The next friend will text your date ""be."" Your last friend will text your date ""my."" Then you will text your date ""Valentine?"" Do these about 20 seconds apart from one another. Make sure that they are texted in the correct order.
Ask to use the intercom at either your school or place of business. Pretend to give the daily announcements and ask her out over the intercom. Make sure she is present at either the school or business.

, About a month before the holiday, pharmacies and grocery stores will begin selling Valentine's Day candy, flowers, plush animals, etc. Whether you are a guy or a girl, it is great to both give and receive these items. They show, through monetary value, that you care about the other person. They aren't the key to your partner's heart, but they are a great added bonus.You can give your partner these items either on Valentine's Day, or when you ask them out.
Make sure you get the items early, as the store could sell out when Valentine's Day approaches. However, order flowers so that they deliver a day before the holiday.

, This is the classic Valentine's Day date. Usually a quieter place works best, like an italian restaurant, rather than a sports bar or club. If you are the man, hold the door open for her, and pull out the chair for your her before they sit down.Another thing to avoid, especially on a first date, is the movie theater. Going to the movies is great for established couples, but in the beginning of a relationship you need time to get to know one another. Movies separate your eyes, and dim the conversation, when you want and need the opposite.
Make sure to hold your partner's hand at some point during the date. You can grab their hand during the middle of dinner, or in the car as you are driving back home.

, This is a great option if you think that there is a high chance of intimacy. Cook a nice dinner from scratch which your date will certainly appreciate. Decorate the dining room with rose pedals, and place some roses in a vase on the dinner table. You can even have some romantic music playing in the background.Dim the lights in the dining room. This will create a more solemn and romantic occasion.
Position both chairs ahead of time so that you are either sitting directly across, or next to your date.
If you are thinking that your date will get more intimate as the night goes along, you can drop rose pedals through the hallway and onto your bed. You can also prepare a nice warm bubble bath for your partner.

, You can go to a restaurant, or all go to the movies. This is a great chance to get closer to someone you like, without the intense intimacy of a solo Valentine's Day date. You can sit next to your significant other without feeling that it has to get more serious.Talk with your friends beforehand. Mention to them that you want to get closer to your significant other. This way you can ""accidentally"" sit next to them in the movie theater, or you can plan ahead and pay for them at the restaurant.
If you are in the movies, you can hold hands if you like. This is an opportunity to make the first move, and then ask your partner out on a more serious date later on.

, If you just can't find someone to go out with, and you don't want to spend Valentine's Day alone, blind dates can be great options. Search online, or in your local newspaper, to find blind date events nearby. These are much more prevalent around the holiday. Decide whether you want to go on a singular blind date, or if you want to participate in speed dating.For singular blind dates, you will want to bring some roses to give your date. Since you have never met the person before, spend time getting to know them at a restaurant. Ask them questions about where they are from, what they like to do for fun, and what are their plans for the future.
Speed dating is mostly an exercise in having fun. Come in with an open mind. These are events focused on getting to know the basics about many people, and getting phone numbers. You might very well meet someone you wish to have a more serious date with later on.
Do not expect intimacy with these types of dates. While sex does occur sometimes, remember that you have never met each other before.

, This is similar to a blind date, except that you get to prescreen your potential dates. You can always post on a social networking site that you are lonely, and looking for a date on Valentine's Day. There are also popular apps such as Tinder and Grindr which can be used to find a potential match.Properly vet each potential Valentine's Day date. If someone is a bit sketchy, or if you feel as if their public profile is false, it is best to find someone else.
Dating apps are best saved as a last resort. People you know in your real life are going to be much easier to get romantically close with.

, You don’t have to have everything in common with your significant other, but having some things in common is often helpful for a successful relationship. Try to identify your biggest interests to determine some things that you want your next girlfriend to also care about. For example, you might list:


Music, such as rock, country, rap, or classical.
Reading literature, the newspaper, or poetry.
Sports, such as basketball, football, running, or baseball.
Playing an instrument or singing.
Going to the movies or playing video games.

, After you have constructed some lists that expand on your definition of a sweet girl, you can use these lists to help you find her. Read over the traits and interests you have listed, then think about where a girl like this might spend her time.


For example, you might determine that a girl who shares your love of music will probably frequent local concerts and music stores. Therefore, be on the lookout the next time you go to one of these places.
If you have listed that you want a girl who is kind and caring, then she might volunteer at the local homeless shelter or animal rescue. Try signing up for some volunteer hours as well.
If you want a girl who has the same political or religious philosophy as you do, then attend local political activism meetings or religious services.

, Many people find someone who they feel connected to just by going about their usual business, such as by going to school, work, church, or to community gatherings.Try to stick to your routine and pay attention to the girls who are usually there. One of them might be the perfect girl for you.Try talking with girls who you see on a regular basis. For example, you can strike up a conversation by saying something like, “I see you here all the time. I am a regular here, too.”
Or, “How long have you been with the company? I have been here about a year, but I don’t think we have ever had a conversation.”

, Although blind dates have a reputation for being awkward, lots of people actually meet their significant other through a friend. Try asking your male and female friends if they know any single girls who might good a match for you.Be sure to tell your friends what type of girl you are looking for in detail, such as by sharing your lists of traits and interests with them. Your friends might have a different definition of a “sweet” girl, so be as clear as possible about what you are seeking.

, Online dating is also a great avenue for meeting a girl. A great benefit of this method is that you can say exactly what you are looking for and connect with girls who have those traits and interests.Try making a profile on an online dating site to meet some girls who have the qualities you are looking for.


Online dating is also a great option if you are a bit shy. You can talk to girls who are interested in you and not have to worry so much about rejection.

, Before you head out to do some flirting, take stock of your personal care routine. Taking good care of yourself is an attractive trait. Make sure that you are taking good care of yourself, such as by:Taking a shower every day and wearing clean clothes.
Brushing your teeth.
Combing or styling your hair.
Wearing deodorant and a bit of cologne.

, Making eye contact and smiling is one of the best flirtation techniques you can use.It shows that you are interested, confident, and available. If you see a girl that you want to get to know better, then try to catch her eye and hold her gaze for a moment. Then, smile and hold your gaze for a few seconds longer.


If she holds your gaze, or looks away and then looks back and returns your smile, then she may be interested in talking to you.
If she avoids your gaze, or does not return your smile, then she is probably not interested.

, If you get a smile and some eye contact back, then you can go and introduce yourself. You do not need to do anything fancy to introduce yourself to a girl. Just walk up to her, and say something like, “Hi. My name is ____.”


You can also find something about the environment to strike up a conversation with her, such as saying, “This place is so busy tonight! We’re lucky we got in! I’m ___ by the way.”
Or, “Beautiful day today! I love sitting on the patio here while I sip my cappuccino. What are you drinking? I’m ___.”
Pay attention to her body language as you approach her. If she turns to face away from you as you approach or looks around the room when you approach, then she is probably not interested. Look for positive body language, such as facing you, making eye contact, smiling, etc.

, If you end up talking to her for a few minutes and it seems to be going well, then try asking for her number. This does not need to be a big production either. Try to keep your request simple and direct, such as by saying:


“I’ve really enjoyed talking with you. Can I get your number so we can do this again sometime?”
Or, “This was really fun! We should do this again. What’s your number?”

, When you feel ready to give her a call and ask her out, you can sue a direct approach or by more subtle. Some options include:“I’m going bowling this weekend and you should definitely come along. How does Saturday night at eight sound?”
“I was thinking of trying out that new sushi place tomorrow night. Do you like sushi?”
“I’m going to see a movie tonight and I just thought I’d see if you are free. Want to join me?”

, First dates are important. You get to learn a lot about the person and then use that information to help you decide if you have found a match. Some questions you can ask on a first date to help you get to know the girl include:How was your day/week?
What do you like to do for fun?
What kind of music do you like?
Where do you like to go on vacations?
Do you like your job?
What are you passionate about?
Do you have roommates or do you live alone?

, On your first date, you can begin to get a better idea if this girl meets your criteria for a “sweet” girl. Is she nice? Intelligent? Funny? Optimistic? Think about the list of traits and interests you made to help you figure out if she is someone you want to spend more time with, such as on a second date.

, You might get a sense that this person is not someone you can or want to spend much time around. However, there are some red flags to watch out for as well. Try to keep a mental log of these along with any positive traits or interests the person has. Some red flags to watch for include:She is only talks about herself and does not seem interested in getting to know you.
She constantly complains about her life, the restaurant, friends, family, or other things.
She is rude or unreasonably demanding of the waiters or other employees in a restaurant or café.
She keeps checking her phone and seems more interested in it than in engaging with you.
She expresses strong political, religious, or other personal views that you disagree with.

, People who have these qualities tend to be better at maintaining positive relationships.For some, these qualities may also be part of what makes someone “sweet.” Be on the lookout for these traits if you want a satisfying, long-term relationship. Some ways that you can assess the girls that you meet for this quality include:


Noting how well she listens and responds to what you say. Does she stare off into space when you are talking or start texting friends on her phone? Poor listening skills can signal trouble for a long-term relationship.
Paying attention to her patience. Does she get impatient if she has to wait for you? If so, then she may have a hard time delaying gratification, which can be trouble for a long-term relationship.

, If the first date goes well and you want to see her again, then arrange another date. You can do this by telling her at the end of the night or by calling a few days later.


Try saying something like, “I had a great time on our first date and I’d like to see you again. Would you like that too?”

Be yourself.,

Compliment her.",How to Get a Smart Girl to Fall for You," Hygiene matters if you want to put your best foot forward—so brush your teeth, floss, use mouth wash, shower, and wash your hair. Wear clean clothes.;
, This shows that you care how you look, and it never hurts to look a little extra attractive! Try a nice shirt in a color that flatters you (ask for help if you don't have an eye for color). Try a little cologne if you want to; it'll give you a slight scent that she'll remember.


Too much cologne may result in an annoyed or wheezing girl—not good!
Nerds tend to be attracted to fellow nerds. So, if you're a nerd looking for a nerdy girlfriend, put on a nerdy outfit and own it.

, A little friendly teasing is okay, and it will definitely help form some inside jokes, but remember girls, especially teenagers, are always at least a little insecure, and often really, really insecure, so be careful, even the most confident of girls are somewhat insecure about something, so watch what you say or you will most definitely annoy someone.


Gross or ""wrong"" humor may alienate a smart girl (particularly a younger smart girl), so avoid this unless you know she's into that sort of thing.

, One of the reason you are reading this article is because somewhere, deep inside, you think you don't deserve her, you are not worthy of her, which is complete nonsense and a lie. Remember that it matters if you think it matters; if you think you are unworthy of her then the same thought will come to you again and again until you believe it to be true.


To remove that thought try to change the response of the cue. For example whenever you see her in reality or in your head, loudly repeat in your head 'I am worthy of her, I deserve her'.

, Keep the truth in mind that she is not the only smart girl in the world and there are plenty of cute and smart girls out there. If you keep this 'abundance mentality' in mind it's not only going to help you get girls but will help you in other aspects of life as well. So don't limit your options because there are plenty.

, Smart girls often like smart partners, so don't hide your brains. Some girls enjoy witty banter and intellectual discussions, and it makes them feel like they're in a Jane Austen novel. Try bringing up intellectual topics, and using your larger vocabulary words (if you usually hold back).


Don't feign intelligence. You don't need to have an IQ of 140 to win her over, and she can probably tell if you're faking it.
Even if you aren't particularly smart, that's okay. Brains are way less important than personality. If you treat girls well, you'll find that some of them will be interested in you.

, An intellectual girl may be put off by vulgar language. Instead, work on being your best self around her, and keeping things clean unless she expresses preferences otherwise.

, Maybe you both like to write computer code, bake, or watch Star Trek. Find things to share and enjoy together.


It never hurts to do a little reading on her interests. Maybe she can teach you a little, and maybe you'll end up liking it too!

, Even a light, brief touch can send a message that you're interested. Touching her arm in conversation or to get her attention is a great way to get her thinking about you in a ""more than a friend"" way.


Hugging is a great way to show how tender, compassionate, and sensitive you are (all great traits). Try hugging her as a greeting, hugging her after she tells you something personal/emotional, or from behind if you know she doesn't startle easily.
Don't touch her sexually without her consent, and without signs that she's ready for it. Many smart girls are not ready for sexual touching in their teens.
If you're a girl attracting another girl, you may have to build up to being even more obvious, because it's pretty normal for female friends to touch each other.

, Many girls enjoy the special feeling of someone taking the time to open doors and offer seats to them. These little acts can make a girl feel like a princess.


If you're concerned about sexism, think of it as an act of caring, rather than a ""women are weaker"" form of benevolent sexism. If you'd do it to anyone you cared a lot about, then it's not sexist.

, Girls who want a more serious or longer-term relationship tend to be very cautious with guys who have a reputation for playing the field. You may be thought of as a jerk, and she'll wind up frequently questioning your intentions.


Girls protect each other. If you mistreat a girl (e.g. disrespecting her, not listening to a ""no""), then word amongst the women will spread to steer clear of you.

, Besides treating your (potential) date like she's special, it's good to treat everyone well. Be polite to her parents, her friends, the waitress, her peers, complete strangers... If you act respectfully towards everyone, you'll seem polite and kind. This definitely attracts girls.


Respect all women. She sees how you treat other women, and this is part of her evaluation of whether you can be trusted. If she sees you respecting other women, it'll be a positive sign to her.

, Not too much, especially if you aren't going out. If you are still in the ""Chase Stage"" don't overdo it. Just stand up for her if someone is being a bully or is somehow hurting her feelings, position yourself just a touch ahead of her when you do and stand tall. Be a hero, it's hot.


Remember the difference between being protective and being controlling. Your job is to stand up for what she wants and feels, not to limit her options. Let her make her own choices, so she can meaningfully choose you.

, It's a subtle way of telling her and people around her that you are into her and it really does make all the difference. If she's open to it, try placing a hand on her shoulder or an arm around her.

, Every girl wants to feel heard. Ask her questions, listen to the answers, and learn more about her perspective on life. This can make her feel really interested in talking to you again. And, if you remember the little things she's said before (her favorite book, what type of jewelry she likes) it makes her feel very special.

, Girls want a partner who has a good sense of self and is confident. Yes, your mom really is right sometimes. Work on being the best version of yourself.

, Keep her secrets, share your emotions, and don't go and tell your friends all about her flaws, just tell them the good things. And even if things unfortunately don't work out between you, her keep the secrets she told you. This will make you look trustworthy to other girls too.

, If there is something you like about a girl, whether it is her personality, some physical attribute, etc., then say something about it. It'll make her happy, and she'll enjoy being with you.


Tailor your compliments to the girl. ""I love your hair"" is fairly generic. ""You have such beautiful curls"" is more specific, making it more personalized and memorable.
You don't need to constantly compliment her. If she starts to look uncomfortable after the 5th compliment that you've given her in 3 minutes, you're probably overdoing it.

Perhaps there’s someone in your classes who you haven’t bothered to get to know. Maybe you see someone at the park who catches your eye. In general, just keep your eyes open when you’re out in public. You’ll never know when you’ll meet the one you’ve been dreaming about.


If you have a “type” and really want to meet someone that matches this, try going to stores that cater to the type of girl that you’re interested in. You’re much more likely to find an athletic girl at a Nike outlet than an Aeropostale. Preppy girls don’t shop at Hot Topic.;
, If you’ve had your eye on someone for a while now, then it’s time to introduce yourself. This can seem intimidating, but nothing is going to happen if all you do is stare at them. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Something like, “Hey, I’ve noticed you in a lot of my classes and just wanted to introduce myself. I’m so-and-so, what’s your name?” is fine. Make some small talk then end the conversation with something like “see you around!”


A lot of people have trouble coming up topics for small talk on the spot. If this sounds like you, have some topics in mind before you approach her. Pick something that isn’t really controversial that you’re both likely to have something to say about. Some topics that might work for you are your school’s last basketball game, new music you think they might like, or something that happened in a class you have together.

, Once you’ve introduced yourself, you have to make an effort to continue to see her. Keep up the small talk and throw in some jokes. Eventually, you’ll get to know each other better and the conversation will begin to a flow much more naturally. You’ll start to hang out in the hallways and spend more and more time with each other in general.


Humor is one of the best ways to win a girl over. Make sure your jokes are good natured and aren’t offensive, even if they aren’t offensive to her or anyone she knows. If you begin to share inside jokes, you’ll know that you’re on the right track.
Regularly doesn’t mean 24/7. Don’t come on too strong right away. A few minutes a day most days of the week is fine to start out with. You’ll see each other more as things progress.

, Ambition is something that everyone finds attractive. Bringing your future into the conversation can make you seem a lot more interesting to a girl. Talk about things you want to learn and what you want to accomplish in your life. Mention things you are doing now to someday achieve these goals. She’ll probably want to get to know you more when you do., You’re going to have start flirting to let the girl you’re attracted to know you’re interested in her. Make some low-pressure physical contact like touching her elbow or shoulder. Compliment something she’s wearing then smile and make eye contact. Gently tease her, but not about anything that could make her upset.While you’re flirting, look for signs that she is enjoying it and flirting back. Does she move away when you touch her elbow or let her arm linger? If you compliment her clothing does she smile and look you in the eye or stay quiet and look away? If she isn’t responding well to your flirting, it’s time to move on.Don’t try a tired old pickup line. Hotties get approached all the time by guys and have probably heard whatever you’ve had to say before. In general, women see these as immature and won’t be impressed by what you have to say.

, If flirting has been going well, then it’s time to take them out on a date. Our society expects men to make the first move in relationships, so you are probably going to have to be the one who does the asking. Don’t make a big deal about it. If she’s been flirting with you, she’ll probably say yes no matter what. Something like, “I really like hanging out with you and wanted to get to know you better, do you want to go get lunch on Wednesday?” is fine.


It’s just a first date, so don’t make too big a deal out of it. Dinner is probably a bit too much for a first date, but lunch or coffee are fine. Fun activities like mini-golf, bowling, or seeing a movie can also good ideas if you aren’t sure quite what to take them to.
If you’re chasing a hottie, you’re probably dealing with someone who’s been asked out dozens of times. Get creative with your date ideas, don’t just take her to a popular movie. She’s probably sick of them by now. If she’s mentioned a hobby or interest, choose something that’s in line with that. She’ll notice and appreciate the thought you put into it.

, Congratulations, she said yes to your date! Wear nice clothes while you’re out, but make sure it’s not too formal. Compliment her when you meet her wherever you are going. Ask her questions about her life and interests. You can talk about yourself too, but don’t overdo it. The most important thing is to keep the conversation flowing.


She’ll notice everything you do, so make sure you treat everyone well on the date. If you’re out a restaurant be kind to the waiter and tip generously. Thank any employees that assist you on your date, and even try making a little small talk. Unless your date is a mean person herself, she’ll like that you treat strangers with respect and are nice to them.

, If the date went well and you want to see her again, you should ask her to see you again while you’re still out. Wait until the end of the date so you have the best idea possible of whether she had a good time or not. Say that you had a really good time and were wondering if she’d be interested in going out again sometime. If everything went well, she’ll probably say yes.


Sometimes dates don’t go well, and maybe you aren’t interested in seeing her again. That’s fine! Just say it in a way that doesn’t hurt your friend. Something like, “I’m glad you decided to come out with me, but I think we should just be friends,” is acceptable. She might get upset, but you did the best you could in the situation.
A lot of people are curious over whether they should kiss the girl at the end of the first date. There’s not really a hard and fast answer for this. Some women are comfortable kissing on the first date and others aren’t. You’ll have to read the situation for yourself. If she looks at your lips then makes eye contact and smiles, she wants you to kiss her. Otherwise, a hug is probably more appropriate.
Mix it up! Don’t ask her out on the same date twice in a row. Try a new restaurant together. Go whitewater rafting. Whatever you do, don’t let it get stale. She probably has a few other guys that would jump at the chance to date her if you break up.

, There’s more to a relationship than just going out to dinner once a week. Talk to her regularly and take an interest in what she does on a daily basis. Send her pictures of something funny that she might like. There’s nothing wrong with texting, but you should make an effort to talk to her in person or over the phone almost every day.


At the same time, you don’t want to suffocate her with texts and missed calls. Talk to her regularly, but not every minute of the day. She still needs to time to hang out with her friends and be her own person in general. Don’t worry if she doesn’t respond right away, she probably just hasn’t seen your message yet.
Be sensitive. Talk about how things make you feel. Tell her that you like her and say why. Empathize with her problems. Contrary to how some books and movies make the world seem, girls like guys who are in touch with their emotions and can comfortably express them.

, Both average people and scientists agree that self-confidence is a desirable trait in a romantic partner.If this is something you struggle with, try reminding yourself of some things you have accomplished that you are particularly proud of.

, Good hygiene is essential for anyone who is interested in dating. Make sure you are brushing and flossing at least twice a day to keep your breath fresh and your teeth white. Wash your hair and get it cut regularly so it looks neat and put-together. Shower regularly and wear deodorant so you smell good.

, The most important part of dressing well is to wear clothes that fit and compliment your body. You don’t have to wear the latest trends or the most expensive brands to dress well. Clothes should sit close to your body but shouldn’t squeeze up against it or restrict your movement. Clothes that are too baggy will make it hard to tell what your body actually looks like, and will actually make you look smaller.


If you’re having trouble finding clothes of your own that fit, start with some basics and work your way up. A good pair of jeans and a white t-shirt can go a long way. It’s better to have a small wardrobe with a lot of pieces that work together than a large wardrobe with a bunch of specific outfits.
Wearing nicer shoes can go a long way in improving your style as well. Don’t wear the same old beaters you use to mow the yard. Sneakers are fine, just make sure they are relatively clean and don’t smell bad. Try some leather boots if you don’t have any already. They are a classic look and can work with almost any pants..

, Muscularity is one of those things that almost everyone finds attractive. You don’t have to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it’s a good idea to start hitting the gym if you don’t already. Make a schedule and commit to it to ensure that you see results. Within a few weeks, you will start to feel and see signs that your body is getting stronger.


If you’re overweight and want to slim down, you’ll also have to change your dietary habits. There are a lot of different diets out there, but they all revolve around the idea of eating fewer calories. Eating a lot of fruit, green vegetables, and lean protein will go a long way in improving your diet.

, Girls tend to like guys who can make them laugh. Work on building a good sense of humor if you’re serious about dating a hottie. It will make you much more attractive in the dating pool. If you don’t think of yourself as a funny guy, this can be a tough thing to do. Try watching professional comedians for ideas. Find a few you like and really delve into their catalog, paying close attention to the jokes. You’ll start to see what they find funny in everyday life and begin to notice similar things yourself. Eventually, you’ll start to make similar jokes yourself just by relating to people you think are funny. It’s a good idea to test out any jokes or zingers on friends first. That way you know if they’re funny or not. Few things are as awkward as staring at someone who didn’t find your joke funny. Even worse if they feel personally offended.

, Your girlfriend shouldn’t be interested in you for your money, but it’s nice to have some money in your pocket you can spend when you’re with her. Get a part-time job to earn a little cash. Use it for things like gas for dates and paying for food, tickets, small gifts, etc. She’ll probably want to split most date costs, but treating her every now and then can be nice.

Remember that the chase is never over.",How to Get a Man to Chase You," Sure, you can approach a man who is staring at you and start up a conversation. He can like talking to you and fall for you even more…or he can get more and more intrigued by the beautiful woman he saw walking by and may want to know even more about her. Let his eyes rest on you and wait for him to approach you instead. Or, if you know you'll see him again, come up to him the next time.


Of course, if you really want to go up to him, he can be intrigued and find that refreshing, too. You don't have to be so dainty if it's not your style.;
, Guys find nothing sexier than women with their own lives. Having a meaningful and fulfilling life where you pursue your career or passion and have a few hobbies or interests that you care about will make you a person who is worth knowing. Whether you want to be a writer or just really love painting, the guy will be much more into you if he sees that there are so many things that you care about that aren't him. If all you do is watch TV and wait for him to call, then he won't be as intrigued.


Doing a lot of interesting things will also make you a more interesting person who is worth getting to know.
If the guy thinks your schedule is wide open because you're not doing anything, then he'll be less likely to chase you, because he'll always know where to find you: at home.

, Guys can be intimidated by girls with a lot of confidence, but they are also deeply attracted to them. Let him see that you love who you are and what you have to offer to the world. Instead of being insecure, always complaining, or looking to the guy for validation, know that the validation comes from within. If you're happy with who you are, the guy will be happier with who you are, because he'll know that he can enjoy your company instead of trying to validate you all the time.


Of course, everyone can work on being more confident. In the meantime, you can start spending more time doing what you love, having open body language and good posture, and addressing those pesky things you don't like about yourself.

, You've got to get your flirt on if you want the man to chase you. You have to make eye contact, play with your hair, tease him a little bit, and even maybe blush and get a little bit girly to catch his eye. You can playfully touch him on the arm, give him a little smile even when nothing is funny, and just be playful and fun when you're together. The flirtation is supposed to spark his interest, and to give him a taste of what it would be like if you were together. Keep it light, fun, and exciting.


Don't come on too strong. Flirt a bit, and then pull back. Make him work for it.

, Find whatever sexy means to you and go for it. If it means getting your hair and nails done, then do it. If it means having the natural look and just wearing a bit of lip balm and a big smile, do that too. You can wear sexy clothes or just flattering clothes that make you feel great. Do whatever makes you feel confident and gives you the feeling that you're taking care with your appearance. If you want a man to chase you, then you've got to put in some effort.


This is not to say that you should do anything that feels unnatural. You want him to chase you, not some version of you that wears five pounds of makeup and uncomfortable stilettos.

, Don't talk too much about hanging out with other guys, or the guy will see that you're trying a little too hard to get his attention. Instead, let him see you talking to other guys, and be yourself when you talk to them. Don't laugh too hard, touch the guys too much, or make it look like you're making way too much of an effort to make the guy feel jealous. It should happen naturally. Whether you're hanging out or walking with another crush or just a platonic guy friend, be engaged and interested and the guy will be jealous.


Though it's totally dumb, it's true that having other guys interested in you will make you more desirable. The guy will want you even more if he sees that other people want you, too.
Make sure not to take this too far, though. If the guy always sees you around other guys, he may think that you're just a big flirt or that you're not interested in him, anyway.

, If you pick up the phone as soon as he calls, or if you agree to go on a date with him even if he asks you out just hours before, then he'll start to think that there's nothing exciting in your life besides hanging out with him. If you want the guy to chase you, then he has to feel like you have a lot going on and that you're difficult to get a hold of. Of course, you don't want him to think you're so busy that you can never hang out with him, or he'll get bored, but strike a balance between being busy and being available enough to see him so he stays interested.


If he calls you, don't pick up on the first ring. Better yet, let a few hours go by before you return his call.
The same goes for texting. If he shoots you a text, let some time go by before you get back to him, unless it's particularly time sensitive.

, Once you've established some kind of a relationship and have hooked up a few times, don't be afraid to let him know when you're in the mood when you're apart. You need to call him one day at work and tell him about the naughty things you've been thinking about doing to him. It will make him lust after you until he can get his hands on you. Do this sparingly, at the right moments, and you'll have him wrapped around your little finger.


Choose your timing well. You don't want to tell him you're feeling frisky if he's about to head into a job interview or is spending his day with his grandmother.

, Sure, playing hard to get is great fun, but if you do it too much, he'll start to think that you're too hard to get. You have to back up and give in a little bit, letting him know that you do care about him. Cook him a homemade meal on his birthday. Call him just to say hi. Get two tickets to his favorite team's home game. Do something nice for him to keep him interested, and then pull back again. If you cook him that homemade meal every day, then yeah, he'll start to take you for granted.


Find a balance between playing hard to get and giving in every once in a while. You can't always act one way or another.

, If the second he meets you, you tell him you have five sisters, that you dream of being an actress, and that you have a complicated relationship with your mother, he'll feel like it won't take a lot of effort to pull back the layers and really get to know you. Instead, make him work for it. Tell him one interesting and unique thing about yourself when you first meet, and drop these pieces of information like rare pieces of the most delicious chocolate throughout your next hangouts. Make him work to get to know you; if he thinks you're putting it all out there anyway, he won't try nearly as hard.


Men love it when they feel like women who are more reserved or less open open up to them. They feel like they've won a prize.

, Let him be the one to call you first more often than not. Let him text you to say hi. Wait for him to suggest a fun party you both should go to. Though you don't have to do this all the time, you should wait for him to take the initiative more, seeming like you're busy or have more important things to do than to worry about whether or not he'll call. Of course, you can still get in touch with him or suggest an awesome outing for the two of you, but make sure the ball lands back in his court.


Nobody said these tactics were for the patient-minded. If you're the type who goes crazy waiting around for a guy to get in touch with you when you'd much rather take over and steer the relationship in the direction where you want it to go, then this will be tough for you for sure.

, Don't be one of those girls who never calls her girlfriends back once she gets a boyfriend. You should have fun with your girlfriends and enjoy those girls nights out, regardless of your relationship status. If the guy sees that you like going out dancing with the girls, having drinks with the girls, or just getting in your girl time, he'll think it's cool that you prioritize your friends. He'll also get more jealous, because he'll be thinking about all of the guys who may approach you on those girls nights!


Making time for your girlfriends will keep you centered and will keep you from being too boy crazy.

, If you want the guy to keep chasing you, then you have to keep him on his toes. Suggest a random weekend trip. Jump into the ocean even if it's a little cold and windy out. Go to Chuck E Cheese for a date. If you always do the same old things or say the same old things, then he will get bored and will stop chasing you. But if he doesn't know what to expect, then you'll have him where you want him! You don't have to be spontaneous 24/7, but make it a priority to be surprising when the moment presents itself.


Resist the urge to plan, plan, plan everything and leave something up to chance. Let him pick you up without asking what you're going to do every second of the date.

, Even if you think the guy is falling in love, you should always keep him on his toes. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't open up to him gradually and that you have to not be yourself, but it does mean that you have to be on the alert and to never get complacent in your relationship. Don't worry about letting your guard down, but keep things fresh and exciting at the same time.


Keep complimenting him, making him feel special, and making him feel like he has to work for it -- in a great relationship, you both have to do a bit of work to keep up a healthy amount of love and affection!

Ask him for help on your homework or a work item, advice on something, or to borrow something. Just come up with a good way to make contact. Whatever the reason, go up and talk to him!


Use this initial interaction to start getting to know him and becoming friends. Are you both taking the same history class? Do you work in the same office? Find ways to talk to him, ask him questions, and get to know him.
Be sure when you ask him for something to make it something where he will be helping you, but also something he won't have to go out of his way to do. If it's a major inconvenience for him, he may say no.;
, As you get to know him, let him do the talking. A lot of girls can dominate the conversation, so instead of doing that, let him do the talking. Show him how much you enjoy listening to him. Build and foster the platonic aspects of the relationship.


Ask him questions about himself. This serves two purposes: you are able to find out more about him while remaining interested in him.
Paying attention to him helps fuel his ego by putting him at the center of attention. This can help him start to view you as someone he wants to be around.

, As your friendship develops, be there for him. This means listening and sympathizing when he gets a bad grade on a paper, a bad evaluation at work, or has a bad day. Be ready to listen to him talk about all his problems, especially relationship problems.

If you're into science, tell him about the documentary on sharks you watched the night before., If you get to the point where you've exchanged numbers, use texting as a platform to flirt. Send funny texts about things that happen, complain about homework or work, or comment on the new movie you just saw. Using texts to showcase the fun things you do in your life helps him see how interesting you are.This is a good way to start gauging his interest level in you. Does he respond to your texts? Or does he ignore them? If he ignores them, you might not have a chance.

, One way to get closer to the guy and start to win his attention is to become friends with his friends. Get on their good side. Flirt with them so that he sees it. You want to make a good impression with his friends so that they will talk positively about you if you're mentioned or you walk by.


Don't be sleazy with his friends. You don't want him to think you are interested in his friends. You want to keep it light and fun when you flirt with them.

Being friends with his friends will please him because his buddies like you, but it may also make him jealous, which may result in him trying to steal your attention from them., Spend some time with him away from work, school, and other people. This can be the two of you catching a game or a movie. Try suggesting coffee after class or going for lunch during your lunch hour. You can also suggest a study date at the library or one of your houses. You want to get the two of you together and alone.

, If you don't feel like intentionally breaking up your crush and his girlfriend, then remain friends with him. Build that friendship, get to know him, and enjoy his company. This keeps you on his good side, so if he ever breaks up with the girlfriend, you are in a great position to get him.Just remember that if you want to stay friends, that you actually stay friends. Don't pretend to be friends and still try to break them up. Be genuine with him.

Wearing your best outfits doesn't mean wearing skimpy tops and short skirts. Your best outfit could be a pair of great fitting jeans, boots, and a t-shirt. It might be leggings, an oversized sweater, and a scarf. It might be a cute sundress and sandals. Not only do you want to look your best to impress him, but you also want to feel your best.

, Don't try to go over the top to attract the guy. You don't want to wear too much make up or dress like you're going to a formal event or a club. Use your natural beauty to attract him. Subtle will work better than being obvious.


Get a haircut or try a new hairstyle. Start wearing makeup. Get a facial, paint your nails, get a pedicure, or get your eyebrows waxed.
He won't know that you've gotten your hair cut or started wearing a different shade of lip gloss, but he will notice that something is different and pleasing. This helps catch his attention, even if he's not sure what exactly has changed., This is one of the most important tips for attracting a guy. Sexiness isn't necessarily how you dress or how pretty you may or may not be. Confidence is sexy and attractive. Whenever you're around him, dress in clothes that make you feel great, and then project confidence. This confidence will read as sexiness. That is more helpful than the tightest outfit or perfect hair.It is especially important to be confident when you are around him and his girlfriend.

If the girlfriend sees him staring at you, it might cause some problems with them that would work to your benefit.

After a few days of doing this, stop. You want to keep playing coy and be hard to get. Make him miss your stares and your smiles.Find reasons to walk by his desk. Think of a reason to call him. Do these things sparingly. You want to make him interested and then pull back. Don't make yourself too available to him. You want to tease him and then make him want to see you more.

, If you're friends with the guy, find out what he likes in a girl. More importantly, find out what he doesn't like in girls, especially in his girlfriend. Whatever quality he mentions he resents in her, become the opposite. You want to attract him by sharing interests and representing the things that he wants in a woman.


Does he think she shops too much? Tell him you hate shopping. Is he upset she doesn't like him watching football? Ask him to come to a game with you. Does he think she's too uptight? Engage in childlike pranks with him.
Don't change yourself too much because he should always like you for who you are. If he is going to leave his girlfriend for you, he should be leaving her for a good reason rather than for a false personality.

, Find ways to touch him in subtle, light ways. Don't throw yourself all over him; keep it coy and fun. Be flirty. The touches should be simple and not cross any personal boundaries.


When he says something funny, gently touch his arm or leg as you laugh. Touch his shoulder or back when you greet him.Try putting him into the protective role when you touch him.

, Guys do not like it when they feel trapped by another person. Fawning all over him may actually push him away. Even if he does have feelings for you, he will put off telling you because he may not enjoy how clingy you are.


Be patient. Trying to move too quickly may frighten him and cause him to be less open around you.
Do not bombard him with text messages. You should not be the first person texting him in the morning and the last person texting him at night. Make sure that the text exchanges between the two of you are more equal than one sided.
He should initiate hanging out with you at least half the time. If you ask him to hang out and he gives you a reason why he can't, let him be the one to ask you to spend time together next.

, If you chase after a guy you like in hopes that he will confess his feelings for you, he might want to keep running. Being chased might be more exciting for him than confessing how he feels about you. He may start to really enjoy being pursued by you instead of being the one to pursue you!

""What do you like to do with your free time?""
""What do you do for work,"" or ""What type of job do you want to do in the future"".
""What are your favorite movies?""

, He could be refraining from telling you his feelings because he thinks he already has you and therefore, doesn’t need to. Once you know that you want him to confess his feelings for you, try playing a little hard to get by not always being available to hang out or not answering your phone every time he calls. This will hasten the time it takes for him to share his true feelings for you.


Give him a chance to miss you or wonder what you are doing. Allow him the opportunity to text or call you first.
If he asks you what you are doing over the weekend, be honest, but respond with positive statements. You might say, ""I am spending time with friends and catching a movie,"" or you may say, ""This weekend I am hanging out with family for a little bit and then I am not sure what I will do after that.""
Whatever you say, don't respond with anything that indicates that you will be bored and sitting at home because that sounds desperate.

, Nothing bad will come to you or him by simply asking him outright how he feels. If he's being shy about confessing his feelings, then be honest and tell him you like him. It may cause him to reveal his undying devotion to you. If you have already developed a close friendship and you have noticed that he responds to your smiles and flirts with you, feel free to ask him. Here are some ways you can ask him:


Try sitting or standing next to him and say, ""I like you and I am wondering if you maybe like me too?"" or ""I really like spending time with you and I am kinda hoping you like spending time with me. Do you like me?"".
If he doesn't know what to say at first, giggle and say, ""You like me, don't you?!"". He will surely fall victim to your charm.
If he says yes, you have won your heart's desire. If it is no, at least you know, so you can stop wasting your time and move on. If he takes time to think, don't worry; he may be having a hard time putting his thoughts into coherent words.
If you let him know in a subtle manner that you like him and that you will welcome his feelings, he might open up and admit he likes you.

You can text him simply ""Hi, how are you?"" or you could send some flirty emoji that show your interest.

Don't be afraid to get the ball rolling via a different medium, if you feel too nervous to call him. He might call you back, and you can text him something like “It would be great to hear your voice” to get him to do just that., Sometimes even texting can seem too formal or to daring, but almost everyone now connects using some sort of social media.You might follow or be Facebook friends with tons of people you might not even know in person. So, it makes it feel a little more casual as a medium than calling or texting. Facebook even has a call option now, so you can call him via that medium, or suggest that you want him to call you by saying “Would you like to talk on the phone?”, Depending on your age and situation, an email might be useful.

If you have not yet expressed your interest, this can be a way to do so. If he doesn’t answer, leave a message. Keep it simple and short, but positive. You could say, “Hey, I’d love to talk.

Also, make sure you have the privacy and time to talk should he answer., Make sure you make eye contact with your crush and smile. Be careful to read his reactions though, because unwelcome flirting never ends well.If you notice him looking away a lot, looking at his phone repeatedly, or slowly backing away, he is likely not interested. Remember, no one's obligated to like you back, and sometimes no amount of flirting, etc., will make that happen., This is an old technique that often works if he is interested. You can even add a heart or a smiley face, if you’re writing it on paper. You might even write “Call me” with a winky face. This will be a bit more flirtatious and should encourage him to call you., This often the simplest way to get a someone to call you back. Oftentimes they might not realize your level of interest, thinking you just want to be friends. So, telling him might prod him into calling you., This is the most direct in-person approach.

If he really likes you back, things should feel easy., Sometimes when we have a crush, all we want to do is obsess about them. But part of what makes you crush-worthy is living the life you're living, not obsessing about something that might never happen. Obsessing will certainly not make it happen. If you normally go out with friends or do yoga or anything else regularly, keep doing it., Thinking in endless cycles the same thoughts over and over about a guy who may or may not call you won't in the end make him call you. If you find yourself in this thought cycle, gently bring yourself back to the present moment. Focus on your breath and how you feel. Avoiding rumination can help the crush not seem so painful, because rumination tends to reinforce the negative feelings you are already feeling. , You will feel a lot about a crush, and judging your feelings (feeling guilty about obsessing, or feeling ashamed that you still like them after they haven't called you) won't help. It's easy to get stuck in our heads with our feelings and it can feel insurmountable.Remind yourself that you are awesome with or without this crush in your life.Tell yourself that your feelings are valid, but also that they might not be representative of reality., If your crush doesn't call you back, and your efforts go ignored, it may be time to move on. However, before you move on, you may feel pain or grief over losing what you hoped might happen, especially if you've had the crush for a long time. Give yourself time to grieve and feel whatever feelings you feel about moving on., Take care of your self by eating well and getting exercise. Don't stop hanging out with your friends. You can give yourself some space, but make sure you're not cutting off your support system. Finally, remember that you are not any less just because your crush didn't return your affection., This may be the most important step to moving on when a guy doesn't call you back.

Be yourself.,
Be confident in who you are and how you look.,
Don't be scared to initiate the conversation.,
Don't send complicated body language.,
Say no to the creeps.,
Don't overdo the clothes, hair, and makeup.",How to Get a Guy to Approach You," This is the number one rule. Don't make up a fake name or give a fake number or tell lies in an attempt to seem more attractive. First of all, this won't always work, and if you end up really liking a guy, you want to have a real relationship with him, rather than one built on lies. Secondly, no guy is worth compromising who you really are - never change things about yourself in order to attract guys.;
, Any girl is unattractive when she is slumped over, drawn in, and spends the whole night staring at her shoes. Instead of doing this, be outgoing, with your body language as well as your conversation. Stand up tall, have good posture, and be confident in how you look. This is the easiest and most effective way to attract a guy's attention.

, If you see someone you like, walk right up to him and introduce yourself! Most guys will find this confidence attractive and will appreciate that you made the first move. And the surest way to get a guy to talk to you is to go talk to him.

, Most guys don't understand flirting and subtle movements that girls may think are simple and easy to understand. They can be obtuse and unobservant, or they can misinterpret signals that you thought were obvious. They will always prefer an outgoing girl who asks them to dance or is up front with them. This approach is black and white, no grey zones, and they look for this and feel more confident and comfortable once they know.

, If you're approached by anyone whose character or intentions you doubt, or if anyone makes you feel uncomfortable, say no and walk away. Find a close friend to stay with you - these guys are much less likely to approach you if you're with someone else. Take care of yourself, and if someone gives you a bad feeling in your gut, listen to it. You don't know someone by their outward appearance.

, A lot of guys like a simple look, one that maybe doesn't show off too much. Don't go out with the sole intention of attracting guys. They will come over time, and gradually build up.

A light hug is a great way to say hello and goodbye.

, Subtly show him your interested. Casually mention that you’re not doing anything on a particular night or invite him to hang out with you and your friends. You can even give him compliments about something you like about him.


Don’t be too forward. The goal is to get him to ask you out.
If he asks you to “come over,” or “hang out,” politely decline. Players suggest casual hangouts to try and seduce women without the pressure of going out on an actual date.
You want to make sure he puts thought into the date.

, Players have a set of routines they use to seduce as many women as they can. Recognize when he’s trying to manipulate you and let him know it's not going to work. Remember the reason men try to play women is to create a wall around their own insecurities. Tell him you’re mature enough to understand his need for approval but also independent enough to make your own choices.

, Do all the things that you enjoy. Don’t let him take up room in your life until he's ready to commit.


If he tries to get you to break plans to spend time with him, politely decline.

If you become too attracted to resist, leave immediately.

, Don’t let him know how much you like him. Players are all about power dynamics and the second he feels like he has the power, he’ll stop chasing you.


Be mysterious.
Be the prize. Beat him at his own game.

, Even after he finally does commit to you, keep your boundaries in place. You may feel like it’s okay to let your guard down but you still need to hold your own in the relationship. Learn to say “no,” “I’m not ready,” and “you’re being a jerk.” Eventually, he’ll learn to see you as a human being and not a conquest.
You’re in control of your own body and feelings. Don’t let him take advantage of you. , Let him know that being with you doesn't mean he has to leave all his buddies behind. One reason players avoid commitment is that they fear they won't be able to go out with their friends anymore. Show him you like to have a good time too and can get a long with his group of friends.


Be outgoing and talkative. Put in an effort to show his friends you're fun to hang out with.
His friends may not open up right away. Give them some time to get used to you.

, The past is the past. He may have had a lot of flings with other girls, but he's with you now. You may think that expressing your jealousy will protect you from being hurt, but in reality, it will only drive you crazy with worry. Your jealousy may even make your partner feel trapped and start to resent you.


When you feel jealous, remind yourself that he has chosen to be with you.
If you do find evidence that he's being unfaithful, deal with it accordingly but don't go looking for it.
Never look through his phone. Even if you don't find anything, you'll still become more paranoid.

, Most players are insecure, so they seek validation from as many women as possible. Remember that he needs to feel powerful in a relationship. Tell him how great he is and let him know that you want him. When his confidence wanes, remind him of how cool and sexy you think he is.


Be sincere. Take the time to make him believe you think he's great.
Don't help him become an egomaniac. You want him to be confident not arrogant.

, He's not used to meeting the emotional needs of one girl. Let him know what you expect from the relationship. Don't expect him to read your mind. Ask him for exactly what you want from a boyfriend.


If you want a monogamous relationship. Explain this clearly.
Tell him what it takes for you to feel supported.

Choose the right moment.,
Catch their eye.,
Keep your facial expression inviting.,
Maintain eye contact.",How to Flirt With Eye Contact1," Holding your crush’s gaze can be a powerful way to flirt, but you need to do it at a good time. There’s no way to plan for the exact moment, but aim for a time when you can potentially have their complete attention without too many distractions.Don’t choose a moment when your crush is distracted or busy. They won’t be able to pay attention to you. For example, don’t try to hold their gaze while they’re driving, reading, or working.
Good moments can be when you first meet and shake hands, when you’re handing them something, or when you open a door to greet them.;
, If you’ve chosen a good moment, this shouldn’t be too hard. If they’re introducing themselves or meeting you at the door, they’ll likely naturally make eye contact. If the context is more difficult, keep your eyes on them until they notice you looking.At a party or other social event, position yourself so that you can see your crush’s eyes. Keep your eyes on theirs as much as possible. Eventually, they’re going to look up and they’ll probably see you looking at them.

, Let your expression be soft. This can mean smiling slightly, or even licking your lips a bit. If you let your face freeze up or come across as too serious, it might look like you're staring rather than flirting.

, Normal eye contact lasts for about three seconds. However, if you can hold your crush’s gaze for four and a half seconds, they’ll get a powerful cue that you’re flirting with them. You can even hold it longer, if you like, as long as your crush doesn’t look away.If you’re nervous, you may be tempted to look away. However, try to maintain the eye contact to help build tension. You’ll seem confident and available, which are two powerfully attractive qualities.

"
"
Start off by smiling at her.,
Make the first move whilst ensuring you're confident of success.,
Watch how she's reacted to you so far.,
Encourage the girl to talk.,
Talk about her interests.,
Be bold but courteous.,
However, if she pulls her arm away, take a hint and reel yourself in a bit.

,
Use appropriate humor.,
Take it to the next level.,
Be yourself when you're trying to flirt.",How to Flirt With a Pretty Girl," Then, pick your strategy.


If you don't know her, start off by asking her name. Pay her a compliment. ""That shirt is a great color on you"" or ""I couldn't help noticing the way that necklace really brings out your eyes.""
Set up a conversation starter without talking to her. For instance, if she's wearing a shirt with the logo of a great band on it, and you have some of that band's music on your audio device, then put your earbuds on and slightly turn the iPod screen toward her so that she can see what's playing. Who knows--she might actually start a conversation with you.;
, Truthfully, most girls want guys to make the first move, so think of a great question to ask her. Even if you don't feel confident at first, you'll definitely get more comfortable when she responds to you.


Again, if you know her, then ask her something that encourages her to talk. ""What did you do this weekend?"" or ""How did you do on that project?"" are both easy openers.
If you're feeling really confident, be more direct. You can say something like, ""I was looking for the stars last night, but I couldn't find them, because they are in your eyes."" Or you could say, ""I must be a snowflake because I've fallen for you.""
Openers are all about delivery. If you're going with a casual opening question, then deliver it with confidence and look like you're really interested in what she has to say. If you're going with the direct approach, then deliver it boldly. Give her a big smile and make good eye contact, and laugh a little bit if she does.

, If she seems interested in you, she'll turn her body toward you, make good eye contact and smile back at you. If she's not interested, she'll turn away or look over her shoulder at you, and she might roll her eyes or look down her nose at you.


Girls can be complicated! If she likes you back and doesn't want to admit it, or is too shy she may look down, giggle, not answer your questions (or say things like, ""it's up to you""), or blushes (a dead giveaway). Also, she could be playing hard-to-get, and in that case, try to say things that might open her up.
Keep flirting with her if all signs point to ""yes."" Show her that you're interested, too. Lean slightly toward her, turn toward her and maybe tilt your head slightly to one side. Give her a disarming smile.

, Ask questions, wait until she answers them and then make comments to show that you were listening.

, Learn what she likes and encourage her to discuss the subjects that she feels passionate about.


Avoid interrupting her while she's talking. Constant interruption is a major turnoff because it makes you look like you only care about yourself.
Start a flirtatious argument with her. For instance, if she loves the Yankees and you love the Red Sox, then you can tease her about the rivalry. You'll both love to banter back and forth. However, never start a serious argument with her with anything serious such as politics or religion, that's a big ""no.""

, If you can't think of anything else to say, look at her and hold her hand and smile while looking at her eyes, as long as you know she'll not feel uncomfortable with you making physical contact..

,, Most girls agree that a good sense of humor is attractive. Humor can also relieve awkwardness. If you say something that doesn't go over well, follow it up with something funny and turn it into a joke.


If you open with a line like ""I must be a snowflake because I've fallen for you,"" and she looks at you like you just popped out of a UFO, try saying, ""I'm sorry. You're so beautiful that I forgot my good line and had to go to my backup."" She might find that funny and start flirting back with you.

Teasing a girl can be a good way to put her at ease and keep things interesting. Just don't joke about something that may be a sensitive issue. If she strongly cares about the environment, for example, and you say something about not believing in climate change, then she's going to reject you. And never, ever joke about her weight.
Find something that you both think is hilarious. Turn it into an inside joke, so when you want to talk to her, you have something to say no matter what, and she thinks that something is funny.

, If the conversation is going really well, then you can do a couple of things:


Ask for her phone number. The next morning, shoot her a quick text saying, ""Just wanted to say good morning. I've been thinking about how much I loved our conversation."" If she responds positively, then call her within a couple of days.
Invite her out on a date. If she mentions something that she would like to do, like checking out a movie or a new club, then say, ""I've been wanting to do that too. Want to go together?""
Make it a little more physical. Ask her to dance and see how close she gets to you. If you're feeling it, and it looks like she expects it, brush your lips against hers.

, Even if your act does impress her momentarily, you'll lose her trust and interest when she figures out you've been trying to fool her. Girls can smell a liar, so you're better off being who you are from the beginning. Do not attempt extreme images such as:


Macho man
Super-smooth and fly
Cool dude
Comedian
Pick-up artist

Figure out what he likes.,
Ask him questions.,
Ask for his help.,
Compliment him.",How to Flirt With a Shy Guy1," Start by figuring out what his interests are and then talk to him about them. Most people are comfortable talking about things they like to do.


Maybe he likes a certain band or loves videogames or movies. Or maybe it’s a sport he’s interested in.
Act genuinely interested in his interests (but if his interests truly bore you and you’re completely faking it, consider that he’s not the right guy for you.)
Even better yet, figure out areas of common interest that you both like and start there so that your interest is genuine. Just be yourself.;
, One of the best communication techniques to get a shy person to open up is to ask them questions rather than uttering statements.


Make the questions casual, not nosy. Ask him about something he likes to do or is interested in, such as whether he saw the latest movie with his favorite actor.
Asking questions draws shy people out of their shells by helping stimulate their side of the conversation. Use your intellect.
Ask open-ended questions. These are questions that are phrased to elicit an explanatory, detailed response. Start the question with words like what, how, in what way, and why. Asking questions that start with words like “do” will provoke terse, single-word yes or no responses.

, Maybe it’s just conversation that unnerves the shy guy and stands outside his comfort zone.


He’s probably an observer who’s deep but has trouble expressing that to strangers or people he doesn’t know very well.

Flirt with him by asking for his help with something. A lot of guys do feel comfortable with being the person who helps out. Consider it their inner knight coming to the surface.
Whether it’s help with your car, a math equation, or a stuck locker room door, ask if he can help you out. Don’t ask him for help with emotional problems, though, at this point.

, Everyone likes to be complimented. It’s human nature. A shy guy is going to be no different.So point out you like the color of his shirt. Or that you like his new jeans or his haircut or the way he thinks.
Don’t just point out his physical appearance, point out an attribute about him that you like. Perhaps it’s his loyalty or how smart he is at a certain subject.
Say his name a lot when talking to him, and give him a lighthearted but complimentary nickname. This will probably get him to laugh and open up.

"
Catch your crush’s eye.,
Drop your gaze downward.,
Slowly bring your gaze back up.",How to Flirt With Eye Contact2," This may happen in a natural context, such as when you need to talk to each other, or you pass each other in a hallway. However, if you’re in a busy social setting, keep your eyes on your crush until they look up and meet yours.There’s a difference between looking at someone and staring. Make sure your gaze is curious and inviting. You don’t want to seem like you’re impatient or upset.

, Once your crush makes eye contact with you and you’ve held it for a couple of seconds, let your eyes drop down as though you’re feeling shy (which you probably are anyway). Only let the eyes drop momentarily, however. You don’t want your crush to steer their focus elsewhere.You can drop your eyes down toward your lap or the floor to appear shy.
If you’re feeling bold, you can drop your eyes to one of your crush’s other features, such as their lips, chest, or groin. This can be very suggestive and may turn some people off, but it’s great if you want to be extremely obvious about your intentions.

, Once you’ve dropped your eyes a bit, bring them back up to meet your crush’s gaze again. They’ll likely have some kind of questioning look on their face, since you’ve just sent a clear signal that you’re flirting with them.You can now choose to hold the eye contact or look away again.
If you were engaged in a conversation, keep talking. Feel free to keep up the eye contact and drop your eyes down again whenever you want to appear coy.

"
"
Make eye contact with your crush.,
Smile.,
Add some energy.,
Add another gesture or expression to convey that you are flirting.",How to Flirt With Eye Contact3," You can do this technique in any context. It’s great if you work together or are already friends. If you are in a situation with a lot of other people, you may need to say or do something to get your crush’s attention so that you can make eye contact.Don’t do anything too outlandish to get your crush’s attention. Simply saying, “Excuse me, do you have the time?” or saying, “Hello” is plenty.

, This might seem obvious but sometimes if you have a crush on someone, you’ll feel so nervous that you’ll forget to smile. As soon as your crush makes eye contact with you, let a nice big smile show on your face.People can subconsciously tell if a smile is real or fake. To make sure that your smile looks warm and genuine let your teeth show and make sure that your eyes squint up, creating crows feet on your face.

, This may be a little bit confusing, since it’s more subtle. To add energy to the interaction, simply let the positive and nervous feelings you have around the person energize the way you look at them. Don’t try to hide it. Some ways to add energy are:Take a deep breath and let it out through your mouth.
Straighten your posture.

, You can try waving, touching your face, winking, or brushing back your hair. You can smile, shift your eyes a bit, and lick your lips if you're feeling a little bit bold. Choose small facial gestures that work for you.Winking can be flirtatious, but is sometimes viewed as old fashioned, or even creepy depending on the context. Use your intuition to tell you if it would work well with your crush.
You can also blink slightly more often around your crush. This is something people do subconsciously when they’re around someone they’re attracted to. It will help send subtle messages that you like them.

"
"
Use positive body language.,
Repeat the clues.,
Flirt in writing first.,
Hang around him.",How to Flirt With a Shy Guy2," Some shy guys are observant and likely to pick up on the smallest signals of flirtation that others might miss.


Play to this strength of his by using body language to flirt with him and communicate that you like him. People’s body language can convey interest or disinterest in another person. Lean forward and make eye contact with him.To communicate interest, keep your body language open. Smile when you see him. Smile a lot and big. Look him directly in the eyes when you first smile, and then quickly glance away, looking down while still smiling.
When talking to him, keep your feet pointed toward him not away from him. Don’t crowd his space too much, but square your body toward his. Laugh at his jokes.
Don’t cross your arms or your legs as this can be a sign of closing off and can signal a lack of interest to someone who’s paying close attention. Touch him lightly on his shoulder.

, The shy guy might be insecure and he might not be sure you were really flirting with him the first or even the second time you do it.


If you smiled at him in the hall, he might think you were just being nice until you do it the third time or more.
The key here is to send him the signals more than once so he grows confidence in the fact that, yes, he’s actually getting them.
If you pursue him too aggressively, he might back away, so do this subtly. The art of flirtatiousness is to remain a little mysterious while still accessible.

, It’s a sign a shy guy likes you if he communicates with you by text or email a lot, but doesn’t talk to you. His friends might tease him when you’re around because they know he likes you.


That might just mean that he’s less comfortable with verbal communication. Reach him through pathways that are in his zone of comfort. Some shy guys are deep thinkers who may respect wordplay.In addition to texting and writing him, click like on his pictures on Facebook or add a breezy and positive comment to a post he’s made.
Use emojis to flirt. Don’t be afraid to text him something first, just keep it light. Can you believe how hard that assignment was? Could be a good opening. Send him a friend request.

, In order to , make sure you’re around him more often, just do it in a subtle manner.Sit a little closer to his table in the lunchroom, for example. If you know he walks his dog in the park every morning at a certain time, go jogging there.
Put yourself in situations where you can easily strike up a conversation. Sit just beneath him at an athletic event or school dance, for example.
If he’s older, show up at the coffee shop where he works on his computer in the mornings and sit at the table next to him.

"
"
Approach him individually.,
Stay in his comfort zone.,
Recognize whether he’s into you.,
Be patient.,
Accept his shyness.",How to Flirt With a Shy Guy3," If he’s a shy guy, then he’s probably uncomfortable in large groups of people, especially those he doesn’t know.


That’s especially true of the girlfriends of the girl he might secretly like (you). You’ll have to get him to open up to you by flirting with him one-on-one.
Shy guys are going to withdraw more if you always come around hanging with a pack of girlfriends. Separate from the herd!Approach him in a setting where your flirting won’t be on display: by his locker room, as he’s walking to his car, and so forth, not in the lunchroom where he’s also sitting with others. If he’s an older shy guy out of high school, the same applies.

, To , don’t make it too obvious. There’s no magic equation you need to know or master. Just be yourself.


That means being friendly with him in a casual way, by approaching him and saying hi or striking up a conversation about an area of mutual interest.
You could mention a particularly tough homework assignment or, if he’s older, a sports team’s loss or victory (if he’s interested in that).
The goal here is to not act too obvious with your flirting. Flirting is really about showing interest in another person, and with a shy guy, you should start low key and friendly.

, All of this is well and good, but one of the most difficult parts of flirting with a shy guy is trying to figure out whether he’s interested in you.


If he gets nervous around you, by stammering or blushing or the like, he’s probably interested in you.If he asks your friends about you, that’s a sign of interest.Pay attention to his body language back. Does he use open body language to indicate he’s receptive to the flirting? A shy guy might feel intimidated around you.
If he teases you, jokes, or acts silly around you, he probably likes you. This is a way that shy guys cover their unease and embarrassment. He might be shy but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s an introvert. Introverts are personality types who gain energy through being alone.
If he goes silent around you, it’s not necessarily a sign of disinterest from a shy guy. The more he actually likes you, the more uneasy he will feel around you.

, Don’t give up on a shy guy too soon. It’s going to take a bit longer for him to pick up on and then acknowledge your cues.It may very well be worth it in the end though because the shy guy doesn’t flirt with everyone. Thus, when you get him to flirt with you back, you’ll know it means something.
Don’t hesitate to be the person who initiates at first. You might even be the one who has to initiate the first date. Ask him somewhere casual at first, for coffee or to a movie. You might wait forever with a shy guy if you wait for him to make the first move.
Guys are shy for different reasons. Maybe he’s been rejected before or it stems from a childhood experience. More likely it’s just genetics. He’s a quiet type. That’s who he is.

, Dating a shy guy is not a bad thing. Many shy people are thoughtful, introspective people who are often deep thinkers.


It’s a mistake to try to change anyone. Don’t expect that, by flirting with him or dating him, you can turn him into something he is not.
Accept that this is his personality type and work from there. That doesn’t mean, though, that he won’t come out of his shell a bit as you get to know him better.
It’s human nature to want things you have to chase a bit. The shy guy is appealing sometimes because he’s a bit mysterious and doesn’t give away everything to everyone. Thus, if you become his eventual confidante, you’ll feel very special.

Ask him for his number.,
Give him your number.,
Tell him you would like to “keep in touch.” When you meet an adorable guy and really hit it off, it is natural and acceptable to want to remain in contact.",How to Get a Guy's Phone Number1," Directly asking a cute guy for his number is more than little nerve wracking, but the risk is worth the reward. When you have worked up the confidence to ask for his phone number, consider using a cheesy pick-up line, a cute video, or a note. Your boldness may capture his attention and score you his number.When approaching a stranger for his phone number, you can be more bold, daring, and memorable. By him a drink and ask the server to write your name and phone number on the cup. Tell him you are playing the phone number game and you need his digits to beat your friend.When you ask an acquaintance or close friend for his number, there is more at stake because the chances of you encountering him again are significantly higher. Instead of asking him directly for his number, request his digits in a joking way. Ask him if you can check of his phone. After a few minutes, hand it back to him. Tell him “your phone is pretty cool but it is missing one thing: my phone number.” If he is interested in exchanging numbers, he will ask for yours.If you met him through work and it is not appropriate to ask directly for his number, consider asking for his business card instead.;

Create a reason to exchange numbers.,
Call or text yourself from his phone.",How to Get a Guy's Phone Number2," Whether you are struggling to strike up the nerve to ask a guy for his number or you missed your window of opportunity to do so, consider asking a mutual friend for his number.

Provide your friend with a reasonable explanation, such as “I think he is cute,” “I want to get to know him better,” “he left before I could ask him myself,” or “I need it to invite him to a party.”

, Sometimes, it is necessary to create opportunities to exchange numbers with a cute guy. Potential opportunities include:


Asking him to study. After you express interest in reviewing for a test or exam with him, ask to exchange numbers so you can plan a study session.Making plans. Casually invite him to hang out with a group of friends or ask if he would be interested in doing an activity that just the two of you enjoy.

Ask to use his phone to make an call or send a text. When he gives you his phone, ring or text yourself.

Friend him on social media.,
Respond to his request for phone numbers.,
Ask for his number via social media.",How to Get a Guy's Phone Number3," After you meet a cute guy, don’t hesitate to send him a friend request on social media. When he accepts your request, you will have access to his profile, which contain his phone number. If his number isn’t listed, send him a message or chat with him online instead., When people get new phones, they will often post a message on social media requesting their friends’ phone numbers.

Fortunately, social media provides you with several alternative ways to communicate with your crush:


Instead of asking for your crush’s number in person, send him a private message requesting his number.
Chat with your crush online. After talking for a while, explain that you have to get going and ask if you can continue talking with him via text instead.
Send flirty tweets back and forth with your crush. Once you capture his attention, ask for his number."

Glance at him every now and then, you may catch him looking at you too.,
If you do catch his gaze, smile and say hi!,
Continue your shopping, but keep glancing.,
Now you can talk to him, if he does not talk to you first you go to him.

,
Start a conversation.,When you feel as though the conversation can come to a close (and leave him wanting more) tell him you enjoyed talking with him, tell him you would love to see him again, this should give him the idea that you are interested and he will probably ask for a number, if not you ask him (unless his body language says he is not interested)

,

,, Start this conversation with something like ""Oh, that shirt you have will look great on you, you should get it!"" if he is holding a shirt or something. Just continue from there!

,, No guy wants a fake ditz. If you feel him looking at you when you stop, smile a little and giggle to yourself as if you remembered something funny (but don't look at him while doing this), it will be inviting and cute. Glance at him and smile and look away shyly. Bite your lip once(practice this in the mirror!) He should come to you in a heart beat!"

Smile at her.,
Use work as a way to break the ice.,
Offer to help her with work projects.,
Bring her coffee or lunch.,
Keep the physical gestures to a minimum.,
Ask her to hang out after work.,
Find something you have in common besides work.,
Offer to take her to lunch on a workday.,
Avoid coming on too strongly.,
Understand the policies on workplace romance at your job.,
Avoid going after multiple girls at work.,
Avoid flirting with a superior, or someone below you.,
Understand that she might not want you to flirt with her.,
Realize that failed office relationships can lead to an unhappy workplace environment.",How to Flirt With a Girl You Work With," It’s simple, but smiling and being polite and kind are great ways to subtly hint that you like her. Workplaces are professional atmospheres, so livening up a bit and being friendly and outgoing could set you apart to her from the other people at work.A simple smile or joke is an appropriate form of flirting, and doesn’t cross any professional lines. If she smiles back and goes along with it, you know she’s into it. Alternatively, if she seems standoffish and shuts it down, you know to back off without any embarrassment.;
, Try adding a joke in through a work memo email, or sending her a funny picture via webchat while you’re at work. Make a lighthearted joke about the meeting you both attended earlier in the day.You both have at least one thing in common: work. Use it as a way to start a conversation. Just avoid petty gossip about co-workers. You want to come off as a positive person, not a downer. Also, avoid any inappropriate jokes. Keep things friendly and light.

, If she gets assigned a big project or has to stay late, offer to stay and help. Ask her if she needs anything, or if there’s anything you can do for her. Being helpful is friendly, but also shows her that you’re interested in spending some extra time with her.If she misses a meeting or isn’t at work on a day you get new equipment or learn a new policy, bring her up to speed with some notes or a quick phone call. Again, you’ll be helping her out, but also showing her that you’re interested in her. Say something like, “I noticed you were out the other day, so I took down some notes during the meeting for you.” You’ll be letting her know you notice when she’s not around, as well.

, This will be like giving her a gift, but not one too garish or forward. It’s far more understated than giving her flowers, but will still show her you were thinking of her. Plus, it’ll give you a reason to go up and approach her for a conversation about something other than work.The next time you’re headed out for coffee, ask if she wants some. If she does, she’ll tell you her go-to order, and later on, you’ll know exactly what to get her. Plus, it’s yet another opportunity to express interest in her, give her a smile, and offer to do something nice while still staying professional.

, Public displays of affection in a workplace can make other people feel uncomfortable, and it might be a different co-worker who ends up reporting you to a supervisor. Plus, physical gestures like touching could possibly make her feel uncomfortable as well, which is the opposite of what you want.Keep things professional, even when flirting. You can be flirtatious without touching her at all. Eye contact, smiles, and glances are just as effective as touching but don’t come with the possibility of coming off too forward or behaving inappropriately. You might also compliment her work ethic. Praise a project she did well recently.
Keep things light and more on the prude side, just to be safe. Don’t make any sexual comments, or say anything that she might be offended by. These kinds of comments could lead to negative consequences like harassment suits or complaints filed against you with human resources.

, Start with an activity that other co-workers will be at, so that she doesn’t think you’re singling her out entirely. It won’t seem as if you’re coming on too strong this way. Then, once you’ve gone out as a group, you can suggest you hang out together alone outside of work.When you ask her out for some one-on-one time, try to make it casual. Invite her as if you were going already, and decided to ask her along. It will seem a little less intimidating, as it will seem like less than a date. Say something like, “I was going to hit my favorite bar after work today for a drink or two. Want to come along?”

, When flirting with someone you work with, it’s easy to constantly fall back on work as a constant conversation topic. Instead, ask her about what she likes to do outside of work. Not only will this show her you’re interested in her as more than just a co-worker, it’ll also give you some hints about her as a person.


If you work in a place that has offices, desks, or cubicles, take a glance at hers as you walk by and see what sort of knick-knacks she has. These might also be hints to her interests, and you can use them as conversation starters.

, One way to get some one-on-one time with a little less pressure is a quick lunch break together. You could ask her to grab a bite with you outside the office, or even just grab the seat beside her in the break room while she’s eating.


Lunch is a great opportunity to have a conversation, break the ice, and get to know her a little better. If you take her someplace away from work, you’ll be away from the prying eyes of your co-workers, and things can be a little more casual and comfortable.

, Even if she makes the first move, hang back and be cautious. You wouldn’t want to reciprocate a touch or a hug and then have things go bad down the road, and have her file a retroactive complaint against you. Stick to light, friendly, and appropriate gestures and conversations.Dating and flirting in the workplace is tricky if you aren’t careful. Make sure you aren’t coming on too strong right away, and make sure you are reading her body language and signals to know whether or not she wants to reciprocate.

, Some business or companies might have strict rules against any kind of fraternizing between co-workers. Consequences for doing so could even be termination, so make sure you know what the rules are before you pursue the girl at work.Sometimes, policies like these only exist if the co-workers are on different levels. For example, it might be against the rules for a supervisor to date or pursue his subordinates. Other times, there are no policies in place regarding workplace romance at all., Not only is that just bad form and pretty rude, you might end up in a sticky situation if the girls find out. If you want to flirt with or pursue a girl at work, stick to her only, and don’t throw pick up lines at every girl in the office.More often than not, gossip tends to circulate around workplaces. You don’t want to end up with a few ladies having bad things to say about you, and then everyone hearing about it. It could make your place of work a very unpleasant place to be.

, These kinds of relationships can cause a lot of friction in the workplace as they could possibly make other employees think there is favoritism happening. Make sure the girl you’re flirting with is at the same level as you in the company.Women are especially subjected to criticism when dating people in the workplace. Make sure you aren’t putting a female co-worker into a situation in which she could be negatively judged.

, If she reacts negatively to your gestures, joking, or singling out, take the hint and don’t push it any further. She might report unwanted attention to your boss, or things could simply get very awkward at work.If she isn’t responding to your flirting, or if she shows signs of wanting you to stop, make sure you listen to your gut and don’t push things. If she feels harassed or threatened, she could file a sexual harassment complaint against you, or report you to a supervisor.
If she seems uncomfortable or unreceptive when you flirt with her at work, talk to her after work. Apologize and explain yourself. You may find out that she was only shutting down your advances because you were at work. Read her signals and body language. If she shies away, or looks upset or irritated, back off.

, If things go sour with someone in the workplace, you might find yourself feeling uncomfortable and awkward at work. Office gossip might not end up in your favor, or being around the girl who turned down your advances might just feel awkward.Weigh the pros and cons of pursuing the girl at work before you do so. If the idea of things possibly going badly and resulting in an uncomfortable workplace doesn’t seem to outweigh the pros of pursuing the girl you like, then consider looking for someone outside of work.

Look him in the eye, but don't stare him down.,
Be confident.,
Don't turn him away with body language.,
Have a good time.",How to Get a Guy to Ask You Out On a Date1," If you make sure he knows you see him by glancing in his direction, he's more likely to come say hello.

Make brief eye contact.,
Smile.,
Raise your eyebrows.",How to Flirt With a Girl You Barely See1," Another way to get someone's attention is to make eye contact. This is particularly helpful if you see the girl somewhere like a bar or party. Brief eye contact can send the message that you have interest in this person and would like to talk.Try to catch the girl's eyes. Glance at her when she's looking in your direction and wait for her to look back.
Hold her gaze for about 4 seconds and then look away. Four seconds is long enough to establish a connection. Any shorter may be mistaken for accidental eye contact, and any longer may make things feel awkward.;
, Flashing a winning smile at someone from across the room is a great way to get their attention. While holding the girl's eye contact, offer a quick and warm smile. This will convey you're paying attention to her., You can also try raising your eyebrows slightly while making eye contact. This is a flirtatious gesture that does not read as overtly sexual. This can show the girl you're a friendly, approachable person. She may be more likely to engage you with conversation later on if you raise your eyebrows during eye contact."
"
Talk about simple things.,
Notice what he likes.,
Crack a witty joke.,
Ask him about himself.,
Listen and talk in equal turns.",How to Get a Guy to Ask You Out On a Date2," A conversation starter doesn't have to be complex. You can bring up the weather or what's going on in your city. You can mention a new movie or a new book on the market. Anything can open up the way for a conversation.For instance, you could say ""Did you see that bit about the mayor slipping on the city steps? What a way to start off a term!""

, If you see he's carrying a wallet featuring a certain sports team, ask him about it. If you notice his scotch is an expensive brand, inquire about how he got into drinking scotch. Asking people about what they like is a sure way to start a conversation.As an example, if you see he likes the Texas Rangers, you could say, ""How do you think the Rangers are shaping up this year? I'm ready for the season to start!""

, Make a pun or even tell a joke you've memorized by heart. Guys like humor, and it will draw him into the conversation.It's fine if your joke is a little cheesy. For instance, you could open with ""Jeez, somebody forgot to turn off the snow, didn't they? They should fire that guy.""

, People love to talk about themselves, so ask about his job or his hobbies. It's a great way to start building a relationship, especially if you have mutual interests.For instance, you could say, ""So what do you do for a living?"" or ""What do you like to do in your spare time?"" You could also ask ""What are you passionate about?""

, Actually listen to what he has to say and respond to what he's saying. You don't want to overpower him with too much talking.However, he also wants to get to know you, so don't always deflect the conversation back to him. Be willing to share some about yourself.For instance, if he says he enjoys gardening, you could say, ""I've always had a black thumb, but I love fresh herbs. It must be nice to be able to grow things well.""

Look for signs of interest.,
Bring up interesting questions.,

Let him know you're available.,
Bring up dating opportunities.,
Use silence to your advantage.,
Be patient.,
Hold some of yourself back.,
Be realistic.",How to Get a Guy to Ask You Out On a Date3," If he seems engaged in the conversation, he likely wants to see you some more. His body language will tell you whether he's engaged. For instance, if he's pointing his body towards you rather than away and if he's smiling, those are good signs. Similarly, if he seems to be genuinely listening and responding to you, he's likely interested., Just asking the right questions can make you seem more interesting, and those questions can open up space for finding similar interests.For instance, you could ask him about the last interesting book he read by saying something to the effect of ""So are you a reader? What have you been reading lately?"" If he's not a reader, move on to a movies instead. As an example, you could say, ""Oh, well, nobody has time to read these days. Do you enjoy movies instead?""You could also ask sort of what-if questions, such as ""Would you prefer to have power or money?"" or ""What would you tell your younger self if you could?""Try asking him where he was born or where he considers his hometown. That gives you a jumping-off point for talking about childhood and family. You could say, ""So where'd you grow up?"",

For example, you could say, ""I heard there's going to be an awesome jazz band at The Jazz Club over the weekend. Do you like jazz?"" , If you can make a suggestion about a dating opportunity, let him talk his way into it by staying quiet for a minute or two. Most people will try to fill silence, so he will keep talking, which works to your advantage., Some guys take a little longer to get around to asking you out. He could be shy or introverted, and he may need to work up the nerve to ask you on a date. Don't be discouraged if he doesn't instantly ask you on a date., You don't have to disclose everything about yourself in the first 5 minutes; you're just getting to know the guy., That is, not every guy you meet is going to be the one. If you can't get him to ask you out, don't worry about it. He's obviously not the person you should be with for the long haul."
"
Watch for opportunities for small talk.,
Gesture while you talk.,
Nod.,
Mimic the girl's body language.,
Listen.,
Ask about the other person.,
Use a flirtatious tone.,
Try light touching.",How to Flirt With a Girl You Barely See2," If you successfully get the girl's attention, she may approach you to talk. However, you can also look for small talk opportunities throughout the day depending on where you see the girl. You can strike up a conversation when it's appropriate.Parties and large social gatherings are generally the easiest time to flirt. People are often more relaxed and uninhibited, making them more receptive to flirtation. If you happen to see this girl at a social event, that would be a good time to try and flirt. Social events at bars and other places that serve alcohol are a particularly good place to flirt. Stick to areas, like around the counter, that are thought of as public zones, where it's appropriate to strike up conversation with someone you don't know well.
Learning places, like schools or colleges, are also decent places to flirt. If you see this girl during class, you can try to flirt with her before or after a lesson begins. It can be easy to flirt during class as conversation can be somewhat easy. As you're both enrolled in the same course, you have something in common to discuss right away.
If you want to flirt at your office, be careful. Make sure you review your company's policy on work relationships. You should also stick to flirting in areas like the break room or cafeteria, where people are not busy doing their jobs. You can also engage in quick flirting during things like morning greetings or in the minutes before a meeting begins.

, Gesturing while you talk can convey a lot. Certain hand gestures can help keep the girl engaged with you, and you can also use gestures to promote intimacy, understanding, and flirtation.Try to be more lively and animated in conversation, moving your hands as you speak. This can convey that you're invested in the other person and engaged in the conversation.
You should also make small, subtle movements to keep the girl's focus on you. Shift your hands slightly at the end of each sentence. Use open palm hand movements to kind of project what you're saying on the girl. If you're trying to make a point, use a downward hand movement, like placing your hand on the table, to better convey that point.
Watch the girl's hand movements as well. If she seems animated and lively, and is using a lot of gestures, she's probably engaged in talking to you. If she seems stiff or bored, you may want to switch up the conversation topic. This is a sign she's not interested.

, You want to make sure you're listening to the girl. If you appear interested in what she's saying, this can come off as flirtatious. A good way to keep the conversation moving, and show that you're paying attention, is periodically nodding.Make small, brief nods as the girl is speaking. This shows you're listening and encourages her to keep the flow of conversation moving.
Quick, double nods are best. Single nods or triple nods can come off as confusion or frustration, resulting in the conversation halting.

, Mimicry is the highest form of flattery. It's a good idea to try to mirror the girl's body language. In a subtle, somewhat unconscious way, this can convey you're interested and help the girl feel flattered.Try to position your body in the same way she does. Move your arms and legs in a similar manner. If she crosses her legs, for example, you can cross your legs as well.
Do not take it too far, however. Mimicking body language exactly can come off as mockery. Try to follow her body language to a degree, but do not imitate her every movement as it's happening.

, When flirting, you should strive to listen as much as you talk, if not more. People are attracted to those who seem interested and engaged with them. Smile as the girl speaks, ask her questions about what she's saying, and smile, nod, and laugh when appropriate to convey you're paying attention., If you don't see the girl a lot, any information you can get is valuable. You can convey interest, which is flirtatious, by asking about the other person. Of course, you should not dip into deep personal questions right away. Light questions, however, can be very helpful. Try things like, ""How was your day?"" and ""That's a great color on you. Where did you get that dress?""

, Vocal signals can also come off as flirtatious. During the brief moments you have to talk to the girl in question, make sure to use a flirty tone.Try to incorporate variation in pitch. Monotone can come off as disinterest. When giving brief, one word answers, like ""Yeah"" or ""Okay"", try to deliver them with enthusiasm. This can show you're engaged with the person and want to continue the conversation.
You can use a questioning tone at the end of some sentences, where you emphasize the last syllables. This can be particularly helpful when striking up a conversation, as it invites the girl to share her opinion. There's a big difference between, ""Crazy test yesterday"" and ""Crazy test yesterday, huh?"" The latter encourages the girl to share her opinion, giving you an in for conversation.

, Touching can help greatly with flirting. Small, subtle touches can increase feelings of intimacy and convey an interest in the girl. However, be careful with touching. Touching that feels inappropriate or invasive can ruin your chances.The arm is generally the safest place to touch, as this is an area that's not too intimate. A brief touch on the girl's arm in conversation can increase feelings of intimacy. You can also try a light touch on the hand.
Make sure you pay attention to how a girl is acting around you before trying touching. If she's mimicking your body language, turned towards you, and engaged in conversation, she's probably interested. A light touch is okay. If she seems distant, however, touching can easily feel alienating.
You should also keep in mind touching may not be appropriate in all situations. Touching is probably safest at a social gathering, like a party. Touching at work or school could come off as inappropriate, especially if your office or school has rules against touching and flirtation in certain situations.

Act natural.,
Use humor.,
Form a genuine connection.",How to Flirt With a Girl You Barely See3," When trying to flirt in a short amount of time, it can be easy to get hung up on details and come off as bumbling or nervous. However, try to keep in mind much of flirting is innate. If you're interested in someone, things like flirtatious body language and conversation will probably come naturally. While you should try to keep in mind how to convey interest, relax and go with the flow of the conversation. You probably flirting in subtle ways you're not even completely aware of., If you have a natural sense of humor, use it to your advantage. People may feel more relaxed when they laugh together. If you're trying to flirt with, say, a barista at a coffee shop, try to think of a funny observation while checking out. If you're at a party, try to make a joke about the decorations, theme, or other aspects of the event.

, Being flirtatious is often thought of as a way to brag about yourself or flatter another person. However, most people are drawn to a genuine connection. Try to stay calm and be yourself. Do not try to show off. Just try to talk to the girl in a way that shows you're interested in her. People are often flattered by flirtation, and genuine interest will get you farther than bragging."

Choose a good time to talk.,
Choose a good location.,
Clear your throat.,
Don’t eat while talking.,
Don’t wait 3 days to call.",How to Flirt With a Girl on the Phone1," When you’re calling a girl, you don’t necessarily want to set up a specific time that you’ll call. But you should choose a good time when you have some time to devote to talking. Then, you won’t feel rushed in the conversation. She’ll wonder why you called her when you only have a few minutes to talk.


If she can’t talk when you call, ask when it will be a good time to call back. She might be at work or at an appointment. Let her choose a time for you to call her, and then be sure to call her at that time.;
, Make sure you’re in a good spot when you call her. Don’t call when you’re on the bus or walking through a really crowded area. It can be hard to hear her or your voice might go in and out. Even worse, your call might drop and you’ll lose the connection.

, Don’t start off the conversation with a frog in your throat that will make your voice sound weird. Clear your throat or give a little cough to make sure your voice sounds clear.


If you have a really bad cold and your nose is plugged up, it will be harder for her to understand you over the phone. You can still call to say hi, but keep the conversation short. Cut your conversation short by telling her you’re going to get some rest so you can be well for when you get together in person.

, The sound of someone eating can be really off-putting, and if you are chomping on a burger or slurping down a milkshake, the phone might amplify that noise. It will also be harder to understand you if you’re chewing in the middle of a sentence.

, Some dating advice recommends that you should wait 3 days after getting a phone number before you call a girl. This is terrible advice. Show her that you’re interested by calling when you want to call. This might even be the day after you met her. If you wait too long, she’ll just be annoyed and think you don’t consider her to be very important."

Draw attention to your lips!,
Smile!",How to Flirt With Body Language1," Winking, squinting, rolling your eyes, or even using your eyebrows and eyes together is part of using your eyes as body language.;
, By raising your right eyebrow, you are telling the other person you want to know more about them. By raising both eyebrows, you are asking the other person, ""You thinking what I'm thinking?""

, Girls, this only works for you. Inhale deeply, expanding your chest. This will draw the man's attention to your breast.

, Yes, your lips! Your lips are a powerful flirting weapon. Smiling, puckering, pursing, licking, and biting are each part of flirting using your lips.

, Look at your crush. When they turn to look at you, just smile a bit. It doesn't have to be a huge, overly animated grin; just a friendly smile. This will show that you think they're interesting yet keep you mysterious without being cold.


If you find this hard, think of something funny or think of them. it almost always will make you smile or giggle.

, When communicating with a girl online for the first time, put yourself out there so she knows that you are interested in her.


Start out by saying, ""Hello!"" or ""Hi there!""
Introduce yourself briefly; your name is likely all you need to share at this point.
Ask her a question about something you saw on her profile that caught your eye.

, Online flirting and dating can feel uncomfortable and dangerous to many women, especially when they do not actually know the man with whom they are talking.Respond to her in a timely fashion once she gets back to you. Responding too quickly might indicate that you are too eager, while taking too long might indicate that you have lost interest. It is best to respond within a few hours, whenever possible.Focus on learning about who she is and what her personality is like. Asking her about her physical appearance or to send you photographs of herself will give the wrong impression of why you are chatting with her.
Avoid immediately asking her out on a date or to meet in person. This also might give her the wrong impression and cause her to stop chatting with you. It is best to get to know each other for at least a few days before doing this.

, The point right now is to get to know her enough to determine whether you would like to take her on a date.


Keep the conversation balanced in terms of how much you talk about yourself. Answer her questions about you, and turn the conversation back around to her when you can.
Be polite and funny, if appropriate. Do not be afraid to make jokes that you find funny, because chances are, she might also find them funny.

,""What do you do for a living?""
""If you could go on vacation anywhere in the world, where would it be and why?""
""What is your favorite season and why?""
""Do you have brothers and/or sisters? How many?""
""What is your favorite pastime with you family?""
""What do you most enjoy doing with friends?""
""Which is your favorite holiday and why?""
""Do you like animals? What kinds?""
""How would your best friend describe you?""
""What is your favorite memory from high school/college?""
""What is your favorite app on your phone?""

,""You have such a great sense of humor!""
""It's so interesting to hear you talk about traveling. You really love it!""
""That's such a great book! You have great taste.""
""You have great taste in music.""
""I can tell that your family is really important to you. I appreciate that.""
""It's so great that you're passionate about volunteering. This world needs more people like you!""
""I haven't met many people who love their career like you do. Keep it up!""
""You have such a big heart for animals, and I like that about you.""
""You're such a caring person. I really admire that about you.""

, Ask her some questions to feel out what you have in common.


""What is your favorite genre of music?""
""Have you ever been to any concerts? Which one was your favorite?""
""What is your favorite genre of reading?""
""Do you have a favorite professional or college sports team?""
""Have you traveled many places?""
""What is your favorite type of food?""
""Do you like to cook or bake?""
""What kind of extracurricular activities were you involved in while you were high school/college?""

, Keep the conversation focused on getting to know each other. Say what you truly feel or believe in a polite way, and avoid controversial topics. These will likely lead to a disagreement and a negative experience.


Do not complain about family or friends
Do not complain about your job
Do not complain about other women you have dated or flirted with in the past
Do not discuss topics such as politics and legal matters
Do not talk about religion if you are unsure of her religious affiliation
Do not discuss topics such as environmentalism and animal rights
Do not discuss topics such as civil rights and women's rights

, Again, these could send the message that you are interested in the wrong things. This includes sexually explicit conversation. Here are examples of questions that you should not ask while initially flirting with and getting to know a girl online.


""What is your yearly income?""
""When were you last in a relationship?""
""Why did your last relationship end?""
""How many boyfriends have you had?""
""Have you ever been married?""
""Where do you live?""

, It is a turn-off for many women to see that a man spells poorly, uses incorrect grammar, or uses too many emoticons.


Use correct spelling and grammar to the best of your ability. It does not need to be perfect, but making an effort to do so shows maturity and responsibility.
Use punctuation appropriately. It is possible that she will say something that you really like or find funny, but you should avoid using more than one exclamation point at the end of your response sentence., These can send the message that you are immature or do not know how to communicate.


Overuse of emoticons sends the message that you have nothing important to say, or it undermines what you have already said.
Use of emoticons might send the wrong message, such as indicating something inappropriate.
Contrary to what you might think, emoticons are not necessary to help someone understand your tone or how you intend a message to be received.

, Tone is hard to convey online, so do not assume that she will pick up on your intended tone.Keep your messages simple until you get to know her better.
Be straightforward, including when you are trying to make a joke.Remember the tips above about punctuation and emoticons. Things like all caps or excessive exclamation points can be interpreted as yelling, for example.
Avoid sarcasm while chatting online. It is highly likely to be taken the wrong way when used in online communication with someone you do not know well.
Avoid assuming that she has an understanding of every topic you bring up. The safest thing to do is to ask if she is familiar, and if she is not, then you can explain it.

, A girl likes to have confirmation that you are interested in her, and following up after messaging or chatting in a chat room gives her that reassurance.


When you get busy with your personal life and cannot respond for a period of time, send her a quick message to let her know you are still thinking about her and will respond more in-depth when you have more time.
If you are trying to chat with the same girl in an online chat room on more than one occasion, be on the lookout for her username. When you feel comfortable, ask her for her email address for more private and consistent communication.
Continue to flirt with her online until you feel comfortable enough to take the online relationship to the next step.

, If you are able to meet with this girl in person (online chat rooms, for example, connect you with people from all over the world), then choose a public place to do so in order to make her feel comfortable.


Dinner dates feel intimidating to some women for first dates, so an afternoon date might be more her style.
Choose an activity that is laid back and will not add to the pressure of a first date. For example, seeing a local band play or painting clay pottery gives you something else to focus on to take pressure off of making conversation the entire time.
Be willing to accommodate whatever time she suggests, as well as ideas that she has for what you can do on your date. Show her that you welcome and appreciate her input and sense of security.

, If you ask her out on a date and she turns you down because she still feels uncomfortable, give it more time if you are genuinely interested in her.


Taking more time to get to know her and make her feel comfortable will result in a date when she is ready.
Suggest moving your conversation to personal email or phone numbers via text messaging or calling. This gives you a new way to communicate with her and help her feel more comfortable.
Show her that you are willing to wait for her by continuing to chat with her, taking an interest in her life and her story, and showing your patience.

You might tease her a little, but don’t be mean. Be sure to listen carefully to her response. If she seems to get colder when you tease her, let up.

, Flirting over the phone doesn’t work as well when you’re talking about heavy or controversial topics. Choose topics that are easy to talk about, such as movies or travel.


You can also follow up on something that you talked about in a previous conversation., When you’re just getting to know someone, you don’t want to offend her or making her feel uncomfortable by talking dirty. You’ll just come across as a creep and she’ll want to get off the phone.

Don’t text too much.,
Don’t rely only on texting.,
Don’t get upset if she doesn’t text back.",How to Flirt With a Girl on the Phone5," If the girl gave you her number and you want to start texting with her, a good starting point is to text about something you will both laugh about. Maybe there’s an inside joke or something that you both have in common that you can message about.


Stay away from texting something boring like, “How are you?” This will probably only get you a boring answer and it won’t engage her very much.

, Send a text with specific details about the last time you were together in person. For example, you might say, “I loved you in that red dress the other day.” She’ll feel special that you remembered these details., Sending 20 texts in different parts of the day will likely be overwhelming.

Show off your best features.,
Face your body towards the other person.,
Break the touch barrier.,
Get closer.",How to Flirt With Body Language2," This can be done through clothes or actions. As with any flirting, be sure to not overdo it or you'll risk looking cheap.


Girls, try moving your hips, playing with your hair, or ""accidentally"" dropping something, only to show off your butt while picking it up.
Guys, show off your physical features. Butt, muscles,strong hands, stomach.

, Hold eye contact for slightly longer than usual.

, Lets say you and the other person are sitting next to each other. Why not say a funny joke? While you two are laughing, unintentionally lightly place your hand on the persons arm.

, Shaking hands or hugging is a very good start. It brings you closer together.


Girls, if you and your man are walking, try faking a trip. Fall towards the man so that he can catch you, but don't let go too quickly! Stare into his eyes as if saying, ""You just saved my life."" Then look around as if saying, ""this is awkward"", then giggle.

Be creative.,
Ask an open question.,
Watch your spelling and grammar.,
Don't come on too strong.",How to Flirt Through Text Messages1," It's hard to be original when you're texting, so the person you want to flirt with will be even more impressed when you're able to pull it off. When you pull out your phone to text that special person in your life, you should try to think of something no one else but you could say. This will pique the interest of your crush and will make him more likely to respond to you right away.


Make your crush laugh. Start off with a short funny statement about something you both saw recently, or referencing a previous conversation.
Make a clever observation. Your crush will certainly respond to that. Flirting with your wit is a great tactic.
Be original. Write something that no one can say but you.;
, An open question is one the other person cannot answer by just saying yes or no. Asking an open question is a great way to impress and flirt with your crush, because it shows that you're not texting just because you feel like it, but because you want to keep a conversation going and care what your crush thinks. Here are some great things to keep in mind when you ask questions:


Keep it simple. Just ask about something that happened during that person's day or week, like how her friend's birthday party went or if her mini-vacation was as fun as she had hoped.
Ask lots of open-ended question. Don't just ask a question that can be answered with a simple ""yes"" or a ""pretty good."" Give your crush room to elaborate and to ask you something back.
Don't be too open-ended. Don't ask a deep philosophical question that your crush doesn't know how to answer. They may be puzzled by your message and could just give up.
Don't be a boring texter. You're less likely to get a response if you say something like, ""What's up?"" or ""How are you?"" Be original, even when you ask questions.
Be thoughtful. If you know your crush had an important event the day before, a text asking how it went shows that you pay attention.

, This may seem silly and irrelevant, but if you were flirting with your crush in person, then you would make sure your outfit was neatly put together and that your hair was in place. Therefore, if you're sending a text message, you should make sure you're using proper punctuation and that your sentences are complete.


If you send sloppy or inarticulate texts, it will look like you don't care enough about the person you're texting to spend enough time scanning your texts.
Your writing doesn't have to be perfect. Just skim each of your texts once before you send it.

, Subtlety is key when you're opening up a text-based conversation, so you should try not to go overboard or your crush will be able to see that you're trying too hard from a mile away. Just relax and send a text when the time feels right, and don't over think it. You shouldn't spend more than a minute deciding what's the best text to send your special someone.


Make sure you're not always the person who sends the first message. If you are, then your crush may not be so excited to hear from you. Play it cool and wait for your crush to chat with you first sometimes.
Don't try too hard to be funny. If your target can tell you spent hours crafting the perfect opening, it's not worth it.
Remember that flirting over text is not so different from flirting in real life. You should still relax and take it easy if you want to be a successful flirt.

Check out your crush.,
Stare, slide, and settle your gaze.,
Maintain prolonged eye contact.,
Bat your eyelashes.",How to Flirt Subtly1," When you met a new person, your eyes peruse their face in a zigzag pattern. You glance at one of their eyes, then the other, and finally you look at their nose. Subtle flirts expand the size of this triangle. After looking at both of your crush’s eyes, skip the nose and quickly glance at their mouth or chest.


If your crush picks up on this, they’ll think you’re checking them out (and they’d be right!).;
, Gaze at your crush until they notice your eyes on them. Once you make eye contact, slowly move your gaze around the room before settling your stare back on them. This quick little trick (approximately 15 seconds) will let your crush know that you’re interested in them., If eye contact generates intimacy, prolonged eye contact is incredibly intimate. When you lock eyes with your crush for more than ten seconds, your bodies experience a physical reaction. Your nervous system is engaged, your heart rate is elevated, and your blood flow increases.


When your crush is talking to you, stare into their eyes., When your gaze settles on someone you find attractive, you tend to blink more. As a result, our brains associate rapid blinking with sexual attraction. The reason for this is two fold. Experiencing an intense emotional reaction, like arousal, causes our eyes to produce more tears. In order to maintain appropriate moisture levels, we blink more.Batting your lashes is a great way to let someone know you find them attractive.

Use positive body language.,
Master the art of subtlety.,
Ask her about herself.,
Tease her.",How to Flirt With a Girl1," Your body can tell a girl that you’re interested before you say a word and can help you be a better flirt throughout your conversation. There are just a few tricks that you need to know to show the girl that you’re interested through your body language.


Maintain eye contact. Look right into the girl's eyes when you're talking and don't check your phone or look around to see what your buddies are doing. You should show the girl that you're giving her your full attention, but glance away occasionally so things don't get too intense.
Keep your arms at your sides or use them to gesture. Don't cross them over your chest or you'll look closed off.
Lean toward her when you speak. Whether you're sitting or standing, lean in a bit to get closer to the girl. Just don't get too close or you'll be one of those ""close talkers"" and may come on too strong.
Don't forget to smile. Let her catch you smiling at her even when you're not saying anything from time to time. It's easier to flirt if you keep up a positive vibe.
Don't slouch. Stand tall and proud and you'll look more confident.;
, Subtlety is the key to being a good flirt. You need to know the difference between saying you’re interested and implying that you’re interested. Saying you’re interested is too obvious and leaves nothing to the imagination. Being subtle and implying you’re interested will intrigue the girl and will keep the conversation going.


Find subtle ways to compliment the girl. Instead of saying you love her outfit, say, ""You must have spent hours putting that together.""
Find subtle ways to show you'd like to spend more time with her. If she says she loves to swim, don't say that you'd love to see her in a bikini. Instead, say, ""I happen to love girls who love to swim. Especially in the summer.""
Find subtle ways to let her know she's special. Instead of saying, ""You look hot,"" tell her, ""A girl like you must not have any trouble getting guys.""

, You don’t have to give the girl the third degree to show that you actually want to get to know her. Finding a way to ask her questions about her interests or background is a great way to be flirty and to show that you’re interested. Here are some things you can ask:


While you're joking around, ask her what she likes to do for fun. This will show that you want to get to know her.
If your siblings come up, ask her if she has any. Girls love talking about their siblings.
Ask her if she has any pets. If she does, ask her if she likes to cuddle with them.
Ask her opinion on something silly or small. Say something that will make her laugh, like ""What do you think about men who wear pink?""

, Once you’re comfortable enough with the girl, you can start to tease her a bit. You might click instantly and be comfortable teasing her within the first minute of talking, or it could take a bit longer to ease into tease-mode. Once it feels right, don’t be afraid to show your playful side by teasing the girl while you’re flirting.


Tease her about her interests. If she says she likes reality TV, ask her if she'd rather be home watching The Bachelor.
Tease her about her appearance. Make sure to do this in a complimentary way. If she's wearing obviously fake gold costume jewelry, ask her if it's real gold.
Tease her about her laugh. If she has a really cute laugh, ask her if she hangs around funny people like you just so she can laugh more often.

Respect their boundaries.",How to Flirt With a Co worker (for Women)1," Men tend to interpret friendly and talkative women as flirty.Find excuses to chat with them when they are not busy. Some things you can try:


Talk about hobbies, interests, and plans outside of work. ""Any big plans for the weekend? I've been dying to see this new movie myself.""
Praise their recent accomplishments or awards: ""I heard you just received an award! Any plans to celebrate?""
Ask them about current projects by saying, ""Hey, how is that current project going? Are you hanging in there?"";
, If your coworker makes a joke or says something even slightly funny, laugh. Laughing is a gentle way of flirting. It should not feel forced, nor should it seem as though you are laughing at your coworker.

, Appreciate the work that they do around the office, and praise them for their strengths. You want to make sure that you are appreciating their skills, abilities, and personality instead of their looks. Some good, flirty compliments include:


""Great job on that last presentation. You'll have to give me some tips.""
""Thanks for helping with that last project. You make my life so much easier around here.""
""You have such good ideas. How do you come up with them?""
Be extremely careful with workplace compliments. If it seems as though the recipient is awkward or uncomfortable, stop immediately.

, Asking people to help you can increase their self-esteem and confidence, which encourages them to flirt back with you.It also shows that you appreciate their strengths in a work-friendly manner. It can even encourage them to spend more time with you. Some ways you try this include:


""Hey, you're good with technology, right? Can you help me with my computer?""
""Do you mind listening to me practice my presentation? I'd love to get your feedback on this.""
""Can you help me lock up tomorrow night?""

, Find excuses to drop by their desk. Perhaps you have a question about your project. Perhaps their desk is close to the coffee maker. As you pass by, make eye contact and ask them about their day.


Walk by their desk, and try to catch their eye. If they look up at you, smile and ask, ""how's your day been?"" or ""Are you hanging in there?""
You can also ask, ""how is the work going? Do you want to take a coffee break?"" This gives them the opportunity to start a conversation if they are interested.
Do not interrupt your coworker if they look as though they are busy with something else. Instead of being flirty, you might only annoy them.

, You may be feeling bolder, or you want to make the next step in your relationship. Instead of asking them to drinks or dinner, which can be too formal, try asking them if they would like to grab something to eat over your lunch break. Coffee is also a great way to bond with your coworker.


A good way to ask is to just say, ""Hey, we should catch up over lunch. Do you want to grab a bite to eat somewhere?""

, Your first priority at work is to do your job. Be warned that flirting at work can get you in trouble if someone complains. If your coworker seems uncomfortable or asks you to stop, do not continue flirting with them. Give them space by only talking to them about work-related matters for a few weeks.


Before you make any moves whatsoever, review your workplace sexual harassment rules, as well as rules about relationships in the workplace. You can also talk to someone in the HR department if you have any further questions.
Make workplace friendly jokes that have no sexual innuendo.
Never flirt with your boss. They are in a position of power, and any flirting can cause professional difficulties for both of you. It is best to flirt with coworkers on your pay grade.
Do not flirt with a coworker who is married or in a relationship. Even if a married coworker enjoys your flirting, you are putting both of you in a difficult situation.

Tease your crush.,
Show your crush you care about him.,
Be a little naughty.,
Don't be too eager.,
Don't use texting to build a meaningful connection.",How to Flirt Through Text Messages2," Teasing over text is a great way to flirt with your crush. You can be a little bit playful and make fun of your crush, and let your crush make fun of you back. This shows that you don't take yourself too seriously and that you're invested in the person you're texting.


Keep it light. Tease your crush for watching a silly movie or spending too much time with his guitar.
Make sure your crush gets that you're joking. It should be clear that you're not trying to be offensive and that you just want to have some fun.
If you have a silly nickname for your crush, use it when you're texting.
Send a wink face emoticon to show that you're just teasing.

, If you want to flirt through texting, then you should find a way to make it clear that you care about the person you're talking to, whether it's by asking a question about his life or just asking how he's feeling.


If your crush is feeling sick, check in to see if he's feeling better.
Use your crush's name occasionally. This will surprise and excite the person you're texting.
Ask your crush's opinion on a new movie or restaurant. This may even turn into plans to check out the new event together.
Compliment your crush. Find a subtle way to let her know she looked cute the other night, or that you liked her new haircut.

, You can find subtle ways to arouse your crush through texting. You don't have to say ""What are you wearing?"" to show that you're thinking about your crush in a less-than-PG-rated manner. Here are some tricks to try:


Casually mention that you just got out of the shower.
Be open. Just say, ""I can't stop thinking about that dress you wore the other night.""
Say, ""I have a bottle of wine in my fridge, and it looks so lonely without you."" Inviting your crush to share a bottle of wine is an invitation for more.

, Remember that you're supposed to play it cool when you're texting, so you shouldn't be the person who sends a hundred questions in a row or asks a question with a million question marks. If you're too excited about texting the person on the other end of the conversation, it will be a major turn off.


Make sure that you and your crush roughly text each other same amount of times. If you send her five texts for every one of her responses, you have a problem.
Emoticons are great for occasional flirtation, but don't overuse them. The same goes for exclamation marks and questions.
Don't respond the moment you get a text. Play it cool and wait a few minutes, or even a few hours, to respond unless the text is time-sensitive. If your crush takes a day to get back to you, don't fire back a text right away or you'll look desperate.

, No relationship is made or broken through a series of text messages. When you text your special someone, remember that texting is a great way to flirt, to make plans, and to take the relationship into the physical world, but not a great way to build rapport or to really get to know someone.


Remember to keep it light. Flirting is all about having fun and being playful, not about getting into a deep discussion.
If you really like the person, try to spend more time talking to him or her than you do sending text messages to that person.

Know when it's time to stop texting.,
Leave on a good note.,
Use your texts as a way to ask your crush out.",How to Flirt Through Text Messages3," You don't want to be that person who keeps up a textual exchange hours after there's nothing left to say. When you're talking to a new love interest at a bar, you should talk just long enough to hook the person and then say you have to leave so you don't drag out what started off as a good conversation. Well, the same goes for texting.


If you're doing most of the talking in a textual exchange, it's time to stop texting.
If you keep sending long messages and getting nothing back but one-word answers, then it's time to stop texting.
If you can just feel that both of you are struggling to find something to say, then it's time to end the conversation.
If you have the sense that you're doing most of the talking every time and that the person you're texting doesn't seem too eager to get back to you, it may be time to end the conversation -- for good.

, Whether you're just stopping the conversation because you're busy or because you're going to meet up, you should leave the person you like with something to think about. Don't just say, ""Bye!"" or that person won't be thinking about you after you stop texting.


If you're meeting up, don't be afraid to say that you can't wait to see that person.
If you have to go, tell the person where you're going and what you're doing. This will make you look like you have a great life outside of texting and will intrigue the person on the other end of the conversation.
Leave an opening to pick up the conversation at another time. Say that you're looking forward to chatting about whatever is on your minds later.

, If your texting sessions have been going really well and your flirting is getting fierce, then you should take your relationship to the next level and use texting as an opportunity to ask the person out.


Keep it light. If you're in the middle of a conversation, just say, ""How would you like to pick this up over dinner or drinks?""
If you've really been texting the person a lot, you can say, ""I really like texting you, but I think I would like talking to you even more. How about we continue this in person?""
You can also be more casual. Instead of asking for a real date, you can invite the person out to join you and your friends for drinks or at a party.

,How to Flirt Through Text Messages4,
"
Start the conversation casually.,
Start small talk.,
Joke.,
Tease playfully.,
Use cheeky emoticons.,
If you're getting a good response, heat things up!,
If you're getting a bad response, back off.,
Be the person to end the conversation.,
Don't be too self-deprecating.,
Don't be too sappy.,
Don't be too clingy.,
Don't be vulgar.",How to Flirt Through Instant Messaging," As in the real world, the first step to flirting is to get over your cold feet and jump right in! Text the other person a brief message asking them about their day, asking them a specific question about work or school, or simply saying ""Hi!"". The hardest part of flirting is to break through your initial reluctance, so if you're having a hard time taking the plunge, just remind yourself that no matter how badly it goes, it'll be less stressful than an equivalent real-world encounter.


There's no reason to be nervous when it comes to IM flirting — if the person you want to talk to doesn't want to talk to you, s/he always has the option of simply not responding to your message, as, from your point of view, this is indistinguishable from him or her simply being away from the computer.
This being said, if you barely know someone, it can be a good idea to have an excuse for starting a conversation to avoid awkwardness. Asking for help with a work or school-related problem is almost always a good bet, as is asking a question about something striking about the person. For instance, if the person has a band-related username, you might say: ""Hey, cool name. Did you see those guys when they last came to town?"";
, After your initial greeting and exchange of pleasantries, you'll probably want to ask how the person's doing (just like you might in the real world). Ask him or her about work or school, his/her interests, or any recent trips, for instance. Rather than asking a question, you can also simply offer your comments on these things. When s/he responds, add your own comments or ask follow-up questions and proceed from there! Don't pry into his or her personal life — keep things light, fun, and focused on worry-free subjects.


Don't dwell too long on small talk. A minute or two is great for breaking the ice, but much more can get boring fast.
For example, after we've opened up by asking about this person's interest in the band in his/her username, it's logical and reasonable to ask about this person's musical likes and dislikes. You can even offer your own opinions and suggestions. For instance, you might say something like: ""If you like those guys, you might want to check out this band called Manic Albatross - they're like the Beatles, only darker. What sorts of other bands do you like?""

, Everyone likes a good sense of humour. In the immortal words of Marilyn Monroe, ""If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything"" (don't worry, ladies — the same is true for men!) Try to be playful and even slightly sarcastic as you respond to the statements of the person you're talking to.


For instance, if you're asked what you're up to, rather than saying, ""looking for people to hit on on Facebook"", you might find that it's a better idea to give a sarcastic answer like ""writing the great American novel"" or ""drowning my sorrows"". These responses have the added benefit of being natural launching points for conversations about your hobbies, like the writing you're doing on the side and the great bourbon you tasted the other day.
In our example conversation, you might work a joke or two into your music-related small talk. For instance, you might say something like, ""I don't know why every song on the radio nowadays has a Texas Flynn feature. Does he even have time to record between rehab stints?""

, When you've established a good rapport with the person you're talking to, it's a good idea to up the ante by getting in a good tease or two. As you do so, maintain a playful air to keep the atmosphere light. As a good general rule, the better you know this person, the ""sharper"" your teasing can be.


Be reasonable about your teasing. Obviously, you'll want to avoid sore subjects that have to do with this person's personal life, career, aspirations, and so on.
The line between being a flirt and being a jerk can be somewhat thin at times, so, when in doubt, play it safe. It's easy to think up a different dig later, but it's not so easy to talk your way out of the situation after hurting someone's feelings. In our example, you might gently rib your conversation partner about a certain band s/he likes with a line like, ""Oh, come on, them? Hahaha."" However, if you say something like, ""Those guys are nothing but posers and their fans are the worst"", you'll sound a little more threatening.

, One of the handy things about flirting via IM services with emoticons as opposed to via purely text-based channels like email is that it's possible to make the intended emotion behind your words explicitly clear. If you're flirting, you'll want to rely fairly heavily on the winking (;)) and ""tongue stuck out"" (:p) emoticons that nearly all IM services have built in. Accompany your flirtatious, teasing remarks with these types of emoticons to make your intent obvious, yet palatable.


A word of caution - don't overuse emoticons. Sprinkle them sparingly throughout your conversation to make your flirtatious jabs a little sweeter and to make the intent behind ambiguous sentences a little clearer. If you use emoticons constantly, you'll end up seeming juvenile or annoying.

, If your conversation partner seems to be reacting with good humor to your jokes and teasing, you may want to make the transition into more intimate territory. Do this gently — don't go from lighthearted teasing into full-on come-on mode. Instead, make subtle innuendos. Imply things, don't outright state them. This is called ""being smooth"" and it's a valuable skill sought by many both online and in the real world.


Try to stay tongue-in-cheek with your remarks. There's a certain degree of silliness to any sort of flirting or come-on. Acknowledging this silliness does a lot to make you seem more down-to-earth and less creepy.
For instance, in our band conversation example, if your conversation partner says that s/he finds a certain song sexy, play along and turn up the heat. Fire back with a faux-scandalized ""Behave!"" or show you're game with a wry ""Oh reeeally? ;)"".

, Flirting with people anywhere means dealing with the possibility of rejection. Online, where communication is cheap and impersonal, this possibility is a very real one indeed. If the person you're flirting with doesn't seem to be reciprocating, cut your losses and exit the conversation gracefully. For instance, you might try saying that you have something you need to do (homework or job-related activities work well as excuses) or that you need to go to sleep. The exact excuse you use to exit the conversation isn't important — what is important is that you respect the wishes of the person you're flirting with and avoid dragging out a needlessly embarrassing exchange.


For instance, in our band conversation example, if you mention a certain song and your partner says that it's his or her S.O.'s favorite song, you'll want to eventually make a polite exit. This can be as simple as typing, ""Hey, I gotta run. Talk to you later!""

, A good rule for flirting online and in real life is to end the encounter by leaving the other person wanting more. In the world of IM flirting, this means that you should shoot a quick goodbye message before the conversation starts to grow stale. This way, the person you've been IMing with will have only fun, positive memories of the encounter — not awkward memories of struggling to find something to say as the conversation goes on and on.


If your conversation partner has responded well to your flirting so far, make your sign-off a saucy one to ensure s/he doesn't forget you. Emoticons can help here. For instance, while the message ""Goodnight."" is somewhat plain and uninspiring, ""Goodnight. ;)"" can carry the subtle connotation that you'll be thinking about them (and possibly vice versa).

, Simply put, confidence is sexy. This is more true for real-life situations than it is online, but this mantra has some truth in the world of IM flirting as well. For instance, you'll want to avoid making lots of jokes at your own expense. Just one is plenty — it shouldn't be a recurring theme throughout your conversation. Doing this too often can quickly turn an otherwise flirtatious conversation into one in which you appear needy and self-loathing.


On the other hand, this isn't to say that you should necessarily make jokes at other people's expense, as this can make you seem mean and petty. Any sort of pointed or caustic remarks about yourself or someone else don't have a place in flirtatious conversations.

, People like flirting to be fun. For most people, receiving compliments is only fun up to a point — getting more than one or two can make someone feel embarrassed and self-conscious. It can also make him or her question your motives, leading the person to believe that you may be trying to get something out of him or her. Besides, the wooing power of flowery, gushing compliments is diminished (to say the least) when the compliments are displayed in a tiny box at the bottom of the screen alongside cartoon smiley faces.


Instead of relying too heavily on compliments, instead, focus on having an engaging, genuine conversation. Follow the mantra ""show, don't tell."" In other words, show that you're attracted to this person by giving him or her a great conversation, not by stating it outright.

, Flirting with someone for the first time via IM is ample evidence that your relationship is a very, very casual one. Because of this, you'll absolutely want to keep your conversation casual. Don't bring up love, long-term commitment, or anything similar when you flirt — these are giant red flags to the person you're talking to and, in most cases, will completely sabotage your chances of eventually winning a date.

, Different people have different attitudes towards when it's appropriate to use dirty language, potty humor, sexual references, and so on. Respect this difference. Online, where bad language, violence, rude humor, and sex are all just a few clicks away, it's easy to forget that many people don't like being confronted with these types of shocking content. So, keep the conversation relatively PG until you know this person a little better. At the very least, try to be conscientious of how you may appear to the other person if s/he isn't used to these types of things.


A good rule of thumb is not to be vulgar until your conversation partner is. In other words, if you're flirting with someone, don't curse, make dirty jokes, or make lewd comments until s/he does first.

Mimic your crush’s movements.,
Test their personal boundaries before you touch.,
Experiment with flirtatious gestures.,
Smile at your crush.",How to Flirt Subtly2," You can establish a connection with your crush simply by copying their actions. You’ll leave your crush with the impression that the two of you are simpatico.


If your crush leans in, you lean in.
If your crush turns to face you, turn too.
If your crush takes a sip, take a drink too.
If your crush smiles, smile too., While overt flirts go straight for the touch, subtle flirts gauge their crush’s comfort level first. Before you graze your crush’s arm or pat their back, find an excuse to enter into their personal space. Step towards them to let someone pass behind you or reach for something near them. If they move towards you when you pull away, they're comfortable around you. You have the green light to “accidentally” or playfully touch them.Try placing a hand on the person’s arm or shoulder if he or she says something you find funny. Leave it there for a few seconds while you are laughing and see how the person reacts to your touch. If the person pulls away, then this may indicate that he or she is not interested.

, Subtle, flirtatious gestures are powerful signals of attraction. As you flirt with your crush, you can use self-touch, body posture, and other flirtatious gestures to show your interest. However, keep in mind that the gestures you use may be different depending on your gender.


For example, if you are a girl, then try playing with your hair, stroking your neck, biting your bottom lip, glancing at your crush over a raised shoulder, wiggling your hips as you walk, parting your lips slightly, or playing with your jewelry.
If you are a guy, then you might try sitting or standing with excellent posture to show off your best assets, puffing out your chest slightly, or using a dominant stance when you are sitting.For example, you might sit with your legs slightly wider than shoulder width apart and place your arm over the back of a chair, such as the chair of the person you are flirting with.

, Smiling is the perfect way to let your crush know you are approachable—you are friendly and willing to engage them. As you interact with your crush, smiling signals approval—you find them acceptable—and rapport—you enjoy sharing this experience with them. Smile freely and don’t be afraid to laugh (it gives you an excuse to tilt back your chin and show off your neck!)

Listen to your crush.,
Ask questions about your crush.,
Give coy compliments.,
Use humor.",How to Flirt Subtly3," In order to carry a conversation with your crush, you need to listen to what he or she is saying. If you want them to know you are a good listener, let your body language do the talking.Lean forward to indicate that you want to be emotionally and physically close to your crush
Nod your head to show that you are sympathetic
Maintain eye contact to reveal that you’re focused on them. This is easier to achieve if you put away your phone., Everybody shines and is at ease when they talk about their passions. While brazen flirts have a tendency to keep the spotlight on themselves, subtle flirts let their crushes shine. You can accomplish this by asking questions about your crush’s life and interests.Questions to ask include:


What are you passionate about?
What is your dream vacation?
What is your favorite pastime
What was the last movie you watched?
How was your day?
Where did you grow up?

, Subtle flirts do not over compliment their crushes. They choose their moments carefully. When you find the right time to compliment your crush, make sure the statement is sincere. Examples of coy compliments include:


”I love how passionate you are about (work, school, family, sports, etc.)”
”I’m impressed by your (patience, kindness, etc)”
”You’re a very good (listener, cook, etc)”
For added effect, pair your compliment with meaningful touch., Humor is an essential part of flirting, but some people may use it too much while others use it too little. Don’t be afraid to engage in playful banter with the person you are interested in, but pay attention to his or her physical cues to determine if you are using humor appropriately.For example, you might engage in some teasing, playful banter by saying something like, “So what is a pretty girl like you doing in a dingy bar like this?” To which a girl might respond, “Whoa, you want my life story? Buy a girl a drink first!”
You may want to tone down your humor if the other person does not laugh at your attempts at humor or starts showing signs of discomfort, such as turning away, avoiding eye contact, or crossing his or her arms. Likewise, you may need to be willing to engage in a little more humor if you notice these signs and you are not using humor at all.
Avoid using humor that is too sexual when you are just getting to know each other. This can make women feel uncomfortable and men may interpret the use of this kind of humor from women as an invitation.

Impress her with your wit.,
Show off your sense of humor.,
Be confident—not arrogant.",How to Flirt With a Girl2," If you can prove that you’re witty and capable of snappy answers and fun banter, the girl will be impressed by your flirting style. Show her that you can play ball by knowing how to make punchy or clever remarks at the right moment. Here are some great ways to impress the girl with your wit:


Show that you can keep up the banter. If she's firing a sarcastic or clever comment at you, fire one back.
Be original. Part of being witty is finding a new way to think about old topics. Don't tell her something any guy could say.
Understand your audience. If the girl is really smart and clever, you can make a sophisticated reference in an unusual way. But if she doesn't seem as well-read, don't try to impress her with your knowledge, or she won't get it.

, Guys who are truly funny are hard to come by, so you should make yourself stand out by showing your funny side. There are a few ways that you can use your humor to flirt and to get closer with the girl.


Work on your delivery. Time your jokes so you don't interrupt the girl or lose the flow of conversation.
If she says something funny, don't ever say, ""Oh, that's hilarious."" Instead, match her sense of humor with a funny comment of your own.
Don't overdo it. If you're trying too hard to be funny, the girl will know.
Learn to make fun of yourself. Girls like guys who are comfortable enough to know they aren't flawless and who don't take life so seriously.

, Being confident is the key to being able to charm a girl and to flirt with her from the moment you open your mouth. If you’re confident and comfortable with who you are and what you do, you’ll find it much easier to flirt with her.


Be positive. Talk about the things you love -- your job, your interests, or your friends. If you're negative about everything, you'll come off as unhappy with who you are.
Don't be self-deprecating. Making fun of yourself lightly is different from calling yourself a loser or talking about how you'll never be able to get a good job.
Talk about something you're good at, whether it's sailing or learning new languages. You don't have to brag to show you're a capable and interesting person.
Don't act like you're so great that she's lucky to be getting a minute of your time. That is a big turn-off. Keep things on the same level. You both should feel that you're lucky to be talking to each other.

"
"
Don’t be too direct.,
Don’t be too subtle.,
Don’t forget to connect.",How to Flirt With a Girl3," If you’re too direct about your intentions, your target will be turned off faster than you can say, “You’re so hot.” Though subtle compliments are key, you should avoid being too aggressive, making overly sexual comments, or just generally laying it on too thick. This will make you cross over from “flirting with her” to “hitting on her.”


Don't be too aggressive. If you say, ""Hey, want to make out?"" she'll walk away. Instead, say, ""I like your lip gloss.""
Don't make overly sexual comments. Don't say, ""You have a great rack,"" or she'll spill her drink in your face. Instead, tell her she looks great in her outfit.
Don't give the girl all of your attention. You shouldn't spend all night talking to the girl and ignoring everyone else or it may get too intense.

, Though subtlety is key, you don’t want to be so subtle that the girl has no idea that you’re interested. To keep up your flirting, you have to find ways to let the girl know you care, whether big or small. If you try too hard to be subtle, then you’ll look aloof and the girl may not think you’re worth it.


Drop at least a few hints that you're interested. If you give the girl nothing to work with, she won't think you like her.
Make it clear that she's not in the Friend Zone. Compliment her looks, let her know she's special, or just generally treat your conversation like the preamble to a date. If you don't let her know she's special, she'll think you just like her as a friend.

, Flirting is a key element of talking to a new girl you like, but you shouldn’t flirt 100% of the time or you won’t be able to get closer to the girl. Remember to stop and ask the girl some questions about herself and to get into a variety of topics. If your entire conversation is nothing but flirty banter, you won’t be able to move forward.


You can flirt and move a conversation forward. You can still be playful and fun while asking the girl some genuine questions.
Make sure to let her know at least a bit about yourself by the end of the conversation. She should walk away knowing at least something about you so she feels like you actually connected. You should learn a few things about her as well.

Make eye contact.,
Smile.,
Show off your neck.,
Lean over their desk.,
Avoid touching.",How to Flirt With a Co worker (for Women)2," Eye contact is one of the primary tactics of flirtation. Brief glances can show your attraction and interest in another person.You can try looking across the room during a meeting or glancing across the table at lunch. Meet their eyes briefly before glancing down and away.

, Smiling is an open and friendly act that invites people to interact with you. In fact, smiling may be one of the best ways to meet new people and start new relationships.As your coworker passes your desk, glance up briefly and smile. If you catch their eye in a meeting, give them a quick grin. Don’t linger. A small smile is all it takes.

, When you know they are looking at you, try to casually flip your hair to show off your neck. This shows the curve of your neck while drawing attention to your hair.This is a casual but flirty move that makes it seem as though you are not deliberately trying to catch their attention.

, Leaning or orienting yourself towards another person signals that you are interested in them.You can practice this while working on a project with your coworker. Lean over the desk to point out something. Reach out so that your arm is crossing their body without touching them. If you’re working on a shared computer, shift your body so that your feet and shoulders are tilted towards them.

, While gently touching someone is often a form of flirting, it can get you in trouble in the workplace. Try to use body language that does not involve physical contact. If your touching is unwanted, you can get in trouble for harassment.

Wear make-up.,
Put on heels.,
Apply light perfume.,
Maintain professional standards.",How to Flirt With a Co worker (for Women)3," Many men find women who wear make-up more appealing. Men typically like to flirt more with women whom they find attractive, so making yourself more attractive is especially important if you want to flirt with a co-worker. Eye make-up in particular can increase your flirtatiousness., Heels can increase your attractiveness to men. The higher your heels, the more likely men are to approach you.High heels can push your pelvis and chest out, arch your backside, and make your legs look tighter and more muscular—all of which make you more attractive., Perfume can boost your sex appeal but only if it is used sparingly.Spray once on your wrists. Rub your wrists together before dabbing them on your neck. This will give you just enough perfume to attract someone without annoying your other colleagues.

, While you should look appealing to your coworker, you must keep in mind that you have to look professional as well. Follow your workplace’s dress code. Avoid tight or short clothing that reveals too much skin. Instead, try to find clothes that fit your body’s shape without being too revealing.If you can, try using eye catching colors instead of revealing clothing.
Wear jewelry to draw attention to your neck and arms.
Make sure that your hair is brushed and styled in a way that both accentuates your features and provides minimal distraction to you while working.

Be patient.",How to Get a Guy in 10 Days," Keep a good balance between casual and formal, bombshell and girl-next-door, absolutely stunning and subtly sexy. Don't be afraid to take chances with your style, but above all, be sure that what you're wearing is the best possible outfit.


If you feel like getting that extra top or those one pair of jeans will set you over the top, go for it. It's okay to reward yourself, especially if it makes you feel good.
If you have a sense of what type of girl he likes, try to dress the part. Don't be anyone you're not, but try to incorporate elements of that style into your wardrobe.;
, Make sure you smell good by taking a shower at a good time every day. If you can't take a shower for whatever reason, give the smelly parts of your body, especially your underarms, a mini bath by lathering up with soap and rinsing with a bit of water.


Make sure your hair isn't greasy. Greasy hair, for the most part, is not attractive. If you have very oily skin, you may need to shampoo your hair every two days (or every day if it's really bad).

, Your face is a big part of what will attract him to you, so make sure that it looks as pretty as possible. There aren't any big changes that you can make in 10 days, but definitely focus on:


Eliminating pimples and acne. If you have breakouts, wash your face twice a day, moisturize after each wash, eat healthy, and use acne-busting products.
Use minimal makeup to cover up blemishes or imperfections. Guys like girls with natural looks, so don't cake the makeup on. Use it sparingly but effectively.
Get your facial hair under control, if necessary. If your eyebrows are shaggy, consider getting them sculpted. If you have visible hair on your lip, consider removing it.
Make your lips look luscious and kissable. A small amount of lip balm and lip gloss could send your lips into unstoppable kissable territory.

, Maybe you love the way that your hair looks. If you don't, it'll be important to find a hairstyle that fits your face. Short hair might be an option; adding curl and volume might be another!

, 10 days won't be a lot of time for you to get back in shape, but it will be a good start. What's important is that you're treating your body with love and giving it what it needs. Try any combination of the following if you feel like you want to get back in shape.


Join an intramural sports team/league. If you love playing soccer, try to join a league. If basketball is good fit, get together with another group of basketball lovers. Join any team that makes you want to exercise.
Consider joining a gym or using gym equipment. Joining a gym will let you take advantage of lots of different equipment, all under one roof. Use the gym to do cardio exercises like running (treadmill, incline), swimming, and cycling (spinning).
If nothing else, try to walk for 30 minutes every day. Walking for 30 minutes every day gives your body a small, but important, bit of exercise. If you can't join a sports team or gym, and don't want to do cardio, then walking will help you exercise.

, You need to make an impression, and you need to make it fast. Get your best outfit together, do your hair, makeup, and nails, and figure out a way to get introduced to him or make him notice you on your own. Here are some suggestions:


Accidentally bump into him or just bump shoulders. Perhaps you can pretend that you're rushing somewhere and accidentally bump up against him. When your eyes meet, introduce yourself.
Ask a friend to introduce you. Have your friend talk to the guy. Have her play matchmaker, except don't let it be obvious.
Go up to him yourself and engage him. Ask him a question about school, or pay him a compliment. Talk about an interest that you may share, or come up to him with a joke.

, Show him your wonderful smile; it will light up the room and actually make you happier. If he makes a joke, remember to laugh, even if it isn't all that funny; guys like thinking they're funny. Do the little things to send him good body language:


Look into his eyes when you're talking to him and when he's talking to you.
Face toward him with your body and keep your posture open and inviting.
Twirl your hair if you want him to notice it.

, Guys like girls who are pretty, but they also like girls who they can talk to. If they're attracted to you, but you have nothing to say to one another, your relationship isn't going to last very long.


Some keys to having a great conversation:
Ask really good questions. Do this as a way to keep the conversation moving (""So where did you live before you moved here?"") and as a way of letting him know that you're actively listening (""You said you didn't like action movies. What kind of movies are even left for a guy to like?"").
Offer him information about yourself. He's probably interested in you, too, so don't spend the whole time asking him questions without volunteering information yourself.
Make light of a painfully awkward situation by calling attention to it humorously. If you find yourself in a really awkward situation, say so! ""Sorry that was awkward, I'm the queen of that"" is a funny way of defusing the situation.



, After a few days, start hinting that you'd like to move beyond the simple friendship by using your hands to break the touch barrier. If you're trying to make a point, tap him on the hand. If you're trying to console him (perhaps as a joke), give him a reassuring back-pat. If he's very playful, you might even tickle him and get good results.

, You can pretty much flirt in three different ways:


Via text or the internet:
Send him a text saying something like: ""Hey! I really enjoyed having that talk last week. Hope it can happen again soon....""

Or send him a text in a more joking style: ""Since when do you look like a cave monster in the morning?? :-) You look like you didn't get any sleep!""



Via body language:
Twirling your hair, batting your lashes subtly, and giggling sweetly.
Rubbing his chest or thighs, which is very suggestive; use sparingly.


Via compliments:
Try something like: ""So how often do girls attach themselves to you like magnets when you step outside?""

Or maybe something like: ""You're really fun to talk to. Why is it that a special guy like you doesn't have a girlfriend?""




, You want to nudge him in the right direction if he hasn't already asked you on a date. You can do this in a variety of ways:


Be really bold and up-front: ""Why is it that you haven't asked me on a date yet?"" If he likes you, he'll ask you right away.
Be sly: ""My friend and I were going to go to the movies tomorrow night, but she cancelled and now I don't know what to do."" He could suggest that you two do something instead.

, You don't need to do this, but if you want to get a guy in 10 days, you need to be more forward than normal. This is popular for two reasons:


Sometimes the guy likes you but doesn't really know how to show his feeling or ask you out on a date. If he knows that you like him back, it could give him the courage to actually ask out because he's not afraid of being rejected.
If the guy doesn't like you, after this, you'll know. You can look 50 shades of beautiful and still not convince a guy to like you. That's just the way life is sometimes. If your friend tells him that you like him and he doesn't act, what's the use of going after him? There could be very little that you can do to get him to like you short of forcing him to be your boyfriend, and you don't want that.

, Whether you go to the movies, a bowling alley, an art museum, or a walk in the park, try to balance out two ideas: Show him that you like him, but still make him do some work. Guys like encouragement, so give him nice smiles, thank him for paying if he does, and get close to him. At the same time, guys like a little bit of a chase, so don't throw yourself onto him just quite yet. Be friendly without being totally head over heels just quite yet.

, Chances are that if he likes you and you've gone on a couple dates, he'll try to kiss you. (Always bring breath mints, they're a lifesaver!) If he hasn't tried to kiss you, you need to give him better signals that he should kiss you:


Get closer to him than you usually do. Let your face get closer to his face so that he doesn't have to move as far to kiss you.
Look at him longingly in his eyes. Fix his eyes with yours.
Lick your lips seductively. This is really easy to overdo, so don't do it very often. Once is plenty!

, Getting a guy in 10 days is certainly possible, but you can't rush love. Once you've got him to kiss you, you're on a good path. Love should come easy from now on, if you let it. Remember, though, that guys are a different breed from girls, and that what he wants might not be the same as what you want.


He might not want to rush into a relationship. He might want to casually date before committing to you.
He might not be as communicative as you are. He probably won't be as expressive with his feelings as you are with yours.
He might act macho in front of his friends. He's just trying to impress you.
He might not understand the idea of romance. He might need to be pushed and nudged and told how to be romantic.

The act of smiling even makes you happier, so it's not just an act, because your brain releases neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin when you smile that make you feel good.In addition, seeing a person smile is actually coded as a reward in other people's brains. When you smile at them, they feel rewarded. In turn, they come to associate good things with you.
Also, smiling at another person makes them want to smile, which will make them happier, getting you noticed.;
, A person who is all tied up in themselves is a big turn off for most people. Being a giving person will get you noticed, especially if you are going out of your way to not be noticed. In other words, be generous, but don't flaunt it. People will notice anyway.Try volunteering. Volunteering will help others see you as a selfless person, plus it will get you out in the community to meet people.
Also, volunteering will help you feel better about yourself and help you build confidence.

, Confidence is often very attractive to people, even more so than good looks. However, there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Confidence is knowing that you have good qualities but not spouting off about them every chance you get. If you know you have confidence in yourself, it will show in your mannerisms, so you don't have to talk about it.One way to build self-confidence is to take some time to list your strengths, achievements, and good qualities. Try to consider all the good things about yourself. If you can't get started, ask a friend to help, or think about compliments you've received in the past.Another way to build confidence is stop talking negatively about yourself or at least, try to change the conversation into something somewhat good. For example, if you want to say, ""I feel ugly,"" you could say instead, ""I don't feel very attractive today, but I'm thankful this body is living and breathing and is letting me enjoy life.""
Fake confidence. If you can't bring yourself to feel confident yet, start acting confident. Faking confidence is mostly about the way you present yourself, such as speaking clearly, talking in a loud enough tone for the situation, and looking people in the eye.Also, stand up straight, as slouching implies a lack of confidence., If you can crack a joke, you'll appear more confident. Plus, it can help break the ice. Self-deprecating jokes can draw other people in, as it shows you're comfortable with who you are, which is an endearing quality., Even if you aren't the most beautiful person on the planet, having good hygiene and staying sharp-looking go a long way towards attractiveness. Maintaining a good appearance tells other people that you are confident in yourself, even if you're not. Confidence is a big attraction for most girls.Part of taking care of yourself is just making sure you're practicing good hygiene. Take a shower once a day or at least once every other day, brush your teeth twice a day, floss, and clean under your fingernails. Presenting yourself as unkempt is often a turn off. Deodorant and cologne can also help.
Take care of your hair. You don't need a trendy haircut. However, it's good to get regular haircuts to rid yourself of dead ends and to keep your hair from being unruly. In addition, make sure to comb and style it every day so it's not out of control.
Pick clothing that fits you well and looks good on your body. Plus, make sure you are comfortable in whatever clothing you choose.

, While clubs and bars may not seem like the ideal place for conversation, you can meet women there. In fact, many people go out in the hopes of finding dates or new boyfriends or girlfriends, so the odds are in your favor. However, if you're going out dancing, make sure you stand out by learning some good moves for the dance floor. Girls will be so busy noticing your dance moves, they won't have time to notice if you're attractive or not.


If you're not a very good dancer, ask a friend who is a good dancer to show you some moves.
If clubs aren't your thing, go other places where people are social, like a coffee shop.
You could also join local clubs, take a class at the community college, or join an athletic team. The main thing is you need to get out there and meet people.

, Another option if you don't want to meet people in clubs or other public places is online dating. If you're a bit shy about putting yourself out there, online dating sites can act as a bit of crutch, as you don't have to go up and talk to random strangers. In addition, it puts you in touch with many more people than you could actually meet in person.You should put up a profile picture, but since you're in control, you can choose one you find flattering.
In addition, most of the people you meet on these sites will be single and available.

, You don't have to meet a new person to have a girlfriend. You probably have people in your life already who could be girlfriends, and in fact, many romances blossom out of friendships. You just have to look for the right ones.Consider your friendships. Are there any girls in your life who would make a good girlfriend, who you enjoy spending time with?
Be flexible. If you find yourself less than attractive and still want love, you need to offer that same chance to the girls in your life. That is, even if you don't think the person is that attractive, get to know them before brushing them off.
You may need to think outside the box when it comes to thinking about a girlfriend. You may have a person in your life who's been around for years, but you've just never thought of her as a girlfriend.

, You probably heard it said that there's someone for everyone, and that's true. Try to express who you are in your demeanor and the way you dress, as that will attract someone who's interested in some of the same things you are. Plus, if you stand out a bit, you won't be lost in the crowd.


For example, if you're a bit nerdy, don't be afraid to don a nerdy shirt when you're out in public. You'll find plenty of girls are attracted to nerdy guys.

, You should go up and talk to people. That's how you get to know someone. However, you should always consider where you are, too. If you're at a park late at night and you see a woman walking alone, that is probably not the best time to go strike up a conversation. In fact, most of the time, daytime is probably better to talk to a woman no matter where you are, unless you're at a club or bar.In addition, if you're alone with woman, especially in a small space, that can be off-putting if you start trying to flirt.
Limit your flirting to places where there are other people around and where she can move away if she wants to.

, When you see someone you'd like to talk to, get up and go talk to her. You may think she's out of your league, but you never know until you pluck up the courage to start a conversation. Be sure to do it as soon as you see her, as the chance you have to talk to her will close quickly.


In other words, if you see a girl who looks interesting at a coffee shop, go try to strike up a conversation.
If she rebuffs you, don't take it personally. Some people, particularly introverts, just don't like talking to random strangers. It may have nothing to do with how you look.
Don't be afraid to laugh and joke with her. If you set her high above you, she won't feel like she can be herself around you, which isn't something that will attract her to you.

, If you want to get a one-on-one conversation started with a girl, start by breaking the ice a little. If you come on too strong, you may find yourself rejected, which probably wouldn't change even if you were the most beautiful person in the world. It's much better to get a genuine conversation going first.For example, one way to get a conversation going is to ask her a favor, any small favor. If you're both at the bar, ask her to pass you a napkin or the nuts. Oddly, asking someone a favor endears them towards you.

, Another way to get the conversation rolling with a girl is to ask a question. The best kinds of questions get the other person talking and are a little bit flirty but not overtly so. Basically, you want the girl to notice that you're there and start talking to you.It may work better to get the person to evaluate themselves instead of you.
For example, ask the girl if her watch is a designer brand. If you're watching game on television at a bar, ask her if she's any good at basketball, rather than saying you, yourself, are amazing. If you try to impress her too much, you can turn her off.

, Once you've got it started, try to keep it going. If it lags, bring up something new. For example, you could make a statement about your surroundings that further engages her in conversation, such as, ""The coffee here is amazing!"" That gives her something to talk about, too, even if it's just agreeing with you., If you can't add something smart to a conversation or something that moves the conversation along, it's better to keep quiet. Girls will perceive your quietness as intelligence because when you do say something, it will be something of worth.However, if you're in a one-on-one conversation, try to keep the conversation going if you can.

, Women are less likely to find a person attractive who comes across as desperate when they're trying to get a date. If you beg a girl for a date, that's an instant turn off, so play it cool. If she says ""no,"" just walk away, which shows you're not desperate and that you respect her boundaries., If you feel like you're not the most attractive, you may not have the confidence to ask a girl out directly. In that case, you can go about it in a more roundabout way, such as making an indirect suggestion that she go out with you.For example, you can ask her what she's doing over the weekend. When she responds, you can say, ""That sounds fun. I'm going to see this new art exhibit that's supposed to be really cool. Maybe you'd like to see it, too?""

, One way to make it seem like you're not asking is to first ask for a recommendation of a restaurant or some other fun thing in the area. Once she responds, you can suggest that you go together, which makes it seem like her idea.For example, you could say, ""Do you know this area well? I don't get over here much. Know any good Mexican restaurants over here?"" When she responds with a name, say, ""Oh, that sounds good. Want to show me the ropes there?""

, You can also try the opposite approach, where you talk about a fun or great place in the area. She may respond that it sounds interesting, and then you can suggest that you try it out together.You might say, ""I've heard that place across the street has the best burgers."" If she says, ""Really? I love a good burger."" You could say, ""Want to try it out with me?""

, Another option is to just be direct. You may think you need to hide behind flirtatious questions, but really, most women appreciate when you're at least somewhat direct with what you want. Therefore, it never hurts to just ask, as the worst she can say is ""no.""For instance, if you've been talking for awhile, you could say, ""You know, you're fun to talk to. How would you like to continue this conversation over dinner?""

, Choosing good clothes starts with picking ones that fit you well. The clothes you choose should be form-fitting, not baggy. However, they shouldn't be so form-fitting that they're uncomfortable.If you've never done it, it can help to measure yourself. Take measurements at your shoulders, chest, waist, hips, and thighs, as well as your inseam. Use a measuring tape meant for measuring the body, which you can find in sewing kits or at craft stores.
Your inseam is the line running from your crotch to where you want pants to fall on the inside of your leg. You can take an inseam measurement off a pair of pants that fits you well.
Once you have your measurements, you can compare them to typical size charts to get an idea of what should fit. However, you'll still need to try things on because every brand runs a little differently.

, Don't pick something just because you think a girl will like it if it makes you uncomfortable to wear. You'll look uncomfortable wearing it, and that won't get you anywhere. That being said, think about the occasion when choosing your clothes. You don't want to wear ratty jeans and an old holey t-shirt on a first date. The girl you're dating will expect you to dress up some.If you're not sure what's appropriate, take a fashion-conscious friend along when you go shopping. Just be sure that you don't buy something that makes you really uncomfortable to wear.

, You can hire people who will find things that look nice on you. Having another person's opinion can be helpful in creating a new look for yourself. Another option is a subscription service that sends you clothes once a month that match your tastes and body type, that you then choose to buy or send back.If you don't have the money for either of these options, it's fine to ask employees at the store what they think.
However, they are being paid to sell clothes, so they have a vested interest in getting you to buy. Plus, many have a wide variety of other duties, so don't take up too much of their time.

, While you may not be able to afford expensive clothes, getting less expensive clothes tailored to fit you better can make all the difference in how they look. They won't hang off you or be too long in the arm or leg. If you go to the dry cleaners for alterations, it's usually not very expensive., Darker colors often look sharper, mostly because they hide the flaws in the fabric and construction. If you pick lighter fabrics, they tend to show off the flaws if your clothes are cheaper. Plus, lighter fabrics will show more stains."

Walk like an alpha male.,

Carry yourself confidently.",How to Flirt With a Girl the Alpha Way," When you approach the girl you have your eye on, don’t wander around, casually bump into her friend group, and then awkwardly initiate an interaction. An alpha male sees the girl he wants to flirt with and approaches her directly, with confidence and purpose. Walk like you are in control, with slower, determined steps. You know where you are going, and nothing is standing in your way.As lame as it sounds, don’t be afraid to practice your walk in your home. Try to find a place with mirrors so you can observe yourself. Sometimes, people have nervous twitches that they don’t even notice, so don’t be embarrassed to practice a little bit.;
, When you’re talking to a girl that you’re interested in, especially an extremely attractive girl, it can be intimidating to look straight into her eyes. But when you divert your gaze, you send the message that you believe she is out of your league.Most women aren’t going to be interested in flirting with a man who has already unconsciously announced he feels unworthy. When you introduce yourself and start talking make eye contact.


This doesn't mean you should stare at her — that can be a little creepy. It's okay to break eye contact occasionally.

, If she’s in the middle of a conversation, wait until there is a slight pause before saying something like, “I’m sorry to interrupt, but I had to come say hello.” If she’s a bit taken aback, that’s a good thing. You’ve immediately shown her that you’re confident and you don’t hesitate to pursue what you want. Extend your hand for a handshake to show you’re mature, and make sure to grip her hand firmly enough so she knows you feel secure in your interaction.


Avoid pick-up lines. Women are attracted to genuineness, so don’t act like you’re using a flirting manual to talk to her. Tell her confidently why you approached her. You can say anything from, “I saw you from across the room and I had to come say hi to someone so gorgeous,” to, “I really wanted to introduce myself to someone with such a beautiful smile.”
If you don’t want to use a compliment right off the bat for fear of sounding cheesy, make sure you plan another logical opener. If you have mutual friends, you can say, “You’re friends with ____, right? I recognized you and had to come say hello.” You can even make an observation to start off a conversation, like, “I noticed you’re eating _____, isn’t it excellent?” By planning something to say, you’ll avoid an awkward silence.

, This will allow you to control the conversation. Controlling a conversation doesn't mean you should talk over her, interrupt her, or act like a know-it-all. It means that you are steering the conversation. Ask her questions about herself, both to show her that you’re interested in learning about her and also to control the conversation topics. Don’t ask her anything intense or personal, but typical, introductory topics.If you're at a party, you can ask her how she knows the host. If you're out somewhere ask her simple introductory questions: her name, what she does, where she's from, and the like. Once you find out a little bit about her, you can ask more personalized, in-depth questions.

, Talk about yourself only when it’s appropriate, but don’t launch into long stories or monologues about your life. Let her share more about herself than you do about yourself, only talking about yourself if she asks, or if you want to highlight something you have in common. The more she is able to talk about herself, and the more rapt attention you show her, the better., Alpha males don’t complain, and they certainly don’t feel sorry for themselves.They create their own realities, so avoid being a “Debbie Downer” while you’re speaking to the girl you’re interested in. If you have a sense of humor, use it! Making a girl laugh is an extremely effective flirting technique.You want her to associate you with positivity, laughter, and fun, so don’t complain.


If she says something negative, support her opinion but offer a positive spin on things. If she says something about the weather being awful, you can say something along the lines of, “It’s not great, but at least we can suffer through it together.”

, Don't bombard her with flattery just to make her like you. Comment on the attractive qualities you see in her. Because alpha males are secure in themselves, they don't say things that they don't sincerely mean.Not only will this show her that you are a genuine person, it will make her appreciate your thoughtful compliments even more.


If she talks about her job, you can say something like, ""It sounds like you're extremely intelligent to manage all of that."" If you tell a joke to make her laugh, you can offer her something like, ""You have a unique laugh. I like it."" You won't look like an alpha male just by telling her she's hot.

, Don't be afraid to tease her a little bit. Alpha males ooze confidence, and they they don’t shy away from being genuine. Obviously don't say anything that could actually offend her, but make her laugh by calling her out on silly things.


A fun way to start a lighthearted back-and-forth with a woman you've just met is to act like you've known her forever. Once she starts talking a bit about herself, you can say something like, ""Oh , you've always been so funny/stubborn/clumsy/observant/nerdy."" You can create attraction by making her laugh and feel comfortable., Don’t approach a girl with the singular goal of securing a date with her. Instead, make it your goal to have a great, flirty conversation. Women can typically tell if you’re “picking them up” rather than flirting, and flirting is much more light-hearted, fun, and noncommittal. Let the conversation be organic and natural, and only ask her out when it feels like it’s going well.

, Once you’ve chatted for a bit, end the conversation appropriately. If it’s gone well, ask her out on a date or simply get her number. If you know you’ll see her again, tell her that you enjoyed meeting and talking to her. By ending the conversation on your terms, you’ve once again asserted your alpha-ness. Wait for a lull in conversation, and say something like, “It’s been wonderful talking to you, and I will .”If things don’t go smoothly and she doesn’t seem interested, do not worry or stress over it. Even alpha males get rejected sometimes, but it doesn’t matter. The key to being an alpha is not needing anyone else to validate you, so carry on. Rejection is nothing to fear.

, This doesn’t mean you need to suddenly get a six-pack, cut your beloved beard, or drop thousands of dollars on a new wardrobe. Decide what “great” means to you, and be that. If it means exercising regularly and getting more fit, do it. If it just means brushing your hair, do that! Being an alpha, and flirting like an alpha, is all about feeling your best. Polish up anything that you think would make you look better, groom yourself how you like, and know that every time you meet a girl, you’re the best version of yourself, whatever that means to you.


There are alpha males who look like Zac Efron, with huge muscles and perfect clothes. There are also alpha males like Bill Clinton, who find power in confidence and intellect. Being an alpha male is more about mindset than it is about outward appearance., While things like hairstyle and wardrobe are personal and up to you, good hygiene is non-negotiable. If you want to have your best shot with girls, you can’t be dirty or unpleasant to be around. Shower regularly, keep your breath smelling fresh, and keep your skin and hair clean.It might be possible to flirt successfully while maintaining a sloppy hygiene routine, but cleanliness will certainly increase your chances.

, Sometimes people confuse a confident, ""alpha"" attitude with being cocky. An alpha is self-assured, doesn't need to dominate a conversation or always be the center of attention, and are flexible — they recognize that they're human, just like everyone else; they make mistakes and they own up to them. Someone who is cocky, on the other hand, is arrogant (his self-esteem is based more on wealth, privilege, and external factors), will talk over others, be ruthless in trying to get ahead, and will not admit to wrongdoing or apologize.A truly confident person can accept criticism, can allow someone else to step into the spotlight, and admit it when he's wrong (without over-apologizing).

, Stand up straight, and don’t be afraid to take up space. You will not see alpha males hunched over and nervously fidgeting with their clothes or hands. Take a deep breath and tell yourself that you are the coolest man in the room. Take a wide stance if you’re standing, and keep your arms to your sides. Focus on looking comfortable, self-assured, and dominant, whether or not you feel like that on the inside.Looking like an alpha male is like exercising a new muscle. Every time you do it, it will become easier and easier. Eventually, you’ll start to feel like an alpha male as well.

If you avoid looking a person directly in the eye, they will think you don’t want to be around them. You don’t need to constantly stare at the person, just make eye contact from across the room a few times, and be sure to make eye contact if you’re having a conversation.When you pass a person you like in the hallway, make eye contact and say “hey” or “how’s it going?”;
, A smile is the best way to flirt using body language. It doesn’t have to be an all-out grin, you can smile subtly without showing your teeth. Look the person in the eye and smile. After that, you can look away, especially if you aren’t speaking to the person, but have made eye contact from across the room.If someone in class make a joke or says something funny, smile at the person you like. This shows you have a sense of humor, and also that you want to share that sense of humor with them.
You can also smile and wink at the person when something amusing happens, or smile at them and roll your eyes at a teacher’s lame joke.

, If you walk past someone you’re interested in, look back over your shoulder at them. Smile slightly then look away. This is an enticing movement and will catch the person’s attention., Do this subtly. Gently press your teeth down on your lower lip for a second or two while maintaining eye contact with a person you are interested in. Alternately, sweep your tongue your lower lip while talking to them. This draws interest to the mouth and lets the person know you are interested.If you see a cutie at the coffee shop, catch their eye, then take a swig of your drink and then subtly lick your lips. This makes it seem natural, but also flirtatious.

, Raising your eyebrows shows interest. You can also lower your eyelids at the same time, giving yourself a sultry look. Practice this one a few times in the mirror if you haven’t done it before so you know what you will look like. Think Marilyn Monroe here, girls.If you catch someone’s eye while out and about, raise your eyebrows and lower your eyelids. Smile slightly, then look away.

, Getting close to a person is a sign that you are interested in them. Stand in line next to the person, or sit down next to them at lunch or in class. This will also give you a chance to talk to the person you like. Don’t get too close, as this may cause the person to back off.


At an assembly or sporting event, find a seat near someone you like. You could even smile and flirtatiously ask “is this seat taken?” in order to start a conversation.

, To show you are interested in someone, you can angle your body toward the person. You can also lean in slightly or tilt your head toward the person. Crossing your legs toward a person, rather than away from them, is also a good strategy.If someone asks you a question or makes a comment to you, lean toward them as if you can’t hear what they were saying. Don’t be too obvious, just angle yourself a tad more in their direction.

, When a person is talking to you, whether that may be sharing a story or telling a joke, you can lightly touch them on the arm to show you agree or understand. A quick, light touch is all you need, don’t grip them too hard, or let your hand linger too long.While having a conversation with someone you like, gently smooth their collar down or pick a piece of lint (pretend or real) off their shirt.

, Don’t follow every move they make, but simply make subtle adjustments to your own movements. This shows the person you are on the same page, which they will appreciate.You can do something as simple as lean against the wall when they lean against the wall, or hold your drink at the same level they are holding theirs.

, Confidence attracts others to you. Even if you’re nervous, act like you aren’t. Posture is important, so stand, or sit, up straight rather than slumping over. Participate in an activity or conversation taking place around you rather than acting like a wallflower.

, Pull your hair out of its holder and let it fall around your face. You can also toss your hair over one shoulder, or twirl a strand between your fingers. Don’t overdo it here, you’re not at a salon! Just touch or play with hair once or twice while flirting with the person., Motion attracts the eye. Standing stock-still could make the person think you are nervous or even boring. Gesture with your hands while you talk or nod and react when someone else is talking., Occasionally touch your necklace or earrings while flirting with a person. Don’t overdo it, once or twice during a conversation is enough. This draws the person’s attention to your neck in a slightly sensual way., To look approachable, you want to have open body language. Don’t cross your arms, slump, or fidget. Crossing your arms is a gesture that tells people to stay away; it shows that you are closed off, rather than open to their advances.Try putting one hand on your hip, or one hand in your pocket as an alternative to crossing your arms.

There's nothing wrong with wanting to make a good impression. However, it is possible to take this too far and in turn repel men. The same applies with myths about dressing sexy and excessive flirtation. If you do not respect your body, you will only attract men who have a similar lack of respect for you and your body, and a good man will find it more difficult to take you seriously. Be yourself, and a real man will respect you.;
, Desperate, dramatic, and clingy relationships are often rooted in a feeling of need and desperation for a man to fill your life. Even if you have low self-esteem, work over time to build it. Pursue your goals and be focused, explore your passions, have an interesting life, do things that take you outside your boundaries. Don't put up a tough exterior to get over shyness; gradually learn to build trust with a network of people, so that your boyfriend isn't the only person you open up to and share your life with. Also remember to trust yourself first. If you can't trust yourself, you are likely to not trust your man.

, Most guys hate it when girls are possessive, moody, clingy, controlling, etc. Learn to relax, and have fun. We all have too much going on in our lives; don't be the high maintenance ""drama queen"". Having a woman around who makes life more difficult than enjoyable will make a man lose interest. If you do things like show genuine concern when the man has had a rough day, it will earn his respect and go toward winning him over and a good man will reciprocate. Remember that most men, especially the good ones, are looking for someone with whom they can be comfortable, and not someone who is always intense.

, Men can often miss the subtle messages that women send in their body language. Don't judge a guy because of this; it's just the way men are. Subtle body language like smiles only make a man think that you might like him; he can't assume it means you're interested without being accused of being a self-absorbed jerk. To drive the point home, gradually introduce more ""obvious"" body language like playful touches on the arm, playful banter and teasing, winks, inside jokes, playfulness, or (when you know him better) attempts to find a man's ticklish spots. (Don't be afraid to kindly tease him over minor things - women who pretend a man is perfect are regarded as weak in their eyes.) Flirting will not only show him you like him enough to get that physical and playful, but also help to break the physical barrier and allow a man to feel more comfortable making a few advances to you. But don't forget to look at how he is reacting to you.

, Psychological studies have shown that people seek out partners to fill a psychological void. Sometimes these voids are unhealthy; for example a woman who is unhealthy will actually seek out any man for the ""high of seduction"" or to get attention and feel desirable. Look inside yourself and ask yourself why you want a man so badly, be truly honest with yourself, and, if need be, talk to a therapist about this. A woman with issues only attracts a guy with issues as well, and a good, real man doesn't want anything to do with a woman who has more issues than TIME magazine. If you want a good, healthy relationship with a real man, make certain that your own mental state and intentions are healthy.

, Nobody likes a partner who plays ""head games"". This is deceptive, and will hurt anybody who trusts you. Be real, don't play games, and good men will respect you and may even pursue you. Playing head games will only make good men run away. Remember the communication thing? That is especially true here. If you like a guy, don't push him away and act like you don't like him. Tell him. Yes, there are some men who do like the thrill of the chase, but all good men genuinely want to respect you and your wishes, and will leave you alone if you insist on it. Remember, men communicate directly; if you act like you don't want him, he'll think you don't want him.

, This is the most important thing of all. Men hate being around a woman who emasculates them, and a good man won't take long to leave such a woman. Don't be afraid to help your man feel good about himself. A little known secret is that men are just as insecure as women. If he's with his friends or family be open to opportunities to let your man look like ""the man"". It will win his love and respect.

, Let's be real: a good man doesn't desperately need any woman; he would like to meet a good woman. If he's a good man, he will appreciate the compliment to his attractiveness, at the very least. But remember that compliments are usually given to acquaintances - people who are intimate usually have a more honest connection, with playful teasing and banter. Think of good relationships between brothers and sisters, parents and children, especially couples - they're always joking, laughing, teasing, flirting in a positive way. A woman who is always complimenting may simply be boring and look desperate. Even if you are old-fashioned and never want to be the woman who asks a man for a date, you can still go out of your way to talk to him, and arrange to be with him. Don't overdo this, however; unless he is already attracted to you before the encounter, the more obvious it is that you've put a ton of time into the encounter without his direct encouragement, the more desperate and less attractive you look. Work on building attraction first.

, If you say no, he should stop. If he doesn't stop, leave. Don't ever be uncomfortable saying no. Don't go against your morals to try to keep a guy. If you feel this is necessary, then either he's not a good man, or he is a good one but simply isn't a good match for you specifically (e. g. he is currently ""playing the field"" and is up front and honest about it, but you're looking for an exclusive relationship). Don't be uncomfortable saying yes, either. If you feel the time is right, believe in your worth and don't worry that you're ""giving yourself away."" You respect yourself and you're confident that he'll come back for more! A man who doesn't respect you in the morning never properly respected you to begin with, and a man who doesn't respect your wishes to wait is too impatient to make a good partner. Either way, find someone else.

, That means apply the same rules to yourself that you'd apply to others, including him. Real men do in fact notice this; they just don't scream it out. For example, if he tells you he has a girlfriend and things are not working out, Stop! and think ladies that this could be a ""test"" on how you would handle the situation, so stand your ground and cut off communication (hint: ""Golden Rule""). Second example: if you do want to try finding his ticklish spots, then don't complain one bit if he tries finding yours in return. Don't go on about how you ""don't NEED no man!"" or about ""men this, men that"" if you don't want him treating you the same way. DO, on the other hand, treat him--and others--with respect, dignity, and honor. Others will notice, too, and who knows--if they know you want a good, real man but don't yet have one, they just might introduce you to one!

, This means, don't show that you love this person by being near them all the time. They need their space and they need to know that you don't need to follow them everywhere they go. Most of all, they need to know that you have your own life.

You'll never be happy with the guy even if you do end up nabbing him at the end - so do your homework! Watch the kind of crowd he hangs around with, take notice of any rumors surrounding him, know how he treats his women (or women in general). If he seems to be worth it, go to the next step.;
, Think about changing your hair color/getting a new cut, or another minor detail, like wearing a new stand-out scarf. It'll make sure that he takes note of your existence if he hasn't before.

, Guys all love a good-looking girl, don't you? It doesn't matter whether you are a gorgeous Kate Moss lookalike or not - but what is important is that you make an effort on your appearance, which signifies self-respect. Wear a little lip gloss, iron your best jeans, use a bit of gloss serum in your newly-coloured hair. Remember, less is more - natural radiance is the key here. Guys are attracted to girls who've got game - have fun, be nice to others... and above all, be yourself!

, When you next see him walking towards you, catch his eye and hold his gaze for three seconds, smiling slightly all the while and doing your best to seem accidentally attractive. Holding a guy's gaze for three seconds signals sexual interest - so work it to your advantage! What's there to be embarrassed about? You're looking your best!

, Place yourself in situations where he'll have the chance to interact with you. Join something that he's involved in as well, or hang out near a place where you know he'll be during break or after school. It's also advantageous to place yourself in a situation where he'll possibly be on his own, as he won't feel so weird talking to you.

, Still haven't had the chance to talk to him yet? Or has he not shown the slightest bit of interest? It's time to pluck up the courage, girl! (And it's not nearly as hard as you think.) If you don't want to ruin your chances by screwing it up the first time you speak to him, create a bit of leeway by getting to know one of his friends first - and then maybe he'll start joining in on your conversations! (or perhaps you can drag him into it.)

, Then flash him a great smile.

Be funny without being crude.,

Exhibit good manners.,

Respect all girls equally.,
Be attentive.,
Be confident in yourself.",How to Get a Girl's Attention1," Everyone loves to laugh. Getting a girl to laugh can be a big part of getting (and keeping) her attention. This doesn’t mean that you need to transform yourself into a Jim Carrey-like comedian, but it does mean that you need to figure out what kind of humor you are best at. It’s good to remember that you don’t have to be funny every second, but throwing some humor into a conversation is often a great way to get a girl interested in you.No matter what sort of humor you’re using, its never good to wait for the girl to laugh. Quick, witty humor that only pauses for an instant is the way to go. If she thinks it’s funny, she’ll laugh. But don’t expect her to openly guffaw at your jokes--and never say something like “oh you didn’t think that was funny?” if she doesn’t laugh. That will just cause a serious amount of awkwardness to ensue.
Do your homework. If you don’t feel like you are a naturally funny guy, watch comedians on TV or study the funny characters in movies. See how they deliver their jokes, but don’t memorize jokes and simply repeat them--that can come off as rather stiff and stilted.
Use situational humors. While dishing out funny or witty one-liners can get a girl to giggle, try embellishing your humor but commenting on your situation or environment in a funny way.
Laugh when you genuinely think something is funny. Avoid fake-laughing, as that is generally pretty easy to see through. A real, whole-hearted laugh can be a very attractive thing.
Don’t use mean humor. While light teasing may be funny at first, use it sparingly. No girl wants to have a dude spend the entire night cutting her down with his words--even if he means it in a joking way. On the other hand, self-deprecating humor (humor that makes fun of yourself) can make a girl feel comfortable with you quickly because it shows her that you have enough confidence in yourself that you can easily make fun of yourself.;
, If you show passion for whatever you are involved in, chances are you will be catching more than a few female glances. Being passionate and good at something is attractive--it shows that you care about something other than yourself, you’re a hard worker, and you are passionate. It also shows that you have ambition--you don’t just want to be involved in something, you want to be the very best you can be.


If you are on a sports team, work hard to be the star or team captain. If you are on debate club, give it your all to lead the debates. If you are in a photography or art class, don’t be afraid to show off your artistic side (and skill.)
Don't hide what it is that you like. If you're happy, confident, and enthusiastic, people will start to get interested in what you’re interested in. Don't act like you hate what you actually like; just play it off like it's not a big deal and sell the really fun parts of what it is that you like.

, You don’t need to weep openly if a sad topic gets brought up, but make sure you are not an emotionless-robot when you are around her either. This means sometimes discussing how something made you feel. Saying things like “Oh man, that movie we watched in class today made me wonder how it must have felt to be trapped on the Titanic. It’s so scary and sad to think about” will show her that you have empathy--you can relate to how others are feeling, and feel things yourself., Most girls love guys who are polite and courteous. Don't do or say things that many people consider offensive, including swearing and making sexist/racist/etc. jokes or comments. If you act like a gentleman, demonstrating your respect for women and other people in general, girls will be more likely to welcome your company.


Saying things that you know would probably offend some people isn't a good way to make or keep friends. It might look ""cool"" to your guy friends, but it's a real turnoff to most girls. It's easy to diss something; it's much harder to believe in something. Be a man and believe in something.

, You don’t have to be the captain of a ship, or a world-class mountain climber--but you should be up for almost anything. Invite her on hikes, camping trips, a day out in the city nearest you. Go with the flow if you are hanging out with her and something exciting gets brought up.

, You stand a much better chance of making a good overall impression if you treat girls that don't interest you just as nicely as those that do. This doesn't mean that you need to talk to or flirt with every girl, but don't ignore them or treat them dismissively. You never know when a girl is going to suddenly get attractive, or who she'll become friends with. The best bet is to treat them all the way you would want to be treated.


Don't talk to a girl about another girl's attractiveness; it's distasteful and can degrade the girl's opinion of herself. Plus, it's just easy to accidentally say the wrong thing, or say something you didn't mean. Stick to talking about other girls with your guy friends.
You generally shouldn't talk about past relationships you've had, or other girls that potentially interest you with the girl you are most interested in. No girl wants to have to compare herself to your past relationships, and she really doesn't want you to compare her to them either. Make her feel like she's the only girl in your universe, and the universe will smile kindly on you.

, When you talk to a girl, give her your full attention. Listen carefully to what she says, and you may learn a lot about her and discover interests that you have in common.


Ask her lots of questions. This will signal to her that you're genuinely interested in her apart from her looks. Ask her what activities she likes, what music she’s into, what movies she’s seen recently. Ask her about her family, her aspirations and hopes. Any question that is sincerely and respectfully asked is game.
Give her time to speak. If you ask her questions, give her time to express herself, and don't feel bad if she's talking a lot. Remember, her talking a lot is a good sign!

, Confidence is a big turn on for most girls. If you walk with your head held high, don’t hesitate when discussing something that you know a lot about, or simply walk up to a girl without hesitation, you will get noticed. Know that you are an awesome guy--when you display confidence in yourself, it shines through and girls will notice.Bear in mind that you should not be too cocky. Confidence and cockiness are actually separate things. When you are confident, you have faith in yourself without holding it over others. When you are cocky, you are confident and you want everyone (really everyone) to know it. Cockiness can be a turn off for girls. They want someone who believes in himself without letting everyone know how awesome he is, all the time.

, Most women are sick of guys who try to become whatever they think women want -- especially when they don’t give women much credit. On the flip side, an admirer who is genuine is instantly intriguing, which is good news for you! it is a great way to get things started, This is how beauty and the beast got together in the first place. If you’re not naturally confident and at-ease, at least have the guts to be yourself; a nervous but authentic individual has a lot more to offer than a preening peacock with no substance.

, It may seem like winning the lottery to be a beautiful woman in today’s society, but not being taken seriously also comes with the territory in a big way. Guys are so used to seeing beautiful women sprawled across billboards and magazine covers that when they notice one in real life, they often don’t bother to find out if she’s smart, funny, kind, or interesting; in fact, many don’t think twice about staring, making ridiculous remarks, or even copping a feel. This can make attractive women suspicious of just about any guy.


Make sure you are interested in who this woman really is (her hopes, dreams, fears, ambitions, quirks, oddities, favorite things, etc.). If you're not interested in that, you're not after her for the right reasons.

, This really is the most important step. Most attractive women have seen enough admirers come and go to know whether or not you're not being yourself -- and if she knows you're acting differently for her, she’ll lose respect for you. Besides, people who act like themselves (even the goofy ones) are sexy.


If a woman doesn't like who you are once she gets to know you, she isn't worth your time. Furthermore, if you have to change who you are to attract or keep a woman, you are cheating both yourself and her.

, No well-adjusted woman wants to be with someone who can’t function on their own; first of all, she won’t want to be your replacement mother, and second, she’s seen no evidence to indicate that you’ll ever be able to take care of her needs. Clean up after yourself, stay in shape, do your laundry, clip your toenails, and learn to cook a meal or two. As mundane as it may sound, these things can work MAGIC for a relationship.

, Beautiful women attract arrogant suitors like flies, which tends to scare away all the nice ones. Work up the nerve to approach her and she might just find you a breath of fresh air. There are, however, certain things to keep in mind:


Don’t approach a woman who doesn't seem to want to be approached.
Avoid approaching a woman in a bar, or club. These women aren't looking to be wooed by a fast car, cheap haircut, and lame lines; they usually have their guard up and don't want to be bothered. Instead, try to place yourself in a situation where you’re comfortable. Give yourself any social edges possible.
Don’t try too hard. This is the biggest game-killer ever. Pages can be written on this but, as a rule of thumb, if you're frustrated, you're probably trying too hard; if she's frustrated, you're definitely trying too hard.
Don’t rule out friends as possible romantic interests.

, A lot of guys treat women like jerks -- and, frankly, sometimes it works. However, a woman who doesn’t demand respect from others probably doesn’t have any for herself. If you try it, it might work for you, but it’ll have the unfortunate side effect of a) making you a jerk and b) landing you with a woman who has no self-esteem. If you want someone happy and well-adjusted, behave accordingly.

, (Hint: if it's a line, it’s cheap.) Sparks only fly in the spur of the moment, so start with a comment, joke, or witty interaction based on the situation. If all else fails, a simple “Hello” will suffice.

, If you have to lie to get something, it's not for you and never was. Women are no exception to the human race, as they appreciate honesty above all. Remember, every lie you tell is a lie you’ll have to remember if it ends up working out.


Don’t confuse honesty with tactlessness; there’s no need to be brutal.

, Keep a good posture, relaxed but not slouching. Look her in the eye but don’t stare. (Definitely don’t let other women catch your eye when you talk to her.) Avoid fidgeting, shuffling, and shifting your weight. The goal is to look casual and comfortable in your own skin.

, Be polite, considerate, and genuine. It seems like common sense, and it really is, but a lot of people forget that. And really, treating anyone like an equal is a solid strategy for forming a connection; at worst, it may turn out that she’d rather be fawned over, in which case you’ve just saved yourself a lot of trouble.

, Try to get to know her by asking about her interests and seeing if you have any common ground. Listen actively instead of just hearing passively; if you make a mental note of things she says, she’ll be delighted to find out that you remember them later.


Do talk about yourself, but be polite; don’t try so hard to sell yourself that she can’t get a word in edgewise. As a general rule, a woman will ask about you if she’s interested.

, Be kind, friendly, and supportive, but never let that stop you from doing your own thing. Go out with your friends, have fun when she’s not around, and continue to be an autonomous individual; knowing that you have an interesting life of your own will just make her want to be part of it.


If you find yourself idolizing a woman so much that you’re always, always there for her, you’ll also soon find that you’ve become her friend. If you panic, you may even try to be extra nice to impress her. Don’t do it.

, Conversation is at the heart of getting to know someone, as it can hold their attention, get them to laugh, and make them interested in you. Only through conversation can take it to the next level (ex. phone number, going on a date, etc.), and every good conversation the two of you have will probably translate into another date. Once you string enough dates together, you’ve got a relationship.


There are some things to avoid during early conversations. For instance, stay away from serious subjects like war, politics, religion, abortion, etc. If one of these does happen to come up, keep it light and change the subject matter. Also, don’t compliment her excessively, as this comes across as desperate/needy.

, Conversation is a great way to get to know each other superficially, but to really understand each other, you will have to learn to communicate. This means not only discovering each other’s hopes, fears, dreams, and desires, but also becoming more comfortable in your own honesty.


Listen to her. She has more to say than just words; she is conveying ideas, thoughts and emotions. When you ignore someone who is really trying to communicate and tell you something, you are insulting them on a deeply personal level. Keep in mind that some things can’t be conveyed through texts or during a commercial break, so if you set some time aside to really talk, it will work wonders for your relationship.
Tell her your feelings. True story: communication isn't just for women; they also want to know what you think and feel. Letting her in shows that you respect and trust her. Remember, it takes skill to communicate effectively and you can’t always count on her to read between the lines.
Lots of guys try to avoid communication or fake it. If you’re serious about this (or any other) relationship, take the time to learn. All the hope, love, or chemistry in the world can’t keep two people satisfied if they don’t know how to communicate with each other.

Self confidence and self sufficiency are extremely sexy qualities in a person, and you will not seem like you have either of these if you're begging every girl you meet to go out with you.


Look to make good friends rather than a girlfriend. This means you should talk to as many women as possible, not just girls you're immediately attracted to. Making good friends with women will help you practice holding conversations with them, as well as learning how women feel and think in general. More importantly, you'll be helping yourself feel less lonely without desperately seeking a girlfriend.;
, It could be her, or it could be someone else in the room. Is she carrying something heavy? Say ""let me help you with that"" and carry it for her. Is someone short on cash? Lend them a few dollars so they can eat lunch. Hold the door open for the next person coming through, even if they haven't reached it yet. In other words, be a kind and generous person. Not only will it get her attention, but it will also make you feel good about yourself. Don't be fake and do nice things only when she's around, though. Chances are, she'll notice that there's a difference between how you treat her, and how you treat others. Help people all the time, in a wide variety of ways. She'll notice, and so will the people she knows, and on the occasion that you come up in a conversation, people will say ""They're such a great person!"" and this girl will start thinking ""Yeah...they are, aren't they?""

, If you see a girl whom you find attractive, go and talk to her (doesn't matter what time it is). And you do that on a regular basis. If you go out one day and sit it out for next few days, it won't work well. Go out regularly and talk to bunch of women. Supermarkets, library, malls, streets, social gatherings any place where you think you might find girls.

, Remember, fear of rejection is extremely irrational. If you see a hot girl, go and talk to her. Convey her your intentions right away. Don't digress, no matter what, ""Hi, you are cute and I came here to know who you really are."" You are looking for a girlfriend, not a friend who is a 'girl'.

, When you see a hot girl, don't make excuses like 'she's probably in a relationship', 'she is on her phone' or 'she is jogging', 'Man I look so bad'. Believe it that there is no valid excuse to not talk to her. At worst she would say 'no' and walk away. You have to try again and again to get good at this.

, This is really important. If you are not having fun while talking to a girl or while looking for her, you are probably taking it too seriously. But if you are having fun, you won't care about the potential rejection and would come out as cool and fun person.

, If you don't find something she says funny, don't laugh just because she is laughing. Don't try to be something you are not.

, The more people you meet, the bigger pool of people you'll have to choose from. Don't be picky about who you meet or how you meet him—the nice old man down the street may have a gorgeous granddaughter your age and the somewhat annoying girl from last night's party might have a friend who's perfect for you.


Go out and pursue hobbies you love. If you're not sure how to start meeting people, sign up for activities that sound fun to you! Check forums, listings, classifieds, and listservs for local events or meetings that are likely to attract people with similar interests or passions. You can also explore new interests or activities. You might find a new hobby and a girlfriend all in one go! Don't depend completely on the internet.

, No matter how much women would like to admit otherwise, looks are an important part of the dating game. Bad body odor, smelly breath, and greasy, unkempt hair are simply not attractive to most women. Shower regularly, brush your teeth twice a day, and stay in shape. While you don't need to be the best looking person out there, you do need to make a good first impression.


Take pride in your clothing. Again, you don't need to be stylish, but clean, unwrinkled clothes are always better than the opposite. Avoid wearing the same thing every day, especially if it's just sweatpants.
In addition to making you more attractive, taking good care of your physical appearance will boost your self confidence, which in turn, will make you more attractive, boosting your self confidence, and so forth. While cockiness is never a good thing, knowing that you've got good qualities will make you much better at marketing yourself.

, Challenge yourself to find something beautiful in any girl. It doesn't have to be something physical; it can be a cute gesture, an admirable trait, a talent or skill. Recognizing and expressing true appreciation for any and every girl will make you more attracted to girls and girls more attracted to you.

, Don't use “canned material”, “nuclear attraction” routines, or other social robotics. The best way to make a connection with someone is to come from the heart and live fully in the moment. What you say isn't nearly as important as how you say it. Socializing is about exchanging energy, not being a wordsmith.When in doubt, just say “Hi”.


In unconventional strategies, in order to connect with a girl, you have to ""dis-connect"" with her first. This is actually making the girl take sudden notice of you and making her connect with you instead!

, Girls love people who have a good sense of humor, and the key to having a good sense of humor is to be lighthearted, and unabashedly yourself. As long as you're not making fun of people in a mean-spirited way, anything goes. Is your sense of humor perverted? Slapstick? Sarcastic? Go with anything, as long as you don't try so hard that it becomes fake.


Don't worry about whether or not she thinks you're funny because you know what? If she can't laugh with you, then this isn't a girl you want to spend a lot of time with anyway. And who knows? Maybe another girl—one whom you hadn't noticed before—will be laughing so hard that her soda comes out of her nose, and maybe you've just found your soulmate.

, Keep all your friendships slightly flirty to avoid falling into the friend zone. This doesn't mean that you want to try to get with all of your girl friends, but being a little flirty will help them remember that you're a potential partner, not just another good friend. Even if they're not interested in you, they may be more likely to set you up with a friend.



Break the touch barrier. Take a few little ""touch risks"". Be playful without being creepy. Grab their elbow or out your hand on the small of their back to guide them through a crowd, grab their upper arm and laugh if they say something funny, etc. If they don't like it, they'll definitely let you know. Touching someone communicates to them that you find them attractive, and also that you're reasonably confident. Both of these things can make someone feel more attracted to you.

, If you like the woman you're talking to, be the one who ends the conversation. This prevents the conversation from lingering into an awkward silence, shows that you're busy (i.e. not needy or desperate), and allows you to end the conversation on a positive note. When you end the conversation, simply say ""Hey, I've gotta go, but it's been really good talking to you. Want to continue this over a cup of coffee sometime?"" If she says yes, get her phone number and move on. If she says no, just move on. She's not the only girl that will cross your path.

, Most women like men to take the initiative, at least at the beginning of the dating period. When you phone her to set a date, have in mind at least two attractive options to offer. Don't contact her and ask her what she wants to do without proposing an alternative yourself, or she will most likely think that you are lazy or not putting enough interest.


For example, if you talk to her and the topic of your date comes up, say something like: ""Well, I had thought we could go to this new amazing restaurant downtown... And I have also been wanting to go to the new bowling center in the mall... Did you have anything in mind?"" If she likes one of your options, she will tell you, and if she doesn't, she will propose something else and you will have demonstrated your assertiveness. If she says she doesn't care, just choose out of the two.

, Just because it gets our attention, doesn't mean teasing us gets our affection. Girl are more sensitive than you'd think, and a simple on-purpose rude remark could cause us to never even think about TALKING to you. Instead compliment heron something good shes done, or be sympathetic if she makes a mistake. But take great caution not to sound sarcastic

, If you meet a nice girl who seems interested in you, try to follow through with this. If you like her back, be willing and confident enough to ask her out. Be subtle at first. A person we just met may seem creepy setting up a fancy candle lit dinner for two on our first casual meeting, connection or not. Try taking her out for coffee after school or work. If she says no, then she either isn't ready, or she doesn't like you. Don't persist, this will push her away more, but be friendly until she starts showing a more romantic interest, and then try again.

, Once you have met a girl that you feel you truly connect with, you need her to like you. If you've done the above correctly, she's probably already interested, so now you just need to seal the deal. Invite her out for a date or a cup of coffee. Offer to pick her up, walk her there, or take the bus together. Not only is this polite, but it will give the two of you more time to talk during the course of the night.


Don't ask her out over chat or text. Give her a call or ask her in person. Though a small gesture, it means a lot to a girl and shows her that you're not just looking for a quick hookup.
Offer to pay. Go to this date expecting to pay. Again, this shows manners, and it lets the girl know that you're not cheap. She'll probably protest out of politeness, but unless she's really sincere, insist.

, There is a big difference between the person who immediately rolls over on his back and begs for a job and the person who knows they have got as much to offer the company as the company has to offer him. When you're with a girl, don't act like you're interviewing to be her partner. Imagine instead that you're interviewing her to be your girlfriend. Putting yourself in the power position will not only make you more attractive to the girl, but it will keep you from choosing the wrong girl just because she'll get with you.

, After the date, don't text or call right away. Some people set a general rule of waiting for 48 hours before calling a girl back. You don't have to give yourself a set time limit, but you do need to avoid looking desperate. Don't call or text her right after the date—give it at least another night.


Be the one to end the conversation. Whether you're texting or calling, when you feel like the conversation is drawing to a close, make sure you're the one to end it. This will make you seem busier and will always leave her wanting more.
There is nothing wrong with initiating the text/chat/call in the beginning. It's actually showing that you're interested and serious and not looking to play games. Be laid back and relaxed about it. If she sees you're serious about her, she'll take initiative that will surprise her. If she doesn't, she's not that into you.
Wait a few minutes to reply to texts. Replying the instant she texts you will make it look like you're just sitting around waiting to hear from her. Wait 5 to 20 minutes before replying to most texts. Note that you shouldn't wait too long, or the conversation may get lost.

, If you still feel a good vibe a week or so after the first date, consider asking her out again. Consider making it slightly more romantic than the first—go out to dinner rather than coffee or hang out just the two of you instead of with a group of friends.



Kiss her! If the mood is right and you haven't already, take this opportunity to give her a kiss goodnight. If ever your faces are three inches apart, and you're both staring at each other, it may be a good time to kiss her. Move in slowly to give her time to react, or push you away if she feels uncomfortable. Look for the signs that she wants a kiss. If this is your first kiss with the girl, leave it at that, even if she invites you in. Just reply ""Not tonight, but next time!"" This will show her you want something more meaningful than just a hookup while conveying that you are still interested.

, Each relationship evolves differently. Sometimes, you'll have to initiate all of the dates until the two of you are officially a couple. Sometimes, she'll initiate. If the former, do your best to read her signals while you're together, as well as the ones over text to gauge if she's uninterested or if she's just shy.


Gauge signals in person. If she responds well to your flirting, laughs at your jokes, and seems comfortable around you, she's probably interested. On the other hand, if she sits away from you with her arms crossed or if she refuses to look you in the eye, she's probably not. Try grabbing her hand when you're walking or putting your hand just above her knee during a movie or during dinner. If she pulls away or seems uncomfortable, she probably hasn't warmed up to you just yet.
Gauge signals over text. If you feel like you're always stretching to keep a text conversation going or she always replies with short answers such as ""great."" ""okay."" ""yeah."" etc., you can assume that she's probably not interested. She likely knows these answers don't lend their way to a meaningful conversation, and is just trying to be polite by responding without giving you the wrong idea. However, in person signals are always easier to rely on. If you're getting mixed signals, go with the in-person ones over the signals you get over text. In a dire situation, talk to mutual friends to help you better understand her behavior.

, Once you are pretty sure that there's strong mutual attraction, ask her to be your girlfriend. You can do this in a big, creative way or simply ask her in person. Be sure to never ask this over text or chat (even just over the phone is questionable). Don't change your Facebook relationship status or refer to her as your girlfriend until she responds!

, Life doesn't normally work on the schedule you envision. Your future girlfriend might cross your path tomorrow or two years from now. A healthy relationship will color your world no matter how old you are, so don't rush into things, or else you might end up forcing the wrong person into the girlfriend role, which will cause pain for everyone involved.

If you rush to get into a relationship with a girl, she might think you are desperate and lose interest in you. Even if you really like a girl, take things slowly when you are first getting to know her. Try to be her friend and get to know her better before you try to make her your girlfriend.Never tell a girl that you love her before you go on a date with her. You should even hold off on telling her that you like her until you have had a few dates.;
, To get a girl to notice you, you will need to talk to her at some point. You don’t have to have a good excuse to talk to her, you just have to have some sort of excuse to break the ice. Once you've broken the ice, talking to her again should not be as difficult. Try saying something like, ""Hey, do you remember what the homework was?"" or ""Can you please pass the salt?""

, Sincere compliments are another great way to get a girl to feel more comfortable with you. Just make sure that your compliments are direct and thoughtful. Compliment her looks, but also compliment her on things other than her appearance, such as her intelligence, her creativity, and her determination.For example, you could say, “You are such an amazing artist. I really admire your talent.” Or, “Most people don’t have the determination or ability to pass advanced level math classes. I think it’s really cool that you have excelled in such challenging courses.”

, Flirtation is important to show a girl that you really like her and that you are interested in more than friendship. If you are new to flirting, then you will need to learn some techniques first. But often flirtation happens on its own. You may find yourself smiling and locking eyes with the girl you like and not even realize that you have been flirting.


Smile at her when you see her and make frequent eye contact as well. These are clear signs that you are interested in her. If she looks away, don’t get worried. This might just mean that she is nervous, which can be a good thing.

, Looks are not all girls care about, but looking and smelling good will help her to see you as someone she might want to date. Take care to shower every day, wear clean clothes, style your hair and shave, and wear deodorant and cologne. Showing her that you have style and that you take pride in your appearance will be attractive to her., While it is great to spend time with a girl you like, it is still important to make time for your own interests. Make sure that you do not stop doing the things that you love in order to spend time with a girl. She will be more attracted to you if she sees that you have a great life and that you are independent than if you need to be around her to feel happy., Being a good listener is crucial if you want to get a girl to fall for you. To show that you are listening to her, maintain eye contact and say neutral things like, “Yes,” “I see,” and “Go on.” Make sure that you repeat back what she has said now and then to show that you have been listening to her., Your unique qualities may help you to get a girl to fall for you as well. Think about what your best traits are and look for ways to put them on display. For example, if you are an athlete, invite her to one of your games. If you play guitar in a band, invite her to come to one of your concerts. If you are an avid reader, strike up a conversation about books with her., Demonstrating how supportive and encouraging you can be may also convince her that you are worthy of her love. Do little things to show her what a great guy you are before you even go on your first date.For example, you can cheer her on at one of her games, high five her for acing an exam, or congratulate her for getting promoted at her job. Look for little ways that you can offer your encouragement and she will be grateful.

, While some girls are attracted to bad boys, a kind, considerate guy makes a much better boyfriend. Make sure that you demonstrate your boyfriend qualities to her before you even have your first date. Use good table manners, open doors for her, and be kind to others., In order to take your casual flirty friendship to the next level, you will need to ask her out on a date at some point. Ask her out in a way that is casual and low-pressure to increase her chances of saying yes and reduce any awkwardness if she says no. Try something like:


""I have a spare movie ticket to on Friday night. Are you busy?""
""I don't know if you have any interest in going, but I usually go to the state fair to be slightly less bored than I'd be at home. You want to be my partner for the day?""
""So that big football game is coming up. Do you want to help me celebrate school spirit by cheering for the other team?""

, While you can ask her out in a way that is casual, you may also want to plan a date that will really wow her. Think about what you already know about her to plan something she would enjoy. Or, you can just ask her what she would like to do. She may appreciate your consideration of her desires as you plan your first date., Showing that you have her comfort and enjoyment at the top of your list will make it more likely that she will want to go on more dates with you. Watch for little ways that you can ensure that she is having a great time all through the date.For example, if she seems cold sitting outside at a café, ask if she wants to head inside to warm up. Or, if the waiter forgot to bring her a drink refill, get the waiter’s attention and ask (politely) about it or just go to the bar and get it for her yourself.

, After you have had a few dates, let her know how much you enjoy spending time with her. She might feel the same way about you, but you will have to speak up at some point if you want to be sure.


Try saying something like, “I always have such an amazing time when we go out. You’re really fun to be around.” Or, be more specific and say something like, “You have the most beautiful smile. It always brightens my day.”, Getting a girl to fall in love with you takes time and energy. Even if your first date was amazing, you can’t expect her to be in love with you already. Keep taking her out on amazing dates and enjoy the process of getting to know each other. The relationship will have a better chance of thriving if you let things happen rather than trying to make her fall in love with you right away."
"
Take it easy and slow.,
Meet the girl.,
Take the conversation up a notch.,
Get her to like you.,
Ask for her number at the peak of the conversation.",How to Get a Girl's Phone Number1," You need to relax before you even approach the girl. Even if you know you want to get her number as soon as you spot her, you won't be able to do it if you don't chill out first. She'll be able to sense if you're nervous from a mile away, and if you're nervous, she will be nervous too or you might scare her off.


Though it's normal to be nervous if you're feeling scared or shy, the girl may wonder, ""What's up with this guy?"" She may think that there's something off about you even if you're having an ordinary case of the jitters.
Calm yourself down by considering the worst-case scenario. The worst thing that can happen is this: you ask for her phone number, and she won't give it to you. Can you survive that? Probably.;
, Once you've calmed down, it's time to come up to the cutie and crank up the charm. Make eye contact, smile, and go up to her to show her what a great guy you are. If you want to keep her talking, you have to make a great first impression as quickly as you can. Here's how to do it:


Be confident. Show her that you love who you are, that you're happy with what you do, and that you love meeting new people. If she thinks you feel good about who you are, she'll feel good about you too. Chances are, she will be excited when she finds out you are interested in her,
Give her all of your attention. This doesn't mean that you should creepily stare into her eyes. It does mean that you should turn your body toward her, put your phone away, and make her see that what she says matters to you.
Make her laugh. The easiest way to make her like you is to charm her with your wit.

, Once you get the basics out of the way, like your names and where you're from, you should start to connect with the girl on a deeper level. This doesn't mean that you should ask her about her life philosophy or about the most meaningful experience of her childhood, but it does mean that you should move past the introductions. Here's how to do it:


Ask her some questions about herself. Don't interview her. Just ask about her siblings, about a movie she's seen, or what she thinks of her job. Let her see that you care about her opinions.
Open up. Make sure that you're both talking about the same amount. You don't want to put pressure on her by asking a lot of questions without revealing anything about yourself, but you shouldn't hog the conversation either.
Tease her. Once you build a good rapport, start to playfully make fun of her a little bit. If she's wearing an obviously decorative chunky gold necklace, hold it and say, ""Is that real gold?""
Compliment her. Don't tell her she's the most beautiful woman you've ever seen. Just tell her she has an amazing laugh, or that her eyes are striking. Don't go overboard! Make sure to stay cool.

, Once you've moved past the introductions and have charmed her initially, it's time to get her to like you enough to want to spend time with her again. She doesn't have to think that you're the man she's been waiting for all her life; all she has to think is, ""Hey, this guy is cool. I want more of this."" Here's how to get her to want to see you again:


Build witty banter. Show her that you like to tease her, have her tease you, and keep up your end of a sharp conversation. If she says something funny, answer back with a funny quip instead of just laughing and saying, ""That's funny."" This will show her that you can keep up with her if you hang out again.
Reveal something a little more personal. Don't get so personal that you make her uncomfortable, but tell her something that makes her heart melt just a little bit and see that you're not just all about the jokes, but that you really do have a softer side.
Have her open up to you. Lean in a little closer, and encourage her to tell you something about herself that she doesn't tell just anyone. Start building a strong connection.
Bring up something from earlier in the conversation. Women love this if you do it correctly. If something from the beginning from your conversation comes up again, you can impress her by showing that you remember everything she says.

, Don't wait for things to lag, or you'll lose. Just when you're having the most fun talking to the girl, or when you're laughing the hardest, is exactly when you should ask. When you reach the point where you think, ""I'm having such a great time talking to this girl that I don't even want to interrupt it by asking for her phone number,"" you should ask immediately. Here are the two best ways to do this:Ask her out. Instead of asking for her phone number, ask her out on a date. In the middle of a great conversation, just say, ""I have to go, but I really want to keep up this conversation over dinner or drinks next week. Would you like that?"" If she says she would like it — and at this point, she should — then you should ask for her number to coordinate.
Ask for her number directly. Just when the conversation is going as well as it can, say, ""Hey, I really like talking to you. Can I get your number so we can keep talking?"" Make it clear that you're asking for her number because you want to hang out again, not because you want to send her creepy texts or because you get a rush from getting girls' phone numbers.
React appropriately. Don't cheer and pump your fist in the air and say, ""Yes!"" when she gives you her number. Just say, ""awesome, thanks,"" and tell her you'll call her soon. Then say goodbye and walk off with your head held high. And if she says no, shrug it off and say it's not a problem — it was great to meet her anyway.

Examine your reasons for asking the girl to make it official.,
Make sure she likes you.,
Find the right place and time to ask your question.,
Have the right attitude.,
Pop the question in the best way possible.,
React appropriately.",How to Get a Girl to Be Your Girlfriend," If you've found a girl who makes you feel special and your heart is beating at a million miles per minute, then chances are, she would make a great girlfriend. However, asking someone to be your girlfriend could be making a serious commitment that could lead to marriage, and it's important to understand your motives before you plunge into your question.


If she's the right girl, then she will possess many positive qualities that will make your relationship thrive. Here are a few signs that she is girlfriend material:

You love spending time with her. Every time you are apart, you're counting down the minutes until you'll see each other again.
She makes you want to be a better person. Her intelligence, quick wit, and work ethic makes you want to read more books, work harder, and brush up on your jokes.
She is committed to you. If she has demonstrated loyalty by showing up to watch your band perform, or bringing you chicken soup when you're feeling sick, chances are, she'll transition smoothly into the girlfriend role.
You have common interests. You have things in common, from your favorite sports teams to your love for running marathons. Though you don't have to share all of your interests, you have to have enough in common so you can find meaningful ways to spend time together as the relationship progresses.


If she's the wrong girl, or you're in it for the wrong reasons, then chances are, you're better off being single. Here are some signs that you should not take your relationship to the next level:

If she expresses interest in other people. If you know she is casually dating others, and makes no plans to stop seeing them, chances are she won't stop pursuing her extra-curricular activities once she becomes your girlfriend. However, give her the benefit of the doubt: she may be on the dating market, but you could be the one she has her eye on.
You only want to date her because you are lonely, or in need of some attention in the bedroom. Casual dating works best for these situations. Having a girlfriend is a real commitment, and you should be asking the girl to make it official because you care about her--not about what she can do for you.

;
, If she's sending you mixed signals, try spending a little more time with her until you feel confident about how she feels.


Avoid asking too early! If you're only just beginning to get to know her and you immediately ask her to be your girlfriend, she will say no because she doesn't know you well enough, and the resulting awkwardness might decrease your chances of being together. Furthermore, she will probably think you're a bit strange (in a not so great way).
Listen to her words, and note her body language. Do you get the impression that she wants to be around you? You can pick up on this pretty easily if you concentrate on her actions.
Get a sense of her feelings from her friends. Without being too obvious, you can check in with her friends to see if she's really digging you. This can help boost your confidence--and to avoid potentially awkward situations if she has you deep in the Friend Zone.

, It's important to be thoughtful about when and where you'll be asking your question. This will show your girl that you put time and effort into planning your special moment, and will increase your chances of getting a favorable response.


Pick a location that sets the right tone. It's important to pick a place where you can have enough privacy to ask your question. You can avoid any overly-romantic location, such as a candle-lit dinner, which will make your intentions too obvious and will make things more awkward if you are rejected. Asking during a long walk in a park or over quiet drinks can be just perfect.
Pick the right time. Evenings are more romantic and will allow the girl to focus on you, not her busy day. You can ask her on a weekend night, but be wary that this will make it look like a date already.
Make plans in advance. Be mysterious. Ask her to meet you a week in advance, so she'll be thinking about your intentions. This will show her that you're playful and thoughtful.

, You should approach the evening with a positive attitude. Thinking that your conversation will go well can really help you succeed. If you have confidence in the future of your relationship, she will too.


Avoid being nervous. Don't bite your nails, or retreat into awkward silence. Just be yourself.

, It's important to deliver your question in the best way possible, so that your intentions are clear.


Once you've gotten to know your girl, it's time to ask her to be yours. There are several ways to ask a girl to be your girlfriend, and it's going to depend on how people your age refer to it. For example, ""going steady"" is an outdated phrase. The following are pretty timeless:
""Will you be my girlfriend?"" Asking her to be your girlfriend is much more direct and upfront than ""would you go out with me?"" Most girls would be flattered by your confidence and direct speech.
Don't be afraid to be creative if the direct route is not for you. You can ask the girl by handing her a letter, writing ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" on a cake, or finding another creative way to capture her attention--and her heart.
Don't wait a long time or she'll think you don't like her anymore. Girls have their limits.
Avoid asking her to be your ""implied girlfriend."" This may happen when you've been hanging out for a few weeks and generally having a good time. Then, one day you sort of look at each other and you ask, ""Hey, are we going out?"". Invariably, the answer will be No. Most times, it is just worse not to be direct about what you are.

, Whether she agrees to be your girlfriend and gives you a big hug or turns you down, your actions after you pop the questions can set the tone for the rest of the relationship.


If she says yes, tell her how excited you are to hear that you'll be spending time together as boyfriend and girlfriend. All of your cards are on the table and you don't have to worry so much about playing it cool anymore. Reciprocating her enthusiasm will show how thrilled you are about your future together!
If she rejects you, be understanding. There are many reasons that she may not want to be your girlfriend, such as having feelings for someone else, or only seeing you as a friend. Whatever her reason, it's important not to put her down or act like you don't care about her anymore. This will show that you're mature and reasonable, and will allow you to continue your friendship. Also, this will make it more likely that she will reconsider your question if you ask her in the distant future!

Find ways to make physical contact with the girl whose attention you are trying to get.",How to Get a Girl's Attention2," If you want a girl to notice you, start by noticing her first. Whether you are in class or at a bar, eye contact is a key part of getting a girl’s attention. Glance at her, but when she sees you looking, look away. Repeat this and then hold eye contact for a moment and throw in a smile if you feel like its the right time to do so, then look away again. Doing this will arouse her interest, and will also hint to her that you are interested. If she is interested too, she will keep glancing at you to see if you’re still glancing at her. It's a cycle that will clue her in to the fact that you are interested.If she doesn’t hold eye contact with you, or if she chooses not to glance back at you, she is either very shy, or not interested. You will have to use other methods listed in this article to determine which one it is.
When you talk with girls, try as hard as possible to keep consistent eye contact with her. This tells her that you're really confident, and that you're paying really close attention to her.

, Girls tend to have a different humor and perspective than guys, so being aware of and sensitive to these differences is important when it comes to getting (and keeping) a girl’s attention.


Do common things that are gentlemanly, like opening the door for a girl, letting her cut you in line, and saying ""excuse me."" Doing the small things is really easy, and girls pay attention to them much more than guys do.
Don't make really sexual jokes or comments. Girls already think that guys are obsessed with sex, so don't make it worse by being obsessed with sex. Be mature and respectful about sexual matters, at least when you're around girls, and you'll definitely get a girl's attention.

, It sounds basic, but a lot of guys assume women may not notice, or care, when men treat them like they are lower than men. This is completely wrong, and it won't make you very many friends among females. Think before you speak negatively about girls as a whole. As a rule of thumb, pretend that your grandparents are in front of you whenever you say something about girls--it will keep you from saying anything too inappropriate.

, Even if you are all jittery on the inside, keeping a cool and calm demeanor around girls will give them the impression that you are a confident, easy-to-hang-out-with guy. When you are tense or nervous, you're more prone to feeling embarrassed if you make some minor mistakes. This is a turn-off for most girls. Staying calm allows you to fully enjoy a girl's company, stay confident, and show her the real you.


Staying confident is hard, but try to imagine that the girl you're trying to impress is just a friend. You wouldn't be nervous around a friend, so why be nervous around her? If you're confident and manage to look cool and calm, you'll scream popular. Her attention will be yours in no time.

, A smile is the universal sign of happiness. If you show people in general, and her specifically, that you're a happy guy, she'll want to be closer to you. Girls love guys who have a good sense of humor and can smile easily. Smile often, be lighthearted and unabashedly yourself.

, It could be her, or it could be someone else in the room. Helping others says that you are humble, and that you're a genuinely nice person. Be a kind and generous person. Not only will it get her attention, but it will also make you feel good about yourself. Girls are attracted to guys that have empathy for others--be the guy that helps her carry a heavy box and she won’t forget it.


Is she carrying something heavy? Say ""Let me help you with that"" and carry it for her. Hold the door for her when she is carrying a lot of stuff. Give her your jacket when she is cold or offer to share your umbrella with her when it is raining.
Is someone short on cash? Lend them a few dollars so they can eat lunch.
Don't be fake and do nice things only when she's around. Help people all the time, in a wide variety of ways. She'll notice, and so will the people she knows, and on the occasions that you come up in a conversation, people will say ""He's such a great person!"" and this girl will start thinking ""Yeah...he is, isn't he?""
One thing that holds many guys back is being scared that she'll misinterpret you. For example, you might not want to help her carry something because you're worried she'll think you're a macho guy, and you're implying that she can't carry it herself. But push the fear aside and think about what you're really doing. You're just helping her because you genuinely want to, and what could possibly be wrong with that? If you're not trying to question her ability in any way, then she's not a very nice girl for assuming that you are, is she? If what you're doing comes from the heart, a decent girl will see that.

, For example, you could say she has beautiful eyes or a beautiful smile. But, only say things like that if you want it to be obvious that you intend on moving beyond flirting. Select something good that is reserved for her only; it will make her feel wonderfully special, admired, and beautiful.

, When you're doing something and it's only guys, be brave and include the girls you want included. You don't have to do this all the time (sometimes it's important to have time with your guy friends), but don't be afraid to add some girls to the mix.


If boys call you out, you know they're jealous that they didn't have the courage to invite the girls. There's no reasons why girls can't be a part of your group.

, Physical contact can be a great way to create sparks between you and that special girl. However, don’t make it obvious that you are going out of your way to be near her--that might creep her out if she doesn’t know you are into her. Do subtle things, like touching her arm when she says something that makes you laugh.


If she has an eyelash or a fuzzy on her face (or even if she doesn’t) lean in, make eye contact, and slowly brush it from her cheek (but be gentle!)

Groom yourself.,
Keep your wardrobe in mind.,
Be aware of your body language.,
Keep your body in shape.",How to Get a Girl's Attention3," Depending on your style, this step can vary a lot but the basics are this: Take showers regularly and brush your teeth. Those are the absolute basics, but they will still go a long way in improving your chances of getting that special girl’s attention. No one wants to cuddle up to a dude who smells like B.O. and has breakfast stockpiled in his teeth. Bust out that body wash and invest in a great toothbrush.


Beyond the basics, there are a lot of ways that guys can groom themselves so that they look their best. Hair mousse can turn your fuzzy bedheaded look into a subtly sculpted thing of beauty. Don’t put gobs of mousse on your head though--grease hair can be a turn off for some girls.
If you’re rocking a beard, keep it in check. Some women really dig facial hair, but even the manliest of beards can go the way of Rip Van Winkle’s absurdly long beard if they are not properly maintained. Invest in a beard trimmer.
Aside from beard sculpting, take a good look at the rest of your body hair. Pluck that unibrow, clip those nose hairs, and keep any ear hair you might have to a minimum. Most girls--even ones that love beards--balk at excessive hair in other places besides your chin, chest, and more private parts.
Clip your nails. Girls often notice hands, so make sure yours don’t look like they might belong to Big Foot. Cut off those talons and scrape any dirt out from under your nails.
Moisturize. While this may seem like an unmanly thing to do, when you have the girl of your dreams on your arm, you will not want that arm to be dry and flakey. Use lotion to give your skin a softness that she won’t be able to resist touching.

, Everyone has their own style, and that is completely fine, but its really best to avoid the ‘slob’ style. Don’t wear sweatpants every day of the week, and try to change your shirt before heading out of your house each day. Apart from that, try to keep in mind that girls like when guys put a bit of effort into their look, even if that just means throwing on a stylish flannel, tightish pants, and a pair of rocking thick-rimmed glasses (see How to be a Hipster.)


If you are trying a catch a gal’s eye who happens to work at your place of employment, try to play up your professionalism. Invest in some classy suits and some great ties. If you don’t know how to do that, enlist the help of your best girl friend.

, Posture plays a big part in how women perceive guys. If a guy is hunched over in a corner, avoiding eye contact and not talking with anyone, they are most likely not going to walk over and start a conversation. Stand up straight, make eye contact, and smile. Keep in mind that you want to have good posture, but you don’t want to make it weirdly obvious that you’re standing up super straight. Carry yourself with ease.If you don’t know how to carry yourself with ease, look at your role models. Watch lead guys in movies who manage to charm their ways into the lead girls’ hearts.
Keep her body language in mind too. If she's shifting her weight a lot and not making eye contact, she's probably uncomfortable. It may be the conversation topic, how close you are standing or sitting next to her, or something else. Respect her feelings, and change the subject or step back, if necessary, depending on what is bothering her.

, While you are probably a great guy, it is important to remember that some girls really like guys who work out. Plus, the gym is a great place to catch the attention of that special girl. If you want to attract that drop dead gorgeous girl you’ve been crushing on, you have to keep your physique in good condition too. Start an exercise routine that includes cardio and weight training so that you can both buff up your muscles, and get in incredible shape.


Keep in mind that most women like a toned guy, but are not attracted to a dude who looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was Mr. Universe. If you are having a hard time raising your hand in class because your muscles are about to rip through your shirt, it may be time to tone the weight-lifting down a bit.

Find your girl.,
Charm her with your approach.,
Ask for her number.",How to Get a Girl's Phone Number2," If you spot an absolutely gorgeous girl, or just a girl who looks so cute or charming that you want to know her better, then it couldn't hurt to quickly ask for her number. To do this in two minutes, you have to make every second count. First, make sure she's receptive. She could be standing by herself or with girlfriends, not engaged in a deep conversation or looking like she's searching for someone.


Once you've found the perfect girl, wow her with a big grin and strong eye contact.

, Walk up to the girl like you're on a mission. After all, you are. Turn toward her and tell her your name. Ask her what her name is. No matter what the name is, tell her it's a beautiful name.


Make her laugh.
Tell her that you're usually not so forward, but that the second you saw her, you knew that you just had to know her.

, Tell her that you absolutely have to get going but that you knew you'd regret it if you didn't at least try to get her number so you could get to know her better in the future. Say, ""I really wish I could get to know you now and to show you what a great guy I am, but I have to get going. Can I get your number so we can pick this up later?""


If she gives you her number, thank her and say you're excited to get to know her. Then walk away quickly, like you really are busy.
If she won't give it to you, just laugh and say, ""You can't blame me for trying!"" After all, you just took a risk. Be proud of yourself for making an effort.

"
"
Don't ask too soon.,
Don't ask if the conversation lags.,
Don't have your friends ask for you.,
Don't trick her into giving you her number.",How to Get a Girl's Phone Number3," Though the two-minute drill can be effective, the ten-second drill won't charm any girl no matter how slick you think you are. You should take enough time to introduce yourself to the girl, to ask her name, and to let her quickly see that you're a cool guy she'd like to see again.


Don't just walk up to a girl and say, ""Hey, I want to hang out with you later. Can I get your number?""
Don't ask for her number without telling her your name.

, If you feel a lag in the conversation, or the girl keeps looking around the room, checking her phone, or trying to make eye contact with her friends so they save her from you, then you've missed your chance. Sorry, buddy. Better luck next time.


If both of you are struggling to find something to say, then don't ask for her number. Why would she want to give it to you — so you can sit in awkward silence some more another time?
If she says goodbye to you and starts walking away, don't ask for her number. If she wanted you to ask, she would have lingered.

, This is a no-brainer. Unless you're in middle school, you have to put on your big boy pants and ask her yourself. If your friends ask for you, you will look shy, insecure, and not like a real man.


If a girl thinks you're not assertive enough to ask for her phone number, how can she expect you to impress her when you hang out?

, Some people may think it's a good idea for you to go up to the girl and to say, ""Oh, shoot, I can't find my phone, do you mind if I give it a call from your phone?"" Then, the girl will technically give you her number and you will ""discover"" that your phone is in your pocket. She'll see what you're up to and will think you're pretty lame, unless you can be really suave about it and laugh and say, ""I bet you never thought I could get your number."" You may get some cleverness points for this one, but it's more likely that the girl will think you were too cowardly to ask for her number the normal way. There are better ways to go about it.

Touch them when making a point.,
Encourage body contact.,
Hang on the person.,
Rest on the person.,
Use more intimate contact.,
Mirror their body language.,
Tickle the other person.,
Find excuses to touch him/her.,
Touch and then hold their hand.,
Dance with the other person.,
Pull the awkwardness out of a kiss.",How to Flirt Physically," Touch his or her shoulder or hand when you make a point (""It's really cool"" or ""You should try it,"" etc.). Not only are you reinforcing what you're saying, your also giving them an excuse to start touching you back!;
, If you already did some physical flirting, encourage him/her to touch you as well. Play a game like thumb wrestling, put an arm on his or her shoulder, and open up. Be creative. If he or she will smile, the person probably likes it and may want you to do it again. And when he/she touches you back in a sensual way, you are in!


If you're a guy, give the girl a piggyback ride. It's a good way to get close to her and show her how strong you are. Try not to move too fast or you could fall, which would not be encouraging.
When the other person teases you, gently ""hit"" them on the shoulder. Mostly, girls do this when guys are playfully teasing them. Be careful doing this if you're a guy.

, Hang your arm around the person a little when telling a joke or laughing. When you're telling a joke or he's telling a joke, put your hand gently on his/her shoulder while laughing.


For girls, you can probably do this pretty much anytime for any reason. You're asking him a favor, you're talking about your weekend, etc. It seems hard at first, but the guy will definitely be happy.
For guys, you can only really pull this off when being in a jokey mood, or if you're especially close with the girl. Or, after you hug, you can leave one arm around her for a little bit longer than normal and see how she reacts.

, Rest your head on his or her shoulder and say ""I'm tired,"" if it's late at night or if you see him/her early in the morning such as on the bus.


You can do this when you're pretending you're bored or exasperated, too. You're sitting next to one another during an announcement that's taking way too long, and you sigh as you move back gently and rest on the person.

, Hug, touch him/her on the shoulder, or even kiss them on the cheek instead of just saying a simple goodbye.



Hug the person when you see them in the morning, or when you leave for the day; when you're congratulating them for an accomplishment; or when you don't think you'll see them for a while.

Kiss the person on the cheek if you're a girl and you want to send him a signal that he should be starting to kiss you. Kiss him on the cheek as you leave and he'll be thinking about it for days to come.

Kissing casually is harder for guys to do to girls because 1) most girls don't want their private space violated; and 2) most girls will expect a first kiss to be a little more than a peck on the cheek.



, Mirror his or her pose when you are facing one another. This bit of body language sends a subtle signal; subliminally, they will feel as if they have a stronger connection to you just based on how you are mirroring them.


Don't do this all the time, however, or the other person might feel like you're aping them. Make sure when you do it, it's natural.

, Tickling is a great way to flirt with someone physically. Tickling is OK among friends, but not so much among acquaintances, so make sure you know the person enough before you start tickling. Be careful to respect peoples boundaries and also not sneak into peoples houses and tickle them while they are sleeping. A couple tips when you are tickling:


It's more socially common for guys to tickle girls. That doesn't mean you can't tickle a guy if you're a girl, it just means that guys are usually the ones doing the tickling. Keep that in mind.
Only tickle in safe areas. The last thing you want to do when flirting is make the other person feel uncomfortable. To ensure that you don't overstep his/her boundaries, try focusing on the arms, knees, and feet.
Pay attention to your crush's body language, and what they say. If they're laughing and jokingly tell you to stop, it's probably OK to go on a little longer before you stop. If they don't laugh, however, seem uncomfortable, and ask you to stop, stop right away.

, Touch the person when you compliment their ring, bracelet, new shirt or hair. Or say something like: ""You have small hands,"" and put your hands against each others. See how long it takes before they pull their hand back. If it takes a while, s/he most likely enjoyed it.

, If you are afraid of rejection, start slow with a subtle hand touch. Do it in a way he/she will notice, but that isn't too obvious at first. Then slowly move to holding hands if the person seems to like the contact.


For example, when walking next to each other, you could slightly touch his or her hand. If this person noticed it, s/he will look at you, and when s/he smiles you could try taking his/her hand. If they don't like it, you will know it's too soon to start holding hands.
You can find an excuse for holding hands a lot of different ways. If you're in a haunted house, or on a rollercoaster, or showing them something, simply take their hand confidently and don't wait for them to react. If they don't like it or aren't ready for it yet, you will know.
Interlocking hands is harder the first couple times than just clasping or ""cupping"" their hand. To avoid any awkwardness, stick with cupping in the beginning, where you put your pinky, ring, middle and index fingers together and grab onto the other person's palm.

, Dancing is a great, social way to get close to that person you like and show them a bit of flirtatious fun. Whether it's at a school dance, your birthday party, or waiting at the bus stop (if you're silly and/or have a good sense of humor), dancing can help set the stage.


Go for the slow-dance. When that song comes on, go straight to your crush and ask them to dance. If you're a guy, put your arms around her waist. If you're a girl, put your arms around his shoulders. Get close enough so that your mouth is close to the other person's ears.

, If you feel awkward, just gently touch their nose with the end of your finger while smiling. Then, slowly lean into the person as if you were going to hug him and start to kiss them with a little kiss.


If you can tell that the other person is a little unsure of him/herself, after you kiss them, give them a bit of encouragement. Tell them something like ""That was nice, you're a good kisser."" If they feel more confident, you're doing your job.
First kisses can be awkward. That's just life. One thing, however, is certain: it takes time and a little bit of practice to get the hang of things. Don't worry about the awkwardness and focus on the things you like about the other person.

Consider why you want this girl to like you.,
Make yourself more attractive to women.,
Talk to a girl you like, even if she seems uninterested.,
Don’t send mixed signals about your feelings.,
Be a good friend.",How to Get a Girl to Like You when She Has No Interest in Relationships1," Ask yourself why you are attracted to girl. For example, she might sense that your interest is purely physical or superficial, and avoid you.If this is the only type of attention she receives from guys, then she might be jaded or feel under-appreciated.Before approaching her, step back and determine what you look for in a relationship. Next, ask yourself if she is good relationship material based on these qualities:


Integrity: is she honest with both herself and others, trustworthy, and dependable. Can you be upfront with each other about your thoughts and fears.Emotional maturity and self-esteem: no one is perfect, but a willingness to reflect on and learn from the past (and demonstrate what you’ve learned) is a key feature of emotionally mature people. Emotionally immature girls are those that are dependent on others for their self-esteem and well-being, and let their emotions control their actions.Supportive and committed to personal growth: she has her own interests and actively pursues them, has a general positive attitude about life (even when face with difficult circumstances), and she maintains good relationships with family and friends and encourages those around her.However, someone that constantly puts their own interests above others, and are overly competitive or judgmental do not make good partners.;
, One of the ways to get a girl to notice you is to make yourself more attractive in how you look and act.By making small changes, you can not only make yourself more attractive to women, but also improve your self-confidence. It is often the little things that will make you stand out, such as practicing good hygiene and doing something nice for others (even when she isn't around).Clean-up your appearance: this shows you have self-respect and take care of yourself. Make sure you wear clean and unwrinkled clothing, shower at least every other day, keep your hair combed, and your beard shaved or trimmed short.Practice good oral hygiene, brushing your teeth twice a day and avoiding foods that cause bad breath (such as coffee or garlic).Avoid wearing too much cologne or body spray – instead, stick with a neutral aftershave or deodorant.
Relax and be confident: don’t let your fear of being turned down overcome your ability to talk to your crush, even if it seems she is at first not interested in you. Girls don’t like being around or interacting with men who lack confidence.Also, girls find laid-back and less stressed men more attractive and enjoyable to be around., Let her know you exist by initiating conversation and establishing a friendly relationship with her. Put yourself out there in a way that shows you are interested without seeming too pushy or aggressive. Ask her a question about herself or a topic you are both interested in, such as: ""hey, I just started watching (name of TV show). Who is your favorite character or what was your favorite season"".Make a general statement about the weather, school, or something you are eating. Break the ice by asking them a favor, such as help with a project or your homework. Avoid talking about politics, religion, past relationships, or traumatic events.


Catch her attention by making eye contact and smile when talking. Avoid speaking too fast or in a high pitch – this will make you look nervous.If walking next to one another, slow down. This will make you appear more laid-back and approachable – good qualities in both a friend and boyfriend.Remember to be respectful. Respect her decision to stay single. Move on without question her decision. It is important to realize some people are not compatible.

, The term mixed feelings refers to the difference between how others perceive you and how you see yourself.One of the reasons she may be uninterested in having a relationship with you is you send mixed signals. For example, you constantly brag about going on dates or being interested in other women, or you regularly blow off friends.Talk yourself up without bragging. Mention accomplishments you are proud of, or goals you had and how you achieved them. For example: ""That English assignment or math test was rough, but my studying paid off"" or ""my months of training paid off in the half-marathon, maybe I will run the full marathon next year"".
Be more upfront and open about your feelings. One of the mixed messages you may be sending is that you are cold or pessimistic. Make a goal of saying one positive thing a day about someone else., If she is truly uninterested in a relationship, or there is something going on in her life (family, school, work, health issues, etc.) preventing her from having a relationship, do not pressure her. The only, and best thing, you can be right now is a good friend and confidant. You want to be supportive, but not overbearing.This is especially important if she is facing a personal problem, such as a death or illness in the family.Create space and respect her privacy. Do not try to fix her problems or constantly offer advice. Simply let her know you are there and are willing to listen.
Be a good listener. Do not jump in with your opinion and resist the urge to fix everything. Let them talk things out and come to terms with things on their own.
Make plans as a group and include her. Offer to pick her up or pay for her. Simple acts of kindness, as long as there are no strings attached, can go a long way.

Act confident.,
Take care of yourself and your appearance.,
Be an awesome person.",How to Get a Girlfriend as a Nerd1," You don’t have to be confident but you do have to act confident. This will make people, girls included, take you seriously. Also, as we discuss below, girls think confidence is super attractive. Why would she want to like you if you don’t like yourself very much?


However, don’t be that guy that thinks he can do no wrong and that every word out of his mouth is a new book of the Bible. Admit when you’re wrong, always seek to improve yourself, and don’t act like you’re God’s gift to women. Don’t be a Captain Hammer. For that matter, try not to be a Doctor Horrible either.....at least with all the killing bits. That would be counter-productive.;
, Don’t feed the stereotype of nerds not taking care of their bodies. Like self confidence, if you can’t care about yourself enough to take care of yourself, how are you supposed to take care of someone else? Wash your body and hair regularly, wear clean clothes (without holes!), and brush your teeth. No Bowser breath here!

, Be a Nathan Drake. Be a Bruce Wayne. Be a Captain Picard. Be a guy who’s fun to be around, knows things, and makes the world and the people around him better because that's what girls really want. You don’t have to be the smartest guy, but be knowledgeable about the world around you. Help people by volunteering your time and being there for everyone you know. And get out there and do things! Even if it’s just going to cons, you have got to get out and live your life, not just sit around all day.


If you want to do something awesome and show the world (and the ladies) how great nerds can be, do work with nerdy charities like Child’s Play. This will go to a good cause and show people that nerds contribute to society in impactful, wonderful ways.
If you really want to get a girlfriend, take a lesson from the Patrick Stewart School of Awesome and respect the heck out of women. It turns out they really like that.

Attempt to compliment the woman, but make it sound like you are kind of crazy by saying something very inappropriate.,
Attempt to right your previous inappropriate comment by trying to explain what you really meant to say, to show her that your intention really was to compliment her.,
Attempt to ""restart"" the conversation by changing the topic and ask her a question.,
Realise how much you messed it up This is the final step in Ross' flirting.",How to Flirt Like Ross Geller," Also make sure the woman don't get that you were trying to compliment her. Here is an example:


(This one is the original one by Ross Geller in the Friends episode where he flirts) ""I happen to like eight year old boys"" (he is referring to a previous event in the episode where the woman he is flirting with said her haircut looked like that of an eight year old boy. Of course this woman don't remember this and she gets a quite different idea) Once Ross realises what he has said he must try to make it sound right again which brings us to step two.;
, Since you are trying to imitate Ross you must make sure you mess it up real bad and make it even worse. This might be easier if you plan what to say beforehand.

, Make sure this backfires. Here is Ross' example from the Friends episode:


Ross asks the pizza lady if they make the pizzas in wood-burning ovens, and she replies that they use gas ovens. Ross then asks her if she knows ""that smell gas has"" and he goes on and on about how they add the smell to gas.

, In the episode, once the pizza lady left he closed the door and said: ""Did I just talk to her about gas?"" and he realised what he had done.

Do not pressure a girl into saying something she doesn't mean.",How to Get a Girl to Admit That She Likes You," If you like a girl, and you're pretty sure she likes you, it's important to spend some alone time together. Hanging out with a group of friends together can be fun, but it won't allow you two to make a personal connection. Break off from your group of friends from time to time to have meaningful conversations and get to know each other one-on-one.


Ask her questions about her goals and her dreams, about her family, and about her interests. Showing her that you genuinely care about her will make it easier for her to open up to you about her feelings for you.;
, If you do something fun together, she will remember it. Ask her what types of things she likes to do for fun, and do those things. Once she realizes that she has enjoyed hanging out with you on multiple occasions, she may be more comfortable admitting that she likes you.


Creating enjoyable memories together is a great way to continuously remind someone how much they enjoy spending time with you.

, If you're unsure whether or not a girl likes you, her body language is usually a dead giveaway. Pay attention to how a girl acts when she is around you. She might be too shy to actually tell you that she likes you, but her body language will be pretty obvious.


If she gives you her full attention when you speak, this can sometimes be a sign. When you're talking with a group of people, it's easy for people to get distracted and not give you their full interest. However, if she makes a point to pay attention to everything you say, this could be a sign that she likes you.
Does she play with her hair around you? Girls often flirt with their body language by twirling their hair when they're around someone they like. If a girl is consistently playing with her hair in a flirty way, this could be a sign she likes you. Don't confuse this with a girl whose hair is in her way, or a girl who is putting her hair in a ponytail.Does she always stay close to you or find reasons to touch you? A girl will go out of her way to be physically near you if she likes you. She'll grab your arm if you make her laugh, she'll always sit next to you, etc.
Does she flirt with you? This is the most obvious sign, but a girl probably likes you if she's always flirting with you., When a girl likes you, she almost always tells her friends about you. In fact, they probably know as much about you as she does. If she doesn't come right out and tell you that she's told her friends about you, you can find out if she's told her friends about you in a few different ways.


Tell her a story about you telling your friends about her. For example, say ""I was telling my roommate that you've never seen The Lion King, and he couldn't believe it!"" If you share a story like this, she may be more willing to share one of her own.
Ask her if she's talked to her friends about a conversation that the two of you had. If the two of you were talking about a book or a movie and had a funny disagreement, ask her if she asked her friends their opinion. If she has talked to her friends, she more than likely has told them about you., If you're too shy to just tell a girl that you like her, being flirtatious is a great way to show her. Give her compliments, joke around with her, be playful, and throw in casual comments or jokes about you two in a romantic way.


For example, if she makes a comment about a bad date in her past, say something like ""Our dates would be SO much better than that"" with a smile.
If you notice she's wearing new perfume, make a comment like ""I see you're wearing a new perfume for me."" Always say these comments in a light-hearted, relaxed manner., Pay attention when the girl you like talks to you, and apply what they've told you to your future actions. Listen to the things she says she likes and doesn't like, and remember those things. When you show a girl that you like her, she will be more likely to be honest about her feelings for you. If she's scared that you don't like her back, she'll be more hesitant to tell you.


For example, if she mentions she loves cupcakes, bring her a cupcake next time you see her.
If she mentions that she's struggling with a subject in school, offer to help her out., Girls notice when you do kind things for them, so do kind things for the girl that you like. Don't overdo it, or the girl might begin to feel smothered. Give her compliments and gifts every once in awhile (maybe 2-3 times per week) instead of every day.


Kind gestures can include giving her compliments, buying her flowers, offering to rub her back or feet of she complains they are hurting, getting her presents, bringing her lunch, etc.

, Direct your conversations toward romantic topics, like which qualities she thinks are most important in significant other. Ask her about her biggest turn-offs, too. When you engage in this type of conversation with someone who likes you, she may mention good qualities that you possess. Pay attention to see if she's dropping clues about you.


If you initiate this type of conversation, a girl might even go so far as to tell you that she likes you., If the subtle hints you're giving a girl don't cause her to admit that she likes you, try having a blunt conversation with her. Girls appreciate honesty, and don't like to feel like they are getting played, so you making the first move will make her feel more comfortable. Telling her that you have feelings for her may cause her to tell you that she likes you as well., If you're not getting a clear answer from her, you should simply ask her if she likes you. Don't catch her by surprise or make her feel uncomfortable. Express to her that you have feelings for her and ask her if she feels the same way. Let her know that her actions have led you to believe that she likes you, and you want to know for sure.


For example, say ""I've liked you for awhile now, and I was hoping you had feelings for me too. Do you?""
Or you can say ""When we talk and spend time together, I feel like we have a great connection. I've been wanting to ask you if you have feelings for me, because I have feelings for you."", The ultimate way to get a girl to admit that she likes you is to ask her on a date. If she agrees, she's basically telling you that she's interested in you as well. This may take some courage, but if you really like this girl and want to find out if she likes you, it will be worth it.

, Just because you like a girl doesn't mean she has to like you back. If you have expressed that you like her and she has told you that she doesn't feel the same way, you need to respect her choice. If a girl tells you that she doesn't like you, do not be upset with her or yell at her.


If a girl tells you she doesn't like you back but you still want to be friends, you should say something like ""I understand. I still think that you're an amazing person, and I'd still like to be friends.""
If a girl tells you she doesn't like you back and you're not sure if you can handle being friends, you should keep your response sweet and simple. Say something like ""I understand. Thanks for being honest with me.""

Encourage them to talk about themselves.,
Touch on past shared experiences.,
Keep things clean, but don’t be afraid to get a little naughty.,
Ask him or her out on a date.",How to Flirt over the Phone1," People rarely get opportunities where they can be unapologetic about how they talk about themselves.Giving them the floor to talk about themselves is a way to learn more about them and allows you to be more interesting by being interested in them.


Ask open ended questions that delve into the person’s past and present. Find out their career ambitions, their hobbies, and what they enjoy about life.Also ask about their love lives. Sometimes inquiring about a person’s dating life is one of the things that hint towards you being interested in them as more than a friend. Friends don’t tend to ask you about your last relationship and what went wrong.;
, Recalling the moments you have shared together in a way that feels intimate creates a flirting dynamic between you two. Talk about how you met online, in line at the coffee shop, or in study group for class.


Take the time to recap an attribute that made you notice him or her by saying something like, “Your smile took my breath away.”
If you have been out with him or her before, mention a detail of an outfit you’ve seen them wear before and mention how it made you feel watching them in it: “You had that amazing sundress on that day and it had me looking at you like, wow.”

, Flirting can come with a lot of sexual undertones. Use them to your advantage in subtle ways like casually mentioning that you just got out of the shower, or if you’re asked what you’re wearing, state some boxers or a t-shirt.Say their names purposefully. When you know someone, you very rarely refer to them directly by their names. In a husky voice, say their first name. It will personalize the conversation and make them think about you saying their names in other places. It will make their heart race slightly.Diffuse the tension a little by laughing and joking saying, “Don’t go getting any ideas!” It’s a way to play with the sexual tension without fueling it to a point you aren’t ready for just yet.

, Have setting an official date or plans to hang out act as a natural stopping point for the conversation, that way things are left on a high note and the conversation doesn’t go on and on and on until it hits a plateau. Think back on mutual likes to figure out a good date idea for the two of you."

Get to know her in an informal setting.,
Ask a girl out on a date.,
Make a good first date impression.",How to Get a Girl to Like You when She Has No Interest in Relationships2," If you are already friends and want to take things to the next level, then ignore this step. However, if you just met or are only casual acquaintances, spend time together in a group or ask her out indirectly. This might require you to have a good opener or conversation starter. Start with a pre-opener: whenever you see her, make eye contact, smile, and say “hi”.Next, start a general conversation. Compliment her on her achievements, or ask about her interests (music, movies, books, hobbies, etc.).Use this general conversation as a starting point for developing a closer relationship based on common interests and/or shared goals.


Be patient. Some girls are naturally more open about themselves and talkative, whereas others might be more shy or hesitant at first.
Never use cheesy pick-up lines. Not only does this set a bad impression, but it can also be offensive.

, You can be upfront and ask her out directly, or use a more indirect approach such as asking what she is doing this weekend and if she has any plans.Which approach you choose depends on the situation and personalities. Other indirect examples include: asking whether she’s been to a certain restaurant, and wondering if she wants to check it out with you; or phrase it as an opportunity, such as “we are both free this weekend and the weather looks nice, so why don’t we do something together”. Remember, at this stage you are only asking her to go on a date (to a movie, concert, dinner, etc.), not if she wants to be your girlfriend.Make it clear you just want to hang out. Don't talk about relationships or ask her to be your girlfriend.
Do not corner a girl or make her feel trapped (physically) when asking her out. She might say no because she feels uncomfortable and intimidated.If she seems reluctant to go on a date with you, invite her to do something with a group of friends. Organize a picnic or go to a dinner and a movie with a couple friends.

, On your first date (or first time you hang out), your goals should be to make sure she has a good time, you express your feelings in a way that are clear but not over the top, and you do not try anything too extravagant, expensive, or romantic. Go on a group date or do something in a public place rather than inviting her to spend time with you alone.Take the lead in deciding what you will do and where you will go on the date. Do your homework – ask her if she has any food preferences, make reservations if necessary, and avoid places that are upscale and pricey.Make an effort with your appearance – wash and comb your hair, brush your teeth, do not wear too much cologne, and wear clean, unwrinkled clothes.
Do not overindulge in alcohol, be considerate, and practice good manners. These involve not dominating the conversation, turning off your phone and giving her your full attention, and be kind to others.Avoid discussing controversial topics, such as politics, old relationships, complaining about your job, or sex. Instead, focus on good topics such as the news (and her opinion on current events), family, travel (either places you’ve been or want to go in the future), or your thoughts on love and what makes a good relationship."
